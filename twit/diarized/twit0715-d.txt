He's had a number of journalistic jobs over the years, currently head of communications at  Valley Mail, which is a way, or Vale Mail, which is a way of validating outbound email,  which companies need to use. Hi Dylan. Yeah. Great to have you. Hey, how you doing?  Do you miss sometimes, you know, working at the big tech publications? Do you kind of wish, gosh,  I wish I could rip off an editorial here or something like that? You know, it is easier

Transcript:  to get people to call me back. Yeah, of course. You know, when you're a journalist, it was easier  to get people to call me back and I got invited to more parties. So I miss those two things.

Start time: 241.98
End time: 247.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's in internet years. That's like 400. Yeah, we've seen so many different types of

Start time: 247.52
End time: 250.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  phones. Screen sizes have exploded since then. It's crazy.

Start time: 250.36
End time: 296.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, let me ask you because the Galaxy Fold comes out at the end of this week.  I was thinking of running down to my T-Mobile store on Friday,  plunking down a couple of big ones, a couple of thousand dollars and purchasing one until  our friend Steve Kovac said, my phone broke after two days. Our friend Dieter Bohn said,  oh, there's a big bulge in the phone. My friend, Marques Brownlee said, it's not working any.  I think four of the early reviewers all had broken Fold units.  Joanna Stern too, I think. That's right, Joanna.  Mark Manover at Bloomberg with us. So it's five, six, seven. That's a bad sign for a new phone.

Start time: 297.60
End time: 303.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's probably a really small sample group too. So it's like, oh, what does that  rating look like with consumers? Like 100% of product reviewers.

Start time: 305.12
End time: 326.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So it turns out that Steve Kovac and Marques Brownlee, at least those two, maybe others,  removed what looked like a temporary plastic coating. I know my S10 Plus had one. It was a  screen protector, but removed it as I did on my S10. And it turns out there was a warning in the  box that said, whatever you do, do not remove this plastic film. I think they were saying there

Start time: 326.52
End time: 331.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  wasn't a warning. And then with future shipments, there was a warning.  There will be a warning. I'm unclear.

Start time: 331.68
End time: 341.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's not a good sign. People do not read warnings.  After years of pulling those useless plastic things off your new phone,  that's going to be the first thing everybody does.

Start time: 344.08
End time: 355.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It shows how quickly they rushed this out the gate, basically. They had to get all this tech  out there. They had to get a folding phone out there before all the other companies did.  And yeah, so instead of sealing that screen a little, you have a very visible layer right

Start time: 355.98
End time: 384.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  on top. It's crazy. And then Dieter Bohm at The Verge said, well,  he did not remove his film, but he did have a bulge come up out of the hinge that broke the  screen anyway. His review is entitled Broken Dream. It turns out they put a little bit of putty  underneath the phone to prop it up during a photo shoot. And I think maybe that got into the hinge.  So it is clearly a fragile beast.

Start time: 385.92
End time: 388.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I assume a lot of things are going to get into that little bulge there.

Start time: 389.96

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yours is okay editing gadget.

Start time: 392.02
End time: 413.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, we haven't had any problems yet. We're keeping an eye out for it. But it's going to be  Chris Velasco doing the review. I believe our video is up already. And Sherlyn Lowe did the hands-on.  It's really cool, but that front screen is not good. That front screen feels like a joke,  honestly. And it just seems like Samsung really, really had to rush this out there  to get their folding phone.

Start time: 413.64
End time: 431.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting. Because some of the early, and when I say early, I mean in the first day,  obviously, before the phone broke, early thoughts were that, hey, I get it. This is great.  But you do have to make a sacrifice because that front screen is only, what, four inches,  something like that.

Start time: 431.56
End time: 453.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's like 4.7, and it's really, really skinny. So it's kind of useless, honestly. You could do  some very basic lookups with it. But I was thinking about how would I use this phone on  the subway or something or in a crowded way, and really the only way to use the phone to  its full potential is to open it up, and then it's a two-handed device. Then it's a tablet.  So is that really more convenient for a lot of people? I don't know.

Start time: 453.92
End time: 469.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Sherlyn wrote, it's fun to open and shut. Maybe don't do that too much, Sherlyn.  She did say satisfying despite the crease. The crease is another word I don't like to hear on a  crease.  Crease is bad.  Smartphone.

Start time: 470.08
End time: 474.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And also the cameras up top. That is such an ugly thing to see.

Start time: 475.62
End time: 482.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, look at that screen. I see the problem right there. There's Sherlyn's picture of that screen.  Yeah, the front screen.

Start time: 482.72
End time: 490.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, Devendra, do you really think that people are going to be rushing, folding phones out? Are  we going to see a horde of these?

Start time: 491.40
End time: 497.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, we definitely saw a whole bunch, right? Didn't Huawei, they showed one off at Mobile  Huawei's will be available later this summer.

Start time: 498.40
End time: 502.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So like a whole slew of them got announced at CES.  You could, nobody, the Royale.

Start time: 503.36
End time: 504.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Nobody cares about Royale.

Start time: 504.54
End time: 508.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But nobody complained that the Royale broke after day two. Maybe nobody bought it.

Start time: 509.34
End time: 525.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We broke the Royale during the CES preview.  Oh, did you?  During the preview, that thing broke. It's a mechanical object. It's going to break more  often than a solid phone. But yeah, these things are trouble. They're all trying to rush them out  this year. And that seems like a bad, bad decision.

Start time: 526.62
End time: 537.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, you just saved me $1,980. I was thinking, well, I really ought to go out and kind of  validate the experience of all these early reviewers. We didn't get a review unit.

Start time: 539.12
End time: 544.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm sure we'd want to, Leo. I think it's a cool thing for you to buy, just to have that  experience and see what it's like.

Start time: 544.24
End time: 548.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, actually, now I think I'm going to hope it breaks right away so I can return it and get my  money back.

Start time: 549.26
End time: 559.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I do. Honestly, buy it for 30 days. This is what I used to do before I could get reviewed.  Best Buy has a great return policy. A lot of places do. Buy it, try it, and then return if  you don't like it.

Start time: 560.90
End time: 593.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can tell you the Huawei one. So I've used the Huawei one. And when I was using it, it was  the most excited I was about a phone since the first iPhone. So I could not see a crease in that  thing at all. I only got to use it for maybe 20, 25 minutes, something like that. It was one of  these behind closed doors thing. The only restriction they put on me is that I wasn't  allowed to personally fold it on camera, which is a really, really weird restriction to put on  people.

Start time: 594.20
End time: 596.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But you could fold it yourself, just not on camera.

Start time: 597.68
End time: 624.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I could fold it. I've seen the Royale, I've seen the Galaxy Fold, and none of them  look like this. When it's folded out, the display, how thin it is, it's really weird. No one's  bothered comparing it to a Kindle for very good reasons. It's about five million times as  expensive. But in terms of reading on this thing, it is properly nice. It is a beautiful,  beautiful device.

Start time: 624.96
End time: 631.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And the screen is on the outside too, which I think is much more useful than a tiny useless  display on the outside and the folding screen on the inside.

Start time: 632.54
End time: 640.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So it's a trifold. The screen is on the outside. You open it out and it's the same screen. It just  becomes larger. You see both wings.

Start time: 641.20
End time: 673.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It just becomes this really thin eight inch tablet. It's gorgeous. The main thing I wanted  to find out with that thing was, can you see creases down the center of the screen? Because  obviously on the Samsung, that's one of the things we've seen. Maybe this was a brand new straight  out of the box unit, but I was bending it. I was looking at it in different lights and you can't  really see. There is the tiniest, tiniest hint, but it was very, very exciting. So if you're going  to buy any of them, Leo, I would definitely go for that one for 30 days and then send it back.

Start time: 673.40
End time: 675.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, no, no. You misunderstand. I'm buying them all.

Start time: 676.80
End time: 699.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, well, that's perfect. But it really is. At the end of the day, anything that has moving  parts, we've tried to move away from moving parts in almost everything. It's a reason why  the iPad was so successful. One of the reasons the iPad was so successful.  It has no moving parts. It has no fan. So I kind of think it's a step backwards in one way,  but a step forward in a different one. Be interesting.

Start time: 700.82
End time: 715.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nate, I think you've convinced me that I want to wait for the Kindle version of what our phone  is so that I can read on an E Ink screen that's a comfortable size. But for a phone,  I'm not persuaded that I need that much screen or that much risk of the mirror folding.

Start time: 715.88
End time: 728.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was already. There was a Russian company that had a dual screen phone with an E Ink screen on  the back and a color one on the front. I can't remember the name of it now, but they did two or  three. They're bankrupt, as a matter of fact.

Start time: 729.48
End time: 733.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Just reading about them. Just this week, they went out of business.

Start time: 735.32
End time: 736.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was the Yotta phone. The Yotta.

Start time: 738.98
End time: 751.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think you're onto something, Dylan. I think if we could make an E Ink device that could fold out  like this, you could have something that feels like a paperback and then you fold it out. It's  the size of a magazine or something, and that could be really cool for a really niche audience.

Start time: 752.66
End time: 756.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There it is. Or a newspaper. I could just unroll it and it'd be like a newspaper.

Start time: 757.10
End time: 777.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think that's kind of where this all comes from is that sci-fi notion of you've got a thing folded  up in your pocket that you unfold. But despite the fact that we can currently roll up and unfold  OLED screens, there's lots of other issues about the electronics that are attached to it, the hinges,  the screens themselves. I don't think we're anywhere close.

Start time: 777.78
End time: 781.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's not glass on these phones because they have to use plastic because you can't fold glass.

Start time: 785.38
End time: 805.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They're too expensive. Clearly, these early versions were not intended for normal users.  They were intended for a special weird class of people for whom price is no object and having  the latest thing that's clearly different than everything else is worth that extra price.  But if it's going to break right away. You know, this reminds me of when

Start time: 806.38
End time: 850.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Windows Vista was announced and we got those weird laptops that had a little miniature screen  on the outside of the device where you could do a little bit of email checking and notifications.  There were loads of these around and everyone thought, what's the point?  Why does this exist? And obviously, it went away and we moved in a completely different direction.  I kind of get the feeling that we'll look back at these devices in a similar sort of way. Nice  experiment at the expense literally of the consumer. But maybe it helps us figure out,  okay, we don't want to go down that road. Cool. We'll go down this road. Maybe that's  what the industry needs to do. Is the tech industry a particular offender here?

Start time: 851.20
End time: 868.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think every industry, I think of the auto industry, tries stuff that doesn't pay off  too well and then moves on. But the tech industry seems particularly prone to just throwing spaghetti  on the wall and hoping something sticks. Why is that? Yeah, pretty much.

Start time: 869.78
End time: 904.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, we're addicts, right? We're innovation addicts. They know people will buy it.  They know people will buy it. But also, I think you look at the gadget hounds,  the people who are reading gadget and listen to the twit and everything. We're always chasing  the next high, right? The iPhone changed the world. So many things changed the world. What is next?  We're always searching for that. And I'm guilty of that too. I think I've reached a point where  I do like to take a step back and say, do we really need this? Should you buy this? This year,  we're also going to see a ton of 5G phones. Nobody should buy those this year. Don't forget how bad  the early LTE phones were. Just wait and see how those look down the line.

Start time: 904.36
End time: 913.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Samsung's already selling its 5G Galaxy S10. I mean, it's almost pointless because where are  you going to use it? Where are you going to use it? It's pointless. Yeah. I think there are places

Start time: 914.14
End time: 951.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you could use it. I think to vendors, Scott, you've totally put your finger on one piece,  which is the consumer side. We are totally obsessed about the latest new gadgets. There's also a  product development side, which is that everyone in tech is completely bought into this agile  development approach. More in software than in hardware, but I think it affects both sides.  And the idea of that is like, let's just ship it. Let's do two weeks worth of development,  ship it, get it out the door. And then if something is broken, we'll fix it in the next two weeks  sprint. And I think that works really effectively for some things, maybe not so much for folding

Start time: 951.36
End time: 966.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  OLED screens. For hardware, it's bad. You don't want to do that for hardware. For software,  you can just iterate, like send an update, no problem. Hardware is a problem to do that with.  I think Google's faced that issue over time too, because they're such a software focused company.  Whenever they've produced hardware, it's been kind of problematic.

Start time: 967.48
End time: 971.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And Amazon, I think, has had a lot of issues as well along the same lines. FireFone.

Start time: 971.94
End time: 1019.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we've seen it for decades. We've seen it for decades. I mean, normally companies do this kind  of stuff. They have their R&D labs, they innovate this stuff, and they patent stuff. And a lot of  the time it never comes out. They build one, they do a prototype, and they say, yeah, this isn't  going to sell. We're not going to ship this. So they check it to one side and move on. But  there's a cache that now comes with being seen as an innovator, and everyone wants to be that  innovator. Samsung desperately wants to be seen, kind of needs to be seen as that innovator. So  it's bringing these things out, and it's essentially trying these out on the public without regard for  whether they're actually going to be any successful, or whether they're going to support them in five  years' time. And that's just a change in the way I think these companies are operating. We are the  R&D guinea pigs, and it's at the cost of our wallets.

Start time: 1019.28
End time: 1022.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Soterios Johnson Yeah, and I mean, they're coming off of a line of exploding phones, right? They

Start time: 1023.14
End time: 1029.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  push things too far. They're over-exploding. I think the S10 is an amazing phone. But then Samsung

Start time: 1032.12
End time: 1042.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  stumbles, and it's, I feel bad for them. Is Apple better because they do this stuff behind closed  doors? I don't think so.  I don't think so.

Start time: 1042.28
End time: 1045.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They certainly have better quality control. There's no doubt their quality control is better.

Start time: 1045.52
End time: 1052.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Justin Perdue Yeah, but you got to wonder, do they have some magical folding phone in the lab,  or are they just not, I mean, declining?

Start time: 1052.40
End time: 1084.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Soterios Johnson Yeah, I don't know. I mean, Apple's never really done proper market research. I think  that's one of the differences. Apple comes out with something and says, you're going to need this  for this reason, and you'll create the need for it. Whereas other companies, they do their market  research, they go out, they say, okay, well, people want this, people are bored of form factors,  they're bored of six inch black slabs of glass and things. So what can we do? What can we do  that physically in a shop window or on a website makes them excited? And someone said, what if they  fold in half? And someone went, great idea, let's do that.

Start time: 1085.94
End time: 1105.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Justin Perdue Yeah, I'm sorry, Nate, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. I mean,  nobody really wanted giant phones when Samsung came out with the Galaxy Note line. But that kicked  off a huge trend. So, you know, I think they throw a lot of spaghetti against the wall, and sometimes  it sticks and sometimes it doesn't.

Start time: 1105.32
End time: 1113.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Soterios Johnson Apple does have a patent for a folding phone.  You have to think, if they've got one in the lab somewhere, that they're going,

Start time: 1115.94
End time: 1117.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  touch the bullet on that one.

Start time: 1117.92
End time: 1154.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a difference that, you know, they patent tons of stuff that never comes out, you know,  they, they patent stuff, the fact that there's an entire blog dedicated only to like, posting  Apple patents, like they post this stuff, just in case somebody else develops it, and they don't  want to lose their, you know, royalties or whatever. But, but they with the Galaxy Note, a really good  example, Dylan, because I think that was something that really did take off in, in, in the Asian  market. You know, they, that was a big deal. People really liked those huge devices, but over  here in the US and in Europe, we were like, dude, why would you want a phone that's twice the size  of other phones? And we just took a little while to catch up.

Start time: 1154.96
End time: 1188.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

So everything kind of  congealed, I guess, until one spot. But Nate, you're on to something there, like, with Apple,  their design is always very top down, right? You're going to like this, you're going to like  a MacBook Pro with no usable ports, you're going to like a keyboard with no travel, deal with it.  And I don't think quality control has been better for them. Honestly, I think they've been faltering  to look at those MacBook keyboards, but it's a very different philosophy than like Samsung or  Google or something. Nate Bysshev

Transcript:  There's a, I kind of ties into something I read this week. It was actually a blog post from a  few years ago, a speech by Claude Shannon that was never published. Claude Shannon, of course,  one of the great theorists in computer sciences, if you don't know his name,  read their Wikipedia article. But he gave this speech in 1952 at Bell Labs, was not widely  published about creative thinking. And he said, a small percentage of the population produces the  greatest proportion of the important ideas. And he talks a lot about this. It's funny,  it's just coincidental, but a lot about this idea of innovation. And one of the reasons he says it  happens, particularly in the tech sector, is because people are dissatisfied. Things could be  done better. I think there's a neater way to do things. I think it could be improved a little.  There's this continual irritation when things don't look quite right. And I think that  dissatisfaction he wrote is present in present days is a key driving force in good now he called it  scientists, but of course, it was quickly technologists. But I also think that there is  a intense pressure from the stock market and investors and the market in general to come up  with the next new thing. And even just pride, what's the next new thing? And unfortunately,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  we're the guinea pigs for that. Jeff Bezos has a phrase that he used,  which really irritates me, but I think gets to the same point that Claude Shannon made,  which is Bezos talks about divine discontent and how the customer is never satisfied for very long  with anything that you provide them. So for Bezos, he interprets that as a need for the company,  for any tech company really to continually innovate and continually be moving forward.  Because last year's totally amazing thing is something that everybody has now. And you're like,

We wondered with the exploding note, was it the note seven,  the note eight with the exploding note, if that would be a permanent mark on Samsung,  and they seem to have completely dodged that bullet. Oh, yeah. Will the failing folding phone  be the next black mark on Samsung and will it have a lasting impact?

Transcript:  People are incredibly forgiving of tech companies. I mean, look at what happened with Facebook and  the Cambridge Analytica stuff. You know, their stock plummeted. There were calls for resignations.  There was a giant, you know, a new movement in terms of privacy awareness globally. And it's,  you looked at it today, you know, a year later and its user numbers are higher than ever. Its  stock is higher than ever. It's just like, no one cares. Nobody cares.  In tech, in tech, like it's quite specific to tech. People are extremely forgiving  in the technology world. And broadly speaking, they are. It's not just the geeks, you know,  like us who will talk about this stuff. And actually the real world is very different.  It's the opposite way around. And I think, you know, people just forgive tech companies  because they just want the latest and greatest. I mean, Ford survived the exploding Pinto.

Transcript:  This is an amazing story, which recounts a lot of the stuff we already knew. I mean,  apparently Nicholas Thompson and Fred Vogelstein have been working on it for a long time. Jeff  Jarvis said he ran into, I think it was Nicholas at Davos two years early last year. And he was  writing the story then. And in fact, it starts in Davos and the special Facebook,  you know, suite or hotel room they had in Davos where they were planning a temporary headquarters  where they were planning the, it was more like a bunker. One, one that saw a succession of tense  meetings with the same tycoons, ministers and journalists who had agreed with George Soros  when he said earlier, the owners of the, well, I guess basically the Facebook's days are numbered.  The owners of the platform giants consider themselves the masters of the universe,  Soros said, but in fact, they're slaves to preserving their dominant position. I would agree.  Davos is a good place to announce that their days are numbered. That was a year ago, more than a  year ago. Let's talk, we'll talk about Facebook because there's a lot to say about Facebook.  This is a good example of a company that, as you pointed out earlier, can survive almost anything.  Black marks everywhere. We'll do that in just a little bit. But first, hey, what a great panel,  Davinder Hardware here from Engadget. He's senior editor there. Dylan Twainy, great to have you back  now at Vala Mail, many years at Venture Beat and Wired and many other places.

I'm devastated and I'm never watching this show again. Of course, the minute it comes back  and the next season I'm glued to the TV. It's just like Facebook. You can't leave it.

If you're doing Agile, you're using JIRA. We use JIRA not just for software development,  our IT team uses it to keep track of projects. Who's doing what? What stage the project's at?  One of the things I really like about Atlassian's tools, and there are a whole bunch of them,  is it's all about, well, not just getting the job done. Of course, that's key, but communication as  well. In a modern enterprise, in a cloud-based world, IT teams are at the center of everything.  And not only do they have to plan and execute, they have to do it faster than ever. They have  to do it right. They have to be open, agile. They have to coordinate between operations and  software development teams. Expectations are high, the stakes are high, and IT is smack dab in the  center. And you don't get to fail, you got to get it done. So of course, the best IT teams use  Atlassian. Not only JIRA, but we also use Confluence because it's very important when  you get something done to document what you did so that people understand that people who come  after you can say, oh, this is how it works. So we use Confluence like crazy. And the whole idea  that you can use these tools like JIRA and Confluence, Bitbucket if you've got a source  code database, and never leave, not have to use some third tool to get the job done really  encourages communication. And I think that's so important. IT tools, not just for developers,  Atlassian offers an affordable, reliable suite of tools for all kinds of teams, all sizes,  from DevOps to agile to IT apps to ops to ITSM, whatever is next. Atlassian provides a technology  backbone to help modern IT organizations plan, service, and support exactly the kind of change  that propels business. So I mentioned JIRA, Confluence, Bitbucket, but there's lots more.  There's for people who have managed ops, there's Ops Genie status page that'll help teams better  detect incidents, coordinate response efforts, resolve issues faster. And once again, this thing  that for me at least is really important, keep customers and stakeholders and the boss updated.  Communication is so important. Your team can choose the right tools for your current framework,  but trust that as you grow, as your needs change, Atlassian has something for you. They will grow  with you. And of course, everything integrates seamlessly. Your team doesn't have to bounce  from platform to platform. Like all of Atlassian's products, the tools for your IT team are easy and  free to try. Just head to Atlassian.com slash IT and find out which Atlassian offering is right for  your team. We're really proud here at Twitter to say we're in Atlassian house. You should be too.  Try Atlassian today to see what IT can be. Atlassian.com slash IT. Let's talk about,  oh, by the way, we thank Atlassian for their support. Let's talk about Facebook because  it's just an endless litany. I do absolutely recommend Fred's great article on Wired,  15 months of fresh hell inside of Facebook. Dylan, tell me, were there things that  weren't widely known in here or is it just really kind of putting it all together?

Start time: 2000.72

Yeah, there's some, I don't know, inside baseball about the movements of various executives that I  hadn't heard before or hadn't heard all spelled out. But mostly it's just weaving the whole story  and painting the picture of just how crazy and I guess I would have to say inept Facebook's  responses were over the course of 2018 to the various scandals that embroiled it.

Start time: 2032.14
End time: 2051.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Seems to me even anybody just paying the slightest attention to it would quickly come up with the  idea that Facebook would just do whatever it wanted to, get caught, apologize, say it wouldn't do it  again and then the whole cycle would repeat. Yeah, and sometimes they didn't even apologize.

Start time: 2051.74
End time: 2095.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sometimes they just spent like five days sitting there going like, what are we going to say? What's  our response? And then they'd come out and they'd solve a different problem. The problem was  with data leakage and they'd say, okay, we're going to fix this problem with untrustworthy news.  And their solution is some completely half-assed thing that shows they don't really understand  the news business and they didn't really talk to anybody in news and then it doesn't work for a  year and then they pull the plug on that. It seems very, at least the picture that Fred paints  lines up with what I've seen from other coverage, which is just that they don't really have their  arms around the problems that they're causing in any serious way. What they add though also is the

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  behind the scenes machinations going on. They talk a lot about why Systrom left, why Chris Cox left  and it confirms everything those guys said at the time, but also everything we suspected, I guess.  It's kind of like the Mueller report. It's like you knew all this, but now you're seeing it in print.

Transcript:  post during the Mueller report release. Bravo. Oh man, you're talking about the Instagram password  debacle. So first, Facebook says, first, it stored thousands of Instagram passwords unencrypted on  its servers. By the way, this is a week after we found out that Facebook passwords were also stored  unencrypted on their servers. Then timed perfectly on the same morning that the Mueller report came  out, Facebook said, oh, it's not thousands, it's millions of Instagram user passwords.

Start time: 2159.60
End time: 2168.44

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What? Now I have to say, it's not the worst news in the world. It wasn't publicly  published. It was internal, but it meant that anybody who worked, not anybody, but many thousands  of people who worked at Facebook had access to these passwords. Facebook said, as far as we can  tell, nobody used them in any malicious way, but they could. They could. Probably not the best sign

I think it could be a function of them just being  too big too. Like, who knows what all these contractors and other people who have access  to this data are doing. Maybe they're too big to even manage everybody effectively.

Start time: 2218.42
End time: 2283.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's a good point. My sense is that for years, nothing mattered at Facebook other than  growing user numbers and growing engagement. They would basically do anything to increase  engagement and get people spending more time on the site. I think the result is, it may be that  Zuck and Cheryl and other people at the top are actually honestly wanting to control things now,  but there's so much momentum and so much culture behind this at Facebook now.  Everything has been designed to facilitate engagement without any kind of brakes on that  or any kind of controls or any kind of meaningful vetting built in from the start. What they're  trying to do now is slow down the runaway train or install a brake system on the train or safety  controls on the train while it's already going 180 miles an hour down the track. To me, it feels  very consistent with the way Facebook has been run for years, that they just don't care about  anything except growth. It's going to take a long time for them to change that, even if they really

Are they, is it, as you said, kind of innocent, Dylan,  and it's just that it's too hard when you're this big and moving this fast to get it right every time?  Oh, I didn't say innocent. Well, that's one possibility, that they're not malicious.  And then the completely other end of the scale is that they are Machiavellianly malicious actors  who are just covering up as fast as they can. If you have some monopoly fat cat billionaire saying,

There might be some things you'd want  to be concerned about besides making money. I think you could fairly call that malicious or  at least amoral. How about amoral? Not immoral, but amoral.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  might not even be doable. I don't think we can trust these companies at this point. They've  proven time and time again that they don't know how to basically rule themselves. And I've said  for a long time that it seems like the way we've kind of controlled or at least stopped  bad actors in the past is through some sort of government regulation. We did that with Modbell.  It's happened before and that helped prevent monopolies. But yeah, it's a big thing.

He's the guy that chairs these committee meetings where they've done some very deliberately  P.R.E. stunts. For example, when they demanded Zuckerberg appeared and he wouldn't, what they  did is they put a seat out for him. They put in Zuckerberg nameplate and then they published the  photo that basically just looked like he was absent, that he just hadn't shown up.  Of course, everyone used the picture. They do try. The thing that they're trying at the moment to do  is to prevent companies like Snapchat from having these streaks features because they're very  concerned that technology is addictive in such a way that long term it'll be extremely detrimental  for children. So they don't want Snapchat having streaks. They don't want Facebook having  the like button. And that's where a lot of their attention is right now.

Transcript:  approach, but I don't know.  We owe Parliament a little debt of gratitude because last year Parliament was investigating  Facebook and obtained a, with kind of a scary means, obtained a trove of documents,  documents that had been given in the discovery in another lawsuit by an application called  Pikinis that was designed to show up bikini pictures of friends and friends of friends  on Facebook. And Facebook shut down Pikinis access to the friends of friends information,  everybody else's as well. And so they sued. And in the suit, there was a, of course, discovery,  4,000 page trove of documents, including emails, internal company documents. Then the head of  Pikinis was staying in a hotel in England and got tricked into handing, he says tricked into  handing them over to Parliament. And now they've been leaked and NBC News had a big story. And I  don't know about their interpretation. It's hard to tell because they don't quote these documents  directly. They mostly just publish their interpretation of it. The headline, Mark  Zuckerberg leveraged Facebook user data to fight rivals and help friends leaked documents show  Facebook's responses. Well, those documents are cherry picked for a lawsuit in a different matter.  Nevertheless, at least some of the quotes are pretty shocking. Facebook, for instance, according  to NBC, decided to give plenty of data about users to Amazon because Amazon had decided to  use Facebook to market its Fire Phone. But then when there was a messaging app that Facebook thought  it was competitive, they cut off access to data, user data to the messaging application.  There's, I don't, I don't, did you guys read this stuff? And, and, and do you think that NBC's

Transcript:  interpretation is fair? Yeah, I mean, I think a lot of thought goes into this. And I know that  Olivia Solon, who's one of the two reporters in the byline, you know, she's very thorough. I've  worked, I worked with her for many years. She's a good friend of mine. And I do sort of trust that,  you know, when, when she comes out with something like this, you know, she's gone through this with  a tooth comb. So I do think that the, the interpretation is pretty good. And you are  talking about 4,000 pages of documents, you know, I saw when they previously released,  I say they, it was parliament. Yeah, 400 pages released initially. Yeah. Yeah. And they were,  and they, and they published a lot of those with redactions. And I had a copy of a lot of those and  was going through it. And on the one hand, you can see why Facebook would argue that things have been  cherry picked because clearly they, they have, you know, you have to pick certain documents out in  certain sentences out. But at the same time, there are still email chains within these documents  where you can see who said what and who replied to whom. And then what was said then, and like,  you can't make that up. Like they're not, they're not publishing one email and then redacting for,  and then another one. Like you can see that conversation take place. And a lot of those  conversations had said Sheryl Sandberg as a sender, some of them had Zuckerberg as a sender.  And it's pretty clear. And, and, you know, the killer example for me, and the one that I used  as an example in my story for Bloomberg back when this came out was about cutting off data to Vine  because, because Twitter saw Vine as this big competitor. And they, and they didn't want Vine  essentially being able to piggyback off Facebook's data and Facebook's user base in order to grow  what they saw as a rival service. And it's well worth looking at because you could, even if you  are taking it out of context, like the words in the email are right there, you know, and Zuckerberg

Transcript:  knew what was going on for those things. And maybe even more damning than that, Olivia writes  that often, she writes, however, among the documents, like there's very little evidence  that privacy was a major concern of Facebook and the issue was rarely discussed in the thousands of  pages of emails and meeting summaries. But where it is mentioned, it's often in the context of how  Facebook can use it as a public relations strategy to soften the blow of sweeping changes to  developers access to user data that when they did think about privacy, they thought about it only as  a way to market Facebook to the public. We saw it the other way around as well with the, with the,

Transcript:  there was in the previous batch that it was included in these 4,000 pages, there was, there was  discussion around an update to the Android app, you know, Facebook on Android, and there was  discussion in those emails about, you know, that a PR strategy was prepared in advance because they  knew that they were essentially slipping this out into, into the public and they needed to have a  response ready just in case it kind of blew up. So they're aware of these things, you know, they've  got their PR strategy in case it goes wrong and they, and they're essentially weighing everything  up risk versus reward when it comes to testing these things. Yeah, you're absolutely right.

Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, that's a really good talk. And then there's the New York Times article. It's not just  Facebook. There's a New York Times article about apps. It was a study of 36 apps. In the study,  they downloaded apps that specifically were, had keywords with depression and smoking cessation.  Some of these apps were designed to kind of support people who were going through emotional  difficulty. Some of them designed for people who were trying to quit smoking. Of the 36  apps downloaded, 33 of them sent private mental health information out to third parties,  including in some cases, food diaries, health diaries, self-reports about substance abuse  associated with usernames. This was published Friday in the Journal of American Medical  Association Network Open. So these apps, and we've seen this again, this isn't the first time,  the Wall Street Journal also reported that Flow, the menstrual app, was telling  third parties when women were on their periods. Not just third parties, but their employers.

Transcript:  Oh, great. Their bosses. Oh, great. Yes. Okay. That also explains the rise of all the pregnancy  tracking apps and everything too. There is a big business in collecting this data and selling it,  and really not telling people what's happening. I feel like consumers have to be more aware of the  fact that they can't really trust all these random apps that they're playing with, even if they look  nice and slick on their iPhones or something. Half the apps did not disclose third-party data

Transcript:  sharing. Nine apps had no privacy policy at all. Okay, well, don't download those. Five apps did,  but lied. They didn't say the data would be shared this way. Three apps actively said this  kind of data sharing would not happen. Those last three, according to The Verge, stood out to  Stephen Chan, a physician at the Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System, who says they're  basically lying. They're lying. They're saying, oh no, we don't disclose this. A lot of times they say  it in kind of anodyne language like under the third party sharing, we share with third parties  to make our app work better. In other words, so we get paid more so we can continue to make this  app better or whatever. It's not just Facebook, I guess, is the point. That particular thing has

Transcript:  been happening for quite a long time. I remember reporting on PayPal's user agreement, which is  like it's 50,000 words long or was at one point. It's longer than some novels.  The fact is you can defend in court. You can say, well, look, we had this here in this document that  you agreed to. The fact is that that's technically okay, even though the document is 50,000 words  long and written in complex legalese that no real person can understand. There's a need for a change  there. That's going down the route of GDPR, which I think everyone's kind of bored with at this point.  These terms and conditions are very, very problematic, I think.

Start time: 3089.86
End time: 3120.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's boring, I guess, in our circles, but in GDPR we're asking what do we need? How do we stop  these companies? Really, that's it. It's not perfect, but it's a start towards really focusing  on privacy and data and what it means to users, promoting easily understandable user agreements,  and really making sure people are aware of what these companies are doing. We definitely need  something like that in America. We're kind of getting some side benefit to it because now  everybody has to update for that. Now it's not just personal privacy. Now it's a little bit more of a

It's much more subtle than that.  But as we learned from the Mueller report, the Russians were organizing rallies in the United  States that appeared to be patriotic Americans and in fact were Russian actors. Using even  Craigslist for that. It's insane. Yeah, and so I wonder, I don't know, I talk to people,  non-tech people with different political views than mine. Obviously I'm a raging liberal and  they don't seem to be too convinced by any of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, they're not worried. I've definitely talked to people who aren't so concerned by it and maybe  slightly more on the libertarian side of things. Often they just tell me, oh, it's sour grapes.  You lost. Oh, boo hoo. In some way they're probably benefiting from all these broken rules and from  companies basically doing whatever they want with our data. So yeah, as long as it's helping them,  they're not going to argue against it. Is it not the case that at least one thing

Start time: 3215.76
End time: 3231.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  you could say from the Mueller report is it's very clear how much Russian involvement there was,  how active it was, how aggressive it was about throwing the election to Donald Trump.  I mean, not that he, I'm not even saying he wouldn't have won otherwise, but it was very clear

Start time: 3231.88
End time: 3243.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  they were working hard. Yeah, that much is clear and I think as much as we could tell from the  report, the Trump administration was aware. The only thing they couldn't prove is that they were  working together, which seems like, okay, all right, sure.

Yeah, you had lovely people like Nigel Farage. Yes, he's a lovely gentleman. I respect him dearly.  We had, for example, the one that everyone gets is we had this giant red bus, this double-decker  bus that said, you know, we should be sending the 350 million pounds a week that we're sending to  Brussels to Europe. We should be sending that to our National Health Service. And everyone knew at  the time that that was a ridiculous claim to make. It was a lie. It was a lie. It was not true,  you know, and it doesn't account for what you get in return for money that is sent over.  So anyway, that's the thing that people are really angry about. And I think that overshadows the  accusations of Russian meddling, at least in the sort of broadest senses. Yeah. And there's no

It's kind of hard to say, well, this one thing is bad and Facebook is bad and the  Russians are bad, but it's kind of like all of the things we have to be worried about.

We would prefer that Russia not weigh in on our process  and it is manifestly illegal for them to do so. So why don't we try to prevent that from happening  in 2020? That seems like a nonpartisan point of view. I want to know what side they're going to  be on before I decide. Well, maybe the rush is this time because they didn't, you know,  Donald didn't work out as well as they thought. Maybe they'll say, I don't know, you know, that

I mean,  I try not to get political in this show because we have viewers of every political affiliation and I  don't want to smudge anybody for what they think and how they voted. It's not that.

We'll continue on  with more tech news. We'll talk about Qualcomm Apple. That's a big story that broke. And then  Intel kind of weighed in at the end. That was kind of funny. Amazon and Google seem to be patching  things up or are they? And well, there's a lot more to get to. But first, a word from our sponsor,  my good friends, David Friend, who is the CEO and founder of Carbonite and his buddy, Jeff Flowers,  their technology guy. When they founded Carbonite, they came up with a really brilliant process,  a unique process. They actually patented it to lay data on disks, not sector by sector as is done  traditionally with all your disks, but sequentially. It turns out this was so much more efficient that  they were able to create storage. And this was for Carbonite that was cheaper and faster. Then they  had a brilliant idea. They said, we should start a new company, a cloud storage company that takes  advantage of this stuff. And Wasabi was born. Good name too. Wasabi is hot cloud storage,  data storage, moving to the cloud. Of course, the topic everybody is interested in. The ability to  store efficiently and affordably data in the cloud is critical for businesses. Companies who want to  put data in the cloud have many concerns. Among them, how secure will it be? How safe? How fast?  How affordable? Wasabi has an answer that you're really going to like. Now I know it's a new name  to you and people think Google, Amazon, Microsoft, but I want you to add a fourth name, Wasabi.  Because Wasabi storage is 100% S3 compatible, but 600% faster and 80% less than S3. One of the  reasons it's more affordable, no egress charges, none at all. So you can plan because you don't  have to pay to get your data back. No charges for API requests. And Wasabi has something that is  super cool. They call it immutable data. This is an answer to companies that have data in the cloud  that gets corrupted or damaged or destroyed by ransomware or just goofball employees.  You can designate data immutable. You could say this data cannot be changed  and it'll be safe up there in the cloud on Wasabi. Wasabi is secure, in most cases more secure even  than your local storage. It's HIPAA compliant, FINRA compliant, CJIS compliant. It's more affordable.  It's more efficient. In fact, they have this Wasabi ball, which I love. Basically, it's a hard drive  they send you. You can put petabytes of data on it, migrate it right up to Wasabi, just send it back  to them. And with just one tier of service and free unlimited egress, your planning and budgeting  gets a lot easier. So here's what you got to do. Add the name Wasabi to your list. Show the boss,  talk about the benefits. And I think the boss is going to do the smart thing. They're going to say,  hey, you know, this Wasabi is pretty good. We should try it out. Good news. You can right now.  If you go to wasabi.com, click the free trial link. If you use Twit as the offer code, you'll get  unlimited storage at wasabi.com for a month. So you can really bang on it. You can upload a ton  of stuff and I think you'll see it's the best. Wasabi.com. If it's time to move to the cloud,  do it right. Thank you, Wasabi, for your support. I appreciate it. And when you use that offer code  Twit, you're supporting us. So we appreciate when you do that. Ransomware. What was I just saw?  Mondales, the food company, the candy bar company, ransomware hit them. A hundred million dollars  lost. They couldn't, they couldn't move inventory for three weeks. I'm writing a piece of Business

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  insurers as an act of war. Yeah. So it's not insurable. Because the Russians originated that  ransomware. That means it's an act of war, right? Well, it often, I mean, I think it's not in most  cases, right? It's just some hacker in Bulgaria who wants to make some money. But often, you know,  nation state hacking, there's a lot of it. Maybe it is. The Weather Channel,  down for 90 minutes. Turns out that was also ransomware. But the difference, the big difference  is they had backups. And maybe they're not quite as big an operation. So it took IT about 90 minutes  to get their systems back up. Actually, that's really fast work, if you think about it.

End time: 3980.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  because I think, Nate, I'm looking forward to your story, because I think that what insurance  covers and does not cover is going to be increasingly important for big companies. And  the insurance companies are in a very powerful position to be able to say, oh, you need to do  XYZ in your setup in order to be sufficiently protected that we will cover you in the event  that you do get hacked. So, I mean, it's an area that I don't know a whole lot about yet. And yet,  I think it's becoming increasingly important. So, looking forward to it.

Now I want to say Illinois, I think it might be, but anyway,  you know, these documents basically said, look, it says act of war, but what is an act of war,  you know, historically, and this has been traditional ballistics, you know, is basically,  if it's not nukes and warheads, then it's not an act of war. And NATO, there was a guy from NATO  that said that, that a ransomware attack could be used to trigger one of the articles in the NATO,  you know, documents that basically says, this is something that we would rally behind to protect  one of the member states of NATO, i.e. it's an act of war, i.e. ransomware would be considered an  acts of war. So it's, it's really, it's, it's very, very messy. It's very interesting. And it's taken  quite a lot of reading to get my head around it too. But yeah, it's,

Transcript:  Marcus Hutchins has pled guilty. This was a story, just a fascinating story. Marcus  was arrested after he attended DEFCON. Was it a, is it a, it was last year, right? It was more than  a year ago. And he was well known at the time because he was the guy who stopped WannaCry  by figuring out what the server WannaCry phoned home to a server. And he stopped it by registering  the domain name and taking that, that phone home server out of business. But it turns out he had a  long history of writing malware, whether for, for fun of profits, unclear. It almost seems like  they were exercises, including the Kronos malware, which has been used to steal banking information.  It was a plea agreement. I wouldn't necessarily assume that Marcus is saying, yeah, I'm a bad guy.  I did it. I think more likely the fed said, you're going to go to jail for a really long time  if you don't accept responsibility. Although he pled guilty to two, two of 10 counts,  the other eight were dropped, but each of those two counts carries up to five years in prison.  So you could still see, see some serious prison time. Usually though, in an agreement like that,  the implication is, well, by admitting that you did it and taking responsibility and apologizing,

Uh, if, if, you know, charges are levied,  but there is a lot to be said for hiring smart people, um, maybe putting aside what they have  done. I mean, obviously there's laundry list of things you would never put aside, but you know,  when it comes to things like computer hacking and fraud and stuff like that, like, do you want  someone behind bars and buying them from computers? Or do you want to say, look, your parents is,  you've got to go and work for, you know, insert company here and you're going to help figure out,  you know, how to stop this kind of thing happening. Um, yeah. And there's a lot of evidence that he

And then as he got more mature,  he turned, he turned from black hat or maybe not even black hat, but gray hat to white hat hacking.  And he's done a lot of good as a malware researcher. Um, he wrote, uh, as you may on his blog,  MalwareTech.com, as you may be aware, I've pled guilty to two charges related to writing malware  in the years prior to my career in security. I regret these actions and accept full responsibility  for my mistakes. Having grown up, I've since been using the same skills I misused several years ago  for constructive purposes. I will continue to devote my time to keeping people safe from malware  attacks. This is the beginning of what he will, what he and his attorneys will say in court, of  course, trying to convince a judge that, you know, I'm being exactly as you say, Nate, I'd be more

He was arrested at the airport as he was leaving the United States.  There was some, you know, in 2017, there was some real concern among security researchers that it  was going to be risky to come to the United States because you might be arrested on your way in or  your way out.

Transcript:  there's no evidence he used Kronos himself to any ill effect. But he did release it, perhaps he sold  it in which case, yeah, he deserves the punishment. Anyway, that's an update. We've been covering that  since it happened in 2017. Wow, it's been a long time. Apple and Qualcomm have buried the hatchet.  Kind of a shock. This came out. What a world wind of news. I know. I know. I mean, Monday, the trial  began. Multi billion dollar trial. This has been an ongoing battle. Apple owed Qualcomm billions.  Qualcomm was withholding technology. They actually impaneled a jury. They had our opening arguments.  And then the very next day, it's over. We, of course, we don't know what the settlement was,  although apparently Apple gave Qualcomm some amount of money. We don't know how much. And Qualcomm,  in its part, has reached a six year license agreement with Apple. They're going to buy their  chips for six years with an option of two years to extend. Now, I have lots of theories about why  this happened. One of them is fueled by the fact that almost immediately after Intel said, oh,  thank God we don't have to make 5G phones. We're out of the business. Oh, what a relief. Apple was  turning to you. Apple was using Intel modems, you know, this year and was slowly phasing out  Qualcomm chips, partly because Qualcomm wouldn't give them the chips. Apple's contention in public  was, oh, those are crappy chips anyway. Although one of the things Apple admitted to doing and  that Qualcomm sued them for is slowing down Qualcomm radios on some iPhones so they wouldn't be any  faster than the Intel radios on the other iPhones. They got to make it fair. Oh, man.

Start time: 4555.16

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So this is great news for Apple and Qualcomm, I guess, because it means, you know,  the road to the 5G iPhone, be it next year or 2021, is kind of set. But this is another big  loss for Intel. I feel like we're not talking about that enough, too, because a couple of years ago,  they felt really burned by missing out on mobile CPUs and all of that. And I had talked to some  Intel executives and they were making a big play for modems and they made it. They got it into the  iPhones. I don't know what this means for Intel's mobile chip business in general. You can't even do

Start time: 4585.68

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  modems anymore. Yeah, I mean, it's bad for Intel. I mean, I think the other reason Apple said,  let's not continue this is discovery is always painful and Apple's learned this in their long  battle with Samsung. And a lot of times things that Apple would like to keep secret, that any  company would like to keep secret leak out in discovery, including that email from Apple saying,  oh, these Qualcomm modems, they're the best. Even though Apple publicly is saying, oh, they're

Transcript:  stand and have him be a witness. Yeah. In fact, Qualcomm's stock price went up almost 20%.  Apple's went up a little bit, mostly because Qualcomm was under a lot of, the weight of this  was a big depressant to its stock price. But now that it's resolved, Qualcomm can go ahead  and sell chips to Apple. Apple, I'm sure, has thousands of engineers as we speak, working  long hours, even on Easter, trying to come up with a 5G modem for an iPhone. But that's not  going to be, they don't have to worry for six years anyway. I'm also a little bummed about this

Start time: 4655.12
End time: 4666.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I have a question. Which came first? Was it Intel saying it was going to pull out or was it  the Apple Qualcomm settlement? The settlement happened and then within hours, Intel said,  we're out. But the lawyers talk behind the scenes before either those two things happened. So I'm  just curious, behind the scenes, was that the order that things took place or did something happen?

Start time: 4691.04
End time: 4704.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So maybe, you're right, maybe Intel went to Apple and said, dudes, this 5G modem thing is not working.  We're not going to have it for you or we can't do it. That, I'm sure, no, I think it's exactly

He's now over at Intel,  creating a discrete graphics thing. They say their integrated graphics are going to be better.  We're waiting to hear about more details about their ninth generation mobile chips.  They're making a lot of progress, but I do feel like outside of this core PC, laptop, desktop market,  Intel doesn't have that much going on. So it is kind of funny to see them run away from modem so

I don't  know if that's a big deal for Intel. It's embarrassing. Well, I think, well, Apple's also racing to give us

Transcript:  So I'm going to tell you something that is really shocking to me to realize, right?  So when the most recent MacBook generations, the sort of late 2018 ones released, I went out and I  bought one 15 inch top spec. And then in November, I think it was the new iPad Pro was announced.  I went out and I bought one of those, the 11 inch. And I realized a few weeks ago that I've  basically not used that MacBook Pro since the iPad, since I got the iPad Pro. And I'm now  selling the MacBook Pro because I don't need it. I don't need it. You know,

Transcript:  I do. Yeah. I write my articles on it. I, so my podcast that I do outside of Bloomberg, I edit now  on the iPad. I upload it from the iPad. I do the show notes on the iPad. You know,  I've done video editing when I went to mobile world Congress at the end of, in February,  or was it beginning of March, earlier this year, it was the first time in 13 years of covering tech  conferences that I didn't take a laptop. It's not that I took one and left it in the hotel. I didn't  even take one with me because I did everything on that iPad, video editing, photo editing,  you know, all my writing, all my uploads, absolutely everything I did on the iPad Pro.  And the only thing now for me holding it back is the fact that you, you, there is no real file  system. So you can't plug in a USB drive and pull files off it. You know, you have to go around that.  But apart from that, it really has got to the point where I don't need my MacBook Pro anymore.  And I'm selling it.

You know,  it works fantastically well. It's, it's really quite amazing. So yeah, I think the power in  that thing is, is, is excellent. You know, it's got a lot more efficient as well. The fact you can  have two apps running side by side, you can have a third app overlaid over the top of that. You can  have video if you need running picture and picture, and you can still have stuff running in the  background. Like the, the, the power in that thing is really quite amazing. So I think, I mean,  iOS generally needs an overhaul if it's going to compete more broadly, I think with, with desktops,  but it's, it's definitely got to a point where, yeah, I don't, I don't need that MacBook Pro.  I need my desktop. Definitely. I still need my desktop for my main work. But when it comes to-

Start time: 4968.98

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'd love to say that. I bought an i9 MacBook Pro as well and gave it to my son. I don't use it,  but that was more because I couldn't bear the keyboard. But I often feel like when I'm  using iOS, I'm struggling harder than I should. Like I can get it to do stuff, but it's like,  it's harder to do stuff. You don't feel that way?

Start time: 5003.02
End time: 5055.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I really don't. I mean, the one thing that I use as well is I have a remote desktop app  that I use. So on the very rare occasion that I need to, I can remote into a desktop, but it's,  it's so, so, so rare. And a lot of the time it is only because I need something that's like specific  to work or to Bloomberg or something like that. And that's it. But it's so close. It is so close.  And I mean, the fact that I can, for me, it's the podcasting side of things, right? It's the fact  that I can record all that stuff on there. I can do my multi-track editing on there, all the effects,  same with video. And I can do it all on the iPad is just amazing. Like if you listen to the show,  you wouldn't be able to tell whether one was edited in Logic and one was edited on  ferrite, which is what I use on the iPad. It's really, it's really quite the same.

Transcript:  You said there's no real file system though. So my interpretation of that, and tell me if this is  right, is that if you were working with other people who had, you know, you were sending a  lot of files around or collaborating on PowerPoints or Word documents instead of  cloud-based stuff, that might be a problem, right?

Start time: 5074.48
End time: 5093.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you can still do that. And what I mean with file system is, you know, on a Mac or on a PC,  if you've got files on a hard drive, you just plug it in by USB and copy stuff over. You can't  plug a hard drive into an iPad and just copy files. You've got, if you download it from the web or you  have some FTP app or whatever, you can still get those files onto it. It's no problem.

Start time: 5095.20
End time: 5124.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You have to do it from an application. So it requires that the application could see those  files and can open them. But if they can, then you can use Dropbox. So your PowerPoint example,  you could Dropbox a PowerPoint and somebody else could open it. But you can only do it from  PowerPoint. There's no independent way to do it. You have to do it from within the app. And that's  a security and convenience, a dumbing down of the app. I always feel like when I'm using the iPad,  I always feel like, I don't know, like a raptor, like my elbows. It's not fully constraining,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to fly. Yeah. But you know, there's something so liberating. I'm really, really  big up and every year I get more so on the sort of the mental health impacts of technology.  And one of the things I think I really like about the iPad specifically is that it's not trying to  be a desktop where I've got a million windows open. I've got three displays. Everything's blinking  at me. Like there's that ability to slightly control better what is in front of me. It's the  same argument for why people like a Kindle for reading instead of an iPad. They don't want  notifications popping up that can just focus on a book. And I think that that's similar is true  when it comes to the iPad. And I've just got a better ability to control what's shouting at me  from a screen, which then helps me be more productive, less stressed and things like that.

And it's just a mismatch and Apple could totally  fix that. But I think they're reluctant to go too far because A, they want to keep it simple.  Probably that's their most important rationale and B, they're not quite ready to kill Macintosh.

Transcript:  I don't think they want to kill Mac OS. This is the thing. Like I remember there was a great quote  that Steve Jobs gave probably was about the iPad, which is, you know, no one takes a truck to the  shop. And there's a need for trucks and there's a need for little nimble, you know, single seater,  self-driving electric vehicles that just takes you to the store and back. And I kind of think that  there's still a need for that. Definitely. Like I, I wouldn't, I'm not going to give up my desktop  right now and I can't see why I would get rid of my desktop. I've got a 34 inch ultra wide monitor  that you can't see hooked up on the left. I've got this big IMAX sitting in front of me on the right.  Like I need that for, you know, many types of work application, but I don't need it all the time.  And a lot of the time I just need, I need everything that's just in front of me. I can take  it wherever I go. And that's where the iPad is. And it's really getting there. It's not for everyone,  but it's definitely got to that point for me. Okay.

No,  we're much more modern than that. We buy and print all our postage right here from our desks  with our computers. No, I'm not talking about postage meter. That's even worse. No, no. We use  stamps.com. See, I can buy postage. I could print postage. In fact, when the rates went up, man,  it was awesome. We were ready. We had stamps. We print them on demand. You could print right  on an envelope. Stamps.com will automatically fill in the return address. We'll automatically  take the addresses of the people you're mailing to from your contact list. Or if you're an Etsy  buyer, a seller rather, an eBay, Amazon seller, it'll take it right off the website. Saves you  a lot of time. Fill out all the forms you need for international mail, for certified mail. So  you spend less time. You get it in it. By the way, it looks so much more professional. When you print  on an envelope, you get your company logo, your return address. It's so gorgeous. Even that little  barcode that the post office likes for fast routing to make sure your mail really gets to where it's  going. Plus, you get discounts you can't get at the post office. So when the price went up,  when we were printing out new stamps, we got five cents off every first class stamp and up to 40%  off priority mail because we use stamps.com. I mean, that's awesome. Not to mention it's a fraction  of the cost of a post-determiner. Stamps.com is a no-brainer. It'll save you time. It'll save  you money. It makes you look more professional. Over 700,000 small businesses already use stamps.com.  That's what we use. We love it so much. I'm going to show you how you can get a USB scale so you'll  always have exactly the right postage.

Let's do some more Apple news. Oh, yeah. We were talking about Texture.  I can't believe I am going to quote the New York Post here.  But they have a media column. It is pretty good, Keith Kelly. Apple to shutter Texture for News App.  Leave Android users out of luck. May 28th, if you have been subscribing to Texture, and I know a  lot of you do because they were an advertiser for a long time, Apple is going to shut down those  240,000 subscribers. If you are on iOS, you can just move to News Plus, which is pretty much  exactly what Texture was. Or if you are on Android, there are other choices I think but I don't think

Transcript:  they have the same number of magazines. Texture was the best. So many companies have tried  this whole subscription magazine thing and there is a reason Apple bought Texture. There is a reason  they built a whole service around it. It really was the best. Do you like Apple News Plus?  It is fine. I signed up for the free trial and actually as we were doing this conversation,  I had to remind myself to go cancel it because it is fine. It is perfectly fine but I don't really  need it. It is nice to have these magazine articles once in a while. I only really read  magazines because I like the feel and I want to sit down with that long-form stuff. It is on the  web. If a magazine article is on the web, I will read it there. I don't need this whole other app

Start time: 5706.18
End time: 5729.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  to deal with that. I feel the same way. The magazines that I really do want to support,  note support as opposed to read, like the New Yorker and the Atlantic, I will use their apps  and subscribe. Does anybody actually read the New Yorker? The New Yorker app is great. I don't read  it but boy is it great. You can go right to the cartoon. You like to say you subscribe and that

Especially in our  business, I feel like there is an article by Ken Aleta or somebody like that that I have to read  at least once a month. They are long so there is a long-form article I want to read in the New Yorker.  Atlantic is the same thing. I feel like there is, especially for politics coverage, Atlantic and  the New Yorker, I have to have those. Then I pay for the New York Times which is not on News Plus  and I pay for the Wall Street Journal which is, you know who the big beneficiary of News Plus is  in my opinion is the Los Angeles Times. That is one of the things you get with a News Plus  subscription and it is a real chance for them to get a national profile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So two things that stand out here. The first is that I see absolutely no reason why Apple  won't release News Plus for Android. If you look at everything that it is doing recently,  it is all about services. Apple needs services for its future. They have announced Apple TV  that is going to be on Samsung televisions. They have got Apple Music on Android. They are going to  have News Plus on Android because why would you shut out hundreds of millions of potential  subscribers to your services product? So it is going to happen. There is no doubt in my mind  that it is going to happen. Then the second thing is more of a rant which is that one of the main  reasons why I like using Apple News as an app is because I have never hated browsing the web  more than I do today. It has got to the point. I swear to you that the ads on websites are  the least annoying thing on a website, particularly in Europe. This is more so than in the US  because in Europe you have the cookies pop up that is asking you. No, we get that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They wanted to avoid further antitrust fines. The EU had basically said, look, you cannot use  Android to strong arm people into using Chrome and into using Google search. Google agreed that  it would make some changes to make it less apparent that it was strong arming people into  using Chrome and Android. One of the ways they have done that is to textbook follow what Microsoft  did with Internet Explorer. When you fire up the Play Store, this is all after a software update,  you fire up the Play Store and you are asked, do you want to change your search engine from Google  to something else? Do you want to install another browser? There are some key differences that I  think need to be worked out. I do not think it is saying do you want to install this, remove  Chrome and set the new one as your default. It is like, look, there are some other browsers available,  maybe you want to install them and that is fine. That is what they are doing and it is very similar  to what Microsoft did. That was 10 years ago, 2009.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The difference now that is so fascinating is that at the time, the legislation had come too late.  IE was already falling down because I think Firefox had overtaken it in Europe at the time  that that settlement was reached. Whereas at the moment, worldwide figures, Chrome,  specifically on Android, has close to 90% of the market. IE did not have 90% of the market  at the time that they settled with the EU. A lot of people said, well, the browser choice screen  for Windows did not really affect IE because it was doomed anyway. On this occasion, I am going  to be very interested to see how it pans out because I do not know why you would switch from  Chrome to something else or why you would switch from Google to Bing. I know that one a bit better.  I do not know why you would leave Chrome. But whether it will make a difference, I do not know.  I think it will be more interesting to see this versus the Windows equivalent.

Start time: 6095.00
End time: 6113.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It is really interesting to see how these things have turned around too. On Windows 10,  now Edge is your default. It is pre-installed. If you go to download Chrome, at least in the US,  it is like, are you sure you want to do that? Edge is pretty great. You do not want this other  browser on your system. But I guess that is okay, legally at this point.

Transcript:  Switching my search engine is one of the first things I always do on a new phone. But  I do not feel the need to switch to a different browser than Chrome, that is for sure.

Start time: 6125.26
End time: 6164.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Chrome, at the time that it came out, there were some really great reasons to use  Chrome. Actually, more so even with Firefox. When Firefox came out, no one was used to this  concept of add-ons and tabbed browsing and things like that. When that came out, there was this  sudden crazy excitement that there was a different way to browse the web and a different  way to do things online. That was great. Then Firefox got very sluggish and slow,  and Chrome came along and it was just slick and fast. Everything was tied into Google.  Again, that really helped pick up the pace and gave people excited about browsers again.  But on Chrome, on Android, I do not know what you would want to add or change.

Start time: 6165.20
End time: 6203.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, on iOS, you have to use Safari as the default browser, period.  On Android, you can take off Chrome. You can put anything you want on it, if you care.  I would submit that most users, maybe not Chrome, but most users want the Google apps.  This has nothing to do with the fact that Android is laden with Google apps.  This seems a lot like the Windows browser ballot issue all over again.  I think you get a point of fatigue at some point where users just go,  why are they screwing with us? I just want to use my phone, please.

And yet it's a shame  because the open web is the best alternative to these silos, these walled gardens, these gated  communities, or things like the News Plus app. I don't think it's a good thing for content to be  aggregated, to be disaggregated, really, from their original source and stuck in an app is not good

Start time: 6267.78
End time: 6317.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  for anybody. Well, I think it's quite clear, too, why there's so much, why the web  experience is so crummy these days and why there are so many pop-ups like that saying,  can we alert you or subscribe to our newsletter, those newsletter pop-ups that show up some random  number of seconds after you've started getting into reading the thing, just when you're really  engaged. But the reason that that's happening is that these on publisher, news sites and magazines  and publishers of any kind, they're just desperate to make money any way they can because so much of  the value has been sucked out of the advertising ecosystem by the bigger players, by Google and  the Facebook. So they have to do this. They have to throw a bunch of pop-ups at you because  they need to wring out any money that they can from the system. And that's all that's left.

As long as people  want it to be great, then new things will come along. I think you look at the success of something  like Twitter or the blogger was a guy who did it before. It was successful because of what he  didn't have. That was the reason that Twitter was so good because it didn't have the mess of  crap that Facebook's gotten. People are like, yeah, this is great. It's super simple. It's  what you leave out that becomes what's good about that product. And I think the same will happen  for the web in some form. It'll just take a little bit of time. I had another point to make and it's  gone out of my head because it's half past 12. I can't remember what it was. I'm sure it was

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  going to make, which I'm just going to throw out really quickly, which is the nature of ads has  changed to the point that the websites are now having to move to these affiliate models where  they're essentially linking. They're linking through to products and that becomes the way  that they're making their money because the ad business has been sucked up by Google and Facebook.

It was something like GoodSite  that I went to. And I see this more and more. You nailed it, Nate, because more and more sites are  turning to basically either if it's not native content, which is horrible, which is an ad posing  as actual content, to ads for affiliate products. And they're really just blatant  hucksterism. So I was fooled. I was on a site that used to be a GoodSite. I don't know what it was.  And it said, hey, boy, you got to take advantage of this deal. You can get a  Sonic electric toothbrush for like $29.95. And I thought, oh, that's great. Then I went and I  ordered it. And it's a fake, like Chinese knockoff of an electric toothbrush from SmileBrightStore.com.  Obviously, it was an affiliate link for something terrible. I ordered two, which was stupid. But  the good news is, well, I was going to give one away. I thought this is too good a deal. That's  a hundred dollar toothbrush. And then the good news is instead of sending me a toothbrush,  they sent me a face brush for the second one, which isn't but it is not and it is from MyLifeMyShop.com.  But they're both in this fake mint color. I did not even open these because they're clearly just  going to explode in my hand the minute I put them in. It drove me nuts.

But you know, I did have to stop doing Instagram, not because I didn't like Instagram. I don't. I  don't like Facebook, but more because I kept buying stuff on it. Those ads work. Those ads  work. So it's possible to make ads that work. I'd like to think our ads work. You know,  it's not working. This is a great article in the New York Times. Facebook, apparently,  I didn't know this. Facebook created something called Summit Learning, which was an  internet learning curriculum promoting an educational approach called personalized  learning, which uses online tools to customize education. Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan,  their foundation, funded it. It was developed by five Facebook engineers. Mark said, go work on  this. It's been rolled out in a number of towns, particularly towns. And this was the great high  goal of all of this. Tows where schools were underfunded and the test scores were going down.  Under the program, students spend much of the day on their laptops, go online for lessons,  plans, and quizzes, which they complete at their own pace. Teachers assist students with the work,  hold mentoring sessions, lead special products. The system is free to schools. The laptops are  bought separately. This sounds great, right? This is brilliant. So almost everywhere Summit  Learning is, people are rebelling. Students are striking. According to the New York Times,  this Sunday, students started coming home with headaches and ham cramps. Some said they felt  more anxious. One child began having a recurrence of seizures. Another asked to bring her dad's  hunting earmuffs to class to block out classmates because work was now done largely alone.  The Summit's response is, well, these people just have an old-fashioned nostalgia for the old  form of education. But there is a mounting… Why do we didn't have headaches?  Yeah, no, yeah. There is a mounting, according to the Times, a mounting nationwide opposition to  Summit. It's now in 380 schools used by 74,000 students. In Brooklyn, high school students  walked out in November after their schools started using Summit. In Indiana, Pennsylvania,  70% of students wanted Summit dropped or made optional.

Well, but it's really a perfect example of Silicon Valley's kind of blind belief that  technology can fix everything and that this is going to go great. And this is a great way.  And look, I think that their motives are pure. It's nonprofit. They sent it to school districts  that were underfunded where kids weren't doing well. But it seems to have made the children sick.

And I always said, no, you don't want  more technology, you want less technology. You've got great teachers. It's the personal relationship  the teachers offer the students that's most important. And by the way, if you teach people  how to use Microsoft Word, by the time they get out of college, it won't be Microsoft Word.  So you shouldn't teach them technical skills. You probably shouldn't even teach them coding. You  should teach them things like critical thinking, things that have been around for hundreds of  years that are important. And they'll learn the technology. I'm not worried about kids and  technology. They're going to learn the technology. Look at this is Wellington, Kansas, written on the  storefront.

At some point I want to go do some good in the world. And she's like,  oh, don't worry, dad, your company does good things that you work for now. And it, yeah,  which was very sweet. And then she added, and anyway, it's not like you work for Facebook or  anything. I was like, whoa, it could be worse, dad. So she has a very low opinion of Facebook.

So, you know,  let's take a little break and then I'm going to give you some happy, we're going to find some  happiness. We're going to find one way, at least one way that technology has made your life better  this week. Carson, can you get on that? You've got one minute. I'm looking, I'm looking. Just  one way. That's all I ask. I'll tell you one way that my life is better. I'm wearing them right  now. My simple contacts, simple contacts, a very easy way to get contact lenses. But I have to say,  I always run out, right? And then I got, Oh, I got to make an appointment. I got a  renewable prescription. So I found simple contacts. It's an app. It's awesome.  It actually makes the time consuming process of renewing your contact lens prescription very easy.  Because you actually use the app. It brings the doctor's office to your home. It was so fun.  I set the phone up. You have to get a certain distance for the phone. They give you an eye  test. You do a video of it and then it's reviewed by a doctor. I explained some things that are  unusual about my vision. They contacted me. They said, great. Okay. It's the eye exam is $20.  And then you buy the contacts and it's very easy. And I saved a hundred bucks on the contacts. I  used to order them from another online place. It was a hundred bucks less. Simple contacts.  Now you should go in. We're not saying you should replace your periodic full eye health exam,  the puff test. For me, I have type two diabetes. I got to get a picture of my retina every year  and stuff like that. So I still believe me, I still do that. But when I run out of contacts  and I need to renew, this is so much easier. I get great contact lenses and I get them for less.  In fact, we're going to get you even better deal. You could save $20 on your first simple  contacts order. That in fact makes the eye exam free, right? Go to simplecontacts.com slash  twit. Use the promo code twit at checkout. Simple contacts. I don't know how you get your contact  lenses. I love my eye doctor, but you know what? He charges like three times more. So I've started  getting them online and now I found simple contacts. Not only can I get them online for less,  but I get the prescription renewed as easily. It just takes a minute. Simplecontacts.com slash  twit. Use the promo code twit at checkout. I'm a big fan. I got a year's worth, a year's supply.  I'm wearing them right now. Can you tell? Simplecontacts.com slash twit. We thank them  for their support and we thank you for supporting us by using that offer code twit. You'll save  20 bucks. Okay. A couple of bad things. Horrific attacks in Sri Lanka. Just terrible. Last I saw  200 deaths. A lot of tourists. It's Easter. Catholic churches were attacked. Tourist locations were  attacked. Interesting though. The first thing the Sri Lankan government did is turn off Facebook,  Instagram, and Twitter. They turned off social networks. What do you think? Is that the right

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  do that? I'm sorry, you were saying something, Dylan? Yeah, I guess I was going to say as long  as the social networks are unable to or unwilling to shut down the spread of panic,  it makes sense that governments like Sri Lanka are going to do exactly that. They're going to do it

Is there  porn on TikTok? Too much. Really? Is that why they should? They're porn and everything.  That's what they said. That's what they said. I mean, mostly what I saw on TikTok is like teenagers  doing karaoke sing-alongs and Vine style videos, but I guess you can't. Well, hey, good news. At  least in the UK, you'll be protected. They're going to introduce porn age checks in July.

Start time: 7335.18
End time: 7405.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, they want to make all websites, like commercially popular websites,  put up an age gate that asks you to prove how old you are. And there are several things that  are wrong with this. The first is that the group responsible for determining which websites need  to put up these age gates is the group that assigns age ratings to movies and games and  things like that, which is a very well-intentioned group, but is not a specialist group and has banned  some sexual acts. I'm trying to be very family-friendly here from appearing in  commercially available pornography that I think is questionable while allowing certain other things.  And the other thing is that the way that, well, one of the ways that you're going to be able to  prove your age is by scanning your passport or driver's license and uploading it to a company  who I looked into the company. It's a company called MindGeek, which runs websites like Pornhub.

Start time: 7405.94
End time: 7417.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah. MindGeek runs them all basically. They're the biggest of the bunch here.  So you go to Pornhub and it says, okay, you can watch, but first upload your passport

Start time: 7418.44
End time: 7493.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  or driver's license? What could possibly go wrong? And it's very easy to laugh about this,  and you should for many, many reasons. But the really worrying thing is that you look at  what has happened in the past. And we talked about this earlier, I think with the mental health app  that was allowing, or it was mental health app or the fertility apps that were sharing data,  is the problems that can happen when a very personal personal preference, whether that's  mental health condition or sexuality or what have you, is then associated with a real world  identifier leaking out. Because in many countries where we do have very liberal populations,  that's okay. I'll say it's okay. It's not as terrible. It shouldn't happen. But you're not  going to get stoned to death for being homosexual. Whereas there are many countries in the world where  you potentially could be in some very serious life-threatening danger if certain aspects of your  personality or sexuality or whatever were leaked. And I find it very worrying that that's something  that we're essentially relying on not happening in order to allow something like a pornography

Start time: 7493.22

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  site to operate legally. It seems misguided. I have to assume that really the plan of whoever  created this, I presume, parliament is not so much to get age identification as to just turn people  away, like to stop using it. If you're gay and you provide your passport to a site so you can watch  gay videos, that seems a very risky thing to do. It seems like it might be a GDPR problem too.  It has. And it feels like what they're figuring is, well, just people will walk away. They're  not going to do it. By the way, here's another way. You can also go to a news agent and buy  what they call a porn pass, an age verification card. Now only the news agent will know who you

End time: 7547.20

Start time: 7547.32
End time: 7551.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  or something like that. But now you have to carry a porn pass in your wallet, which doesn't seem

Start time: 7551.50
End time: 7619.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  like a good idea either. I mean, someone said to me not long ago, people are just going to be too  embarrassed to walk into a shop and buy a porn pass. And I said, well, I remember being 11,  12 years old. And I remember what you did is you put the dirty magazine inside a very respectable  newspaper and then pay for the newspaper. And that was a very good way of getting around that  embarrassment. But yeah, the bottom line is that there are good intentions behind the law, which  is to protect children from accidentally stumbling on pornography. And that's a very difficult thing  to do in the modern internet. Very difficult. But the problem is, is how many kids are accidentally  stumbling on pornography websites like this? They're not. If they're going to those websites,  it's because they're typing it in. What they're stumbling across it, sorry, where they're stumbling  across it are things like Twitter, Tumblr, messaging apps, Tik Tok. We just talked about that.  And they're not covered by this because they don't fall under the criteria of a third or more of  their content being pornographic in nature. So the places where kids are accidentally stumbling on it  aren't getting covered by this at all. And the places-

Start time: 7619.30
End time: 7648.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But go ahead and do a Google search for Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and see what you find.  Do I want to?  No. That's the problem is that a lot of the stuff that you might innocently search for  turns up results that are reprehensible or just certainly not appropriate for a child.  I don't know what the answer is. I mean, in the States, people put filtering programs on.  They don't work very well. I don't know.

Start time: 7649.00
End time: 7680.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I suppose. I mean, I think it's a case of you have to be seen to be doing something.  Because if you're not seen to be doing something that it looks like you don't care,  the problem is that I don't think this is a good solution. And I don't think enough consultation  with people who know about this kind of stuff. I don't think enough of that has happened to inform  the decision here. I think people have just agreed that, yes, stopping kids accidentally  seeing pornography is a good thing. I don't think too many people would disagree with that in general.  But this is the wrong way to go about it. I think it's-

Start time: 7681.64
End time: 7716.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's very troubling. I don't think there's any good answer. And I really feel bad for a generation  of children as growing up basically without innocence of any kind.  Some might say, oh, that's without ignorance of any kind. But I don't think so because the stuff  that kids are seeing in porn is not normal love, not normal sexuality, but a bizarre kind of  sexuality. And I see it in kids. They don't have that innocence anymore. And I think that's sad.  All right, Karsten, did you find a good story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Utah bans police, thank God, from searching digital data without a warrant.  First state in the nation to ban warrantless searches of electronic data. Did you know that  was legal? One wouldn't think so. Under the Electronic Information or Data Privacy Act,  HP 57, state law enforcement can only access someone's transmitted or stored digital data.  That would include emails, writing, images, audio, if a court issues a search warrant based on  probable cause. The act ensures that search engines, email providers, social media, cloud  storage, and any other third party electronic communication service or remote commuting service  is fully protected under the Fourth Amendment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  7 nanometers and upcoming GPU.  I think they're really, all the hardware you'd expect.  One of the things they really mentioned though is this next generation SSD technology.  Maybe using the next version of PCIe, I guess.  But it's supposedly going to be able to load games almost instantly.  I think that's huge because that's been the big problem for gaming consoles.  This is the past few generations.  You're installing games.  They have to go to the hard drive.  You have to wait for them to load.  You're using slow rotating laptop hard drives.  Not great.  So having an SSD, maybe an NVMe type thing that loads super quickly, that could be huge.  This new GPU they're going to use,

Start time: 8024.54
End time: 8029.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Start time: 8033.24
End time: 8054.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, that could be huge.  That allows games to do amazing realistic lighting and smoke effects and so forth.  Ray tracing is a really neat technology.  We saw an update of, was it Doom?  Done and ray traced with the new-  Quake 2.  Oh, it was Quake 2.  That's what it was.  Yeah, with the new Nvidia processor.  And it was really beautiful.

Start time: 8054.80
End time: 8085.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Looks amazing.  I mean, that tech has a huge potential.  The PC side hasn't really seen many games support it.  But I think as it comes to consoles and developers learning to use it, that could be huge.  That could be amazing.  We still don't quite know what that means though.  We don't know if it's dedicated ray tracing hardware that's on the Nvidia cards,  or are they going to do it through other processing means, which could be more costly.  There's still a lot left up in the air.  I'm just really excited about the loading thing.  And it sounds like the hardware is going to be a step up all around.

And they're trying to sell you something because they're saying,  oh yeah, it could potentially run 8K.  Maybe for a 2D stick figure game or something.  Because the amount of processing power needed for 8K at a native resolution is insane.  If you add 8K to 5G, you're going to get 13GK.

Transcript:  Oh, I do the slash film cast.  That's the slash film.com.  So we review movies and TV shows.  We're about ready to start our summer movie wager,  which is this fun thing we do every summer where we basically predict the top 10 movies  the summer season and try to see who wins at the end.  And whoever wins has to force everybody to watch a movie of their own choosing.  Nice.  So yeah, prepping for that.  That's going to be a lot of fun.  I'm also doing a tech show at nomoretech.net.  And that's know with a K.  And it's like just answering people's questions and talking about like timely news and stuff.
