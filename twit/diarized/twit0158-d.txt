Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  peter norton's crossed arm pose is a registered trademark so nobody cross their arms because

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you'll be violating trademark how can they register that that's crazy what a crock hey has the show  started yet yes it has john c devorek you want to talk about some news well i think maybe that's  what people out there want to hear i think they'd prefer to hear us reminisce about the bad old days

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  stuff we only have vague memories of half the information is flawed well what's different

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  about the modern stuff all right this is the big story from the houston chronicles tech blog  comcasts bandwidth caps out of the closet you know the truth is they've always had bandwidth caps  dave weiner most famously getting that letter from comcast some months ago saying you've you're a hog  we're gonna cut you off in fact they cut you off for a year if they cut you off now there's that  was that for his comcast usage yeah oh he tweeted about it was a fascinating story i think he blogs

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  about it as well there's some guys out there some of my fans will get that one oh that oh i never  mind go on i see that was a little dig no i'm just kidding that dave i love dave i love him i'm a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  kidder so they say uh october 1st you get 250 gigabytes a month they point out that that only  1% of all their users use that much in fact the vast majority use one one hundredth of that it's  much more typical the average usage is two to three gigabytes a month what can i can i bring up a point

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to the listeners out there and that might be good on twitter yes can somebody out there develop a  small utility that essentially counts the bits that we use when we go online because you can do  that as you can just say do a little interrupt in the middle between the uh you know the connection  and the and the and the computer and let's see what people really do use well there are a lot of

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  bad net meters out there yeah net meter is there a counter out there i don't know oh yeah there's  tons of there are what's what's interesting is that is that comcast when asked whether they were  going to provide one because you know if they're going to tell you you can only have so much they  ought to tell you how much you're using they said no go out and do a search for them there are others  out there and to me they have a moral imperative to say to say if we're going to cap you you we need  to tell you what you're doing you need to be able to go to their account page i agree on their site  and it should say right next to your bill how much you view yeah they know just like the cell phone companies

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  yeah but here's the problem with all this i've got five computers at home that are online right now  but i also have three other devices that i can't load anything onto like your slingbox for instance  like my slingbox my sonos and um i don't know lord knows there's four or five the router can do the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  counting yeah especially if your router doesn't do the counting you can flash it with like the  tomato firmware or ddwrt and and then it can do the counting for you but i still think comcast

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  yeah that's a good idea comcast knows they're the only ones who really can easily know all of this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  right you shouldn't have to go flash the firmware on your router to see you know what they're going

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to get sued by somebody if they don't provide this information because the fact of the matter is you  can't charge for somebody and and tend just take their word for it this is like going to the gas  station and putting the pump in and not having any gallonage and then you say yeah you owe me 50 bucks

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  well the same day that this broke there also was a settlement in florida which comcast actually lost  this civil suit i mean a suit from the florida attorney general in which they basically charged  that comcast was not playing fair by having this bandwidth cap but not talking about it  that was announced the same day as this and so i suspect that that may have had something to do  with it they may have actually had to rush this out they clearly i mean they clearly had kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  unwritten caps the question is is this artificially low and here's my contention the real point of  doing this and doing it now right now nobody it's not you know a very small number of people are  going to get bit by this i did some calculating if you for instance wanted to watch my video stream  which is a very high quality 564 kilobit stream if you watch it 24 seven you'd only use 176

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  gigabytes a month so you'd still have but leo you know you got to look at some other things out there  as well i also did some calculations based on like one of our programs dig nation which takes about  it's almost a gigabit a gigabyte per hour so if you if you think about it if you're watching  eight hours of television a day which is what the normal you know american household apparently does  something like that across 30 days you're going to pretty much bump up against that just by watching  eight hours of internet television a day at that level and that's not even hd level so here's my

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that's where it comes well my problem with that let me tack it on real quick leo is if you go  over your limit all you get is a warning and then once you've been warned if you go over again they  suspend you for a year you can't even buy extra capacity yeah it's just no you have to stay under

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  250 change your life because you don't have an option hey does this happen to anybody that we know of

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it doesn't start till october 1st well as i said it has happened to people it has there's no way  they're going to do that that's not going to happen they've done it they've run they've run  done it to people they've done it to people who have run afoul of the cap before they formally  said what it was this cap has been in place for several years and every now and then if you look  on broadband reports you'll see stories about people who yes had their service cut off because  they continually went over it now i don't know that it was just two times and you're out it may  have been more than that but now they're making some formal rules starting october 1st so here's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  my conspiracy theory i think they're doing this now for a very clear reason right now you know  we're gonna bitch and moan but most customers aren't even close to that it's a safe thing to  do but let's i say they're saying let's draw the line in the sand now nobody's downloading  eight hours of high quality video today but in a couple of years three years four years they are  and what is comcast's primary business it's a cable company i think what this really is is  anti-competitive i think they're saying uh we don't want people to start watching tv we don't want  them to start watching revision three eight hours a day because that puts us out of business we  don't want them downloading high def movies you know it's the same thing as saying we don't want  voice over internet because we've got our own call system or a transition play where they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  saying you know we'll wait till people start to hit the 250 gig max and then we'll start  making a more expensive tier they can go to so we make up that money we might be losing from cable

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  right right can i can i defend the company with a with another argument okay first of all there's  a lot of evidence that ip tv initiatives are being looked at closely by comcast and that at  some point they may bail on the cable business and and and do ip tv with a package kind of deal  which essentially is like cable but it would probably save them a ton of money so i'm not  convinced that they're doing this to kill ip tv although it's a really good argument the other  thing is they they keep raising their speeds and at some point they have they're going to run into  a kind of an end point where they're not going to be able to do any practical speed raising  without you know changing their whole infrastructure and i think what they're  doing here is setting up some sort of a essentially a marketing gimmick where they put this this  you know there's a reason you know this fairly high cap up and then at some point down the road  when they have no other leverage to say we have a better deal than at and t whoever they say now  we will give you 500 gigabytes and then now we'll give you a terabyte a month as and pretty much  maintain the same price structure i don't think they're going to go into price gouging  because there's no evidence that they can maintain that because there is there's just enough of a  modicum of competition to prevent that from happening well that's the issue is there if there

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  were competition nothing to worry about right then you just say hey well comcast has a 250 gig limit  i'll just go to my local independent internet service provider except that for most people

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  there isn't one or even if there is one it's at a much lower level i mean i just left dsl i loved  my dsl isp to death but they couldn't provide me more than 150k they just couldn't where i live

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  what don't you live in berkeley or something like that i live in i live in downtown oakland  oh same thing oh that's not the same thing are you kidding me in a lot of cases there are there are

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  two providers there are usually at and t or some telco and there's the cable company at and t has  said that they are looking at bandwidth caps time warner in just down the road in baumont is  trialing a metered usage based on bandwidth caps so this is something that's coming everywhere and  my suspicion is you're not going to be able to escape oh wait time warner first of all is more

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  scared than anybody else they're like they're the the ostrich of the cable company so ignore them  i'd be more interested to see what happens with verizon and comcast where they compete  in the same place and fios is going in because there i think is where comcast is going to get  their shirt handed to them if verizon doesn't put caps on but but where they will is primarily in

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  new suburbs they're not putting it into it's very expensive putting it in manhattan yeah but it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  very well that's in manhattan where there's dense populations it's relatively cheap it's five  thousand dollars per subscriber in in places in suburbs in places where houses are independent

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  actually the best bet for that is the new developments jim you're never going to get

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  fiber to your house he's in he lives on like on the ocean there's not i have fiber in my house

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  does that count you do no yeah i ran fiber when we put it in an addition so what what are you nuts  you know i got that banana peel cable that had two strands of utp two strands of cable and  just so i could say i did it on twin it's a good thing to have and now it's paid off

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  yeah no we're actually running for you know at port angeles house we're running fiber to that  but we paid for the trench yeah it's expensive isn't it well actually they were strung it overhead

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and it wasn't that expensive yeah we like we i looked into trenching out to our house and it was  god it was a hundred dollars a foot or something with some outrageous amount huge i would love to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  see fiber cable dsl where they do have high speed and y max or lte or something you know in the  future all competing against each other i think it's possible but it's going to take forever that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the essential problem is that even if you have an independent internet service provider in your  neighborhood they're getting it from the telco so essentially no that's not true necessarily we're

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  not getting our fiber from the telco well who are you getting it from we're getting it from the public

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  utilities district really that's interesting i think that's an unusual that's an outlier no there's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  lot of people public utilities districts that have fiber the most of the country is wired up and they

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  got all this excess yeah that's true they own well that's good let's promote that i mean the more  competition the better i just think in most markets if you're lucky you've got two big you got the  telco and you got the cable company and they're going to collude uh i here's my here's my proposition  let's not have bandwidth caps i don't mind paying for more speed i think you should pay for more  speed but it should always be unlimited is that is that viable does that work jim laderback there's  an idea paid by the bit not no no no no no no no not by the bit you're not paying for data  paying by speed so if i get the speed say again get the speed that's the other problem is that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  comcast claims these people claim you're going to get you know that's right or you don't get it no

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but i think i think as a consumer i'd be willing to you know tear me so if i'm not a big user give  me two megabits but if i want to start downloading high def video or start watching streaming video i  want 10 megabits i pay for that but it's got to be on at and t does that's what at and t does now

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  at dsl is tiered but traditionally cable has an off bit well you can get you can get a more expensive

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  account from at least some cable operators it'll give you more of a slightly corporate thing we  did this for one of our video creators down in la who had to upload a show every week i just don't i

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  don't want limits because it's you can't measure how much you've downloaded it's an unpredictable  amount and and i don't want limits on what i can watch you i i know how much bandwidth i'm getting  i could check that at any time i know if i'm getting my money's worth and i think that that's  a much more reasonable way to play it and i think consumers would be i mean then you know what you're  getting i'm getting four megabits i'm i'm getting it what about vincerf's idea of like a minimum

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  like a you know like a service level agreement like we will provide you this much it might go  higher sometimes i think that's reasonable conditions are right yeah you're guaranteed this now they tell

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you the maximum they say you may get as much as 10 megabits and you can only go as high as 250  gigabits yeah minimums are much better this is kind of the conversation we had before john where  we were debating what is the actual cost of this bandwidth to the provider and i still like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  attention you know here we go into the theoretical that's all free argument all right i'm not going  to say that i'm not going to go that far i get a bunch of hate mail because i still think that it  should be done and you know how what my argument is you do you don't really want people to pay for

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  the by the bit though yeah i do he likes the way it was back in 1996 i see paying by the bit makes

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  no sense to me i can understand paying look understand we have to pay for the infrastructure  john i'm not saying we don't have to pay for something but but but it makes more sense to me  that i pay for the the speed i get not for the bits what we really don't want is pay for the bits  because that gives them a choke hold on the content that we get they're essentially condensed  yes it does because i if i'm getting 250 gigs limit i can't download high def movies i can't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  do all the things i'd like to do leo here's what i would get what you would everybody assumes when  they take on this argument with me is that that for some reason the calculation is going to result  in some horrendous fees for normal usage i'm saying that you should be able to download all  the movies you want by the bit and pay like 12 bucks a month okay i i could i could dig that  do you think that's what's going to happen well no because it's already the the the amount of of  the number of people that are against the idea and the fact that we've done it some other way  for so long and the fact that every time you turn around one of these guys is going to offer  something like now we don't should do it that way no it's never going to happen the problem is that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  if you pay by the bit they still have another dial they can turn which is the speed so they say okay  yeah you buy by the bit but i want to turn your speed down because i don't want you to i think

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it should be the maximum amount of speed that you can possibly get by the bit well i could live with

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that if the if the price of per bit in a way that makes more sense because you're buying let's say  you buy a high def movie and it's two gigabyte download you know exactly what the cost of that  movie is going to be you know if it's a penny a penny a megabyte it's two you know whatever

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  whatever that is 2000 megabytes then all your vista machines wake up at midnight and download

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the whole operating system well that's a good point we got a we got an email from a family of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  four and the guy's really worried about the 250 gigabyte cap because he says he's got you know  xbox 360 and he's got four computers one for each of his kids and he and his wife and they're all  patching and they do backup so they upload a backup every week that's you know several  gigabytes he's like i'm pretty sure i'm gonna go over that 250 gigabyte max in a month and i don't  know what i'm gonna do get two accounts well they run a second wire because that's an interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  idea but you have you'd have to run a second wire wouldn't you they wouldn't yeah they could run a  second wire they got the little thing right on the pole they do that though because one of the things  right now is that what happens when you have a duplex and you got two people in and live in there  separately usually they've run all those wires by now that's all i'm saying well that's not  no they'll run a wire they'll charge you for it though yeah well now you get to go one of those

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  free installation deals well they don't do free installation anymore unless you get triple play

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  at least with comcast yeah it comes and goes i think people don't need to worry right now i  think there are very few people who are actually going to hit that 250 gig that's a pretty big

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  limit but but leo you're right it's setting it up for the future that's the point yeah i think it's  going to be a real problem going forward and i think uh you know it's it's going to keep people  from doing things like watching high bandwidth movies or television shows because they're afraid  of hitting that cap even though they'll never get there they're afraid of it and once comcast

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  starts offering the same kind of thing you watch those bits will be exempt from their cap

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  walled garden walled garden so if you go to fan cast right now that's not going to count

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  don't know right now but that's your right future that's what happened somebody listening to you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  guys would think you're all hallucinating you're kind of making up scenarios that we have no

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  evidence to exist well john we're not saying they do exist we're saying what could happen as a result

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  of this all kinds of things come over and beat the crap out of you and steal your money i'm saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  watch your wallet i'm saying they're going after it i remember talking to cable companies and

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that's sucking sound leo i got a crazy hat down line in the basement uh i talked to i talked to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the cable companies uh elections gone by i talked to the cable companies and they said uh very  clearly i said look you gotta you gotta see yourself as content agnostic you're you're you're really  your future is is you're a data provider and whatever is on that bit is on that bit they said  we our business model doesn't work that way we have to charge for premium content that's how we make  our money if we just charge by the bit it's going to cost way too much that's i think that that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  by premium content over ip tv a lot easier than they can do it now well can they is the fcc gonna  let them the fcc doesn't even have any control over it well the fcc doesn't want them crazy

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  without the fcc no i'm saying well they do have control over it in fact that's why they slapped  comcast on the wrist they said you can't prioritize content yeah they don't have right they bitched  yeah they didn't do anything to them but i think they do now they somebody in the chat room just

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  article in tech crunch uh anderson who was in between his freshman sophomore years in high  school i wish my kids had this much initiative uh hacked into although i wouldn't want the fbi task  force battering the door down but uh hacked into the chase manhattan's vax the one that quote  handled much of chase's data processing and record keeping including records of home mortgages and  portfolios of major customers such as pension funds seems unlikely doesn't i don't know you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  bogus it doesn't sound right do you but but wait a minute is tom such a good hacker that he was able  to place this story back in 1985 somehow place this into the archives maybe maybe that's the real hack

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  maybe john tidor to do it for him or it could be that the police who who talked to the reporters  from the story back then didn't know their vax from there i think that's probably no that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  possible yeah and then what about the guy who disappeared that they interviewed tom about  landriff like late later down in the story yeah who apparently disappeared they never found it but  then something else turns up that he worked for the cia or something i mean it just gets weirder  and weirder the farther into that story it might be you know they're doing them they're doing a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  frankenstein yeah exactly melbrooks i was going with the melbrooks young facebook stein excuse

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  me while i code this out my name is zuckerberg

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  uh let's see apple's being sued three different ways from sunrise the biggest one the most  interesting one anyway is scistars countersuit now scistars a company that made the apple clone  that apple uh for a while put up with but finally uh shut down how did they brick them

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  uh that's a good question it just says that in the headline i i'm not quite sure did anybody ever

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  touch one of these machines now yes yes i've seen it no no does it work yep yeah runs apple you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  you better not run system update i mean you have to go through their system update but other than

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that so according to scistar apple illegally destroys competition i guess the way they would  brick it is if you ran windows update it would brick your your uh your clone of course

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  windows update oh well we're just gonna let that pass what is the other company uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  os 10 update apple yeah i guess what they're saying is it bricks it because you can't you  can't because they put in that kernel right whatever the efi thing is so that you can't

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  install it without a hack is there merit i mean there might be some merit to this i mean it's  says they violated the sherman antitrust act by engaging in anti-competitive behavior in violation  of public policy underlying copyright laws well they've got to define apple as their own market

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that's what they're trying to do they're not part of the pc market they are a separate market unto  themselves and therefore a monopoly that's really hard to convince a judge wait a minute wait a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  minute say that about any company i got it now i got another thing let's say the following this  is what i would equate it to i've got my car and i bought the whole car from some dealer who only  sells bridgestone tires and i take it back into them i bought fire stones you know i didn't  outside the dealer they say you're supposed to be buying your tires from us you didn't buy the  bridge stones i said i know can you fix the engine and instead they take and poke holes in my tire

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  they brick it rick it now that's what i think that's exactly the analogy that size stars  attorney should make i think that's very reasonable well the problem with the issue that they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  wait let me finish one more thought which is why do i i buy a piece of equipment from somebody  what right does apple have to wreck my piece of equipment

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  well they didn't they just provided a system update that didn't work it's not it's not their  fault you weren't using it on the right machine i mean you know if you've hacked something to  work on something else you can't expect them to support the hack they're not supposed to wreck my

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  machine the problem with the argument that size star is trying to make that they that it's its  own little market and thus has its own little set of monopolists and people wanting to to undo  that monopoly is that they're trying to separate it from windows but now max can run windows and  they run them quite well and so it really kind of doesn't matter what's on that machine i think  that's just a completely bogus argument that wall between them is no longer there so they have to  prove monopoly for this lawsuit to work within that little market within that little pond that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  they're arguing is apples does anybody really care i mean if you are so inclined to buy a mac  are you really going to buy something that's not a mac if it's cheaper are they cheaper oh yeah oh  yeah they're a lot cheaper quite a bit yeah but people will people want that mac goodness you  know those mac people that's what they want i agree that's actually a related story uh i'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  gonna see if i can find it because i didn't bookmark it in this but a story i think was  an ars technica saying how uh apple fans give give apple a complete free pass with all the  problems apple has been having they still love their macintoshes they still love them i'm not  going to say anything bad about apple and that's the thing the apple audience are apple fans i  think you're right i think how many people are buying you know ugly looking beige boxes and  running os 10 on it if you if you want to run os 10 you're going to want to run it on that nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  expensive apple hardware but it's easy to run os 10 on it i think you would see more people because  the idea of a triple boot machine that i can run obunto windows and os 10 and have them work you  know across in in in virtualization that's fantastic i mean that that's such a useful  machine and if the machine itself was cheap enough where i could buy the the windows extra and the  os 10 and still be cheaper than a mac i think people would do that different people than the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  ones jim's talking about i would and and hardware vendors want to sell the mac too i talked to michael  dell a couple years ago about a year and a half ago and i mentioned it to him i said would you sell  mac based computers if you could and he said yeah i'd love to now you say uh dell built computers  running os 10 he wanted to sell machines running os 10 okay that's interesting i guess you're right

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  i think if you could walk into a computer store well first of all if there were any computer stores  you would walk into them and you'd see a shrink wrap copy of os 10 that you could then install on  any pc that would be a market i guess you're right yeah or if you could get for example

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  os 10 on an xps 1330 as a dual boot or as a single boot yeah sure yeah when when when you get into an

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  argument with a mac head about uh what you know max your pc is the eternal argument the one thing  they always come back to is it's the operating system it's the operating system and certainly  you know they'll argue that the that the mac is a better os than windows so if you can put that on  a sweet piece of hardware like an m1330 wouldn't you want to do that yeah i think they would can

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  i take the other side of the story yeah here's what apple has to deal with they have to deal with the  fact that they don't they're not now they're selling an operating system into a non-standard  environment that they don't have any control over so they put up some sort of a cool feature that  they have only on their own mac but nobody else has duplicated for whatever reason maybe it's just  a basic architecture and the thing starts to break on the dell machine who do they end up calling  apple ends up with having to do a bunch of support in a situation they have no control there's no way  that this model would ever be of a have any appeal to that company the way they're oriented

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  and that's exactly what they don't do that's why they don't do it you're right they have control

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that's the problem microsoft has they have to work on this heterogeneous environment that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  is completely unpredictable although john support it john didn't you once write that you thought  that apple was going to dump the mac os and go all windows don't rub it in it's always somebody

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  like you in the audience john's favorite quote what is it emerson or is it theroux i can never  remember yeah it was emerson foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds yeah whatever

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  that means dwight you've been you've been pwned well when he uh when he wrote that i did a blog  post about it that with a headline john devorak is smoking crack i think i saw that one there's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  bunch of people that had some nasty remarks i was just throwing it out as a theoretical interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  possibility you know though the discussions we had around that time were why doesn't apple offer a  shrink wrapped version of os 10 and you said at the time john will compare wallets who has the  bigger wallet bill gates or steve jobs the guy who sells an operating system or the guy who sells

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the hardware no i agree that it would be nice and i would definitely probably install so why doesn't  apple do it but this because of the control thing they can't deal with the customer service issue  i think it's huge support would be out of control right you know what you just do what

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  microsoft does if you buy our operating system never answer the phone yeah no their policy is  if you buy the operating system from an oem if you buy a dell we don't support windows dell

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  supports windows but the windows they do that if you buy it from if you buy your mac from apple  then they'll support it you know why not do that that's the justification for the higher cost

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  windows support experience is terrible and because it's decentralized apple has a great support  experience because you go to one place and if they spread that out to all these oems it'll ruin that  wonderful glow you have from getting apple support that's why they don't do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the apple support is is give gives people a glow most most of the time most of the time i think

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the gene you know what i think the genius does i hear a lot of you know you hear negatives everybody's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  gonna have negatives but i hear a lot of positives i was at the apple store this morning and i heard a  negative guy walking by is like genius couldn't fix my heart freaking genius but that's anecdotal

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  obviously and remember apple's been down this road before we had the power systems back i don't know  what was it 10 years or so ago and nobody wanted them nobody bought them well that's right and then

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  steve jobs put put a stake in the heart of these clones by saying we're not going to do it anymore  you got to say whatever jobs has done it's been fairly successful market share for apple is up  dramatically now 20 percent of laptops in the u.s. or pcs and laptops in the u.s. 10 percent worldwide  is pretty phenomenal given that they were three percent just a couple of years ago what  what is the ceiling for that are we at the max can apple have a 30 percent double you think they go

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to 20 you predicted that i think 40 yeah it's very no i don't see 40 but i can see them doing 20

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  pushing 20 at whose expense dell hp del is not in good shape are they i think del probably hit a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  little bit lenovo for sure yeah it's gonna be it's gonna be out of the consumer market though  they're not moving into the enterprise yet until they do that they're not going to get

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  well then they'll hit hp when they do that they're not doing well globally

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  who apple does not do nearly as well globally as they do yeah well that gives them the way i see

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it that's an opportunity for them because globally people who use the apple overseas love it according

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to a piper jaffrey they've actually they actually in april they actually broke 20 percent he thinks  that apple max count for 21 in the u.s consumer market ah the consumer market says leaving out  business and business is 60 yeah business is a huge portion of that so that it's probably it's  considerably lower i would say i would say if you include business it's around 10 now something like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that which is still because there are businesses that run the max i mean we're yeah but they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  all artsy fartsy oh hippies oh a bunch of hippies you see you see them in server rooms a little bit

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  too but it's still predominantly no don't get me started on that we bought an apple san that is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the worst product i've ever i think you'd be crazy to run it it's overpriced what makes it better i  don't i don't know why you'd run an apple server and there's no support the support for it's terrible

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  yeah tom ask your wife it's terrible believe me i don't have to ask i've heard does elaine manage

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  your server room what why would it why would no no we have a um a storage area network that we use  for video editing oh she has to deal with that the sand if it gets more than 80 filled it crashes  that's not good and apple can do nothing about it do not trust your enterprise to apple i think

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  alex uses sans for all of his video stuff i wonder what he's doing of course he's yeah we're trying

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to put in final cut server and we can't do it i would i would ask what they're doing over pixel

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  core course they're used to living with pain i mean seriously it's been painful all along

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  yeah well you just don't fill it up you know you buy a you know 200 terabyte system you only get

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  160 terabytes right well you occasionally see these stories in the computer press it says  oh apple's making inroads into the enterprise and they interview somebody and that's it's inevitably  oh yeah we got a mac sitting over there on that desk over there right and it's that's about as

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  far as it gets yeah one mac how about in newspapers has that changed in the newspaper business

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  well then in the newspaper business um we've always used max for production right layout and  for layout you know except there are some papers that have older proprietary systems  but um you use it for layout what's interesting is at the chronicle we have this very cool policy  where rather than them buying notebooks and stacking them up and you check them out to  reporters reporters can buy their own and the company pays for half and and more and more people  are buying max you see more and more the reporters toting max around and as a result kind of the  support requests to our t department for max are going way up in addition the introduction of the  iphone with the exchange support has got a lot of reporters wanting to use that in the field  and um and so you know there's beginning to be pressure on our it group to do iphones are they

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  reporting trouble in there that way are they reporting trouble with mobile me and exchange

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  and they're not using mobile me oh they're not doing it okay yeah but what's interesting is  is that you know this is traditionally how the ibm pc made its inroads into corporate america  how windows xp and new operating systems do is that the consumers use them and then they come  to their bosses and say you know i like this i want to use this and that pressure builds

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  well that's how physicalic and excel got in but you know the funny thing is about 20 years ago i  began and i and i relate this to the fact that i used to work at factories which kids can't do  anymore when i was a student and i always noticed that the master mechanics in these big places  always had their own tools and i always believed that people should have their own they should have  their own computers that they bring to work and so then when they quit they take the computer with  them you know and they go to the next job and then employee that way the employer doesn't have  to deal with you know having to support all this gear letting the stuff go bad crap you know this  having to refurbish things i mean it just seems to me to like a burden on an employer to to and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  besides that i like what i like i actually do that i i have a laptop a thinkpad that was issued to me  by cnet but i don't i use it for testing or or some video work i bought my own macbook pro that  i run windows and nos 10 on because that way i can do whatever i want on it it's not you know got  some kind of installed thing from the company on it and if i ever do leave i take it with me and  i've got all my settings and everything just the way i want it yeah try taking that into cbs corporate

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and see what happens it's in cbs right now no but what i mean is if you you know and i don't know  about cbs but i remember when i was doing stuff at nbc or msnbc they were so locked down you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  couldn't plug anything into the network at all that wasn't approved most big enterprises are still

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that way yeah that's that's and to me even though i you know i'm familiar with companies like el  terrorist and some of these guys who made these systems that when you put a alien machine on the  network bang bonk bonk it would be an alert would be sent to the it department and you'd have to  actually couldn't get on the network without going through a rigmarole so they checked your  machine remotely which is one way of doing it but generally speaking if you don't have some  methodology that lets alien equipment on the network i think it's just an incompetence at the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  at the highest levels that's what you need that in large companies because if you get into the  network you can start doing things like what lord flathead did worse worse you come in and you you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  an oxymoron if i ever heard of one all right we're gonna take a break before we insult the  tsa anymore and are no longer allowed to fly anywhere in the u.s i don't want to make it on  that list i love those people i don't want to i love the blogger bob we love you dude don't ever  change never did hear from blogger bob we have a standing invitation blogger bob at the tsa if  you want to be on the show you're more than welcome but first it's time to mention our sponsor audible  com those audible books they're so great if you've not listened to an audio book you gotta try them  uh in fact you can get a free one right now by just going to audible.com slash twit it's a great  adjunct to your podcast listening you know you learn some history or you you do like my wife does  she's reading tory spelling's new book you know the story of my life it could be it could be  trashy it could be sexy it could be entertaining it could be spooky the 50 000 plus titles and by the  way i want to point this out if you go to audible.com right now and at the bottom election 2008 they have  a whole section of books it's like a bookstore now where you can go to this you know the section of  election stuff they put online a lot of the speeches from the democratic national convention  they'll do the same from the republican national convention so you and those are free so those are  just pro bono you can download and listen to obama's expect acceptance speech you can listen to his  speech from 2004 they have that online as well if you want to hear the speech that put him on the  national agenda and you can also read books like the case against barack obama you know they've  got it all and so go to the it's really fun to go to the election 2008 section on audible.com  the new bob woodward by the way the war within will be coming out in one week and that's going  to be a hot one also thomas friedman's new one hot flat and crowded that was a that was a the  the world is flat was an incredible book read by thomas friedman and his new one i'm sure is  be just as interesting t boone's pickings t boone's pickings the first billion is the hardest  if you like business so true i know how that feels audible.com slash twit if you want to get a free  book we love audible they've been a great sponsor for us over uh over almost a more than a year now  and uh we're looking forward to going into 2009 with audible as well audible.com  slash twit we thank them for their support encourage you to give them a try  if you haven't tried them you're missing out on some great books  so back we go to the tech news internet traffic is beginning this interesting is beginning to  bypass the u.s our friend john markoff wrote this story i asked john to be on by the way but he's  on vacation he'll be back later in september we'll get him on the show um he says that of course in  the early days of the internet most traffic went through the u.s because in fact you know the  internet started here and even if you were sending you know data from estonia to latvia  it would often go through the u.s uh however the balance of power shifting data is increasingly  flowing around the u.s not merely uh because it's faster but because in fact people are afraid of  having their data go through the u.s there since the passage of the patriot act many companies  based outside of the u.s according to mark rotenberg who's the executive director of epic  the electronic privacy information center many companies are reluctant to store client information  in the u.s they're afraid u.s intelligence agencies will be gathering this information  without legal process also it's uh it turns out to be a little bit cheaper not to do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because we know for a fact that the chinese and the russians and these other places aren't going  to be gathering information without the process they have they have established or they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  establishing an undersea cable linking georgia to bulgaria so that they don't have yeah yes because

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  georgia wasn't georgia was having a lot of problems when they got attacked by hackers during that  the russian invasion of south oscecia and the georgian invasion of south oscecia somebody  invaded somebody there but um it depends on what side you're on who was doing the invading and who  was doing the liberating but anyway there was the hacking and they couldn't they they couldn't find  another connection because most of their connections run through goes right through russia so they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  going to lay their own cable so it's not just shifting away from the u.s the the uh the japanese  for instance want to route through india and china so they don't have to route through the u.s the  georgians don't want to route through russia so they go directly to uh to bulgaria i feel like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  some of this is just natural as the internet grows and grows and grows people realize well  we don't want everything having to go halfway across the world through north america and then  back out what what's the interesting part of this story to me was is the folks in canada and and  closer areas like that who are making a conscious decision to route away from the united states even  if it is faster right or more convenient to do so because of like you said the patriot act or worries  about financial records being under the scrutiny of the u.s government you know how real do you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  think that that fear is i'll tell you it mirrors the what i've been told by a lot of open source  linux types who have said uh we're for instance there's no major linux conference in the u.s  anymore because they don't want to come to the u.s they're afraid of getting arrested or prosecuted  under the dmca or just random they're afraid of it so they have them in canada they have them in  other parts of the world they don't want to come to the u.s and i so they're afraid of getting  picked up by the gestapo yeah literally well you know remember scleraf who was uh the the russian  computer scientist who was arrested because he published a paper on the how fragile adobe's  ebook reader encryption was and how to crack it and got arrested and spent some time in jail  b until they got him out and i think nobody wants to go through that again i think scleraf was kind  of the the clarion called a computer scientist stay out of the u.s their laws are crazy crazy laws

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  but if the internet is distributed and data can kind of flow where it needs to how do you keep it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  from flowing through the u.s that's who you appear with i think right yeah if you have a direct line

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  we're talking about mostly and you can with border gateway protocol and and you know you can say i  don't i don't want it this is how i want to route it yeah you can you can block you can fence off

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  where you don't want it to go look does this have any kind of any kind of implication for like the  average user or is it something that's relatively esoteric esoteric you know i've been vint surf is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  quoted in john's article is saying whether it's a good or bad thing depends on where you stand  says suppose the internet was entirely confined to the u.s which it once was that wasn't helpful  so he said you know i think his attitude is he works for google now and google is absolutely  global google doesn't care um but uh it probably it doesn't impact us and i don't think you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  dwight i don't think it means that no traffic from overseas is going to come in if they don't you  know they want to stay out of our system i think if they're doing direct communications obviously  in the u.s but i think what they're talking about mostly is where the cloud exists where the trunks  exists where the major you know peering exists just to stay out of the u.s minimize exposure

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the people it hits are these these big backbone owners like verizon at and t  quest cogent comcast these are the guys who they'll be losing money yeah because uh so you know i  guess it does impact us in the long run and you know it impacts it could impact the economy it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  bad for business i don't see this is not a big deal and i think it's just it's the nature of  how the internet grows and you know there are always going to be people who may not want their  traffic traffic to go in certain places but i think it's good that you have multiple different  places where your traffic can go and that traffic is going where naturally it should go rather than  these trombone connections which i thought was a great term yeah yeah where they they try to keep

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  traffic away from their competitors regionally and like send it way far away yeah i totally  agree with you jim i i guess that's why the only parts of the story that bothered me is people  who would be benefiting by routing the traffic through the united states because it's faster or  more convenient them starting to say well maybe i don't want to because of privacy concerns i think  that's bad for the internet in the long term um whether you know whether the climate stays the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  way it is is up for question i suppose has anybody seen this picture of the uh of iphone girl

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  what is that you know okay so yeah i know about but i haven't seen her picture i'm trying to find

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  vista screen it what they do is they have taken the same approach to tell to telling you that  you may have a pirated version that's in sp1 of vista and they're adding it to windows xp pro  only not home or media edition so if you have a version that's pirated or if the windows genuine  advantage burps and malfunctions it'll give you a black background and a little watermark that says  you may be the victim of pirated software and of course most of the time you're not it's just a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  failure in the windows genuine advantage they they estimated themselves that it fails like five

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  microsoft hiring of jerry seinfeld it does seem like it kind of we talked a little bit about

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  my premise i started off the best says let's face it the one thing we have to assume from the  beginning before we do the analysis is that these ads are going to stink

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  they ain't going to be prejudicial no they ain't going to be john hodgeman and justin long i can

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  shouldn't be able to see the password right okay now that's it that's the key to this story right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because he has a business account and apparently normally you can't see the passwords in cleartext  at all but the to the bbc story just kind of leaves it out there is like well because this  was a shared business account therefore the password was available for staff to see now why  is that i i have no idea and what does that mean a shared business account well i guess i guess he's  on a business account maybe a small business and multiple people have access to it i don't know

Transcript:  up twitter i'm on twitter by the way at jay lauderby but why'd you give up on twitter i

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  actually haven't i still use twitter effective broadcast but it's well it's it's too big a thing  and what i what i did is what i i did an interview with um evan prodromo who created uh identica uh  it's an open source micro blogging platform easy i installed it on our server i'm encouraging other  people to do it i think revision 3 should have their community houston should have their community  houston chronicle and the idea being that these communities are small a little more manageable  but here's the beauty of it they're federated so i can subscribe to anybody on any other laconic  blog and follow them all right yeah this is a big deal right now i'm very excited about it what  really happened is because twitter turned off im and turned up more importantly turned off tracking  you can't really use it as powerfully as you want to im and tracking are supported on laconic  so if you wanted jim to for instance follow follow all the conversations on all the different laconic  blogs and at any time they mentioned you respond you could uh using a track and so that's i think  that's very powerful i'm excited about that we're actually there any way to connect a laconic a blog  with twitter so there's a pipe between the two there is a one-way pipe there's a bridge ken  sheperton writes runs a bridge so that if i type on twit army it could go on twitter uh  transparently and automatically we don't want one going the other way and i tell you i think the  reason the thinking behind that is that if you have one going the other way too much you've defeated
