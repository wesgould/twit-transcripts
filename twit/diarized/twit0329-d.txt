Transcript:  I've been doing this experiment while I post the same kind of question or link to  Facebook and Google Plus and Twitter and kind of see what the differences are.  It's been really interesting. It's a really interesting experiment.  I don't know how much longer I'll do it, but Google Plus kind of is less relevant these days.

Start time: 146.40
End time: 151.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really? It used to be very relevant, but I've always seen the most engagement on Facebook, right?

Start time: 152.96
End time: 169.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you get a lot of engagement on Facebook. I think the discussions have a little more depth on Google Plus,  but the problem is it's not a lot of normals there. And it's a lot of techies and geeks and people who get really

Start time: 169.84
End time: 181.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  obsessive about things. I don't care about normals. You care about normals? I work for a newspaper.  I have to care about the normals. That's why Twitter has never catered to the normal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Glad you could be here. So thank you, Dwight, for filling up because this has not been a big  week in news. In fact, Tom Merritt normally does the week ahead for us every week. He said,  there's nothing coming up. It's going to be we're getting into the slow, slow, silly season as we  approach the end of the year. But there have been a few things. I guess the big story was  Chairman Genachowski of the FCC deciding that the AT&T T-Mobile merger wasn't going to make it.  He asked for an administrative hearing, which is essentially the FCC's way of saying,  eh. So AT&T pulled back their FCC application. They said, well, we're going to deal with the  Department of Justice first. They're also investigating, see if we can get it through  there. Maybe we'll go to the FCC. But I think we're getting the hint that this thing may be  off the AT&T T-Mobile merger because AT&T has taken a $4 billion write off. That's the $3 billion  cancellation fee that they owe T-Mobile plus $1 billion in spectrum. I think it's all over.

Start time: 360.62
End time: 422.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dwight, are you shocked? No, I'm not shocked. Well, actually, I'm shocked. I thought the government  would never say no to anything. Yeah. Right. And in this case, they jumped in and said,  but the Justice Department said, well, no, we're going to try to stop this. The FCC's action was  largely administrative, but it would serve at the very least to further delay it.  And I think AT&T has got to see the writing on the wall. What's interesting is there's this other  kind of side story that appeared at the same time that the FCC story did about them offering to sell  off 40% of T-Mobile's assets, as much as that, in order to get it past the Justice Department.  So maybe they're in the process of negotiating with the Justice Department, don't want anything  from the FCC to essentially mess with that deal. And then hoping they can get a settlement out of  the Justice Department instead of a trial and then go back and deal with the FCC.

Start time: 422.28
End time: 430.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that explained it. I couldn't figure out why they withdrew it. So the idea is to let's  figure out if there is a deal here that we can make, that we can get approval, and then we can

Start time: 430.56
End time: 456.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  go back to the FCC. Plus, if they have a settlement with the Justice Department, it makes a lot more  sense for them to then go back to the FCC and say, hey, look, Justice Department approved,  you know, and that helps their case, I think. If the Justice Department is still breathing down  their necks, it doesn't make much sense to deal with the FCC. Do you think that T-Mobile will

Start time: 456.72
End time: 462.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  survive as the number four cell phone company if this thing doesn't go through, Veronica?

Start time: 462.70
End time: 475.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I don't think they'll survive at all. And I'm normally not a big fan of giant mergers like  this, but at this point, there's just not enough spectrum to go around. The government isn't  releasing enough spectrum. And so combining this might be the only thing that gives customers

Start time: 476.76
End time: 493.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  better access and will save T-Mobile in the end. Is it the case that the fear is that if T-Mobile  and AT&T merge, then Sprint is a sitting duck, that's going to go away. And then you'll basically  have two cell carriers in the US, and that's really not competition. I know, I think Sprint

Start time: 493.46
End time: 518.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  could definitely be one of the casualties of this situation if it happens, but they need to kind of  step it up and work on some of their issues as well. And I don't know, it's definitely a huge  situation going on right now. I'm very curious to see how it's going to end up because I mean,  everyone's been having problems with AT&T for years now. And I think that combining the two will  definitely make the situation better for customers. But there is a lot of that monopoly situation

Start time: 518.16
End time: 526.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  going on also. Yeah. Any thoughts, Natalie? Are you a T-Mobile customer? I am. I have a T-Mobile

Start time: 526.70
End time: 552.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  phone. In fact, I just ordered. Go ahead. I do have a lot of empathy for T-Mobile though,  because this has put them in a holding pattern since March. They can't really go out and make  negotiations to get the iPhone, which would be good for them if and when the deal dies. They can't  go to new tablets, new Android phones. They basically are stuck waiting and crossing their  fingers. So, you know, they're kind of hosed. That's, I guess, why the $3 billion cancellation

Start time: 552.96
End time: 558.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  fee to kind of compensate them for... You're right. This is a very horrible waiting period.

Start time: 558.12
End time: 570.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The New York Times points out... The New York Times points out we'll probably not even cover  what their actual losses are. I mean, this is high-end economics. This is an opportunity  cost that you can't even really calculate. It's worth certainly more than $3 billion.

Start time: 572.06
End time: 576.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look, Sprint spent basically $20 billion to get the iPhone. That'll give you some idea of

Start time: 577.52
End time: 591.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  how big a deal not having the iPhone is. Also, T-Mobile has probably put aside a lot of the other  deals and contracts that they could have made in this period in order to work on this deal with  AT&T. So anything that they could have done to improve their situation has been also put on hold.

Start time: 591.56
End time: 611.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. So, Leo, you had suggested and Veronica agreed that T-Mobile can't survive. How does  T-Mobile die? What happens? Do they get absorbed by somebody smaller? Do we see Sprint and T-Mobile  merging? Although that would be awkward technologically. I mean, what's the end

Start time: 611.20
End time: 620.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  game for T-Mobile if this doesn't happen? It could even be bankruptcy, right, Dwight? I mean,  they could actually just go out of business. Well, there's all that spectrum that they have

Start time: 620.88
End time: 624.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that AT&T wants and that certainly is worth something. Well, you have a fire sale.

Start time: 625.22
End time: 629.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. And remember, they're owned by Deutsche Telekom, a big company that is not going out of

Start time: 629.94
End time: 646.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  business. Well, this New York Times article says that if Deutsche Telekom doesn't go... If they  don't go through with this merger, then they're going to see-sol business in the United States  and that they would probably spin off the unit as an independent entity and sell it at a less  attractive price to someone like Sprint, for example, or sell it off in pieces, the little

Start time: 647.04
End time: 667.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  bits and pieces of the company. That could be disinformation aimed at the Department of Justice,  of course, because the reason this merger isn't going through is the department of justice says,  oh, we'll lose these jobs, we'll lose competition. So what you say if you're Deutsche Telekom is  you're going to lose it anyway, you might as well lose it in this way rather than where there's some,  some benefit rather than lose it because we pull out. That's a big thing to pull out of.

Start time: 667.84
End time: 689.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Also regarding the iPhone, isn't there a technological issue regarding the way Apple  is building it that it's not just a matter of taking that chip that they have in it, the GSM  slash CDMA chip in it and tuning it to T-Mobile. Wouldn't they have to have a different chip the

Start time: 689.90
End time: 693.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  way T-Mobile works as I understand it? I do not know that because of the frequencies.

Start time: 693.62
End time: 698.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that it's not that simple. That's why they do it this way. So that may be one reason

Start time: 699.02
End time: 730.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  why they don't have it. I'm actually very curious about the notion that even maybe,  this is really speculative, the idea of cell service is old hat and that we will eventually  just kind of have Wi-Fi everywhere and then anybody can play without even having a carrier  that we all, it's VoIP everywhere. What about that? Is that crazy? That would be great.  I mean, if you're Google or Apple, wouldn't you be interested in that?

Start time: 730.52
End time: 731.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  As in municipal wireless?

Start time: 732.50
End time: 758.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not just muni wireless, partly muni wireless, but there are two companies to my knowledge  that are attempting to put Wi-Fi everywhere using satellite and other weird technologies.  If you had unlicensed internet access everywhere you went, you just use VoIP everywhere. You use  T-Mobile as UMA. You just use that everywhere. That was Steve Jobs' original idea according to

Start time: 759.08
End time: 761.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  story last week. That's what made me think about it.

Start time: 762.86
End time: 796.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Isn't LightSquared one of the companies that's trying to do the...  LightSquared is the one, but they had problems too because their frequencies were infringing on  GPS. There's a lot of technological issues and then of course Google has been trying to get the  fiber thing going in a lot of places and also offer free municipal Wi-Fi in a few different  cities. It's kind of only a matter of time before that gets really kicked off in a lot of ways.  I wish LightSquared would succeed because I think they've got great ideas, but it's unfortunate  about the... They didn't take the whole GPS thing into account when they were developing

Start time: 796.40
End time: 831.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  their technologies. You might be able to move frequencies a little bit. I've heard...  It's so hard to know what's going on technically. I've heard people say,  oh, it isn't a problem. I've heard people say it is a problem. I've heard other companies want to  come along and do something similar. I think that it's very possible that... We just assume,  oh, the cell system is the way it works and it's the way it's going to continue to work.  All of this may be moot. Don't you think companies like Apple and Google would love to just say,  the heck with you phone companies. It's a broken system. It's a broken system.

Start time: 833.36
End time: 864.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's so many issues with the frequencies and the pricing is just gouging customers at this  point. I can't even believe how much you're paying for cell phone service these days. I think it's  going to get to a point where consumers and companies like Google and Apple, for example,  do exactly what you said. Just throw their hands up in the air and say, this isn't working for  anyone at this point except for the telecoms. This isn't working for anyone except for the cell  providers. Then maybe we'll get a change. What was Steve Jobs thinking about, Dwight?

Start time: 865.18
End time: 869.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it feasible? Is it something he could have done? Well, I think he was doing this in 2000,

Start time: 871.16
End time: 898.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  supposedly, according to the story. Before the iPhone came out.  Right. It was before 2007. Of course, Wi-Fi, at that same time, you have to remember also that  was the period where there was a lot of discussion about municipal Wi-Fi on a grand scale. Remember,  EarthLink's attempts to be kind of the big dog in that hunt. They came into Houston and tried to set  up citywide Wi-Fi here and kind of imploded here and otherwise. Well, you know, who's fighting it

Start time: 898.92
End time: 906.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  tooth and nail. Right. Verizon, Sprint, AT&T, and Comcast. Veronica, you mentioned the idea that

Start time: 906.66
End time: 915.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it's broken. But the thing is, is that people are paying these prices. They're buying it.  We love our cell phones. We love our cell phones.

Start time: 915.72
End time: 918.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. But all it's going to take is a better technology to come where we're like,

Start time: 919.04
End time: 945.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  okay, well now we can have this clear call quality. I can't say that. Clear call quality,  have easy access to all our data and make voice calls on the cheap. I mean, I've got at home,  I have a phone that's my house line that runs on Google Voice. And I barely, I don't pay anything  for it. And it's just getting that to the convenience level of using your cell phone  to be the point for where everyone's like, okay, well this is obviously a better situation.

Start time: 945.30
End time: 960.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me get this straight. So you don't have phone service in your house at all?  No. You don't have an AT&T line in your house at all? Wow. And so you use your internet access,  but you don't use Vonage or some specialized VoIP. You just use Google Voice.

Start time: 961.64
End time: 968.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. We have a phone that's Google Voice enabled. This Panasonic phone that we have,  we did a whole segment on it. I think that's the future. I think that's the future.

Start time: 969.22
End time: 972.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The downside is it doesn't have 911. Well, and if the power goes out or the

Start time: 972.86
End time: 977.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  internet goes out, you're screwed. Yeah. And your cell phone. But you're making allowances.

Start time: 978.68
End time: 997.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Your cell phone is a backup, right? Right. Correct.  I think this is really like cord cutting for TV. It's the same thing. This is what people want to  do. And this is directly in response to overpriced crappy service from the phone companies and the  cable companies. Of course you can't kill both because you need your internet access from

Start time: 997.06
End time: 1001.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  somebody. What makes you think that Wi-Fi would not have these same problems structurally?

Start time: 1002.80
End time: 1020.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, Wi-Fi has a lot of issues technologically. It's hard to be ubiquitous. It has a lot of  interference issues. Wi-Fi's technology would have to change dramatically in order for it to  be robust enough to serve in the way on a grand scale that Veronica is referring to.

Start time: 1023.50
End time: 1028.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Walls are in the way. You can't have that. I mean, I don't get cell phone service in my house

Start time: 1028.96
End time: 1061.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  either. I have to have a freaking micro cell in my house in order to make phone calls on my cell  phone. So we're already making allowances to get this kind of stuff to work in our homes.  I don't see why just adding a couple of routers in your home anyway is going to make that much  of a difference. Plus broadband is becoming so much more easily accessible for people all over  the country. It can be provided by things like fiber. You just have to open the pipes a little  bit and you can get a lot more access. I don't know. It seems like a much more viable future  option than working with what the telecom providers are giving us now.

Start time: 1062.58
End time: 1063.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we're going to take a break.

Start time: 1063.52
End time: 1077.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  For a while I thought that WiMAX would really be the solution and would just leapfrog Wi-Fi  because Wi-Fi is the weaker of the two, but that is also controlled by the mobile carrier.  So it would just be structurally the same problem.

Start time: 1078.26

Transcript:  They're going to fight like hell to keep this from happening.  We're going to take a break. Natalie Morris is here from CNBC. I like saying that.  Great to have you. Veronica Belmont from Tekzilla, Dwight Silverman from Houston's Chronicle.  Did you see this story about the Chinese kid who couldn't afford an iPad? So he got all the pieces  and he built a $145 iPad for his girlfriend. Touchscreen, battery, cobbled together parts  from an old laptop. It's running Windows 7, but it looks a little bit like an iPad. It even has  the Apple logo on it. Well, we have viewers who are equally intrepid. They wanted an iPad.  They didn't have to build it from parts. They tweeted. And thanks to GoToMyPC, we have a winner.  I'm going to tell you about this in just a second. But let me first tell you about GoToMyPC.  With the holidays here, lots of travel ahead, bad weather, sick days. You don't want to be in the  office. Last place you want to be, but you might need to still get work done. That's where GoToMyPC  is so cool. I love this offer, this 45-day free offer. That's longer than we've ever offered before.  Right now is a perfect time. You can sign up now and get right through into 2012 with GoToMyPC.  What does it do? You put it on your office computer, Mac or PC, doesn't matter. Very easy  to install. You don't need help from the IT department or anything. It takes you 30 seconds  to download. GoToMyPC.com. I'll tell you the offer codes so you can get it free in a second.  And then wherever you go, you can access that computer. You can send and receive  e-mail, run any programs, access any network. Just like you're there, even on an iPad.  And the iPad app is free. This is really, really cool. Of course, you can do it with a laptop.  There's a lot of devices you can use to access your office anytime you need to.  It's just a click away. Now, for the holidays, we've got an extended offer, 45 days free.  All you do is go to the website, GoToMyPC.com, and the offer code is TWIT.  So click that try it free button and use the offer code TWIT and you'll get it free for 45 days.  Now, I have our wiener. So two weeks ago, we said we had our away for the holidays giveaway,  a free iPad 2 to somebody. We asked people to tweet us, tell us where they're going for the  holidays. Polly Alita said, with an iPad 2 and GoToMyPC, she could work while basking in the  glow of the Christmas tree. Conrad Ferugia said he would be able to work remotely while visiting  his sister in Detroit. Santivi Santiago Vargas said he would work from the iPad 2 while sharing  the holidays with his family. Newfers said his computer is downstairs, his iPad 2 would be  upstairs and he wouldn't have to go up and down the stairs. But none of them won. The winner,  it was randomly selected by our friends at GoToMyPC from all of the tweets received.  Are you ready? I love her handle. Cougars 1969. Perhaps her high school football team.

Two minutes before it opened, a mother of two  used a can of pepper spray to attack other shoppers waiting in line. She was trying to get the $100  discounted price on an Xbox 360. She had her children with her. She began spraying customers  as soon as the store employees started pulling back the packing plastic off the discounted items.  Once the doors opened, the woman also used the pepper spray to gain a favorable position.  Disgusting. Somebody tweeted during this. Of course, it was on Twitter, right?  People are screaming. The LAPD and firefighters responded, treated 20 injured customers.  The woman fled the store unclear whether she got the Xbox.

Transcript:  This is unbelievable. They did a whole video about the music of Skyrim and there's the words that  they sing in the Skyrim theme are actually words in the language that they've created.  It's in the dragon language, it's being sung by these monks and it was like 30 guys and they  multiplied it by three. So it sounds like 90 guys. And it's just an unbelievable amount of work that  they put into the audio and into the soundtrack. And it's definitely one of the most ambitious  games that's been created in the past 10 years. Although I, you know, as good as it looks and as  good as it feels, it doesn't seem that different to me, even with the new creation engine,  then like Fallout New Vegas or Fallout 3. It's very Fallout like, it's very, because it seems  more like Fallout 3 to me almost than Oblivion in a lot of ways, especially with the, like the  critical kills and the little things they do for that, the close-up shots during the kills. It's  very, very, slow motion acting. They improved all the NPC voice acting and close-up shots. So I

In fact, right at the beginning,  and I know they do this on purpose right at the beginning, the one of the guards is that guy from  Battlestar Galactica. Yeah, Ty, Colonel Ty.

So it's not a high bar to, I don't know, the voice acting in Fallout  New Vegas, Old World Blues was pretty good. You play far more games than I do, but I just have to  say the depth of this game and how gorgeous it is really makes me think the video games have come of  age as a creative pursuit. They're an art form. Absolutely. They're absolutely an art form.

Transcript:  Veronica, a question about voice acting, because you've done some. Why do you think voice acting  in games is just usually really bad? I mean, why should it be different from say,

Start time: 1775.48
End time: 1852.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  cartoons? I think the main reason is one, because they, until recently, they haven't hired a good  number of voice actors for each game. So it's usually been a handful of actors doing multiple  parts. So I think in Oblivion, for example, they had, there were like- 60. I think they said 60  voice actors. No, I think actually in Skyrim there were 70 voice actors, but there were like- I don't  know about Oblivion. Twice that many parts, or maybe three times that many parts. So it worked out  better than it did in Oblivion, where there were fewer voice actors for more parts. So now they're  getting a lot more, they're getting a lot more, what's the word? A lot of different voice actors.  Variety. Variety. Thank you. I couldn't think of that word for some reason. Variety. There's  a lot more variety. They have a little more time to get it all done. Usually games are a lot more  rushed. They're not doing that quick cycle that they used to in a lot of, like they've been working  on this game for many, many years now. So they've had a little bit more time to kind of really  fine tune the voice acting and the sound creation that they've done. There was another reason too. I  mean, also voice acting looks bad because the AI and the lip sync with the characters never looked  as good as it does now. So there's a lot of reasons, both technologically and economically,

Start time: 1852.86
End time: 1881.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that this is getting easier and better. Radio acting used to be, remember Dwight when radio  acting used to be really bad. It was very broad. And I think that that's a sign of a new medium  a little bit. And I think voice acting is tough. Cartoon is a little different because it's a  character voice. I don't know. I think it's a hard thing to do. Well, the same thing happens

Start time: 1881.80
End time: 1900.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  in cartoon acting. You have one person doing multiple roles. I agree. But I think Veronica's  right. I think it's rushed and it's quick. And my suspicion is that in the past it's been, oh,  this is just a game and I don't have to bring my full game to the game. And I think now people

Start time: 1901.96
End time: 1921.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  are taking it more seriously. The level of immersion too. I mean, people expect to be fully  immersed in these virtual worlds at this point. And so to have bad voice acting, it really takes  you out of that moment in a lot of ways. If you want it to be realistic, you want the voice acting  to look right, to sound right, to feel like you're having a conversation with an actual person as

Start time: 1922.02
End time: 1952.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  opposed to just kind of set dialogue. I don't want to get into a big long discussion of video games.  We will move on in a second, but I can't help it. One of the things that's changing this,  in Oblivion, and this has to do with the voice acting, when you talk to an NPC, a non-player  character, it would kind of zoom in and you couldn't move around, look around. You had to watch  them. Now in this game, it's kind of wild. You can look around and you can even walk away and  they'll still talk and they'll drift off in the background as you walk away from them, which is

Start time: 1953.83
End time: 1958.10

Start time: 1958.24
End time: 2012.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you walk away and they see you later and they keep talking. It's pretty funny. And I think that  so it's things like that that make it feel like a more realistic experience. So even if the voice  acting isn't better, which I think it is, but even that it's just a more realistic overall experience  that helps that I think a little bit. You don't have, you're not like focused in on the person  and all that. Game on, premiering January 15th. Yeah, please. This is where we'll discuss all that  stuff. But I think it's actually a news story. First of all, because it came out at the same time  as Modern Warfare 3. So it was up against the biggest franchise in gaming, which in the first  24 hours sold 400 million dollars worth of units. I mean, it was huge. It's going to be a billion  dollar game. And I think Skyrim, although hotly awaited and everybody had high expectations for  it, kind of stole Modern Warfare's thunder a little bit here. It may be different audiences too.

Start time: 2014.10
End time: 2033.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I definitely know people who like at my house, for example, Ryan's been spending almost as much  time playing Modern Warfare as I've been playing Skyrim. So it just goes to show, you know, if  you're passionate about a game, you're going to put that effort into it. So I think that there is  overlap for sure, but they are definitely different markets. I'm just very intrigued by

Start time: 2034.46

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the artistry, the obvious clear talent in story, in art, in acting that goes into a game, in music  that goes into a game like this is really mind boggling. These are absolutely art forms. And I'm  very excited as the technology advances. The problem is they're using now relatively ancient  hardware on the Xbox and PlayStation through what is a five years old now, hardware on these  things. And although I have to say the PC version is not to me much different than the Xbox,  or I haven't seen the PlayStation for three version, but they're very similar. The reason  people ask me, why do you like the Xbox better? And I've been playing it on both. I like to just  watch it on a 15 inch display or 16 inch display with my feet up. That's all.

It is a very, and I'm sure there's true  modern warfare through many games nowadays, really are emotional, which is I think a testament to the  realism that's going into these games. And if it's in a dark room on a big screen,  it's your heart really can really pound on these things. And it's very exciting.  I have a cave. It's called a barrow. Anyway, it's my ghost cave online spending on Black Friday up  by 24.3% over last year. Online Thanksgiving Day was the big day was up 39.3%. I guess because  started their deals early. Amazon's been offering deals all week long. Amazon Wireless, for instance,  offering cell phones for a penny, everything but the iPhone for a penny. So I think if you if you  why wait in line, go online and buy, then no clerks will be discomfited.  I'll talk about a Baker. No pepper spray. We'll talk about pepper spray. Know your meme.  And a Baker who's very sorry she did a Groupon deal in just a moment. But right now I want to  talk about Epson. These are my I was really happy when Epson said we were thinking about doing some  advertising on Twitter. I said, let me tell you something. I have been I even made a video. I have  been I just want to give you a tour of my house and my and my studio Epson's everywhere the printers  for photo printers. I use the big carriage 14 by nine inch, 14 by 19 inch Epson, beautiful photo  printers. I've used the Epson artisan at home for years. Epson projectors for business and the big  movie projectors. I love Epson. And they've got a great printer now. And they I was just thrilled  to be able to talk about it. And now but I have to question their strategy on this. They want to  sell this printer for the holidays. The idea is that you will okay, you've got I'm going to read  you this. Most of us have tech gadgets on our shopping list to give friends, family and co  workers plus new gadgets for our businesses. What do you have? Do you have a shopping list for your  business? I guess you know what? That is true. It's not the holidays it's doing. It's the fiscal  year you want to spend this. So you get the tax credit next year. Maybe that's what it is. So if  you are if you are spending for the holidays on your business, this is the printer you want. It's  the Epson workforce pro. We got one for the office. Lisa immediately stole it. She's got it. And I  liked it so much. I've actually gone out and I bought one for my house. And I'll tell you why.  We had it we as I said, we had an artisan but the kids print a lot. You know, when you're in school,  you print a lot. And I really needed something that had a big paper reservoir had a big ink  reservoir but mostly that could cut the costs of printing down. And this is an amazing printer,  the workforce pro 4530. First of all, double sided, which makes things look better. It looks  more professional looks like a book. There's printing on both sides and it saves paper.  It's the fastest automatic double sided printing anywhere, copying, scanning and faxing to I use  it for the fax machine occasionally you still need to send faxes. It has a it comes with standard  a paper an extra paper tray for 580 sheets more than a ream of paper. The cartridges are very big.  In fact, the black and white cartridge goes for 2500 pages. That's unheard of. And as a result,  it is 50% less per page than a color laser. These these guys have made an amazing printer.  This is for your office. Before you look at any other printer, I want you to go to the Epson  workforce pro you go to Epson.com and take a look at it. It is an amazing fantastic printer. And I'm  a huge fan. And obviously so is Lisa because she immediately took ours and put it in her office  four pages in 19 seconds 50% less expensive double on the ink. Plus, of course, you'll save  on paper two with double sided printing half the cost. It's easy to use controls. It's wi fi  and ethernet. Look at the size of those cartridges. And if there if you need one more thing,  it prints from your iOS devices automatically don't need any extra software. You just select  print, choose the printer. It's there on the wi fi network. It will print to it just like that.  The Epson workforce pro check it out at Epson.com when they said, would you do an ad for Epson? I  said, Well, I do an ad for Epson. I might I Yes. I've been using Epson forever and ever and I'm so  happy to have them on the show. Thank you Epson and happy holidays. And yes, buy your business  a printer for Christmas. Does that make sense? It's a every business needs a Christmas gift.  Actually, Veronica, I guess we should get one for these guys too. We've been we've been thinking  about our host gifts. Welcome to the twit family. Thank you. Every year we give a host  kiss. You missed the phases last year we gave everybody phases. This year and get a fair what  I did not need a fair way. Well, it was kind of the staff host.

A lot of retailers say well we do a Groupon deal and we get a lot  of customers from the deal but they never come back. Others say no this is great. It's been the  best way and I think a lot of it has to do with not only the product but how you do it. So um  there's a baker named Rachel Brown. She owns a small bakery. This might have been her mistake  called Need a Cake Bakery and there she is. Oh she's so sweet. She says she did a Groupon  deal where it was like 75% off and I don't know what she thought.

It's my understanding that you're supposed to be able  to set sales limits when you work with Groupon and Groupon should have some responsibility  to make businesses aware of this kind of thing that can happen when you sign up because it doesn't  make them look good at the end of the day when orders can't be fulfilled and when customers are  mad that the quality they're expecting isn't on par with what they're ordering because if she's  has to hire outside contracts to help make these cupcakes and they're not as good as what  she normally makes in her shop then everyone is losing. Groupon looks bad, she's looking bad,  customers aren't getting what they wanted and paid for. It's just a bad deal all around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  big issue here where she said these people have never been trained by me. They don't know the  recipe. They don't know how to decorate my cupcakes the way I normally do. So even if  she would have otherwise been gaining repeat businesses maybe the cupcakes were not quite  as delicious because they were not the normal cupcakes. 102,000 cupcakes. So she's not even  really going to get any kind of loyal customers unless the new people made good cupcakes. But

Transcript:  Right. He probably did a Groupon deal. Craig Mundy of Microsoft, he's their chief research  and strategy officer, said, eh, Siri, no big deal. We've been doing it for years on the  Windows Phone with TellMe. It's actually very funny. An Australian blogger did a video where  he actually talked to both his Windows Phone and his Siri Phone at the same time and it was almost  comical. What a lousy job the Windows Phone did. But I want to say it was also unfair because there  are things the Windows Phone will do that Siri won't do. You can launch an application with  Windows Phone. That drives me crazy. Yeah. So it's not really fair. There's different commands.

Start time: 2917.76
End time: 2957.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Dragon Go will do things that Siri won't. You can get it to launch a third party application.  And it's just as smart, right? Because it's the same recognition engine. It doesn't have kind of  the context that Siri has, which is what makes Siri cool, but it does a lot of things that Siri  won't do. So if you have a 4S and you have Dragon Go, you can get Dragon Go to launch, for example,  the Yelp application and find stuff in the Yelp application for you. So I've been using that on  my iPhone 4 and feeling almost smug that I don't have an iPhone for it. This is pretty impressive.

Transcript:  I think though that this is, you know, initially my thought with Siri was, well, this sounds like  FaceTime where it's something cool, demo's cool, nobody's going to use it. I'm starting to think  that this is actually the revolution in user interface that we've been waiting for. And  if every phone doesn't have this in a year, it's going to be a big deal. You've got to have this.  So Greg Monday, pay attention and beef up, tell me, because it's got to be as good.  I use Siri all the time and I'll have to try this great drag and go.  I think it's really surprisingly good, surprisingly interested.  The lack of application launching.  4S. Yeah, it should, it should launch apps. That's crazy. And Apple, the Apple's a little  conservative on this stuff. And the other problem Apple's having, which is a big time problem is  that because it's on every iPhone 4S, their servers are down all the time.

Start time: 3026.96

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  It's true. And you know, I feel like the onus is on me a lot of times to remember what Siri can and  can't do. So when I try and get her to play my voicemails and she says, I'm sorry, I don't do  voicemails. I'm like, well, but you do text messages. Why should I have to remember that? Those  are the little things that bug me about her. I think Siri will get you more useful, but you  never know with Apple. They're, they're, they're very strange company and sometimes they don't

You're tearing and doing this here.

But I prefer Nameberry and also the SSA, the Social Security Administration has an app  that I sometimes look through where you can save names.  And sometimes, you know, on some of these sites, you can make lists  and then send them out to your friends and family so that they can vote on it  as if it's a democracy.  But I never do that because I don't really care what other people think of my name.

Put it to take it off the list.  So I'm not sure it's good to look up this stuff.  The lead in this article by Alan Salkin in the New York Times,  Kalia is a stripper name when spelled with an I,  but Kalia spelled with an EY is not, according to her parents.  They searched Google for K-A-L-I-A and they found a bunch of scantily clad women.  So they decided to spell it differently.  How do you like that?  I guess that makes sense.  The problem is the times change.  When we named Henry Henry, nobody was named Henry.  And now there's four or five kids.  He knows he has to be Hank because they're all named Henry.

Transcript:  My advice, blame Clayton.  That's what my wife would do.  She blames Clayton all the time.  Andrew Sorkin says, yes, I was pitched to write a Steve Jobs bio-pick.  Of course, a lot of speculation.  Sony, I think, bought the rights to the Isaacson biography of Steve Jobs.  And he talked to E! Online this week and said,  Sony asked him to write the movie and he's considering it.  I hope he does because he wrote the Facebook movie  and he did such a job of getting it exactly right.  Are you being sarcastic?  I am being a little sarcastic.  Sorkin, it's very-  Made it entertaining.  Yes, but it's pretty obvious that Sorkin does not like geeks.  He's always, in all of his shows,  he's written about bloggers in their jammies in the basement.  He just doesn't like the internet, you could tell.  So I'm not sure he is the right guy to write this,  but he is a good writer.

Yeah, Wiley.  And then, of course, for some reason,  Justin Long keeps coming up, maybe because he was in the Switch ads.  But the problem is, and we talked to actually Dana Bernetti  who did bid on this, he was the guy who produces Social Network.  And he said the problem is you got to decide  which Steve Jobs you're playing,  because the book spans from when he was a kid to when he died.  So what age are you going to play?  I mean, Clooney would be great for the older Steve Jobs,  maybe great for the older Steve Jobs,  but how is he going to play the younger?  Maybe you do both.

Transcript:  Wow.  Okay, well that makes sense.  I believe that.  No, the reason I bring it up is that we had a discussion on Mac Break Weekly.  There's this whole revisionist thing going on among really the most hardcore Apple geeks.  John Syracuse, primarily among them, Dave Weiner and other,  complaining about the book saying Walter Isaacson was the worst guy they could have picked  because he was a business writer.  He wasn't a tech writer.  He didn't understand anything that he was writing about.  He focused on the human drama, the anecdotes, but completely muffed all the history and the story  and didn't ask any of the germane questions.  I was thinking, you know what?

Start time: 4133.10
End time: 4160.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was just going to say the human element is actually what made me have to put it down  because I was in, I think, my ninth week of pregnancy and I started to read about the  mothers giving up the biological mom had to give up the baby and the adoptive mom was really  emotionally attached to the baby and I was crying so much.  Hey, spoiler alert.  I was like, I can't read this right now because it was about pregnant mommies and not being  able to conceive and I just had to stop.

Transcript:  You know, regarding Jobs, keep in mind that he went to Isaacson and sought that.  Later, there's the question of why he wanted the book written and it was so his kids would know him.  Given that context, I think the focus on the human is exactly what he had in mind when he picked Isaacson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got a lot out of the book and I heard anecdotes we'd never heard before and so I thought it was  quite good.  Isaacson had an unprecedented access and this is one of the things that irritated both Syracuse  and Whiter.  They said, you know, nobody ever will have this opportunity again.  Why didn't they pick somebody who knew what questions to ask?  But I got to think with hundreds of hours of interviews, if they...  And this is what I want to lobby for.  If Isaacson, and I think if he cares about history, will do this,  would please release those audio interviews at some point.  It doesn't have to be right now.  You know, in a few years to a university or Library of Congress so that other historians  and biographers have access to them so that somebody can write a definitive history of  Apple, somebody else can write a more technical biography of Jobs.  I would...  I think that would be great.  But I have to say, for all its flaws, and there were certainly numerous technical flaws,  all of which Syracuse points out, I thought it was a fascinating book.  I just want them to release the tapes of it.  There is a movie going around, the other Lost...  My dad saw it, of all people, and said it was great.  The Lost Steve Jobs interview.  An interview he did in 1995 that is going...  I'm sure it's in limited release, but it's out there somewhere.  There's a lot of information out there about Jobs.  There's this PBS documentary from 1986 you can actually watch online.  I think that...  I think we're going to get many biographies of Jobs.  There will be something for everybody.  I think this is a great biography for people who are not geeks, but kind of are...  I think it painted a very accurate picture, both good and bad, of who Jobs was.  And I think that's enough for now.  And I'm sure we'll see even more down the road.  I loved it.  Did you read it, Dwight?

Transcript:  We interviewed Dan Kocke, who was Steve Jobs' roommate at Reed, on triangulation.  And he talked a little bit about that stare.  Because Steve perfected it while he was there.  And so Dan was kind of the early subject of it.  And he said...  You and I are roughly the same age.  We both are children of the 70s.  And this was very much that era.  He said the stare is all about...  You have a left brain and a right brain, a left eye and a right eye.  You want the left eye to look into the right eye to query the right brain.  Then the right eye to look into the left eye to query the right brain.  And then vice versa.  And that way you get a full picture of the...  So all this stare...  And you go cross-eyed.  You think that Steve's doing the intimidation stare.  He's just trying to figure out what's going on in the brain there.  I believe that.  They were hippies.  Yes.  William Shatner.

But I have a reason.  I had to get one so I could review it.  But still, I stood in line.  And it was kind of a nice experience.  It's an interesting experience.  But the question, is it offensive?

I like that ad.  I do feel like it was attacking the users,  not the phone, which is unusual.  Even Apple, when it did the Switch campaign,  didn't attack PC users.  I mean, in fact, John Hodgman was kind of sweet.  But he wasn't a user.  He was a PC.

Transcript:  Let's move on.  We're going to take a break.  When we come back, the meme that will not stop the pepper spray cop.  But first, audible.com.  I'd like to talk about audiobooks.  See, now Veronica is a big audiobook user  because she does not have time.  She would like to read all the books that she reads,  but she doesn't have time.  So she supplements her paper consumption with audio consumption.  So when you're in the car at the gym, cleaning house, doing the laundry,  audible.com is there.  And I'll tell you, that's the only time I get to read because, you know,  I got the Isaac Sagan book in hardcover.  I got it on a Kindle and I ended up audible  was the only way I could get through the whole thing.  And I have to say that's really the key  because you'll listen all the time and you can get through books and it's amazing.  They, of course, have that book at audible.com and you can have it free.  In fact, I'm going to set you up for two books.  How about that?  Go to audible.com slash twit to the number two  and you can sign up for the platinum account.  That's two books a month.  First month's free.  First two books are free.  Cancel at any time.  The books are always yours to keep.  Bill Maher, I see, has a new book with a profane title.  I won't be mentioning.  What are you reading?  What are you reading for Sword and Laser?

Start time: 5036.70
End time: 5044.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right now we're reading Elantris by Brandon Sanderson  and also our supplementary book is 1Q84 by Murakami.  I'm reading that.  Which I'm listening to on audible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

End time: 5055.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I downloaded it already.  What do you think?  Is it good?

Start time: 5056.21
End time: 5073.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's good.  Yeah, it's starting out a little bit slow.  I'm looking forward to it getting a little more sci-fi,  a little more weird because I know that's coming within the next few chapters.  So I just need more time to listen.  I haven't been driving as much.  I need to get up to Petaluma more often so I can get my audible time in.

Start time: 5075.73
End time: 5098.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.  You need a job where you have to commute a lot.  This is absolutely a recommendation.  In fact, I told Brian Brushwood was looking for his next audible book  and I said, Brian, everybody's raving about this.  It was a huge hit in Japan.  The other one I'm reading is the one I'm reading right now.  This will be next is Reamdee, which is Neal Stephenson's book.  I don't know if you've read that or not.

Start time: 5098.42
End time: 5099.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Start time: 5099.78
End time: 5105.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I'm a little, I think he didn't write this.  It doesn't feel like a Neal Stephenson book to me.

Start time: 5106.82
End time: 5143.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It feels like a Neal Stephenson book.  It's just definitely more of a techno thriller as opposed to what we're used to.  I loved Anathem.  For example, I loved Kryptonomicon.  I love Kryptonomicon.  Yeah.  Or even like Snow Crash.  That's kind of the entry level, typical entry level Stephenson book  that people read, even though it's an amazing classic.  This is definitely, like I said, a little more accessible to people  who maybe don't want something quite so, you know, sci-fi fantasy driven.  But it's really great.  And if you like video games and if you like action thriller kinds of books,  it's got a lot of great elements that geeky people would love to read in a book like this.

Start time: 5143.40
End time: 5147.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kind of reminded me of like Daniel Suarez, Daemon Meets the DaVinci Code.

Start time: 5148.56
End time: 5180.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, God, Daemon is such a great book.  I love Daemon.  We interviewed him for Sword and Laser and he's just super smart.  And Freedom TM, which was the follow up in that series.  But yeah, I mean, all the jargon that Neil Stephenson uses as always is dead on.  I mean, he's speaking.  If you weren't a geek like us, you wouldn't understand some of the things that they go,  that they talk about in the books because he doesn't explain them.  Right.  He just expects that he's speaking to an informed audience on the subject matter.  So it's kind of cool in that way.

Start time: 5180.72
End time: 5183.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then I also got a lot of books.  Ready Player One.

Start time: 5185.07

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Also excellent.

Start time: 5185.66
End time: 5203.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know you recommended that.  So here's the problem.  There's so many great books on Audible.  It's hard to choose just two, but you only get two for your first month free.  Audible.com slash twit two.  If you got Ream D and one Q84, you'd have like 90 hours.  You'd never have to read again.

Start time: 5203.24
End time: 5214.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You'd never have another book.  Ready Player One is a good one because it's definitely bite size.  It's narrated by Will Wheaton and it's super enjoyable to listen to,  but it's only like a two parter.  It's not that long.

Start time: 5215.14
End time: 5220.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the reason, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think Sword and Laser came from an offhand comment of mine.

Start time: 5222.60
End time: 5224.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You would like to think that, wouldn't you?

Start time: 5224.34
End time: 5232.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because I would think we were doing an Audible ad and I was talking about  we should do a sci-fi book club and I think you and Tom were there.

Start time: 5233.08
End time: 5245.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I actually, I did.  I had to go back to those early emails because we were filing our LLC for the company for Sword and Laser  and I was like, yeah, we talked about this with Leo way back in the day, but you were just too busy.  I couldn't do it.  You could have been in on the ground floor, Leo.

Start time: 5246.01
End time: 5265.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know.  I regret that now, bitterly, and I know big things are happening for Sword and Laser,  but I'll let you tell the story when it happens.  Meanwhile, Audible.com slash twit two.  Even if you are, I mean, you should listen to Sword and Laser and I think you guys do a very good job  of picking books that are almost always on Audible.  I don't know if you do that on purpose.

Start time: 5266.70
End time: 5275.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_00

And so he goes from room to room and does a history of why we have desks and tables and chairs.  It's Bill Bryson.  Hallway.  Yeah.  Oh, I love him.  It's really good.  That sounds cool.

A walk in the woods, which is his talk about a book about writing and walking down the  Appalachian trail.  I mean, this, this guy is one of my favorite writers.  So I can't wait.  I didn't even know about this.  Just came out last month.  Thank you, Natalie.  You are welcome.  audible.com slash twit two.  You're going to see right way why two books is not enough.  You need more.  You need more.  So let's move along to pepper spray guy who has become this is, you know, it's, it's really,  I was talking about this at Thanksgiving.  Isn't that where you have, is it unusual to have political conversations at the,  at the Thanksgiving table?  It seems to me that happens every year because we have some very conservatives in our family  and I'm a very liberal and we, we have very good conversations at the Thanksgiving.  And we were talking about Occupy Wall Street.  And one of the things that has, it's been an interesting social event, media event, right?  But one of the things that's held it back is this lack of cohesiveness.  And every once in a while, something happens in the world that co that everything congeals.  And I think this pepper spray guy became the story and in ways that he did not realize  this university of California Davis police officer did more for Occupy Wall Street than  anybody else ever.  And you're seeing these pictures on the internet everywhere.  Here he is spraying God in the eyes as he tries to animate Adam in that famous Michelangelo.

Transcript:  Let's see.  Moving.  I just want to make sure we get all of the big stories.  Anything we've missed?  Spotify.  We're trying to figure out what to do November 30th, which is Wednesday.  Spotify has apparently an event coming Wednesday, which they say is a big deal.  But I can't think.  Eileen and I talked about this and she said, well, should we do breaking news?  Neither of us could think of anything that Spotify would announce that would be  like a big deal.  Anybody here have an idea?  I mean, they're already on Facebook, right?  They're already part of Facebook.  What could Spotify be announcing that could be such a big deal?

Start time: 5697.44
End time: 5699.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 5699.42
End time: 5709.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would be a big deal.  That's not what they would do at a press conference.  I like that.  Yeah.  When they pre-announced, right?  Maybe everything's free.  Maybe they're giving it all away.

Transcript:  So we had a good conversation last week and I got a lot of hate mail because of it.  We had Kara Swisher, Mike Elgin, Rafe Needleman and Kevin Rose.  And I was talking about Google Music like, oh, this is exciting.  Google's selling music.  And everybody said, that's too little too late.  The world is Spotify.  No one wants to own music anymore.  And I thought I'd ask you guys because we got comments.  People said that's ridiculous.  That's absurd.  Of course, people want to buy music.  Do streaming services like Spotify, Mog and RDO make it unnecessary to buy music ever again?

Start time: 5754.16
End time: 5754.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Start time: 5755.90
End time: 5766.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  See?  There were numbers released a couple of weeks ago that show that even though it's on the decline,  the majority of music sales are still CD.

Start time: 5766.78
End time: 5771.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's a lagging indicator.  I think that's probably true.  But that's a lagging.  Clearly, CD sales are not...

Start time: 5773.16
End time: 5779.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The projection was often 2015, it wouldn't decline to below 50% until 2015.  See?

Start time: 5779.78
End time: 5796.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, we're not even talking about buying iTunes.  We're talking about buying a physical plastic disc.  CDs.  Yep.  Yep.  I think that's a lagging indicator.  Yeah, they still sell.  I think that's just momentum, inertia.  Don't you?  It doesn't matter why.  It is.  But the future is not right for CDs.

Start time: 5797.86
End time: 5802.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, the future is not right for CDs, but you asked if people are still buying music.  Right.  Yes.

Start time: 5802.86

Start time: 5808.38
End time: 5823.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I know.  I don't really buy music anymore either if I have a Spotify membership.  Although my husband Clayton decided that he wanted to cancel his Spotify account  because iCloud came out because he has a massive library.  So he thought, well, I could just play my own music.

Start time: 5823.46
End time: 5824.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tell me how that works out for him, will you?

Start time: 5825.44
End time: 5830.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know.  It made sense to him and he thinks it's a great solution, but I kept my Spotify account.

Start time: 5830.74
End time: 5834.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because he'd already bought everything he ever wanted to listen to for the rest of his life.

Start time: 5834.49
End time: 5858.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  As if, yeah, I don't know.  And then he decided and then he can buy a la carte.  I don't know.  That's his solution.  There is an issue.  You know, and I thought that Spotify would make me a lot cooler and I would  maybe find a lot more music.  It really doesn't.  No, you listen to the same old crap.  Yeah.  So I would use that argument to say I'm still going to listen to the same crap,  although his library is much cooler than mine.  I have a lot of shits.

Start time: 5869.94
End time: 5889.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, it's interesting because there is a debate over,  it seems clear that Spotify does not make money for the musicians.  You get very small payments from any of these streaming services.  And I said that last week, the panel said, well, they should all tour.  That's how you make money nowadays anyway.  But then there's some dispute over that.  I think that actually musicians do make some money on Spotify.  It's certainly a good discovery.

Start time: 5890.48
End time: 5924.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I use Spotify to sample things that I've heard that are good.  I go, I'll listen to a whole album.  And then if I like it, I buy it because I actually want to own the bits.  Why?  That's what I want to know.  Why?  I don't, you know, I don't trust Spotify to be there next week.  So then you'll subscribe to Ardia.  I like, I like the, you know, I don't need it.  I don't need a CD, but I like having it stored like on my home server  and being able to stream it through all my devices.  And I know with that format, I could do that.  And I, and I like that.

That's true about the iPad today is that you still have people  who are kind of traditional computer users who poo poo it.  And until they get one and then they have one and they go, oh, yeah, I get it.  And I think that that's really true about that kind of device is that you actually have to  lay hands on it to get it.
