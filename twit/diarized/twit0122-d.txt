Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It was pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John acted.  I think I'm going to make it a sidelight now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to do weddings.  Anyone who wants me to marry him, 3,500 bucks flat fee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's good.  Good fun doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've done it too?  Yeah.  We're all reverence here in the Universal Life Church.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm actually in the World Christianship Ministries, back of the Weekly World News.  Christianship?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not sure what that means.  Adam Curry's married 70.  He has?  Yeah, one time at 50 at once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, see if Adam wants to be on the show.  Then it could be all ministers.  We could do a holy twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My guess is that all of our guests, if we really look into it, are ministers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In some crazy made up church or other.  So now that Weekly World News is defunct, Tom, have you lost your ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I just responded to an ad in the back of the Weekly World News.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It wasn't the Weekly World News' church.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no.  The Fresno, California organization, I assume, is still around.  I have no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that's where mine is too, is Fresno.  I think it's because California has ...  It's probably the same.  They just have different brand names.  Yeah, exactly.  I like Christianship.  There's something about that.  It sounds like the captain of something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly.  The Christianship.  It's kind of a nautical air to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't even know why we're doing a show today.  There's really nothing happened this week.  It's kind of been a dull week for a tech ... For those of you watching on Ustream, here's  my ... People don't believe me.  I'm holding up my diploma from the Universal Life Church, so they know.  I'm glad you keep it handy.  Oh, you never know.  When it might come ... I've only married one, and that was on the screensavers.  That's why I did it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I've only married one myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John, how many have you married?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's it, one.  But I intend to up the ante.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Holy twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Veronica Belmont has said if she ever got married that I could perform it, but I've had people  say that to me before, and then when it comes down to it, mom objects or something happens.  I don't blame them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're not going to have that dweeb, Mary.  What are you talking about?  You're going to have a real minister with a real collar.  A guy who actually believes.  A believer.  That's a collar.  Yeah, you could have a collar.  So the Kindle is out tomorrow.  Has anybody seen the Kindle yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've not got my hands on one.  Have you, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I think it's going to be a disaster.  It looks really stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No backlight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the Sony doesn't have a backlight either.  I think a lot of these E-Ink guys don't have a backlight because you want to have a lot  of battery life.  That might can live with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, sure.  But doesn't it have an extended exterior light or something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you have a built-in light that can ... a little reading light on an arm.  But the Sony, when you buy the Sony, it's kind of the same thing.  You have to pay for it.  That's a attachment.  And it's just one of those LED lights that you'd buy like a book light.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sony's is?  I'm surprised Sony's isn't a proprietary bulb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's a special battery, a Sony battery.  So the Kindle looks like a keyboard.  I've only seen pictures on Engadget in places.  It looks like it has a keyboard.  I don't know.  What?  You don't know?  You haven't seen the pictures?  No.  Bezos ... I mean, look, if anybody could make money in e-books ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know what you're talking about, the little keypad down there at the bottom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know why it has all those buttons.  All you really need is a next page, previous page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you can write the great American novel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah, it's a book and a word processor.  The thing that they have, the advantage they have apparently has wireless networking in  it, which means that you can download and buy books from the Kindle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, and don't they have some deal with a particular provider or something, I thought  I read?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're going to do Kindle editions of many newspapers.  They have a New York Times edition.  I think they want to do a Wall Street Journal and Washington Post.  I don't know if they've made the deals yet.  That would make it useful if you could automatically get your newspapers for you in the morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, the W hotels are apparently going to be doing a deal where you could get your newspaper  on a rented Kindle while you're staying at the hotel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can anybody ... Here's the problem I'm having.  It's too expensive.  400 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're all too expensive.  Sony's only 300.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but you can't put 100 paperback books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not going to read 100 paperback books at once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I might listen to a thousand songs over the course of a couple months, but I'm not going  to read a thousand books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It'll have built-in Sprint EVDO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know Leo reads faster than I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but I was kind of a big fan.  I had the Sony eBook reader.  I thought, oh, this is great.  I did.  I put a ton of books on there.  I put all these trilogies.  Did you read them?  I haven't finished a story.  I put Neil Stephenson's Quicksilver Trilogy, which I have never managed yet to read.  Extremely long.  I keep trying to read it.  Guy wrote it in Ballpoint or Fountain Pen, I think.  The Quill.  Maybe he used a Quill.  I don't know.  Anyway, you can go to the Science Fiction Museum and you can see the manuscript pages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He was on the Cranky Geeks.  He is a Cranky Geek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, he's not, actually.  He's not?  Why is he writing longhand?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love that book, though.  He's one of those guys who thinks it's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It takes a lot of hundreds of thousands of words to prove you're cool.  Imagine the writer's cramp.  You like that book?  I tried to read it, Tom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I liked the whole series.  Yeah, I loved it.  I got sucked in and read the whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's bizarre.  It's the geeks of the Newtonian era.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's just way cool to me because of that.  Taking that geeky cryptonomicon sense and transplanting it to the 1600s and doing a  fair job.  I'm sure it's a little bit modernized, but he does a fair job of trying to stay true  to what was going on in those times and trying to unveil some of the things that you wouldn't  realize were going on at those times, especially when you've got the guy going about France  trying to get away from the mobs of people who just live out in the sticks because there's  no social program.  Instead of a homeless situation, they get just sent out in the country and they live  out in the trees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to try again.  But the point was I put all these trilogies on there thinking, now I have 100 books on  this thing and I left it on the airplane.  Which if you have a paperback book, I've done that before with a paperback book, no deal,  but left it on the airplane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I haven't actually heard that story before, Leo, and I think it's actually telling because  that is the point.  And if everything is 400 bucks, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I've left so many books there and I didn't care because I just buy another copy or maybe  I didn't like the book that much to begin with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not sure yet if we need a separate device for this.  While everything else is merging into one, I think we want to be able to read books on  whatever device we've got, not buy a separate one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree with that, Tom, and I think there should be some universal kind of software  I don't want to say it's PDFs, but it should be something like that.  So you can just read, these devices should be neutral, they should be software neutral.  And the fact of the matter is the way the book is actually made, a real book, like a  real paperback book, this is not a device that's broken, that needs to be fixed by this  solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  True.  It's a solution looking for a problem.  Well we'll see.  I think the idea of having wireless so that you can get your newspaper and it's there,  I have to say, I mean looking at the pictures, who knows what it will really look like, but  looking at the early release pictures, see you could do that with a piece of paper, you  can't do that with a Kindle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sounds like you're crumpling up an e-book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't do that with a Kindle.  But it looks like the same kind of greenish low contrast screen that Sony has.  I want paper white.  Now the iPhone you can read books on, and that's actually pretty legible, but you don't  have the same kind of battery.  Yeah, I'd rather read on an iPhone.  Yeah, you don't have the same kind of battery life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've read a book, I read the great Gatsby on a PDA on a tungsten E, and it was fine.  You know what I liked about it is I didn't get a hand cramp from holding the book open  like a paperback.  You just press a little button to scroll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The rich are not like you and me.  They use electronic readers to read their books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey Tom, get one of those balls and start squeezing it.  Maybe they'll keep that hand cramp.  What are you doing with your muscle structure that you're getting a hand cramp?  It's heavy.  The book is heavy.  Please.  My hand's not used to holding books open, it's used to doing other things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't do it with hardbacks, but with paperbacks they've got the binding so it's  like constantly fighting your hands trying to close.  I guess you just crack the spine.  I'm too nice to the book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're just digging a hole deeper and deeper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we'll watch.  Monday the Kindle comes out, and I'll probably buy one and play with it just because I'm  that kind of guy.  I don't understand why a book reader needs a QWERTY keyboard, but we'll find out.  I liked your article.  We haven't been on since you wrote it, the Halloween column from John C. Dvorak and  PC Magazine, the Vista Death Watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah, that was a huge success, that column.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is it?  You know, it's funny because you talk to people like Paul Therot, Ed Bott, and you know, and  you and I think a lot of Ed, I think.  He's a great guy.  And he says, why are people ragging on Vista?  It's fine, it's good, it's great, I love it.  What's the problem?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, I wrote that column and I got a lot of email.  And there's always the one guy, one guy wrote in condemning me, but the whole thing was  just kind of an illiterate rant done in all upper caps, upper case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At least with the Apple fanboys rant, they know how to use punctuation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And anyway, but everybody else was in total agreement with me and they had nothing but  trouble and you keep hearing these stories about people that have to revert.  Apple's making some hay on that.  I mean, you hear too many of these stories.  No one ever had to revert from XP to Windows 2000.  I don't think you could.  Even with ME, nobody was reverting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I know people who reverted from me to 98 if they had upgraded.  I mean, obviously, if you bought a machine with me on it, you weren't looking to go  back to the company and say, please, sell me 98.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Saying Vista's a little better than ME isn't saying much.  I mean, is this the Windows ME?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it is.  I think it really is because it really doesn't give you all that much more than XP and it's  got problems.  I actually said on Buzz Out Loud on Friday that I'm using Vista for the first time regularly  in my house.  We just got a media center PC hooked up to the computer and it's okay.  It works.  I can do things on it.  But it's annoyingly got bugs.  The HDMI won't send out audio with the audio card that came with the brand new machine  installed with Vista.  That's probably the DRM.  There's all kinds of support issues about, oh, it's the driver needs to be updated and  you try this hack and this, that hack and all of that sort of thing.  It's the kind of thing you hear about with Vista where even brand new equipment sometimes  doesn't work with it.  Overall, it works fine.  It's not great shakes over XP, though.  I'm not sitting there thinking, wow, this is so much better.  I got to upgrade my laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you going to see that anymore?  Operating systems are pretty mature.  I don't think we're going to see a revolutionary new operating system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I felt that way with XP a little bit, though, when I was still stuck on 98.  XP was because XP was reliable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It had an actual memory management system.  But you've made that change now.  I don't know what else.  I mean, John, you've been through this for a while.  I'm sure people have always said, oh, but you can't do anything better.  This is perfect.  What would be the next step in an operating system that would make people go, wow, I've  got to have that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think the main thing, which is what Microsoft promised for this Vista, and they  never delivered it, which is an indexed database style of file management structure that allows  you to find anything instantly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they killed that after about two years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They killed it because they couldn't do it.  But why couldn't they do it?  I mean, the PIC operating system from 25, 35 years ago could do it.  The other people have been able to do it.  How come Microsoft can't do it?  They got 20,000 people working there, working on code, or they're just nobody can do it.  Give me a break.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You offer three choices.  Give up on the stupid variations, which I agree with you.  It's crazy.  They have seven different versions of Vista.  People buy Windows Home, Vista Home Basic and find out you can't even address more than  a gigabyte of RAM just artificially.  It can't do so many things.  So they end up having to upgrade one good Vista, Vista Ultimate, 99 bucks, says Dvorak.  Kind of like what Apple does.  A little more.  Apple does 129 bucks, but there's one version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You need like two versions of it.  You need a server version and you need a desktop version.  That's it, right?  Anything else looks...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you need any other versions?  It looks like you're squeezing people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's the other thing.  What is the point of all these versions?  Why don't they just give everybody the best version?  Does it cost more to make the disk?  I don't think so.  Good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Point two, you say Microsoft should scuttle the entire product.  Why not work on a whole new OS starting today with one team, work on service pack three  for XP with another team and that keeps people using Windows and offers you a way out.  Or finally roll out Vista 2.0, figure out some way to add some nifty features, maybe  stolen from the next version of Mac OS, bring in some outside designers if you have to and  lower the price on that one too.  I think it's good advice.  I guess too, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's good advice that no one's going to take because it's advice aimed at Microsoft.  They're not listening to John C. Dvorak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course not.  Why would they?  And why not?  Yet I have to point out that the Zune 2 is a big improvement over the Zune 1.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although aren't some people having problems with the firmware?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Already?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I read some reports of people having issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mine's been working okay.  The squircle is kind of weird.  When you look at it, it looks like it's unbalanced.  It's not symmetric.  There's something odd about that button.  But it works and I like it because it supports podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a non-equal lateral squircle?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a parallel squircle.  I think that's the problem.  There's something weird going on with it.  But it does have a touch thing.  You can scroll through things.  They've very cleverly got around Apple's patents on the scroll wheel and you zip up and down.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have you played with it?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Meanwhile, Apple's gone on to something new.  That's the problem.  It is the nano, last nano, not the current nano.  Looks exactly like last year's nano.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the Zune is trying to follow the Internet Explorer pathway where the first couple versions  just aren't anything new.  They aren't even that great, but they slowly get better and then they eventually hope to  dominate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's how Microsoft works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can barely talk.  That's how Microsoft works, but how often have they been successful with this strategy?  They've only been super successful with the strategy when they've had a monopolistic position.  The only reason that they ever got any ...  I don't know.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Xbox 360.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the Xbox is following that a little bit.  Internet Explorer didn't have a ...  Very little bit.  You're right.  It was tied to the operating system though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're right.  There's no only one real competitor with Xbox.  They came into the market late.  I agree with you, but they didn't use that strategy you described.  This is just basically just hardball strategy with the Xbox.  They just bring the thing out and just do what the other guys are doing and just trying

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to beat them.  Interestingly, the Wii beat them in October, outsold the Xbox 360.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Xbox 360 outsold the PS3 in Japan for the first time last week, but the Wii still  outsold both of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  PS3 is going to come back.  The last week of October, they cut the price.  They now have a $400, 40 gigabyte PS3.  I think they're already selling very well in the month of November.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  In fact-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, the numbers I saw is that they're selling better, but they're still in third place.  Really?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why?  That's got to be frustrating.  Here it is.  It's a cheap Blu-ray player.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't like to bundle, as it were, the Xbox 360 with the rest of Microsoft.  I really think it's a separate operation in a lot of different ways.  I admire what the Xbox people are doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like the Xbox 360.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think Sony has really booted it with the PS3.  In some ways, it's almost like, it's not quite as bad as Vista, but they ought to think about  moving on to the next one already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like Windows Vista.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, yeah.  PS4.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It just shows you.  You could put a lot of money in marketing at billions of dollars into R&D, but there's  no guarantee that what you're going to make is going to be successful.  It's a tough marketplace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I read something last week that the PS2 is still outselling the PS3.  Yeah, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sure that's the case.  Yeah.  But there's no games.  There's no good games.  If you don't have great games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the biggest problem with it.  Yeah.  The price was the other problem, but that, like you say, has been somewhat ameliorated.  But yeah, there's just no games.  And now Xbox has been kicking out games now.  They've got Halo, they have Portal, they have plenty of other games.  And now that it's sold.  And now that Hero 3 is a huge success.  Back catalog now with Xbox games going to be able to be downloaded on the Xbox 360.  I'm not saying the PS3 is dead really, but they really have messed it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, October was a huge month in gaming.  I think overall hardware and software sales in October were something like $1.1 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I added to that.  Did you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Me too.  Yeah, finally got a Wii.  Oh yeah, interesting.  And what did you get with your Wii?  See, this is the problem with the Wii.  I think the real problem with the Wii is people aren't buying games.  They're playing the Wii games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got a bundle.  That was the only way to get it.  It was a Wii Blaster, Legend of Zelda, Fantastic Four, some dragon thing, and Chicken Shoot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So pathetic.  It's a gaming machine for grownups.  Chicken Shoot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah, Chicken Shoot's good fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, so my daughter and my son, and they got me into playing this thing.  Have you guys heard of Steam?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's Valve's online distribution network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well there's a game called Portal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Portal's awesome.  See, everybody's playing it.  That comes with the Orange Box.  That's what the Orange Box is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For people out there who want to check out, you go online, you can download it, you can  play it on your machine.  When I first saw it, I thought, oh, here's another first person shooter.  Not at all.  No, it's a puzzle game, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The end credits are the best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I haven't seen the end credits.  What's in the end credits?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a Jonathan Colton song.  I can't remember the woman who sings it, though, but it's kind of sung from the perspective  of the main villain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, how fun.  Oh, I've got to get...  That's part of the Orange Box.  So you've beaten it, Tom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I've just gone to YouTube and listened to the end credits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, my daughter's beaten it.  My son and daughter have all beaten it.  So now I've got 30 bucks down.  I have to beat it or it's going to cost me money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's called Still Alive.  You want to hear it?  This is the end credit to Portal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It takes a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're going to start singing at some point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A little echoing there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's so you can hear it.  I have to do that.  It's pausing, too.  I don't know why it's pausing because it's...  The internet's broken again.  I guess I'm getting the whole credits, aren't I?  Yeah, you are.  Let me just get this song.  Here, let's just get this song.  This is the song by itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This was a triumph.  I'm making a note here.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Is this it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's it.  It's hard to overstate my satisfaction.  This is going to be a hit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, if radio stations would play this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We do what we must because we can.  For the good of all of us, except the ones who are dead.  But there's no sense crying over everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jonathan Coulton is going to break out sometime soon.  He is so good.  He is so good.  See, I think if I were a smart program director at some hip radio station, I'd play that song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that's why you're not at a radio station because there's no such thing that  you describe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm a smart program director?  Yeah, you might be right.  I was kind of thinking the same thing, Jon.  They don't even know.  They have no clue.  That's the closing theme from Portal, and you can find it on YouTube, probably illegally,  and I probably played it illegally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or you can beat the game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Beat the game.  I haven't had enough time to play it, but I played a little bit and it really is fun.  You burn holes in everything things and then you go through the hole.  But the puzzle is to get around in the game.  It's really just Skokoban or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a logic game.  My daughter says it's a 30 hour game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a long time nowadays.  Halo wasn't even that long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what she said.  Maybe I got the number wrong.  Maybe 20.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The whole Portal burning thing has really taken over userfriendly.org.  I don't know if you read that comic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's got his characters burning holes and things all the time.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Larry Page getting married.  Anybody care?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can marry him for $3,500.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah, maybe he's looking for a minister.  He and his longtime girlfriend Lucinda Southworth.  See, she's just marrying him for the name because he can't say Southworth.  See, how can you say Lucinda Southworth?  That is tough.  That poor woman's had that name her whole life.  Lucinda Southworth.  It's a difficult thing to say.  Anyway, they're going to be married at the Necker Island, suitably named.  The Caribbean hideaway owned by Virgin Group billionaire Richard Branson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah, let's go there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like Larry Page probably needs about three reverends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think we should maybe could be the Trace Amigos reverends.  Yeah, there you go.  Trace Padres.  Trace Padres.  She's a doctoral student in biomedical informatics at Stanford University.  Has been for four years, so that may go on for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Must have fascinating chit chat over the dinner table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't know that Sergey had already married.  I didn't either.  In May, Sergey Brin was married to his longtime girlfriend Anne Wojcicki.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just don't keep up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  I don't know how I got into this gossip mode.  Beatles are going to go digital next year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's funny that Larry and Sergey do tend to gather some of this Hollywood type gossip around.  The whole thing with the plane, the party plane, and then landing at the Moffat Field.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There would be no Valley Wag if it weren't for Larry, Sergey, and maybe a little bit of Kevin Rose thrown in just for fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just for a dash of seasoning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kevin's looking different. Have you seen him lately?  I haven't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kevin's stiffed us on Cranky Geeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, he's busy. He's got other things to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, maybe. He said he was going to do it today, but he never showed up.  We never heard from him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He still looks like a dark tip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm the dark tipper.  I think he's losing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's got to be a $500 haircut.  It's this new haircut.  It makes him look very much more mature.  Somebody said, Kevin, you can't look like a kid anymore. You've got to get a better haircut.  He's got a $500 haircut.  It looks like it. Look at it. It's definitely a vacant.  You know what, Leo? I don't care.  I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wedding news, now Kevin's hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm just trying to...  I don't really care.  I'm trying to spice it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. You want some hard news?  Bruce Schneier, security expert, is concerned the NIST, the National Institute for Standards and Technology,  has released an encryption standard that Schneier says could very well have a back door, an NSA back door.  Now, he says...  How does he know?  Well, that's it. He says he's not asserting that it does, but we have no way of knowing whether it does.  And since it's not open, and they're encouraging people to use this...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's a standard, so it should be open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's a standard, so it should be open.  He says the algorithm could easily have a secret...  The way it's designed, he says, it could easily have a secret back door, a secret number,  a master key, in effect, that would be able to decrypt content.  That's part of the...  He seems to think that's part of the design, which makes him think that the NSA must have a back door.  Why else would you design something that could have a key like that?  Yeah, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Of course it does.  So it's got a back door.  Obviously. So don't use it.  Use something else. There's plenty of things out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Use RSA. Use something that's open and known and safe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do have to say, though, I generally like to trust the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You want to. Just the name alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah. I mean, it's a good thing to have an organization that just looks over standardization  and says these are the things that everybody should use.  So it does kind of suck if they were to put out a standard for something like this that everybody was like,  no way, I'm not going to use that, because it sort of defeats the purpose of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, wait, wait, wait, wait. What's the purpose?  The purpose to me of that group has always been to define a foot, to have a gold bar and a safe someplace  that's exactly one foot long or to define two pounds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's a second? No, we like feet.  Damn, those Europeans can use meters.  We're feet guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We are feet guys. I like feet better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is an extension of that, though, isn't it?  I mean, saying like here's a standard for generating random numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they're meddling.  Get back to the feet, inches, ounces, grams, that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, where's the grams come in?  Now, see there, now you've got to be careful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're mixing your metric with your imperial.  They can have grams. They can do grams.  You must have a gram. Somebody's got to hold the great gram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, the kilogram, is it the kilogram that's losing weight?  Is it?  Yeah, we did the story.  Is it evaporating? Is the water evaporating?  I think they're saying that it's actually the standard kilogram in Paris  that's in the International Standards Bureau is losing weight.  They don't know why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll tell you why. It's the influence of Haute Couture.  How is that?  Because the models don't want to weigh so much.  It wouldn't work that way.  It's bad role models for the kilogram.  The kilogram is looking at these models and thinking,  I need to weigh less, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But all they eat is steak and chips over there in France.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that true? You were in Spain.  Steak frites.  What do they eat in Barcelona?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, they eat tapas. Iberian ham.  Mmm.  Good stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That Iberian ham is phenomenal.  I think it's much better than prosciutto.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love prosciutto, so I might really love Iberian ham.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just found a place in Oakland that actually has Iberian ham.  Is it real Iberian ham?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not one of the better ones, I'm sure.  They feed the pigs acorns, and if you go to the ham stores in Spain,  they have these hams, and some of them cost up to $100 a pound.  Well, acorns aren't cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The good places shave it right off, right before they serve it to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now I want to go back.  All I had was paella, paella, paella, paella.  Why is it lobster?  It was to die for.  Should have had some ham.  You know, there's nothing to talk about this week.  Okay, let me see.  There must be some more gossip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the Sirius XM merger got okayed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but not by the government, only by their shareholders.  That's not the big leap.  The big leap is getting the FCC to say this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The FCC should give up and let these guys have their satellite.  They're never going to make it.  We're going to lose both of them if we don't let them join,  because one of them is going to go broke before the other.  So right now it's a game of showdown.  Who's going to go broke first?  So what's the point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can they do it if they didn't allow DirecTV and Dish to merge several years back?  Can they then go and make the same argument?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Those guys aren't going bankrupt.  Of course the point is that the trust...  Those guys are making money.  Right.  Trust these regulations aren't supposed to be a way of fixing market problems.  Right.  And if your market problem is nobody wants you, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but still you have to take into consideration what's the circumstances of the merger.  And if you have two companies that are one of them are going to go broke,  leaving only one out there,  you can't say...  The logic of saying let's have the two of them join,  there's only going to be one out there.  Well, there's only going to be one out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's only going to be one out there no matter what you do.  Well, that's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hope you go before the FCC and testify.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, they'll never invite me to do anything.  I don't know if satellite radio can even be saved with the merger.  Anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway.  I'll tell you, you can say that, but I sure...  Even though I've actually written negative articles about this,  satellite radio is really cool.  I mean, I rent cars a lot and I always get one with the satellite radio in it,  because most of them have it now.  And I have to say, you know, it's enjoyable to listen to some of these...  The programming is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, I do a show on satellite radio.  I'm on XM Channel 158 every Saturday and Sunday.  I had an XM radio for a while and I really enjoyed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, see, there you have it.  And then I got rid of it and I don't miss it.  Yeah, that's the problem.  You don't have to have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's good if you've got it, but you don't have to have it.  Right, I agree.  Nothing pushing you to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's good for truckers and rental cars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Great for truckers.  And yeah, good for rental cars too.  All right, well, let's see, more gossip.  We found out who ran The Funded.  They ran the who?  What?  You know, The Funded site, thefunded.com, which is a gossip site  about venture capitalists and which  people who've taken money can diss their VC in private.  It's like F'ed company for venture capitalists.  It's exactly what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Turns out the guy running the venture capitalists

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  turns out the guy running The Funded,  he calls himself Ted, is not a Ted.  It's a Deo Rossi.  Ressie.  Who cares? I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's who it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So who's a Deo Rossi?  I don't know, some guy.  He started a couple companies, but I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's taken venture funding and he apparently was the guy.  I don't know. All right, you're right.  I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, we do care, but we don't have any background here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there's a site called The Funded.  It was like F'ed company.  And part of the game was who would be bold enough  to start this site?  Because you're basically kicking venture capitalists  where the sun don't shine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which means you're never going to get venture funding ever.  Which is why he stayed anonymous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  He's had several startups.  He's taken money from venture capital several times.  Method Five was a web development firm.  He sold for $88 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's on the board of the XPRIZE Foundation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And he's complaining?  Well, you know what he's doing, and I think it's probably a public service,  is telling people what you trade  when you get money from the venture funds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you trade part of the company.  What do you expect? You're getting money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you get people on there saying,  you know, my VC forced me to sell to somebody  just because it was a sister firm  and they had another investment of theirs.  Nobody forces anybody to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can always resign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but then you've lost your company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You still have shares.  True.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I like the idea of the funded.  Not that I'm in this business at all  or really know that much about it,  but it seemed like a good idea to me,  which was, if you're out there  pitching to these guys, here's a place to kind of  get the scoop about what they're like  without the risk of,  you know, offending them.  So you get some honest opinions,  rather than people saying, you know, blathering on  about how great they are, because they don't want to offend them.  So it's a good backdoor information source  I would guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Absolutely. In fact, some VC funds have actually gone on there to apologize.  To say, oh, you know, I'm sorry  that's such a bad experience.  Let me make it up to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Give us your name and phone number.  We'll be right over.  I'd like to buy you a cup of coffee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, anyway, I don't know.  I'm looking, I'm digging, I'm searching.  I'm scraping the bottom of the barrel.  I know. We're putting you on the spot here, Leo.  I've got to find another one.  I'll find it. Here's another, here's a big story.  Apple admits to misleading  leopard firewall settings.  Three serious design weaknesses in leopard.  And they've, but they have ship to fix.  Apple admitted that block all incoming connections  doesn't really block all incoming connections, actually.  So, but they're going to fix it.  I don't think they have fixed it.  It should block all incoming connections.  It's off the hook.  It's off the hook.  It's off the hook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's off the hook.  It's off.  Isn't the deal with the leopard firewall too, that it's off by default?  You have to go in and turn it on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but then even when you turn it on, it doesn't do anything, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, if you want to block  it's really easy to block all incoming connections.  Well, how do you do that?  Unhook the network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We only want to block some incoming connections, I guess.  Anyway, they're going to, if you've patched it, there is a fix.  And now it says, instead of blocking incoming connections, it says allow only essential services.  That's a good one.  That's a good one.  That's a good one.  That's the fix.  That's the fix. It changed the language.  Google has said,  yes, we're going to bid.  We're going to try to buy this  700 MHz spectrum.  That's a big deal.  They are going to finance  the 4.6 billion dollar bid.  I don't know why they would have to finance it.  Don't they have that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  in the petty cash drawer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Larry could get that out of the seat.  It's in the back seat of the Boeing 767 sitting there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's on the gift table at his wedding.  So what are they going to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We've talked about this before. What are they going to do with that?  Everybody thinks they're going to do some sort of a phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they are doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's the funny thing about this announcement is we've all speculated so much  about Google getting into the 700 MHz spectrum  that them saying, yeah, we're really going to do it  was sort of non-plussing.  It's a big deal.  We all kind of figured you were.  We knew you would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what are you going to do with it?  We pegged it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's significant because it does mean that Google would be getting into something that's a little bit deviating from their mission of organizing people's information.  It is more on the side of making it easily accessible.  I don't know that they have the expertise to run a network, do they?  I just love the idea of them having...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They only run the biggest network in the world.  Yeah, but not a cell phone network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They run an internet network.  But I love the idea of them opening this up and making it open.  And kind of sticking it to the cell phone companies.  Saying this is how it should be done.  You know, I was talking to somebody...  Who was it?  Who said that, you know, these guys...  I think it was Jason Calacanis last week, I think.  Said that these guys at Google really do take this idea of their kind of stewardship of the internet seriously.  They really do want to do no evil.  They really do want to build a company that opens things.  They believe in openness.  So I guess he's looking for money from them, huh?  Maybe that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think he's looking for money from them.  I didn't ask him, but he doesn't need money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's got money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I love those Google guys.  You know, I'm interested to hear that, though.  I wonder, does anybody have the impression that Google is evil?  They've been getting more and more negative press than they used to.  There was a Cinderella period for a while.  They could do no wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And now there's privacy and them buying DoubleClick.  And are they gathering too much information about you?  That was the first...  And are they getting too much information about you?  And are they getting too much information about you?  And are they getting too much information about you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was the first chink in the wall, wasn't it?  DoubleClick. That didn't look so nice.  Maybe they bought them, though, to put them out of business.  Maybe they bought them, though, to put them out of business.  I want to believe in fairy tales.  I want to believe in fairy tales.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, apparently.  They're going to buy Enron next.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Think about it, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  With the 700 MHz spectrum,  Google owns all this dark fiber, right?  Right.  And then you've got these  container truck data centers now  that I think Sun makes,  where you can just go dump a truck off in the middle.  All you've got to do is run power and water to it for cooling.  They could just blanket the country  with these data centers hooked up to the dark fiber  broadcasting over the 700 MHz spectrum.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And suddenly the entire nation is wired.  wirelessly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Impossible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thin clients.  The G-Phone is the thin client that runs the 700 MHz spectrum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And there's money to be made on that  because they put the advertising on that site.  It might even be lost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm telling you, it's the worst business in the world.  These guys are going to lose their butts on this deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  I think the wireless spectrum is a pretty  valuable commodity to have, no matter what you do with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'm not arguing that.  I'm just saying it's a tough business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I agree with that,  getting in there, but maybe they lease it.  Google leases it with conditions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's sort of what they're doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  with the phone, which is smart,  saying, hey, we make some good software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe they should improve their search engine a little bit.  How about that for an idea?  Oh, no, they've got other fish to catch.  This is another typical company that gets distracted.  Oh, we've got to do this, we've got to do that.  It's like Microsoft is the worst for this.  These guys have dropped the ball on all kinds of things  going left and right.  Now they're chasing Google for some unknown reason.  And everybody takes it.  They walk away from their core competencies  where they own a market and they go after stuff  they don't know anything about.  And then they stumble and fumble, and then there's all kinds of  things that they're doing.  And then they're like, well, we made a mistake here,  we made a mistake there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Meanwhile, the shareholders should have been getting that money.  Well, it's the shareholders that are pushing them  to diversify and grow and go into new things,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  which forces them to get away from their core.  They have to maintain that growth rate.  But you're right.  It's happened to Microsoft, it's happened to Yahoo,  it's happened to Sony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can see the failures all through the industrial world.  If you just sit on your core competency,  then you get criticized for not trying to grow the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you've got to maintain these crazy growth rates.  The market expects you to maintain a growth rate that's insane,  that you can't maintain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's the best example.  Microsoft's growth rate has gone, has continued on,  or whatever it is, 25, 30% a year, whatever,  maybe more,  marching away only from the  monies they make from their core competencies  and all the money that they're losing  from these other crazy ideas that are  supposedly the shareholders are demanding  they diversify.  I don't know what shareholders these are that are making these assertions,  because it's crazy.  If Microsoft's stuck with its core competencies,  they'd own the place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's a rational way of looking at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Before we run completely out of stories,  I'm going to do our audible pick.  We're just grousing.  This is the grousing episode.  Three ministers  got together to grouse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the start of some kind of joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know, they walk into a bar.  You know, we should really recommend  some business books. If you're interested,  Bill Gates, in really learning what to do  with Microsoft,  you might want to check out audible.com.  Look at the business collection. They've got all sorts  of great books. You can even listen to the  Harvard Business Review, month  by month.  Of course, the classics like How to Win Friends  and Influence People or Seven Habits of Highly Effective  People, they're all there.  A-U-D-I-B-L-E.com slash  Twitter. And you know what? If you go to audible.com  slash Twitter, you get a free book.  You get a free book. So,  just to sign up today, get a credit. I think one of the books  I'd like to recommend is a fascinating  subject called micro trends.  Have you guys read up on this?  The theory is that 1% is enough to create  any trend. And that the smaller  trends eventually snowball  into bigger trends, but they go unnoticed  or unignored. And yet, you can identify  micro trends that are going  to be very, very significant. It's a fascinating  book. Mark Penn wrote it with  Kinney Zalesny.  Micro trend. What are you laughing at?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who comes up with these ideas?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've got to read this. It's fascinating.  Alright, I'll get it.  Send me your copy. I will. The reason I like it  is because  we're in that 1% trend.  That's what podcasting really is.  If we can get,  if this kind of show can get 1% of the audience,  it's enough to create  an avalanche. A world  change. Do you have to get a quality audience?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it doesn't matter. Anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you need to get the influencers and all that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  1% quality audience for this show is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  never going to happen. Bums off the street. Doesn't matter.  Anybody. As long as you get 1%,  that's all it takes. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does that work for presidential candidates?  I think we got the 1%.  This is the most popular podcast there is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it is. Hard to believe, actually.  I don't know.  Maybe not anymore. So, audible.com  slash  is the site.  Great choices. 45,000 plus titles.  Runs on hundreds of different devices.  You can even burn to CD.  I'll burn this book to CD and send it to John C.  Dvorak so he can listen to it too.  It is a really great way  to get reading done. How many CDs does it hold?  Well, that's the problem. It's a lot of CDs  when you burn it to CD. I just prefer to put it on.  I'll tell you what. I'll give you an iPod. It'll be easier.  I'll just put it on an iPod and give it to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Alright. I got them lying around.  Throw it in there with the box with the microphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah, that.  You don't need my mic anymore.  You've got Pod Show giving you  crap left and right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got a good mic here. Yeah, and Pod Show gave it to me.  What kind of mic are you using?  It's got a little serial number on it. When I'm gone, I have to give it back to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it's got that inventory tag?  Yeah. Like Ziff Davis used to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. No, everything's inventory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow, that's like a real company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like a real company, except the cables.  So if you can get enough cables,  you can make money on the deal. Because the cables are kind of free.  They're not labeled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just pull the copper wiring out of the wall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have a Dymo label.  I put property of twit on everything, but I don't know if that really has to...  Property of twit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's all that Ziff Davis ever did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I should put a fake serial number on it, like a phony barcode.  So it looks like we've got an inventory system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. You should, just to fool the rubes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, we've got an inventory system!  So anyway, audible.com slash twit.  By the way, good time now through November 20th.  Half price sale.  A thousand plus unabridged titles, including  the Quicksilver series.  If you want to listen to those great Neil Stephenson books that I can't get through,  but I hear are wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He was on Cranky Geeks.  Where do you get bogged down with them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The very first one? I mean, about halfway through the Quicksilver.  I just, it's like,  you know, I'm not as literate as you, Tom,  and I just can't follow it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tom is the most literate person on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know about that.  I'm definitely the most stubborn. I won't stop.  I just keep reading.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe that's it. It's such a, you know, anyway,  if I hadn't lost the Sony eBook reader,  I'd be reading it right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're still irked about that.  What airline was it? Did they get it back for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was Air Canada. No, can you call them?  I just figured the stewardess probably took it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would have.  You might have tried to call Lost and Found.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They've got an interesting thing here.  I don't know what this means.  Audible has Cryptonomicon.  Which is my favorite book of all time,  practically. I love Cryptonomicon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've been meaning to go back and reread that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I have to, too. Well, get the audible version.  Except I don't understand here. It says,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  unabridged excerpts.  What does that mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a proxy moron.  Well, the excerpts have not been edited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It says unabridged excerpts.  I don't know if that means...  I don't know what that means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a great name for a blog out there, you people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The publisher explains,  I felt that given the style of the book, a normal  book would not work. The book is 900 pages.  So I selected key scenes, and then added  short plot bridges approved by the author  that would allow the listener  to follow the story. No, you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't get this. It's abridged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Get unabridged,  Neil Stephenson stuff. I understand that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like those catch up on Lost episodes  where they just show you  pieces of every episode so far this season.  No, that's no good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wonder if they have Toynbee's A Study of History.  Now, that was a great book.  I think Toynbee was a crack.  No, I met the guy.  You met Toynbee?  Yeah, I did.  Tom, did you read the 13 volumes  or did you just read the short version?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I haven't read it.  I read Will Durant's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have an abridged version of Toynbee.  I didn't know it was 13 volumes.  But his thesis, which is pretty easy to explain,  is that cultures  succeed or fail depending on climate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, civilizations  and that is not it at all.  But that's a nice try.  Well, that Northerners  are 13 volumes so it's a little more complicated  than that. We're thinking of Spangler.  No, Spangler  is different again. Spangler is another  character who is in the same genre.  Spangler did a two volume set called  The Client of the West.  Yes.  And it's actually, I read  Spangler. Spangler's two books are quite interesting.  But the thing about those two books is  that about halfway through volume two,  it just dies.  It's like he ran out of his say.  I just imagine looking at the book  that he says, this book is so much thicker than this one  I'm going to have to add more crap to it.  So he writes a bunch of boring junk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I completely identify with him  actually. I've had that  happen but not after a whole volume. Mostly after  about half an hour.  Isn't Toynbee though often considered  kind of a crackpot? No, never.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's not one person in the world that considers him a crackpot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have you read all 13 volumes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have as a matter of fact. Wow. I'm going to have to get  to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They do not have that on Audible. I'm going to have to read that in print.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is a condensed  version that some guy wrote. That's what I've read.  Yeah, it's two volumes.  And Toynbee, the guy,  this is an interesting story. I can't remember his name off handed  to come to me in a minute. But this guy  wanted to understand Toynbee better so he started  to outline it and write his, he wrote  a two volume condensation so he  could read, re-read all the  theses all at once. Toynbee got a hold of it  and said this is fantastic.  This two volumes.  And he talked his publisher into publishing  the two volumes for people who don't want to read all the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  long stuff. Must be what I read.  Did it have pictures? No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mine had pictures.  There's a picture version of the book that came out about  That's the one I've read. In the 80s  I believe. And it's called the same thing, a study of  civilization. Yeah. And  or study of history. That's the one I read.  Study of history is the name of it. And anyway  it's got, I don't know where this book came from.  I think it was printed, I don't even know who, remember  I have a copy. It's horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why I think it's all about climate.  Cause that's the one I read. It's got nothing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to do with anything. I don't know. I think it had guns, germs, and steel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a great book. No I read  I read that picture version in, I think it was in  high school. I liked it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's got nothing to do with anything.  I mean I don't even know where that book  I looked at this book and I'm thumbing through  one day I'm going this book has got, this is  ridiculous. It doesn't really  do the job. Toineby argued that civilizations die

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  from suicide not by murder.  No he does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He has a bunch of different theories. The thing is  there's more than one way but he  his main thesis is that civilizations  have a life of their own and they come and they go.  It's a cycle. Yeah.  Much like the business cycle.  Kind of. I hate  to be reminded of that. But anyway  that book needs to be finished.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A lot of times they die when they shift  their economies to enter hate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want to read some real fun stuff.  Well fun, not real fun  but it's interesting. Fascinating.  Is the study of history by Arnold Toineby.  Read the volume. Start with volume one  and start plowing through it. It will take you about

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  four years. I'm going to do it.  I'm going to do it and I'll report back to you John  when I understand it. The footnotes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  are absolutely

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  amazing. I love history. You know I talked  to an English woman a while ago. She said  you Americans love history because you don't have any  history. We're so bored with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. That's not true of all  English that I've ever read. No. In fact

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  many English love history. Just that woman that Leo ran into.  Yeah. It was her. She thought it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway you can't get all 12  volumes of Toineby on Audible but  you can't get many wonderful books. Ulysses?  Yeah. I bet you could.  Oh Ulysses is the one to listen to.  Yeah. U-L-Y-S-S-E-S.  Right? Ulysses. Let's see if they have it.  I'm going to search here.  They do have Ulysses.  They probably have a production  version of it. Do they have Finnegans Wake then?  They're not going to have Finnegans Wake.  You can't even. I tried to read the first  paragraph of Finnegans Wake and I  passed out  in a faint. Yeah this is  the idea Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what it's supposed to do. I read it out loud

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to my daughter. She said was he joking?  I said I don't think so. I think he  was serious. They do not have  Finnegans Wake on Audible.com but every  other book. 45,000 plus  titles. Audible.com slash twit.  And we thank them for their support  of This Week in Tech.  So the Beatles. Paul McCartney  says the Beatles are going digital,  going online soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's pretty much the only one left. I mean I know there's  Ringo but he gets  to make the call. The Beatles.  I guess the estates of the  young girls. The Beatles says 2008

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  though which is a little disappointing.  I thought  it'd be sooner than that. How long does it take?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When do they go public domain in  UK? It's like 2012.  It's not  that long after. You'd think you'd want to get in there as soon as  possible. No I think that's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That public domain thing is now  isn't it an international law where  everything is adopted to a 150 year  standard? Not unless they sign the  treaty. So in other words 75 years after his death  or something like that. I don't think that the  I don't think it's been signed yet but has it?  I think that's all in play.  The Gowers.  I think our kids and everybody after us are never going  to understand what public domain even is  except Dickens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.  The issue is they want to harmonize  the British  law with this international law.  But the government hasn't agreed  yet. They haven't acted on its conclusions.  So if the government  does not act  then the Beatles will come out of copyright in 2012.  2012. But they  certainly will act.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah. And meanwhile  they'll be able to sell plenty of digital versions before that.  Yeah. Lots of time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But hurry up Sir Paul.  I don't have anything  else to say. I just want to think. What's going to be the biggest

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  shopping day of the year on Friday? Oh yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Black Friday. So what a poor name.  Can we come up with a better name for this?  Fun Friday. Fun busy Friday.  Yeah. Busy Friday.  Black Friday sounds like a stock market crash.  What a crappy name. Do you even need the Friday

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  anymore though with so many online deals?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I buy now. I buy you know and there's no  Black Monday anymore. Cyber Monday because  people don't wait to go to work to shop  online. They shop online all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the one year where I feel  like there really just isn't anything  big  gadget wise, technology wise for the  holiday season. You've got  wait a minute. You still can't get a Wii.  You get the Asus EPC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The EPC is cool.  I love my EPC.  You can get an OLPC and they kind of give a gift of  charity and have a gift.  That's the feel good gift.  That's the feel good gift. That's $3.99.  It's an expensive feel good. You pay the price to  feel good. Have you played anybody play with

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the OLPC? I played with  it a bit at CES last year  and I don't know how much they've changed.  The thing that was the most cool  about it was the mesh networking. They  had it demonstrated where they only had  one computer hooked up to the internet but you could surf off of all of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can send  Nigerian email scams  from like 20 of them with only one  dial up. It's really great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  First Nigerian email scam to actually come from Nigeria.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wouldn't that be cool?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Then it would be a scam.  They'd just be true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was reading Parade magazine this week.  It's their technology, their yearly technology issue.  It's so dumbed  down. It's kind of sad but they do have  a big ad saying  this man, it's a guy with tattoos and a mohawk,  is an Eastern European  lottery official who says you've won.  It's explaining why.  It's actually a good ad. I'm glad  somebody's running this. I don't know who's paying for it but it's explaining why you  actually haven't won  the Romanian lottery.  I guess they have to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I like those ads.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got a good one the other day  because there's a lot of the ones that are now  called the misdirect  type where this guy says  hey, I got  that $10 million deposit  in that account you wanted  and it's sitting there ready for you but you're going to have to  get a hold of so and so. I haven't heard back  from you.  This kind of thing. I guess to find some  bonehead who actually believes  that by accident  he's got access to $10 million  because he has to have a fee to pay for  some charge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was a great New Yorker article, I'm sure you read  this, Tom, a couple of years ago about a guy who  fell for a 419  scam and refused. He was a, this guy  was like a minister. The article was called  The Perfect Mark.  And he was an ordained minister.  He was a psychotherapist.  He was fairly comfortable. He basically  squandered everything.  He refused to ever believe that he  was being taken advantage of. The money  was always just around the corner with  some widow and he believed  he was helping her.  It's a fascinating, a must  read article. Mitchell Zukoff wrote it. It was  about, I actually have it in front  of me right now, May 2006.  Will to believe, very strong.  Very interesting.  Anyway, I'm going to wrap this up. I think it's  been fun talking to you guys. I'm sorry  to bore you with such lousy stories  but maybe next time we'll have  something interesting to talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anything's possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The news never plays fair with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It doesn't. You get some good news.  It's always slow  The last two weeks in November for news,  I mean this has been going on for ever since I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  started writing. I know. Nobody's going to  announce anything now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's all been announced.  It's all about waiting to see that the sales  figures ring up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you notice this with Buzz Out Loud  that you go through cycles where there's just really  I mean you have to do that every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah, absolutely. There are some days where you're pulling  your hair out. We do  a lot of science stories  as kind of later to sort  of buffer that. You know, things about quantum  cryptography and  entanglement and  That's clever. So just add like a kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  another topic that you could expand  out into if things are really slow in the tech realm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not too far afield to talk about  controlling limbs, artificial  limbs tied into your brain  and things like that. That's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  too far out. That's any minute now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We talk about cooking and food with  John. That's what we do. Iberian ham.  Or twine bee.  That's always good.  Maybe we should stick with the artificial limbs.  That might be better.  Twine bee.  Anyway, Tom Merritt is one of the hosts with Molly Wood  of The Great Buzz Out Loud at CNET.  Buzz.Cnet.com

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's actually bol.Cnet.com

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's right. I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  bol.Cnet.com takes you to Molly's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  own page. And now you do  this CNET Live. Tell me about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It may  sound familiar. It's a call in show.  A live call in show every day.  It's a live half hour video call in show.  Usually it's me and  Brian Cooley, although as schedules  happen, different people have hosted  it. Molly Wood and Donald Bell did it on  this past Thursday and did a great  job. But yeah, it's just  a call in show. We have guests who do some  help segments and take calls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  CNETtv.com, is that where you go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Between that and now the live stuff  that Revision 3 is about to do  and I talk to them. What are they going to do?  They built a live studio. Well, Txilla is  going to go live. Actually, Patrick was supposed to join us,  but I think the baby called.  They're going to start doing Txilla live.  Take live calls. They build a  live studio. Everybody's  copying your old formula, Leo. I know.  And me, I'm sitting here just  doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have the syndicate

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  radio show. I do the lab up in Canada.  I'm still doing it.  You're all over it. I like it.  I want to do more  live streaming stuff. You could do it  now without having a big  budget with stuff like Ustream. In fact,  we've been streaming this live over Ustream.  I think that's kind of interesting.  Anyway, just a thought.  What are you doing with Pod Show these days, Mr. Dvorak?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I got the Tech5 thing this  day. You can check that out at tech5.podshow.com.  And also the one  that's kind of sneaking up, which  and this  is not a clone of a Leo show.  But I do something with Adam Curry  called No Agenda, which we run on Fridays.  And it's about anything but tech.  Oh, I like that.  So basically we sit and grouse,  because he's grousing from England about  England and the United States. And I'm grousing  from the United States. That's actually a great idea.  Because you're both intelligent people with

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  lots of things to talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we've got around the block.  I don't know how intelligent we are. But whatever  the case is, I grouse about stuff. And he  grouses about stuff. And  after 30 minutes, we get sick  of each other and hang up.  It's very therapeutic, isn't it?  You know, the funny thing is people listen  to it. That's what's really frightening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's kind of what Roger Chang and I do  on East Meets West. Same sort of idea.  And it is amazing. People are like, I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You and Roger go back and forth about  the same thing. Yeah, there's no... Just talking about whatever's on

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  our minds. No new ideas under the sun. Maybe that's what we stole

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the idea from. We stole the idea from you. We didn't even

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  know it. There's no new ideas under the sun.  I swear to God.  Actually, on TechFive on Friday, you were  talking about Microsoft buying Yahoo. You still think  that's going to happen? I talked

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  about it, but I still don't think  it's a good idea. And I think it's nutty. And I  think it's like Microsoft  admitting failure. Two companies that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  have lost their way joining together to make a company  well, it sounds like HP  Compact. It's terrible.  The whole thing is a humiliation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We've seen this before. Somewhere between

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  HP Compact and AOL Time Warner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, somewhere in the hole in the ground.  Yeah. A portal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gentlemen, I thank you for joining us. I really appreciate it.  Dvorak.org slash blog. You didn't say it  once, John. I was actually keeping track because I had  a bottle of Stolich Naya here.  Yeah, well, I didn't want to get you drunk.  I was ready. If you'd said it four or five times,  I would have fallen off the ball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would have said it if I'd known that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Said what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Dvorak.org slash blog.  Oh, yeah. Wait a minute. Give me that bottle.  Another tweet.  He's falling off the ball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tom's probably right.  No, but there's no demand for this book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I can't. Why? I used to work the history  section at a bookstore in Austin.  And the  Toy and Bee stuff would always sell, but you had to mark it down.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.
