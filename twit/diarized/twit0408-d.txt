Transcript:  me so thank you I appreciate that. I want to start off I hate to start off with sad  news but it is appropriate you know Oculus Rift has been getting such great  reviews I just got my developer kit this week this was a Kickstarter project  raised more than a million dollars last year to make a virtual reality helmet  that many have said this is the first time it really works it's really cool  but what's so sad about it is the 33 year old co-founder of Oculus Rift Andrew  Rice it got hit by a car a hit-and-run during a police chase in Irvine and  actually Santa Anna and his died so a huge loss apparently it was some gang  members were being chased by the cops he was crossing the street they ran a red  light and they just plowed him down I don't know what will happen to Oculus  Rift as a result I'm sure they'll continue on because they've got an  amazing technology but boy that is a terrible terrible loss to the tech  community 33 years old 33 years old so young so I'm gonna keep the Oculus Rift  we done we did a review if you want to see our review Tony Wayne got his and  have you played with it I have not awesome it's kind of amazing like real  time you turn your head and it's just perfect anyway I hope they keep they  keep doing this but just a great tragedy tragedy for of another kind for  photographers in Chicago and I've been you know I'm really curious what you  guys are gonna say about this I've been getting a lot of email and tweets about  it the Chicago Sun-Times has fired their staff reporters and 28 photographers  they fired him on Friday and this is where it gets weird apparently the  reporters for the writing reporters are written reporters for the newspaper are  gonna be trained in iPhoneography they are apparently expected to pick up the  slack and and take pictures with their cameras sign of the times well that's  what you know this is what intrigued me about this that so many people were up  in arms about this and I of course when people get fired it's terrible but this  is a measure of the fact that newspapers are just dying well you know I don't  hear that when 28 reporters get fired it's it's interesting because there's a

Start time: 480.52
End time: 494.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  parallel in television news especially local news where a lot of camera guys a  lot of studio guys got asked as soon as they started automating the studios with  if you've never seen robot cameras where you can remote they're scary because they

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  know one of the things if you know especially if you're in the in the  business and you're applying for a job you'll notice that a lot of the listings  say they want a predator which is essentially producer that can edit as  well as write and do all the other story all the other stuff that used to be  covered by two other individuals so in a way it's just a cost saving measure  whether or not you'll get the same level of quality from an iPhone I can

Start time: 523.46
End time: 544.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  pretty much guarantee you but I agree with you I thought this is very  interesting because when reporters are laid off a hundred reporters are laid  off when Rupert Murdoch's daily went under you never even nobody goes oh my  god this is horrible look what's happening to newspapers reporters do but  I don't think that people reporters do but but the internet community got very  up in arms about the photographers getting fired I saw a Trey Ratcliffe and

Start time: 544.74
End time: 561.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  others writing about this very upset well you want both you want both pros  using great equipment but if you are a journalist today you should be taking  photos as well you should be shooting video you should be doing all kinds of  stuff you can't just be a word person Dave McDeen our chat room informs me the

Start time: 562.54
End time: 585.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Metropolitan Opera fired their entire ballet company this week not one word in  the press but I think it's because we identify with photographers photographers  are kind of the new heroes of the geek of new media right and so these 28 guys  by the way there of all the people who could possibly be fired at a newspaper  the photographers are most likely to find work immediately right oh yeah you

Start time: 586.24
End time: 635.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  you would switch topics you wouldn't be shooting a news story shoot a wedding or  birthday but there's gonna be work for you well you know a lot of work for a  compositor well that's the thing is like even some of these photographers  probably have some editing compositing you know post-production skills on  photos because you cannot survive especially in today's environment on  just being good at one particular aspect of your job you want to be able to maybe  not be incredibly good at everything but at least competent because you don't  want to be in the position where the company's looking to save a few dollars  and looking so well you know can you edit I mean you're a great anchor person  but can you edit too because it save us a lot of money and you know it's you know  or that it will hire the the new guy who comes at half the rate Chris Markport

Start time: 635.70
End time: 679.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  yeah go ahead this is the this is the business that we're in right I mean this  this is what twit does this is what new media does we have figured out that the  the work the production work that used to take millions of dollars and a huge  studio to do we can now do not on the cheap but for you know with a much  different type of crew different type of equipment the same thing happens to  photography they've the newspapers have realized camera phones or you know  prosumer cameras have become so good and amateur photographers get so many  different angles that they can essentially get the same coverage they  can get the same material the same content that they need at a much lower  price so in essence if you're gonna be blaming the newspaper you should be  blaming content creators like us and amateur competent creators and Craig

End time: 712.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  structure you would essentially be blaming everyone that has a piece of  technology that allows them to capture a still image a moving image and  recording audio I mean think about the last three big news stories where most  of the content came from people not associated with the press I mean the the  the soldier in London that was hacked to death a lot of those videos that  were there iPhone videos the Boston bombing those were all captured either

Start time: 712.84

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  by CCTVs or photojournalists are important maybe one arguably the most  important form of journalism today since we are in a much Vince LaFore who is a  great photographer wrote a blog post how to ensure your instinct extinction look  at what newspapers are doing and he says you know he's talking about we're in the  heyday of photography he says well it's sarcastically yeah obviously teenagers  are clearly reading 300 to 1200 word articles on newspaper websites in a  regular basis they're not they're looking at pictures right and you look  at what the Boston Globe does with the big picture wonderful clearly they're  making money on their photojournalists so maybe the really the short-sightedness  was that the Chicago Sun-Times couldn't figure out a way to make these guys pay

Start time: 757.80
End time: 777.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm kind of astounded they had 28 unbelievable to go from what sounds  like a pretty plush photography staff to nothing as must be kind of jarring and  I am kind of curious what their front page will look like if well if it's  iPhone photos if it's iPhone photos a lot of Instagram non-professionals well

Start time: 777.26
End time: 811.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  it's it's one of those things where you know I mean Leo you know this you don't  necessarily want to cut out you know try to try to bridge everything with one  person but you want to pick and choose where you have that one or two  individuals that are really good at photography and send them out on that  story and everything else like oh yeah you're covering you know this the latest  you know City Council you know debate on you know whether or not a new park needs  a tree or something you can send someone with an iPhone and cover that but if  it's something that you know is gonna make the front page or something that's  incredibly timely yeah you want to send out the best person for that job Vince

Start time: 811.82
End time: 822.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  is arguing they should have fired more reporters and kept the photographers he  might have a he might have a point there the photographers in this day and age  might be more important but I think you know go ahead can ask a question and

Start time: 822.62
End time: 847.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  that is is there still the room for the pure photographer I mean is it now no  you have to be a media creator you have to be a content creator you can't just  do photography you need to do videography you need to do editing like  Roger said you have to have that the talent along the entire spectrum it's  you can't any longer just be the guy with the great eye you have to be able  to deliver on many different levels in in the new media world right I mean that's

Start time: 848.00
End time: 895.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  a good point in fact in fact you you might have hit the nail on the head the  guy who did this Tim Knight was the publisher at Newsday when they did  exactly the same thing in 2008 they fired 20 people from their staff but  they allowed them and this may happen at the Chicago Sun-Times to reapply for  multimedia jobs so they allowed them to say okay you know we're not still photos  are look look at all the attention the New York Times got for that snow the  avalanche piece that they did was it was and it was a multimedia piece it wasn't  stills it was video was moving clearly newspapers are maybe looking more to the  web and more to being multimedia producers so maybe that's what's going  on so I don't think any anybody in their right mind would say we are in a less  visual age what is time does Time magazine have staff we have both a lot

Start time: 896.60
End time: 920.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  of freelance freelance we have astounding photography done by people  have done it for decades and have won all kinds of awards but when I went to  the D conference last week I was taking photos and putting them up too so I  don't they're not mutually exclusive you right you want to have the best  possible photographers doing work with the best possible equipment and people  are just sort of telling the story with whatever they have at hand at the moment

Start time: 920.58

Transcript:  well you look at CNN I often wonder if CNN wants to replace all its reporters

Start time: 924.10
End time: 985.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  with our reporters and you know I don't CNN's really bad so that's a bad example  I think I just avoid watching yeah yeah that's that's a good point but it's  interesting is because you know you know for years people are saying like you  know newspapers are dying out and you know online web is gonna be the future  and it's kind of 50-50 yes that's true but also I mean you still need you still  need experienced reporters who know and understand a story one of the things  that I used to read The Economist a lot and within the past five years there's  been a significant turnover and their writers they shifted really like a lot  either a lot of them retired and they got on a bunch of new ones but I mean  that the quality of the writing is still good but the analysis that The Economist  used to be famous for it has been the lack at least in my personal opinion has  been lacking and and most of it occasionally still get bag hot or one of  the columnists who write a really good piece but overall I mean just the  quality of the information isn't there that I would say it was there ten years

Start time: 985.42
End time: 1003.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  ago well and it's not exactly information it's analysis isn't it yes  the facts it's easy maybe not that easy but it doesn't require nearly as much  skill to gather facts as it does to analyze and present and argue and and  and give people an understanding as opposed to just a list of facts it's I

Start time: 1003.66
End time: 1025.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  mean that's that's that's one thing that I think most people would agree when you  when you watch the news or you read about it there's very little analysis  they'll throw you out numbers they'll throw you out locations and they'll give  you a couple of sound bites from important people who said something but  you know other than that it just gives you kind of it gives you kind of the you  know the the 500 foot view of what's happening but doesn't really give you a

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  worldwide news organizations newspapers magazines etc etc and what we found at  least in the last five years is we've been shutting down more and more of them  because they they haven't been able to shift to the new model we have we have  one magazine that's run out of New York was award-winning for many many years  but the problem is they operated under the old model which is you had a staff  of writers and investigators who basically would write one or two hard  hitting stories a month and now we're telling them look you got to be filing  five stories a day Wow and it you know it's just numbers we need that much  productivity out of them in order to make the publication stay in the black  and and we all lament the fact that oh my gosh well we can't hit as hard as we  used to we can't investigate as much as we used to but unfortunately nobody has  figured out a way to really monetize hard-hitting news versus tweets well and

Transcript:  this is you know we talked about this a lot with Jeff Jarvis on this week in  Google because he's a journalism professor but also a media critic and we  want we need people out there gathering facts because we need the facts as as  the grist for the the mill so that we can start to understand it so we do need  reporting we especially investigative reporting a place like Syria though  people on the ground might do a better job than an embedded reporter right  certainly in some cases that's what we saw in Egypt for instance during the  uprisings we're gonna take a break Harry McCracken is here from the  technologizer from Time magazine Roger Chang from Discovery and Tekzilla my old  friend and and of course father Robert Balliser from this weekend Enterprise  Tech and new shows coming to twit soon we're working on right now we got we got  plans for you Robert our show today brought to you by audible.com my my  beloved this is this is one of my favorite things and it has been for more  than a decade now I started listening to audiobooks from audible in 2000 when I  was committing to the screensavers and it was a two hour a day drive sometimes  more if traffic was bad and I'll tell you I would have I would have strangled

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Android and iOS are already designed to work well with touch it's way easier to  give something that already works well with touch a physical keyboard than to  go the other way around this is why I mean HP HP is making the slate book x2  which is an Android yeah their laptop HP is doing Android laptops that look quite  a bit like like their windows ultrabooks but it's very natural touch

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I like to approach it from a different angle and that is yeah you know if you  look at what touch adds to a desktop if you're trying to sell a touch desktop  it's actually a hard sell it's even a harder sell than selling a touch laptop  but I use a touch laptop I enjoy it I actually find myself reaching up to the

Start time: 1901.14

Start time: 1906.58
End time: 1954.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  seven but I don't think that's how you should be looking at it you're not  selling a touch desktop you're selling a desktop that has touch enabled it does  add another dimension and I think eventually we will get to the point  where you're just gonna expect everything to have touch I have seen my  nieces and my nephews and my cousins who are all younger moving to a desktop  after having worked on an iPad or an Android tablet basically their entire  young lives and then being frustrated I see them reaching up to the screen and  it doesn't do anything yeah so I think there there is that to be said about  about touch which is it's not going to be a super selling feature but it's it's  going to be expected it's going to be like the ability to do 3d and in TVs  most of us aren't going to buy a TV because it does 3d it's just going to be  baked in because well why not that's the cost of doing business it is it's an

Start time: 1954.68

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  option I have a mouse I have a trackpad I have a keyboard and I could touch the  screen and I notice with touch devices that I will do some combination of all  of them depending on how I feel I might tap a button I tend to forget actually  on the Acer I tend to forget I have touch it's I think part of it is like you

Start time: 1972.68
End time: 2007.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  know when you got to a GUI desktop the mouse was was the addition right to your  keyboard right with touch I mean you know more natural than a mouse though  it's more it is but like when I have a layout like a traditional laptop my  first inclination is to go with right I actually what's the the Lenovo yoga  where you can convert it into and you kind of put in a little tent mode where  you can touch the screen works a lot better that way then if you actually  have the keyboard out and you're using as Windows RT and Windows 8 so it's it  makes more sense and I think part of it it's is kind of the man-machine

End time: 2037.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  don't think desktop computing as much but at the same time they're trying to  bridge they have to bridge it they have to bridge in the thing unlike OS 10  Windows has this huge legacy footprint you have literally millions upon millions  of users who still run a traditional desktop some of them still have a CRT

Transcript:  with a touch I have to say the reaction 8.1 it felt like Pete they were  doing that this is it it's our way or the highway they didn't really listen to  people it's funny Stephen Sinovsky who was later severed from Microsoft we  don't know how exactly the guy behind Windows 8 was also at all things deep  talking and was a little snide first of all he said I'm using an HTC one phone  not a Windows phone and he tweeted something that was very Adelphic he said  something like you have to listen to users but not too much I mean

Transcript:  pissed it do you use it and like it I use Windows 8 and I actually don't like  the tablet interface unless I'm on the device like the Lenovo Yoga that  supports it out of the box and it's it's one of those things where I think the  kind of device you use will dictate the kind of interface you prefer to use I  mean remember when they used to the crammed keyboards on the smartphone and  you had to pop them out the the sidekick and whatever they worked real well and  worked well for the Blackberry but as soon as you could get more screen  screen real estate and then have a functional virtual keyboard everyone's  looking I don't really need a keyboard I'm you know this predictive text  typing you know correcting my typos as I go along works just as well as a  physical keyboard and so I think part of it is maybe we just lose the keyboard at

Transcript:  century isn't it but we're getting to the point where it doesn't really matter  this this was actually the biggest thing I took from the Xbox one announcement  and that was that you had a strip down Windows 8 or the media side and a strip  and a game operating system both running in VMs Microsoft has really been pushing  VDI virtual desktop infrastructure which is an easy way to say that is the  ability to take anything your Windows desktop your OS 10 desktop put it up in  the cloud and bringing it up on any screen any device it doesn't matter it  could be your laptop your desktop your tablet your phone that's what most of the  the larger manufacturers are pushing to they want this this ecosystem where it  you can work the way you want on the device that you want and you don't  really have to worry about moving from one format to another if you want to  work with a keyboard fine if you want to if you find working with a touch screen  you can do that and you can be using all the same product products all the same  programs the same desktop that you're used to at work at home etc that's  that's a different way of looking at touch non touch one format or another  format now you're just looking at the screen what about things like the leap

Transcript:  Notch is kind of you know I mean everybody agrees that Minecraft was this brilliant  inspiration that came out of left field. I mean who thought that all the kids would be wanting to  play 8-bit graphic games. Yeah. It's huge. How many copies of Minecraft is he sold? I think 10 million.

Start time: 2750.72
End time: 2756.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

You know it's funny we were at E3 two years ago and I'm walking around and a guy with a beard and a hat walks by. We got a camera crew we're talking and I saw him but I didn't think about it and the chat room is going crazy.

Transcript:  Right. I know this figure only because in last week's issue of Time Magazine I have a feature on Minecraft. It's pretty amazing phenomenon. For which I went to Stockholm and visited Mojang and talked to Notch.  Oh gosh. How was that? Fun. Are you a Minecraft player? You know I did not know a whole lot about Minecraft before I started working on this story. And it was fun to do something where I kind of learned from the ground up and got to go to Stockholm.  And you know I've met a lot I've met and talked to a lot of Minecraft players for the story but I met even more people who have kids who are deeply into it.  Yes. Yeah. So if you don't play Minecraft there's a pretty good chance you have younger people in your family who do. And it's so much more than just a game. There are all these educational implications.  The United Nations is using it to help plan places that need improvement. Like in Nairobi. They're trying to rebuild like parks that are really dilapidated. An 8-bit? They're using Minecraft and then they'll say.

Transcript:  Did you know that Chad? Yeah. I mean. Chad is the host of our Minecraft show. I'm G-Craft. Right. And so I mean it's so simple because editing the game is part of the game so it's not difficult.  Which was a brilliant inspired move. Right. It's not difficult to give people the tools so that they can make the game their own. And so this makes perfect since I actually haven't heard of this specific story.  But I mean also I mean there's hardware design built into the internal wiring system within Minecraft. I mean kids are learning and or gates.

I assume it will be like Nexus has been in the past where they pick a partner.  Somebody else makes it.  And Google is in charge of the software.  But it does seem like a somewhat fuzzy distinction between that and a Galaxy S4 or an HTC One  with the pure Google experience.

But I think he didn't finish that sentence, but there's going to be.  There's nothing we've seen before we acquired them.  Pretty exciting.  Google says they're going to put Google Play Music and they're all-access streaming on iOS  in the next few weeks.  They needed to do that.  It's a pretty compelling platform.  I kind of like it.  It just makes us wonder, where's Apple?  Where's their iRadio they've been talking about?

Transcript:  One thing Google did that I really like and unfortunately they seem to have lost in court  is fight the FBI.  The FBI has sent Google...  It's an interesting story because it's all been...  What do they call that when you can't speak?  So here's the deal.  Gagged.  Gag order.  The national security letters, something that actually has been around since before the  Patriot Act, but the Patriot Act really strengthened them.  They were used for some time.  They were originally used by the FBI as a way to do investigations on foreign espionage,  basically.  They sent a national security letter to demand for data, but it's confidential.  You can't talk about it if you get an NSL.  There's been since the Patriot Act, since 9-11, there's been a huge increase in the  use of NSLs and not just in espionage.  According to the Inspector General, the FBI made 50,000 requests in 2006 alone.  50,000 NSLs in 2006 alone and almost all of them, 97% had mandatory gag orders.  That means you can't even say you got one.  So that's why we're not sure, but apparently it's Google that said, no, we're not going  to give you the information and took it to court.  They followed the lawsuit in April 22nd, and a judge this week told Google, nope, you got  to hand over the data.  Now, what's interesting is it's more complicated than all of this because apparently the 9th  Circuit is reviewing the constitutionality of NSLs in general.  So apparently the judge didn't want to make a decision that would in some way impinge  on that ongoing thing.  But according to the AP, Google has to comply with the FBI handing over data about a customer  or customers, including who the customer is, their address, personal information in response  to a national security letter.  You can't say no.  Google was fighting it on First Amendment grounds.  A little disappointed.  Google contested the constitutionality.  So the bottom line at this point is without warrant, there's no warrant, there's no court  oversight.  The feds can ask for information from Google.  They have to hand it over and they can't tell you that they did.  They're gagged.  Certain types of information.  I was a little unclear about this.

Start time: 3796.52
End time: 3820.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  And there's no FISA court involved.  There's no oversight at all.  And there's no warrant.  And the fear is, of course, that the FBI will use this not judiciously, but use it as a  phishing expedition, trying to find illegal activity.  And the fact that they filed 50,000 of these in one year in 2006 is kind of a little bit  of an indicator that maybe that's exactly what they're doing.

Start time: 3822.24
End time: 3835.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think the lack of any kind of judicial oversight is kind of the most worrying aspect.  Ideally, you would think that you would put some sort of restraint on it.  Even with the whole AP DOJ, they did get a warrant for that information.

Transcript:  Absolutely.  I mean, this has been a recurring theme on This Week in Enterprise Tech.  Brian Chee is a cloud expert.  I mean, he's been writing books since its inception.  And what we were trying to make people realize is they need to write to the representative  because if you denigrate the security, the supposed security of information in the cloud,  if you allow governments to seize it, if you allow governments to take servers, if you  allow them to take shortcuts around due process for seizure of information, it kills a multi-trillion  dollar industry in its infancy.  There is no enterprise on this planet that is being responsible about its data that is  going to put its information in a place that could be subject to any court ruling about  whether or not the government can peak on a phishing expedition.  I mean, because remember what you're talking about is you're not talking about a federal  agent coming to a court and saying, we think X company did something illegal.  We want to look at this.  It's a letter saying, we think there's something going wrong at this ISP.  We'd like to be able to look at all their users.  There's so many things that are wrong with that that it drives the enterprise into getting  away from the cloud, putting everything back on premise where I can control it.  If you want to get into my data, you have to get into my server room, which is all my  property so I want to see a warrant.  Thank you very much.

Transcript:  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  too long ago was during the mega case with Kim dot com.  And in order to get around not having a warrant for individual users, the federal government  tried to make the argument that they weren't seizing data, they were seizing servers.  And the data just happened to be on it.  It just happens to have data on it.  It just happens to have data.  If you try to do that in the United States, so I have a business in the United States,  in San Francisco, if you want to come on my premise, get into my server closet and confiscate  a server, I get to see a warrant before I let you take one step on my property.  That's just that's the law.  It's just that because it's now in the cloud and my data could be shared with other people  on the server that I don't really control or own, that the federal government can now  step in and say, Well, we weren't really looking for your information.  But look what we found.  But looky here.

There's some indication that they may that they probably will in fact, rule these NSL  unconstitutional.  I guess the bottom line for me is you should really you know, there's so many people worried  about Google, what Google, Microsoft and Yahoo know.  It's really the I'm a little more worried about what the government wants to know than  all of that.  It's good to see Google push back.  And I'm really thrilled to see them push back.  Absolutely.

If you're in public, you're in public, someone walks by you, was wearing Google Glass and  it happens to face recognize you.  It doesn't seem to me that you can make a complaint against that.  If you're in public, they could have done that.  It would have taken longer if they didn't have glass, but they could have done it if  they really wanted to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that traditionally, when you've dealt with  people in that manner, people don't have a perfect memory.  So if they see you, it's like they may not remember you because you have a mustache or  your hair is a little different.  If you had the same issue with someone who had perfect total recall, they could remember  every instance at any point in their life and recall it like it was just a second ago.  Everyone had that, but it would be kind of freaky because people would know who you  are even if you were eight or nine and 30 years later.  I think that's part of it.  It's just now that people have this ability to cross-reference you with this immense database.

It's the ability to go, who the hell is Roger Chang?  And have that in my glass.  So it's actually the information that's valuable.  And he says, getting somebody's name is not the hard part.

And it was a set of glasses that actually had a bunch of miniature LEDs built into them  broadcasting on a non-visible spectrum.

Transcript:  All right, let's take a break.  When we come back, I want to talk a little bit about Haswell, Xbox One, and anything  else that's on your mind.  Good panel for that.  From Twyatt, This Week in Enterprise Tech, Father Robert Balliser.  From Tekzilla and Revision 3, my friend Roger Chang.  From Techland, The Technologizer, Time Magazine's Harry McCracken.  Our show today brought to you by Gazelle.  This is actually a good time.  I think this month is going to be a good month for new products.  You should go look at Gazelle.  In fact, this could be your Sunday project as you're listening to the show.  Just Gazelle everything in that drawer, that gadget drawer you have with all the wires  coming out of it or the closet.  Some people have a closet full of old gadgets.  Maybe like Dvorak, you have a room above a gas station filled with old crap.  You can get some money for that.  Maybe a lot of money at gazelle.com.  iPhones, cell phones from a variety of manufacturers.  They're now taking tablets from not just Apple, but Amazon, Asus, Google, Microsoft, even  Surface RT and Surface Pro, Samsung, Macbooks, Macs, iPods.  Go over to Gazelle.  You want that new iPod Touch that just came out?  I bet you do.  Let's see how much your old iPod Touch is worth.  It's a 32 gig fifth generation iPod Touch in flawless condition.  Engraving or personalization?  No, I was too cheap to buy that.  $107 bucks.  That's great.  I mean, that thing I've had for a while.  So here's the deal.  Go to Gazelle and these quotes are good for 30 days.  iPhone 4S, 200 bucks right there.  That's a new phone right there for you.  They're good for 30 days.  So you can get the quotes.  It's not an obligation to sell it to them.  It's just you're going to get the price.  When you decide you want to sell, click the box.  They'll send you a postage paid box.  They pay the postage on anything worth more than a buck.  You send it back to them.  They turn it around very quickly.  Their data experts will wipe the data off too so you don't have to do that.  I've seen this happen time and time again.  Up your offer.  If they say, you know, this is in actually better shape than you said, so we're going  to give you more money.  And then they will send you a check.  You can get if you're in a hurry and get a PayPal credit or even, and I like this, the  Amazon gift card.  That's a good choice if you buy a lot of stuff on Amazon because they bump the value 5% on  Amazon.  So that's a that is a great way to get rid of all these old gadgets.  So you have some cash in your pocket to buy the new stuff.  New stuff is coming.  We know that much.  And I know another thing.  Your gadgets not getting any more valuable.  I hate to tell you.  So get the price now and then get the gadget, the new stuff next month.  As well as here, Intel announced it at Computex.  It is the talk of Intel's tick tock cycle.  The tick is reducing the size, the size, the process.  They got it down to 22 nanometers.  And then the talk is improving the code in there.  In this case, they're moving code in for power savings.  So they're going to get they claim 50% better power on the Haswell chips.  This is they won't say Haswell.  You won't hear it.  You'll see fourth generation core processor.

Start time: 4875.28

Speaker: SPEAKER_12

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm in deep trouble.  But you're talking about DDR4 support.  It has lower thermal dissipation requirements so you can you don't have to run the fan nearly  as long.  So that that noisy fan from the back of the S7.  That's pretty much goes away.  Lower power requirements.  So it saves power runs longer on a standard battery.  And one of the cool unspoken features is they're starting to move components off the motherboard  like the power regulator.  It's in the chip.  Yeah, it's in the chip now.  Right.  So it allows you to use smaller motherboards and more system on chip type type designs.

Transcript:  So this is worth waiting for.  It seems like also better graphics processing.  The the onboard motherboard graphics will be, you know, they say comparable to kind of a  low end Nvidia now.  Right.  Right.  I think this is well worth waiting for.  And it is.  I have a feeling what Apple was waiting for.  Rumors are very strong.  We'll see new MacBooks.  Some of the Ming-Chi Kuo or whatever the analyst.  That's not her name.  Anyway, said that we expect new very thin MacBook Pro retinas thin enough that you almost  could call them an error.  The 13 inch in particular be as thin as it can be and still have those connectors on  there with has well, which means I don't know, six hours, seven hours of battery life.  And there was some interesting news that the Mac Pros are no longer there.  They're going out of stock at some retailers, which indicates maybe there will be a new  Mac Pro channel.  I would love to see that.

That made a big difference, especially on the express card bus.  That thing is fast.  And then I put in a more modern video card in there and it did make a difference, but  it's still not.

Transcript:  Microsoft's putting one billion dollars into games.  We're going to hear more about the games.  It's a little challenging for us because June 10th, Microsoft's holding its press conference  at 930 Pacific in the morning.  Apple's Tim Cook takes the stage at 10 in the morning.  So I think we're going to do coverage on Monday, a week from Monday.  But I'm going to have stereo.  So it'll have Tim Cook in one ear and Microsoft in the other ear.  Whoa.  And split screen.  Blowhards and stereo.  No, actually, what we're going to do is we're going to have one of our reporters, Glenn  Rubenstein, will be on.  He'll be monitoring the Microsoft announcement and we'll periodically check in with him to  see who's who's having the better show.  You should have a little poll going.  We could.  That's a good idea.  We could have a meter.  And if the meter tilts one way, we could switch programming over to the Microsoft side or  vice versa.  Microsoft says we're going to put one billion dollars into games.  And that's what we'll see, of course, at E3, financing not only new studios but getting  exclusives for the Xbox one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, ultimately, I mean, sales will determine, you know, what was a more successful.  You're more excited about the PS4?  You know what?  I'm kind of over both of them at this point because, you know, Steam provides pretty much  all the gaming I need and my PC works fine.  What I am more annoyed about is that there is no carryover from I can understand if 360  games don't play fine.  But, of course, Xbox Live games that I bought.  I mean, the stuff.

Transcript:  But Microsoft isn't competing against Sony.  And that's what a lot of people are analyzing.  They're not.  It's not the one will not compete with the PS4.  The hardcore gamers are going to get both consoles.  It's going to be.  Or they're not going to care.  Right.  They're not going to care.  Exactly.  What they're really competing against is Apple.  They're competing against the Apple TV.  I think Tim Cook did make a big push at All Things D saying how they've sold 14 million  Apple TVs and half of those were this year.  But on the other hand, you have Microsoft, who in almost the same amount of time, so  in eight years versus seven years, will have sold 300 million Xbox.  They want to keep that.  They don't want Apple encroaching on their set top share, which again, is not really  going to be a push or pull with the competing devices to get media into your TV.  That's what that first press conference was about.  Like you said, it wasn't for gaming.  It was TV, TV, TV.

Start time: 5665.74
End time: 5674.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  At least Microsoft is at the point where they know they're not trying to sell you a box.  They're trying to sell you their services.  Their box is their gateway to get you to buy stuff.  And so what they're, I mean, you know, with everyone in digital, they're all kind of jockeying  for position in a way to make it the most compelling service that you will gladly subscribe  to on an annual basis.  And then you kind of just zone in on whether it's games, whether it's TV, whether it's sports,  you know, whether it's one fast or another.  As long as you use their network, use their service and use their box, they're fine.  Whatever you do on it.  Right.

Start time: 5717.28
End time: 5743.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's going to be fascinating with the Xbox One to see at whatever price it ends  up being, whether people who really don't care about games at all or hardly at all will  buy it.  Because the two most successful TV boxes lately have been Apple TV and Roku.  And for those, $99 is the high end of that price range.  And unless Microsoft comes up with some really new approach to subsidies, the Xbox One is  going to be way more than $99.

Start time: 5744.43

End time: 5770.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, so, but there are rumors, and this will probably be unveiled in a couple of weeks  at E3, is that they might roll in subscriptions.  So, if you sign up for basically like you do with cell phones now.  You get Netflix or something.  You get Netflix or you get whatever.  You sign up for so many years, you get a contract, you get the box at a discounted rate or subsidized  rate.

End time: 5824.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, you look at the Wii, Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft, and they're basically, they  are all after the same market, but only I think Sony and Microsoft are kind of going  after the big picture, while Nintendo is still a toy company.  I don't know what Nintendo is up to.  I mean, the thing to understand is Nintendo is a toy company and always will be a toy  company.  Sony is an electronics company, and Microsoft is software services network company.  And they're all approaching how to release your wallet from your hand to their bank account  the quickest.

Australia.  She's no longer my girlfriend.  Okay, we broke up.  So we don't need to mail those postcards anymore.  So I just made that up.  I didn't even know if you had a girlfriend in Japan.  I just made that up.

Transcript:  But apparently I touched a nerve.  I'm sorry.  I had no idea.  But maybe you have to send out invoices or marketing material.  Maybe you sell little voodoo figures of the girl in Japan on Etsy.  Maybe you have, I don't know, an Amazon or an eBay selling thing.  You're selling old military paraphernalia and memorabilia online.  This is a great way to do it because it's kind of like pro-mailing in your own office.  You don't have to go to the post office.  You don't have to use a postage meter.  You don't have to use special links.  You just use what you got.  Your computer, your printer, and stamps.com.  It's postage on demand.  You always have the right postage.  If they've got a USB scale, you just plop it down so you never pay more or less than  you need to.  You don't want to send a client a postage due invoice.  That's bad form.  It'll even suggest what kind of, what class of mail is right for different stuff.  So it really helps you.  You can print your logo along with the postage, along with the return address, right on an  envelope.  It'll take the sender's address from your QuickBooks or your address book or any of  those websites, PayPal, Etsy, Amazon, eBay.  It fills out international forms automatically for you.  I mean, I can just go on and on.  This is a really great solution.  For me, it does a lot of mailing.  And then the mail carrier comes to you.  You can even schedule free pickups.  So you don't even have to get up.  They take care of it all.  Stamps.com, you probably, if you get mailing at all, you're probably getting it from somebody  who uses Stamps.com.  We've got a very special trial offer.  If you've got a small business, we've been using it for years here.  Don't, now you're going to say, oh, that $80 offer on the front page, that's good.  I'll take that.  No, click the microphone in the upper right-hand corner.  Here's a little secret path.  Type in the promo code TWIT and that $80 special offer goes to a $110 offer, $55 in free postage  for the first few months of your account.  You get the digital scale, the USB scale.  You get a supply kit and a four-week trial of Stamps.com.  It really is a great deal.  Cancel it anytime the scale is yours to keep.  Stamps.com, it's the pro tip for anybody who does a lot of mailing.  Stamps.com, give it a try today.  So some good news, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, I think this was on Friday, decided  to get involved in the Save Podcasting movement.  And I wanted to mention that.  A number of companies have been sued, we have not, by a podcast troll called Personal Audio,  LLC.  An interesting story behind this company.  They have a recent patent, it's only a few years old, but it was based on a patent that  came out in 1996.  And EFF believes, as I do, that the patent that they got in 1996 is bizarre and bogus.  It's basically they patented the playlist.  So what EFF has decided to do, and I think this is the right attitude, is not to fight  them in court, but to go to the Patent and Trademark Office.  This is another defense, if you get involved, I've learned a lot about this in the last  few months.  If you get involved in a patent case, you can go to the Patent and Trademark Office,  if you have prior art, and say, you know what, this was a bad patent, you should never have  given this patent, and here's why.  And so they have raised some money, raised quite a bit of money.  They said they needed $30,000 to do this inter partes challenge of the patent.  In under 10 hours, they raised the $30,000.  They're now at $60,000 with 1,000 supporters.  We put in $2,500 because it could save us a lot of money in court costs if this goes  through.  I encourage you to visit EFF.org if you want to give a couple of bucks, help support this.  They are gathering prior art right now.  In fact, if you look at the website, there is a button that says Save Podcasting Prior  Art that goes to Ask Patents at patents.stackexchange.com.  And they've already collected, I think, some very significant examples of pre-1996 playlists,  audio subscriptions, things like that.  It's pretty obvious to anybody who's been in this business that podcasting wasn't invented  in 1996, that it's been around for a lot longer.  It's a bad patent.  I always thought it was a bad patent.  And a number of our friends have been sued, like Adam Carolla.  Instead of, you could fight it in court, but I think the best way to do this and save podcasting  for everybody is to just get the patent overturned.  So help EFF do that.  I have very high hopes of this.  When I looked at the prior art, I thought, yeah, yeah, oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This case is interesting because it's not a typical patent troll.  Most patent trolls are NPE, non-practicing entities that never made anything, never tried  to make anything.  All they did was they acquired a bunch of patents and then they go out and they sue  people.  Personal audio actually is a failed maker.  They tried to make a podcast device, an MP3 player, and in the process of doing that,  they filed for what is now what we know is an incredibly vague patent that should not  have been granted.  So on the one hand, yeah, they're absolutely a patent troll.  On the other hand, they're not, their lineage isn't that of a patent troll.

Start time: 6340.20
End time: 6409.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Okay.  I'm going to argue with you a little bit.  So the guy in 96 who got this patent is supposedly part of this company, but that's very common  with patent trolls.  You go to the original patent inventor and you say, hey, they are truly a non-practicing  entity in the sense that they never, never made anything and they never, and they currently  are not a practicing entity.  So you could debate what a patent troll is, but it's pretty clear that the companies that  are doing this at this point are doing it to make money off of what was clearly a bad  patent.  Not trying to make money by making something, but trying to make money by people like us  and other podcasters who are using something that's very obvious technology.  The Cyber Law Clinic at Harvard's Berkman Center is going to participate in this with  the EFF.  That encourages me.  We've got some pretty heavy hitters on this.  Of course, the company is going to say, well, no, we made something, but I don't think that's  really the case.  And they're going after, they say, we're just going after NBC and CBS, big companies.  No, they're going after everybody.

Start time: 6414.68
End time: 6477.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, but it was a completely different patent.  So yeah, I've done a little research into this because I've been curious what's going  on and I'm encouraged by it.  If you want to support it, I think the best thing to do is to read more about it at EFF.org.  I'm an ongoing contributor to EFF, but I thought this was a good one to give them a little  extra money.  And we were glad to help them do that.  I don't know how long the inter-parte process takes.  When we talked to our attorneys, we actually hired a very good law firm that does deal  with this specific subject in kind of a defensive way.  They said that this is a good approach as long as it works.  And the patent office is a little unpredictable.  But after looking at the prior art, I think there's a very strong case here.  So help the EFF.  It would help all of us and preserve what I think is a very important medium for us  all.  Hey, if you missed anything, as an example, if you missed anything this week, this is  the kind of stuff that we did that we'd like to keep doing.  Here's what you saw this week.

So if I go upstairs and get my Millennium Falcon wristwatch, the one that has a die-cast  Millennium Falcon, like a pocket watch, we have to pop open the top, would you identify  that as jewelry or as a cool watch?  Well, that's something else, but I don't think they're going to sell a Millennium Falcon watch.
