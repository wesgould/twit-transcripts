Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We're drunk.  So tomorrow, 10 a.m., and we're going to cover it live, Facebook has yet another, I can't  believe Facebook.  It seems like almost every week now they're having a town hall and announcing something.  No one knows for sure, but the rumors are, and I think pretty good rumors, Facebook's  going to do a Gmail killer, a Facebook email.  They've got the domain FB.com, which they apparently snookered out of the Farm Bureau.  Really?  No lie?

Start time: 292.42
End time: 295.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was hoping they would call it FMAIL.com.  FMAIL.  FMAIL.  FMAIL.

Start time: 296.46
End time: 298.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  No, they got FB.  I'll send you a FMAIL.  FMAIL.

Start time: 299.42
End time: 301.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a new kind of email.  It's FMAIL.

Start time: 302.04
End time: 304.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So I know you left Facebook and then had to come crawling back.

Start time: 304.42
End time: 318.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I have.  And now you can see why, because Facebook is where it's happening.  So I was going to say, are you happy now that you're back?  Do you think it's doing stuff right?  Or was it a symbolic gesture over privacy?  Or are you really digging it now that you're back into it?

Start time: 318.96
End time: 335.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, I don't dig Facebook.  There's this element of social compulsion, it feels like to me, that if you participate,  then your friends are there.  And I've only added friends this time, not strangers.  And you just feel like you have to kind of represent.  It's a tool to use.  I don't feel like it's a tool.  See, and I wonder if I...  I feel like I'm pressured.

Start time: 336.70
End time: 342.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I wonder if I'm insulated, because I never made it about my real friends.  It was like the answer is yes to everyone.  It's another broadcast platform.

Start time: 342.36
End time: 363.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You're Mr. Showbiz, that's how I used it at first.  And this time I decided to use it.  The only reason I came back is because I wanted to...  That was when Places came out and said, oh, well, now I have to try that.  And I'm glad I did, because they have been adding a lot of things.  And you cannot cover tech without covering these days, without covering Facebook.  You have to.  It's part of your job.  So, you know, it's...  I never worry about privacy personally.

Start time: 363.30
End time: 364.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is baloney.

Start time: 365.22
End time: 375.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John.  I mean, seriously, give me the one reason that you have to cover Facebook if you cover  tech.  Oh, Intel came out with a new chip.  Let's see what Facebook has to say about it.

Start time: 376.00
End time: 392.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  First of all, John, that shows how out of date you are.  We don't care about Intel's new chips.  That's not where the news is.  The news is in mobile.  The news is in search.  The news is in social.  That's the news in tech these days.  And I remember, you know, for the last year, people have bitched at us for talking about  Twitter so much, including you, John.

Start time: 393.74
End time: 396.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, because you were talking about Twitter too much.  That was the story.

Start time: 396.76
End time: 409.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That was the story.  And I think Facebook's a big story.  So if Facebook does Gmail, do they do a wide open mail system or do they do an extension  of Facebook messaging?  I'll tell you why they might want to do the latter, because there's no spam.

Start time: 410.92
End time: 420.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now, OK, so far, the proposal, as I'm hearing it from you, is that this is an email system  that only happens...  You can...  It's a closed email system?  Like, like nobody from the outside can...

Start time: 420.14
End time: 424.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We don't know.  We'll find out tomorrow.  But they have a choice.  Right.

Start time: 424.90
End time: 428.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Which is a smart thing to do.  Well, I mean, that's...  Well, I think what you do...

Start time: 429.46
End time: 436.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, then you already do, which is called Facebook messaging.  Right.  Right.  Although I guess anybody can message you, because I get messages from strangers.

Start time: 436.42
End time: 439.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They can, because when they want to add you, they can send a message for the adder to get  to you.

Start time: 440.74
End time: 455.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  OK.  Yeah.  I think that's how that works.  I think a two-tiered system.  One is, these are validated people on Facebook.  We know, because Facebook says, we know who you are.  These are valid, real people.  And then these are not Facebook people.  They're in a separate inbox.

Start time: 455.50
End time: 473.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It has to be open.  I mean, I mean, who...  Number one, people don't switch email that much.  And to switch from Gmail, like with my Docs and all the other things that come with Google  Suite.  Well, it's going to be hard, isn't it?  Whoop-de-doo.  I mean, they're going to get young kids to start up on it and get numbers.  But people don't just switch email like that, especially just for what?  An email?  Really?

Start time: 474.72
End time: 478.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Jenny, what are you hearing?  Do you think Facebook's going to do an email system tomorrow?

Start time: 478.50
End time: 513.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I'm hearing the noise from all the same places that you're talking about.  But the one thing I have to ask is why on earth would anybody trust Facebook?  It's a record of privacy.  Yes.  Thank you.  With email.  I mean...  Do you trust Google?  No, I don't use Gmail.  Well, I'll correct that.  I do use Gmail for bulk accounts only and for, you know, occasionally if somebody needs  to send something like a Google document.  But I don't trust Gmail with anything that I wouldn't want published or sent to the feds.  Who do you trust with your...  Exactly.  Who do you use?

Start time: 513.50
End time: 514.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Do you hush mail?

Start time: 515.01
End time: 516.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who do you use?  If I told you, I'd have to...  Yeah.

Start time: 517.46
End time: 523.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, you don't use...  Okay, because you're not going to use your internet service provider because that's going  to be even worse than Google.  You don't...

Start time: 523.76
End time: 526.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I do use my internet service provider.

Start time: 526.50
End time: 528.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, but you have a high security one?

Start time: 529.68
End time: 553.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have an ISP that I trust more than I trust Facebook or more than I trust a free service.  I pay my ISP.  Good answer.  But don't freeze the answer.  The domains are hosted in Canada.  Oh, well, that's why you're safe.  A lot of what we do at Boing Boing.  So there's different things that you can do to improve your email security and using free  web-based services.  I don't even know enough about hush mail to really feel fully trustful there.

Start time: 554.40
End time: 559.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right.  Hush mail incorporates PGP encryption, but you're right.  We don't know what happens at either end.

Start time: 559.66
End time: 571.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I used hush mail for a while before it felt like a hassle to go through and then get lazy.  I hate that I'm one of the cattle that's just like, oh, I don't know, I really should be  more private, but this is just so easy.  Thank you, Gmail.

Start time: 571.72
End time: 575.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Jenny, do you use a Canadian host because Cory's from Toronto?

Start time: 577.00
End time: 619.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's actually how it started.  But over the years, it's served us very well when we've been on the receiving end of slap  lawsuits, different kinds of lawsuits or legal threats intended to limit what we publish  and limit critical speech.  So it's served us well, but it actually didn't start out as a way to certainly evade any  law.  I'll say also, as far as web security, I'm a big fan of what the people behind the Tor  project do.  I use Tor every day, no matter whether I'm in this questionably democratic regime or  another one.  I travel to Guatemala, Africa, Asia a lot, and I like to take extra precautions wherever  I go.

Start time: 619.84
End time: 620.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You're really paranoid.

Start time: 621.94
End time: 635.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, I think five or 10 years ago, you would have expected me to come on the  podcast wearing a tinfoil beanie cap with talk like that.  But I think these days it's prudent.  It's like, yeah, I have locks on the door in my house too.

Start time: 636.16
End time: 637.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And it's government you fear most?

Start time: 638.71
End time: 644.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no.  I mean, it's government, it's spammers, there are any number of threats.

Start time: 644.56
End time: 649.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You just saying like on principle, it's just good practice to just do it because it doesn't  matter.

Start time: 650.96
End time: 661.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's good hygiene.  Yeah, I may not know every possible threat, but I do know a number of pretty stupid, easy  things that you can do to reduce the likelihood that those threats will cause bad things to  happen.

Start time: 662.44
End time: 669.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, the other way to do it is how I do Facebook and how I do an email, which is just assume  it's public and not put anything that I wouldn't want to be public on those services.

Start time: 669.34
End time: 694.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But even with that, I think there are risks involved.  I mean, whoever you connect to, you just said that you primarily connect to people that  you know in real life.  Even though you're not specifically saying, here's the information about my bank account  or here's information about my wife or my kids, the fact that you've connected to people,  that you have some kind of real world connection with something could theoretically be gleaned  from that that you might not want.

Start time: 694.68
End time: 705.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, and that's one problem with Facebook is that it doesn't seem to be constrained  just to the people you connect with.  Any application they run then has access to you as well as them.  I mean, obviously Facebook is a sieve.

Start time: 706.00
End time: 709.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And let's not forget one thing.  It all comes out in discovery.

Start time: 711.92
End time: 712.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I don't know what that means.

Start time: 714.78
End time: 726.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anytime there's a lawsuit, they go through this thing called Discovery.  Well, so if and they just grab everything they can and they go through all of it and  say, well, this is what's important.  And by the way, look at this weird stuff Leo did.  Let's throw that out.

Start time: 726.98
End time: 756.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Throw it out into the public domain.  It's the thing of how people that put at the bottom of their email confidential agreement  at the bottom of the email.  I'm like, why did you just waste three paragraphs at the bottom of email?  Again, assume everything's public.  Don't spam me with your legal notice.  Do not share this is between you and me.  Like, no, it's between you, me, Google and whoever else you cc'd on this email.  But now I'm getting a little depressed because it's the liquor talking.  It's the liquor talking.  Have another drink.

Start time: 756.86
End time: 759.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It'll make you feel a lot better.  It always cheers me up.

Start time: 759.94
End time: 768.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, I'm a little depressed because now I can't.  It sounds like I can't reasonably use any of these things like Facebook, Gmail, Twitter,  all the stuff.

Start time: 768.80
End time: 771.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Are you doing that much illegal stuff that you need to worry about?  And I don't know.

Start time: 771.80
End time: 773.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's the Eric Schmidt argument.  I'm just asking.

Start time: 773.76
End time: 775.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you don't do anything wrong, what do you have to fear?

Start time: 776.00
End time: 796.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But obviously that's all that's bogus.  And he should shouldn't ever say that because he's so paranoid.  But let me bring up something about that little dot, that little statement at the bottom of  some emails.  The reason that that's there yet, it looks kind of stupid.  But if there's again another legal situation that occurs, you can be kind of taken off the...  Does it insulate you?

Start time: 796.52
End time: 797.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Does it somehow protect you?  No, no.

Start time: 797.88
End time: 817.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What it does is if you actually violate that little statement, in other words, you got  the wrong email and then you bring it out to somebody, they just throw you on the stand  and say, well, this is actually legal.  And you're apparently a law breaker by doing this.  So you're now impugned.  I mean, everything that we do in this country has got some legal angle.  Wait a minute, I got my lawyer right here.

Start time: 817.72
End time: 828.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Is that going to protect me if I put the thing at the bottom of the email?  It's not going to protect you.  It's going to impugn somebody else.  He says it doesn't do doodly squat, I think is the term of art that they use in law.

Start time: 829.64
End time: 842.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It sounds like John's not saying that it actually does something.  What it does is it gives you leverage on the witness stand to take somebody down.  Exactly.  Yeah.  It's more, it gives you a tactical edge if something actually goes to trial and you have  someone on the stand and you're able to say...  I feel so...

Start time: 844.56
End time: 854.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I feel.  I only imagine how normal people feel.  What?  How do you laugh at that?  The liquor is working on these guys.  You seem to feel I feel.  You seem to say anything, but I feel you're laughing.

Start time: 854.84
End time: 866.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're stuttering how you feel and it's just really bad.  It's like we're at his first drinking party.  It's like we're at a frat party and he discovered the keg.  It's like, guys, you don't understand.  I just feel so much.  This is turning into an AA meeting.

Start time: 866.48
End time: 869.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I feel like I shouldn't use Facebook.  I love you guys.  I feel so helpless.

Start time: 871.28
End time: 881.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I feel so helpless in the face of all this because it sounds like the really the only  prudent thing to do would be not use the internet at all.

It's that when you live your life on the internet, you live your life out in the public for everyone  to see, and the only time it really matters is when it keeps you from achieving something  later on.  Well, I'm not running for president.

I mean, I wish Jeff Jarvis were here because Jeff is a great advocate for living in public.  He's writing a book called Public Parts right now.  His point is if we all just live in, look it, we all have the same freaking skeletons  in our closet.  We're no different.  We're all.  We don't have the same ones.  This is, I actually.  We have different ones, but they're roughly the same in general shape.  Not necessarily.

We need to scan.  All of your aliases.  Any names you've ever played.  And you don't have to play the game.  You just say, well, I'm not going to apply for that job.

The bad thing about Facebook is when things are hidden and you don't know how to turn  things on and off, it's about not having control over your content.  You know what?  If you don't want to get caught with dirty underwear, put clean underwear on and don't  get hit by a car.  That's the Eric Schmidt model, which is don't do anything bad.  Do what you want to do, but know that it might come out.  I mean, if you're a bad person, you're a bad person.  My attitude is, here's my feeling.  Here's my feeling.  I'm a good brother.

And that what it's going to become is that we're going to become bored with the secrets  that we discover.  Exactly.  And then we're going to know that everybody, we have an entire generation of working adults  starting right now, the 18 to 24 year olds who have been living their life, their young  adult life in public, who have all number of stories written about them, photos taken  of them,  and they're all going to be in the same boat, right?  It's going to just as it used to be 20 years ago, the idea of a president who smoked marijuana  was insane, just crazy talk.  And so you had to come up with some kind of hedge like, well, I smoked but I didn't inhale.  But then now it's like we're bored of that.  We're like, yes, yes, of course.  Can I just stop for a second and at least throw something in?

As soon as they can afford the internet.  Not necessarily.  I think they take a look around and say, what, this is crazy to do this.  You know, I do due diligence on people all the time.  Somebody, you were going to do a meeting or something.  I'll go look them up on Flickr and I'll say, oh my God, this person is a douchebag.  You can just tell by their photos.

Transcript:  Well, let me say two things.  First of all, I'm with you on the x-ray thing.  If I have to choose between the peep show and getting felt up, I always choose being felt  up.  It's awkward and they're ashamed to do it.  And that's the way an invasion of privacy should be.  You want to make it feel bad.  That's right.  That's right.  And that's how it should be.  But, but let me say what I'm trying to say about the warts and all and understanding  who people are.  This is a manifestation of the high definition culture that we're joining into.  And it's not just our privacy on Facebook.  It's the fact that we watch high def TV and you can see the zits on people.  You can see the makeup that Jay Leno is wearing on the Tonight Show.  Because the truth is-  We see things the way they actually are.

And I think that we all agree that the magazines and television and movies created a false  standard that was unattainable and has caused great pain for normal people for the last  hundred years.  Media has misused its ability.  This is an opportunity for media to say, and this is kind of what we do here.  Boy, this is warts and all media if you ever-  This is a false argument.

Start time: 1400.36

End time: 1430.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Wednesday, November 24th, 2010 is National Opt Out Day.  Now most people don't know on the X-ray machines, you can always opt out.  All you have to say is I opt out and then they give you a pat down search.  And if we all did it-  I do that all the time regardless.  Air traffic would stop.

And I said, I'd rather have him do it out here in public because just what Brian said.  He's already ashamed to do it and I feel like he's not going to go as deep.  When did this happen?  This weekend.  They're required to put their hands down your pants?  They just changed the rule.  He put his hands on it.  His hands were the least of mine.  Wait a minute.

UCSF has done a whole report on this, questioning the technology from top to bottom.  It's a disaster and it's corrupt.  And you got Chertoff involved.  Give me a break.

Transcript:  I'd like to say, so I've actually been refusing the scans since they introduced them in airports  that I fly into and out of pretty regularly.  And I was having dinner with a friend last night and she said, it's interesting to note  that the people who are really, really upset about the pat-downs, like emotionally involved  in how upset they are, tend to be more guys than women.  And I think there are plenty of theories that you could throw out as to why that's the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll also say that before the so-called more thorough or more extreme pat-down techniques  were put into place, I never felt like I was being groped inappropriately.  It felt a lot more desirable than going through that scanner for sure.  Because I don't know what happens with the images and I don't know everything about the  technology behind the machine.  I think that our country and our airports and our air travel business could do much  better with more intelligent security.  But that being said, I'm not looking forward to flying the next time I have to fly because  it sounds like things are just so much more invasive, unnecessarily invasive, and I don't  feel safer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Transcript:  To me, the most reprehensible thing here is not the fact that this book existed.  I mean, welcome to the internet.  The internet has bad things on it.  Nor is it the fact that Amazon finally decided to pull the Kindle book, the digital book  from its shelves.  There's plenty of other stuff that they don't sell.  They pull pornography from the Kindle bookstore as well.  But the really reprehensible thing here was what certain blogs that at least from my end  shall remain nameless did to wring as much traffic and faux concern trolling controversy  as possible out of this.  Sort of series of outraged editorials that were totally hollow.  The same kind of stuff like Anderson Cooper having Dr. Phil on to talk about the ravages  of pedophiles on the internet.  I don't have the stats in front of me, but I think all the reports that are out there  that children are so much more likely to be sexually assaulted by a parent or another  family member or a friend of the family than they are for the uncle's range guy on the  internet selling a Kindle book.  I got news for you.  This guy had sold like one copy before, you know, TechCrunch and these other blogs got  on it and everybody whipped themselves into a frenzy and it was on Fox.  It was on CNN.  Come on, Zenny.

Start time: 2309.44
End time: 2319.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I love you.  Come on.  I mean, Amazon did both.  It did everything.  So they guarantee you they did something wrong because they did everything.  They defended it.  Then they pulled it.  So, well, okay.

Start time: 2319.40
End time: 2347.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, and keep in mind that the defense was a policy and that policy got a big laugh from  everyone because we were talking about a book about pedophilia.  But if it was a policy about violent video games, read it again and think about violent  video games.  Read it again and think about the anarchist cookbook.  Read it again and think about, you know, Catcher in the Rye.  Any number of books that we've all decided that should be out there.  And it doesn't sound so silly.  Now, in this case, it was a nothing book that was going nowhere, that was written by a crackpot  and possibly a criminal.

Start time: 2348.00
End time: 2352.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So you agree with Zenny that the real culprit here is TechCrunch and the blogs that made  hay on this?

Start time: 2352.60
End time: 2361.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think we are the enemy here.  I think we're all a little piece of the rabble rousers.  And I think Amazon had a good policy.  So Amazon should not.  No, they pull stuff.

Start time: 2363.52
End time: 2365.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They pull pornography, as Zenny pointed out.  Right.

Start time: 2366.16
End time: 2383.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Should they not pull anything?  No, no, no.  Okay.  It's a hilarious policy.  I think it's a sensible policy, but that's not what happened here.  What happened here is we all gathered around with our pitchforks and our torches and we  started marching towards Amazon and Amazon did the one thing that makes sense in the  whole world, which is yank this thing right off the top.

Start time: 2383.32
End time: 2388.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But yeah, understanding that this is considered to be one of the most reprehensible crimes  that we commit.  Of course, of course.

Start time: 2388.96
End time: 2391.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So if it wasn't that, that's the difference in it.  That's what I said.  Like, I understand your point.

Start time: 2391.88
End time: 2396.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But they pull books on how to cheat on tests.  They pull books on pornography.

Start time: 2396.98
End time: 2400.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I guarantee they don't do that on principle.  They do that because they see some pitchforks coming.

Start time: 2401.56
End time: 2414.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So wasn't it appropriate, I mean, I'm playing devil's advocate, but wasn't it appropriate  for people who discovered this book to say, well, hey, Amazon, you have an inconsistent  policy.  Is this not a reprehensible act?  Should you not pull this book, Jenny?  I mean, doesn't that seem like a sensible thing to raise?

Start time: 2416.09
End time: 2426.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I don't understand why it was there in the first place because they refuse to sell titles  that are far less offensive, that have nothing to do with their affiliation.  So then why is it inappropriate for...

Start time: 2427.10
End time: 2433.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So why is it inappropriate for TechCrunch to bring this up and say, well, look, you  got a crazy policy and why are you defending this book, which is horrible?

Start time: 2434.60
End time: 2444.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look, there's a difference between raising a concern over something that's a real threat  and then just fapping traffic.  And that's kind of how it felt.

Transcript:  I was so worried about how this story was going to go.  Interestingly, too, Apple has a very different policy in their bookstore.  And a lot of times people give Apple a lot of grief for having a very restrictive policy.  I don't think that this would have happened in the Apple bookstore.  I don't think it would have happened in the Apple App Store.

End time: 2559.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is, I don't know.  You know what?  It's a lot like comments, right?  So at Boing Boing for a long time, we had wide open comments.  Anybody could post any comment they wanted.  While we were a smaller blog, that made sense.  And that wasn't a big problem.  As Boing Boing grew and the size of the network, the size of the community involved became  exponentially larger over the years, that open policy, we hit a point when it was no  longer sustainable.  We cut comments down altogether and we replaced them with a system where we have real live  human moderators that you could say, I wouldn't say that they're curating comments, but if  someone suggests something, you know, if somebody were to suggest an illegal act like  this, we'd take a look at that and think, like, is this is this harming the community?  Is this is this potentially harming someone?  Is it a personal threat to one of the editors?  Is it something that makes us log on in the morning and feel really uncomfortable?  Does it does it improve the experience for us and for our community?  Or does it degrade it?  So it's a little bit different.

Start time: 2560.24
End time: 2580.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I think in a nutshell, that's exactly the answer to your question.  That's why anything can't go.  That's why you took comments off your blog, Leo, because if anything goes, you end up  with this chaos, this chaotic mess that like Jenny said, is it was was ruining the  experience. And you can't do it.

Either you do what Moot did at 4chan and say whatever you want.  Right. And you see what happens at 4chan or you try to do what Boing Boing did.  And I think Boing Boing has done it very sensibly.  But you but you're also Amazon's in a difficult position because.  And for what it's worth, let's make it very, very clear.

I mean, this are not fiefdoms, I guess, individual city states.  You know, you guys know I'm an unapologetic one of those misty eyed libertarians.  And the Internet is the closest thing that exists to a libertarian, anarchical society.  And it's great to see everybody handle this universal problem in their own individual  ways.  Amazon's grappling with it.  They have their own unique take that they're that they're dealing with it.  But thank goodness it's not the government.

If money is tight and you want to stretch your Christmas dollar  the farthest you possibly can, are you going to get up  and drive out to the mall and pay retail prices?  Or are you going to go online, plan in advance  and figure out how to get the most for your bucks?  And if you're going to do that, where are you going to spend it?

Transcript:  One of the things I love about Squarespace, they use that Java  virtual server technology, then they it's I don't really fully understand it.  But when you go to a Squarespace site, you're not going to just one server.  You're going to an amalgam of servers.  And as bandwidth is required, Squarespace responds.  When I you know, Paul Thurotte's been having such trouble with his  his his website, the super safe.  I keep saying, Paul, just set up on Squarespace.  Just do yourself a favor. Squarespace.  The secret behind exceptional websites is both hosting and software.  Really exceptional content management system running on Squarespace.  All you have to do is go to Squarespace.com and take a look.  Start with a template, 60 plus designer templates.  But then the beauty of it is you're not stuck with a cookie cutter site  because immediately you can start customizing it to your heart's desire.  And I mean, really customizing it.  Squarespace gives you the chance to make a unique site.  Looks like a professional did it.  But it's just drag and drop mouse clicks.  If you know, CSS, of course, you could do even more.  But you don't have to.  You really get a lot of control over your site.  So start with a great template.  You can import your existing content very easily.  Squarespace has importers for all the major blog and website APIs,  including movable type, WordPress, type pad and blogger.  You know, the easiest thing to do, go to Squarespace.com  slash tweet and click the green button.  Try it for free right now.  All you have to do is give them a site name, a password, an email address  so you can recover the password if you forget it.  Do a little capture here. No credit card, nothing.  You've got 14 days to play with Squarespace and really  see what you like. Alex Lindsay was telling me the other day  he was in a restaurant that didn't have a website.  So he started to Squarespace.com, set up a website and said, here,  here's a password. If you decide you want a website,  I've done like 90 percent of the work for you while I was eating lunch.  It's that it's that cool. It's that slick. It's that easy to use.  I want you to give it a try.  If you go to Squarespace.com slash tweet, do the two week.  Please do the trial.  We arrange with our all of our advertisers for trials  so that you can try before you buy. We know you're smart.  We're not trying to sell you a pig in a poke.  It's best to try it first. But if you decide you like it,  sites start at twelve dollars a month. That's hosting software, everything.  Very secure because they do the updates regularly.  And if you use the offer code Twitch, you'll get 10 percent off that price  for the life of your site.  Many great sites use Squarespace.  If you want a tour, go to the examples page at Squarespace.com  and see all the fantastic sites. Squarespace, a lot of photographers,  great, great, you know, portfolio templates, a lot of nonprofits.  Squarespace.com.  Slash twit, we thank them so much for their support.  So if you worked at Google and you were a very nice engineer  and you said, I'm going to take a job at Facebook,  they might offer you three and a half million dollars not to.  What? Yeah, that's what happened. Yes.  We the other story that I know you were thinking about was a memo.  It's a lesser story.  But I want to hear about this one. A half million dollars.  Three and a half. Well, this is the interesting thing.  The guy who leaked the memo about the 10 percent raise  and the thousand dollar bonus to all Google employees was fired immediately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So the idea would be, for instance, I've created a couple of slash tags myself.  There's one that's a slash a tech news and there's one that slash twit.  So I'll do a search, let's say for Google.  And instead of I'll say Google slash tech news.  And then it uses my sources and my sources only for the search.  So then it'll search through my canonical tech news sources.  So I'm only going to get Google tech news stories.  Similarly, if I use slash twit, it would only be cases where people with,  you know, like you, Brian, with your blog or anybody would.  So it works for twit mentions Google.  So I think that that's kind of.

Start time: 3530.34

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK. But you know, the thing with with Call of Duty, black ops is that  some more it had been the case where  where Infinity Ward was the, quote unquote, the real developer for Call of Duty.  And then they all walked out.  And well, and then Treyarch would would be the the at bat whenever,  whenever they had after they had a major release.  Treyarch would come in and do a let's catch you or do Modern Warfare 2.  That's where things got interesting for me personally,  as is what I'd like to think a relatively hardcore PC gamer.  I really disliked Modern Warfare 2.  I felt really well, Modern Warfare 1, Call of Duty 4 was was very, very clever.  It had an engaging story and a big twist that really hit you in the gut.  And it was believable. And I loved every minute of it.  Infinity Ward's next release, Modern Warfare 2, was just silly.  It was a Michael Bay movie.  Now, for some people, Michael Bay movie means a good thing.  I'll go see Transformers 2.  For me, it's just silly.  And it's like, I don't care. Everyone's made of rubber.  And so what's interesting is Treyarch kind of stepped up.  They wrote an interesting story for this one.  I still haven't played it. I'm looking forward to this all here, say,  from where I'm coming from, but I'm looking forward to do it.  But it would be interesting if Treyarch stole some of the deep cred on this title.  Well, I'll wait for all the reviews to see exactly where it is.  I feel the exact opposite of Brian. All right.

So the gameplay is different. Forget the story.  I play it for the multi-user, the online experience of killing my friends.  The story is the story.  You play through it in a day and then you get online for months  and a year at a time waiting for the next Call of Duty to come out.  And that is true. If what you want is and for that...

I would say as good as the iPhone camera.  Five megapixels. Very good camera.  I think very intuitive, simple operation.  Very intuitive and smooth. Very.

There's a lot of little things.  They grok it. Did it break?  They grok it.  They understood it, John.  And and I think that what I'm seeing is Microsoft strategy and ad campaign now  makes kind of sense. This is a phone for non smartphone users,  feature phone users who want a smartphone.  And I think they're less intimidated by this and it's a little easier to use.  And I think Microsoft smart because 80 percent of all phone users  are still using feature phones.

But they did some things differently.  They still could have messed it up.  Oh, boy, we know that.

Start time: 3926.10
End time: 3956.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can look at the box a lot of times.  And the way that works is that it is a moment of of gestalt.  Sometimes in the olden days, when there was actually a lot of software  flowing around, I had to look at a lot of it.  You didn't have time to boot a lot.  And you have to make a decision on whether you want to review this.  And you could tell by the box many times whether it was a piece of crap  because the box just looked like a piece of crap.  There was misspellings on it.  The listing of what it did, it didn't obviously do anything.  It was it was poorly designed.  It had bad vibes on the box.  Let's test this.

There's nothing written on there.  I would have to open that box up and actually look at the product.  Oh, and give me the thing.  This minimalism sometimes pays off when it comes to the sort of thing.  But believe me, when I open the box, I can take a look inside,  quickly glance through the book.  It might be, you know, I may or may not like the product.  Here's what's inside.  Wow. How did you get it out of there? It's amazing.  Yeah. Yeah.

Oh, somebody's been playing angry birds on it.  It wasn't me.  I was told by a number of people, oh, it's terrible.  The applications don't scale properly because it's a seven inch display.  It's running Android.  You know what? They scale beautifully.  And this is actually extremely usable.  You have a black banana and a and a pretty darn good device.

So I have to say, this is actually quite impressive to me.  I think that this shows that Android, even though Google has said  two point two is not really a tablet OS,  this is running two point two, not not gingerbread two point three.  I have to say, I've been very impressed by this.

Transcript:  that was completely serendipitous.  I had a new high score. Congratulations.  I had no idea what I was doing.  Pro playing that thing.  Maybe I played a little too much of Angry Birds.  But this shows me that there's going to be some competition for Apple  in this tablet space.  I don't think a Windows tablet will do it, but Android actually does pretty nice.  That's what is exciting.

The biggest step is from zero successful devices to one successful device.  And the second biggest step is from one to two.  And from here is where it explodes and you get all kinds of different devices  that cater to that with the iPhone, didn't we? Exactly, exactly.  And so just as the iPad, I mean, I'll admit, I was very skeptical of the iPad  as a device that people would keep on them and use.  And obviously it was a big, big hit.  And I own an iPad now, but I suspect looking at this device  that this will be better because I do take this ridiculously big laptop with me.  If I'm going to take a small I don't want to take a full iPad  and this giant laptop, but something like the Galaxy would be fantastic.

They still have they still are telling people not to buy an iPhone 4  because of the antenna issues.  Said this is the best laptop they've ever tasted.  This is better than anything they've ever tested.  Looking at this MacBook Air. They tasted it. They licked it.  It's isn't that what Steve Jobs said? It's a lickable interface.

He did a whole hour long talk talking about the principles  that are used in magic and illusion and how Apple is a wizard of cooperating.  Because if you look, this is a deceptive base.  So when you look at it head on, it looks thinner than you only see  this edge on both sides.  Now, meanwhile, obviously it gets thicker at the back.

Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't even know how important those lists are.  But I think it kind of bums me out that the only female name  that you mentioned there, I think, probably the only one on the list.  Sarah Palin and Lady Nancy Pelosi is on there.  Why can't we have like one woman who, you know, like wears pants to the office  and does something interesting with science and technology to get recognized?  Yeah. You know, I read a blog post,

Start time: 4734.10
End time: 4739.90

End time: 4751.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I hadn't really thought about that.  But once once I'm going to try to see if I can find it.  But basically, her point was that Wired Wired covers are misogynistic.

Start time: 4752.66
End time: 4777.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, OK.  So the point she was making was that the magazine hasn't had a woman on the cover  just for like straight up science and technology achievements since,  I don't know, 1996 with Sherry Turkle, I think that was it.  And like there's been Martha Stewart and Sarah Silverman and some sexy covers  with, I don't know, well, and the current cover, which is  which is the story is about the story is about tissue engineering

End time: 4801.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't just that they must be really desperate to flog the print sales.  Yes. Sales must not be doing well.  And I think it's, you know, it's definitely fair to have this discussion,  but it's unfair to single Wired out as the only publication that  that suffers from a lack of smart females on the cover.

Transcript:  What? Give me a couple of women that should be women of the year  just so I can get educated on some.  Look, I mean, it's not my job to like pick.  Oh, I know. I know. It's not a job.  I was just asking in general, like, you know, because Sarah Palin  obviously is a joke.

Start time: 4814.34
End time: 4823.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I think but I think her point is, is time's job is to let us discover  people who we didn't even know should be the person of the year.  And it would be nice if more of them were women.

Start time: 4823.34
End time: 4826.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Transcript:  Here's the blog post, Cindy Royal, Cindy's Take on Tech.  There's the Wired cover, the current Wired cover.  And I thought this was such a great post.  Dear Wired, I feel like I'm in an abusive relationship with you.  I love you. You're charming, attractive and smart.  Everything I would ever want in a magazine.  Most of the time, you're harmless.  And I tell everyone I know how awesome you are.  But every now and then you slip and you make me feel very bad.  And then she you know, she's done a good job of putting together Wired covers.  There's the Sherry Turkle cover.  Here's Laurie Anderson.  But but those were more than a decade ago.

Start time: 4890.38
End time: 4921.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Why shouldn't she be on the cover? I don't understand why she. Yeah.  I mean, there's there's a lot of examples.  And actually, Cindy, in her blog post, refers to quite a few of them.  I think this is a legitimate question to pose.  Now, admittedly, Condi Nast is the publisher.  I mean, this is a this is exactly the kind of stuff Connie Nast, I'm sure, does on,  you know, don't they publish Cosmopolitan as well?  I mean, there's a lot. Oh, is that is that sexy publication?  Herstow's Cosmopolitan. Herstow's Cosmopolitan.  Well, they publish similar kinds of magazines, I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's part of why I love what we do on Boing Boing,  because we don't have to worry about pushing a certain number of  copies of a dead tree issue with every story that we write.  And we're able to cover people and things and ideas that maybe  aren't on the top of the heap yet.  We're able to pursue things that fascinate us.  And I think that that it's not diversity by design,  but it does end up yielding more of a diversity of participants in that conversation.

Start time: 4952.16
End time: 4974.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If we could swap roles and I could play devil's advocate here.  The and I'm very sympathetic to the point.  I would be interested to know, I guess, to know whether or not there's an unfair bias.  We would have to know because it's very specific.  It's clear you want women in technology or in science to be on the cover.  But I would imagine of all the topics that cover on Wired that that is a much smaller.

Start time: 4975.40
End time: 5001.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, she makes the point that when Wired did a major story about  Katerina Fake, who founded Flickr, she wasn't on the cover.  Will Ferrell was on the cover.  And that sells magazines. Now, Jenny, you're actually, I think,  being a little self-deprecating because this is the dead tree issue,  but plenty of blogs do exactly the same thing to generate traffic.  And it's to Boyn Blaine's credit that you haven't succumbed to that kind of, you know, link bait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But here's the deal. Wired is arguably the journal,  one of the journals of record of the tech industry.  It's all the other paper magazines have fallen by the wayside.  If you're going to encourage more women to get involved in tech,  you're going to you're going to put you're going to you're going to exalt them  at least once in a while so that there's some sense that there's a position,  there's a role for women in tech that it's not just, you know,  Sarah Silverman, Martha Stewart and Pam from the office that count, you know?

Transcript:  You know, you know, you guys can talk to your blue in the face about this.  This is very in big magazines, especially groups like Connie Ness.  They study this to death.  They roll out one of these issues with somebody you want on the cover.  And the cover drops dead on the newsstands.  And the guy who's doing the covers gets chewed out.  And so he goes with what you know, what sells.  I mean, that's what it boils down to. You can't complain about it.

They give you a sign, a numeric score, as anybody reads.  Consumer Reports knows to the phone the number one phone, according to their numeric score.  And I don't know. Do we as tech people consider consumer reports  a valid reviewer of tech objects?

Transcript:  Yeah, I don't.  When we're in PC magazine in its heyday from about  I'd say 89 through 90 to 2000, let's say  when we had this huge lab, but we still have a lab.  But it used to be huge when we used to go over every nook and cranny  of every possible aspect of these computers that came in.  And we compared them to the Consumer Reports version of these reviews.  And they were shallow.  They were missing the point. And they were largely wrong.  They I've never been a big believer in Consumer Reports after that.

The number one phone, according to Consumer Reports, the  Samsung Captivate with a 76 tied with the Samsung Vibrant.  I do like that Galaxy S platform.  Then the Droid X just below it with 75 points and the Droid 2.  The Evo with 74 points, the 3GS,  not the 4, the 3GS with 74 points.  And that's because they don't recommend the 4 still due to the antenna issues.  The Aria with 74 points, the Droid Incredible with 73, the Ally with 72.  These are all Android phones.

Start time: 5390.32
End time: 5419.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK, well, I think we're getting to the point where it's especially with technology.  There's so many different aspects to it.  It's easy for Consumer Reports or for any, you know, review institution  to look at numbers and say, well, this is two cameras, and that's clearly better than one camera.  But it's like it's how the device fits with you.  And if you're the type of person, it's how you feel about your phone is what you're into.  I am really surprised that the Galaxy took the top spot.  I that makes me I got to admit, I'm a little bit Android curious these days.  Uh huh. I want to I want to try it out. Uh huh.

You know, you just you're disconnected from everything.  But now with the Ford Sink, you know, in Android phone or the Windows phone  or an iPhone, you they were smart because they thought these technologies  are going to advance faster than we can in the car.  So what we'll do is we'll tie the car to your phone.  We'll use the phone's capabilities.  And that's where Ford Sink really is exceptional.  The it's got 911 assist through your phone.  You know, if you've got a podcast or music, you can you can call for it  by name through the phone, both my Android phone and that Windows phone.  The iPhone doesn't do it, but we'll read you text messages.  The whole idea is you want to keep your hands on the wheel  and your eyes on the road, but still be connected.  So a message comes in and goes, Bing, you got a text message.  You press the button and goes, well, it reads me something like those  auto correct message.

Your brain's doing stuff.  But then you're able to hear and listen.  You have these different inputs and it ties it up when you play a game like Tetris.  Meditating is just me.
