Transcript:  I have no idea.  It sounds like a money-making scheme to cash in  on the nerd culture.  If you ask me, I wouldn't buy a ticket.  I wouldn't support it.  So it's like Lollapalooza for geeks?  Yeah, honestly, I love going to conventions,  and I find myself seeing the same groups of people  at each convention, and it was painful to me  that we only got around to meeting each other  and seeing each other a handful of times a year.  So I wanted to take bits of CES, E3, Comic-Con,  potentially Coachella, sort of miniaturize it  and put it under one roof for one night,  and that's what lead-up is.  Wow, this is ambitious.  This is ambitious.  Yeah, we had one here in Los Angeles,  and it was a blast.  We had over 1,000 people come in.  Wow.  We had Kevin Smith, Chris Hardwick, Doug Benson,  Alex Albrecht, Felicia Day.  We did stunts and games and giveaways.  Epic Meal Time had somebody shout out  on a 500,000-calorie burger.  And then while all that's going on on stage,  there's music, and then in the crowd,  there's video games and cosplay and photo booths,  and it's one big party.  So that's what we're doing.  We're taking it to 10 cities.  Seattle, September 20th, Portland,

End time: 461.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not part of that.  I should have PR around me for what I say here,  but we're not part of that whole investment they had,  the $100 million investment,  but we're partnering with them.  Cool.  And it's...  We're going to be shifting to a bit more...  We are more broader What's Trending online,  and what we saw is it all came back to YouTube.  And so we're going to be...  Like what MTV was for music videos,  we're going to be to YouTube, and we're at...  You know, live daily, it's going to be a 28-minute or so live show,  curating the top videos that are trending on YouTube...  Oh, that's a good idea.

Start time: 462.14
End time: 463.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 464.79
End time: 475.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  including the stars behind those videos,  and the same mixture of, you know,  web and social media influencers and celebrities  and traditional stars as well on the show.  So it's going to be really fun,  and it's the beginning of our growth.

Start time: 476.20
End time: 481.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I keep expecting that somebody's going to do a talk soup  for YouTube videos,  because that's really the idea, right?

Start time: 482.00
End time: 483.21

Transcript:  Ray William...  I mean, it's a clip show of crazy stuff on YouTube.  So we're more trying to create what you really need to watch.  We're obviously entertaining and fun, yet informative,  and we're going to be doing Google Plus interactivity in it.  I'm going to have guest co-hosts.

Start time: 503.10

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, one, we like it because, you know,  for our switcher and what we have,  we're bringing in capabilities, bringing in Skype  for every single person.  If we want three or five people in a live chat,  I mean, I don't know how you do it with your tech right now,  but we were having to call one person up  and then, you know, say goodbye to them  and bring the next person up,  whereas this allows us to bring in everyone at once.

Start time: 528.61
End time: 530.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Got it.  So you use Hangouts?

Start time: 531.41
End time: 566.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a Hangout,  but we're bringing it into our live stream.  Got it. Cool.  Yeah, so we'll be doing a global Google Plus Hangout tomorrow  with YouTube stars from around the world.  We have a star in Peru who does the cute women fail in Peru.  We have a star in Hong Kong  who has like over a million subscribers over there.  Our beauty channel will have this YouTuber Olga Kahan Studio  and Will of DC.  It's a whole other world, but as you know,  just the ecosystem is becoming more mainstreamed  and it's just, it is where the media is.  It's not about either being a techie or a YouTuber.  It's like you need to be there to connect with people.

Start time: 567.97
End time: 578.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Callie Lewis is also here.  Callie, I feel left out.  I don't have anything big.  You got anything big and huge going on?  Exciting?  You're wearing bone conducting headphones.  That's exciting.  Right.

Start time: 579.12
End time: 625.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, always testing new gadgets.  That is my job.  But yeah, we've just been increasing  a lot of what we're doing and putting more out there.  We've also been working a lot with conferences,  technology conferences.  That's interesting.  We're going to meet our official media street partner  and go out there and do a lot of coverage from those events.  Like in September, Photo Plus is coming up.  So all photographers, Gate Beat is teaming up  with FroKnowsPhoto, Jared Polin,  and we're going to be live streaming from that event  and doing a lot of great coverage from there.  Oh, I'm sorry, it's not September, it's October.  But I knew that was coming up too soon.  But yeah, we've been doing a lot of that  and it's been fantastic.

Start time: 626.12
End time: 672.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So one of the things that,  the reason I asked about Google Plus, Shira,  is because Twitter, of course,  getting a lot of attention this week  by changing their API.  I'm just wondering if that's an opportunity  for some of these other social networks  to take up some of the slack.  Twitter is essentially saying to developers,  thanks guys, thanks for all the fish, see you later.  A few developers, I think probably mostly developers  who want to stay on Twitter's good side are saying,  oh, it's not all that bad,  but a lot of developers are saying, this is it.  There's no place to be a third party anymore.  Twitter really wants everybody to use Twitter's apps  and Twitter's pages.  And of course, it's all about ads on Twitter.  Does that make any difference, Shira,  or does the user community on Twitter  even know or care about this?

Start time: 673.39
End time: 710.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah, they do.  They've created a whole new economy  with all the third party apps.  I mean, people have gotten acquired,  I mean, millions of dollars,  because of their ability to connect with the API.  And I think we're going to see a lot of businesses  that are going to have to shut down because of it.  You're going to have a user cap.  You're just changing the whole system.  The reason people love Twitter  is because it was an open platform.  But obviously, with the business angle of it all  and advertising, the realizing,  they want people just to stay there.  They don't want people going to third party apps.  And yeah, Twitter was the only one that did it.  I mean, Google, obviously people stay  within the Google ecosystem  and within YouTube.

Start time: 711.30
End time: 727.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because Google doesn't really have an API.  You can't really build Google Plus clients.  They maybe looked at Twitter and said,  well, that was a mistake.  Although from an old timer's point of view,  it looked like that's what made Twitter a success.  That was the smartest move.  There's no way that was a mistake.  What, not having an API?

Start time: 728.20
End time: 751.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, to have an API.  Yeah.  That's what brought everybody there.  And this is Twitter's move to squeeze play everybody.  Notice it says your user limits are set  based off our approval.  I mean, you can get to 100,000 or go to 200,000  if you're being grandfathered in  or whatever the percentage is,  but it's up to their approval.  So that's their squeeze play.  You'll either pay to play them  or they'll just acquire you  or they'll see what's successful  and just build it themselves in-house.  They're saying if you're a new to...

Start time: 751.20
End time: 815.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, let's not get too upset about all of this.  I mean, yes, it has great roots  and it has that open feel from their roots.  But speaking as a business owner myself,  I mean, you have to look at this decision  from a business perspective.  Because that's what it is.  They can't just do the same thing  that they always have been.  Sometimes you have to grow and you have to change.  And if you love Twitter,  you want them to stay in business,  it is an expensive proposition  to run it like they always have.  So yeah, they do want people to use their ecosystem.  They do want people to pull in.  But it's not just using the Twitter website.  There are apps.  There are official apps that people can use.  And to be honest, I think that the people who really care  that it is an open platform essentially or has been  are all on Twitter.  So people coming in new,  I don't know that they're really going to have a problem  with using the Twitter app on the iPhone  or Twitter.com on their website.  I don't know. I have a problem.  What do you use on Twitter?  Because to tweet, I use TapBots for instance,

Start time: 817.10
End time: 827.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  which is so much better than the official Twitter app.  Do you use the official Twitter app everywhere?  I use the Twitter app on my iPhone.  I use TweetDeck on the desktop.

Start time: 828.54
End time: 833.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  TweetDeck is by the way owned by Twitter now.  Exactly.  But they haven't really been updating it.  I've been using it for forever.

Start time: 833.63
End time: 837.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They haven't really updated it though, have they?  No, it's still, there are things I don't like about it.

Start time: 838.10
End time: 849.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, it's still very heavy for sure.  And they've done a couple of updates, I think.  TapBots, I think, is a great app.  And they've done a couple of updates, I think.

Start time: 849.32
End time: 873.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  TapBots, which I think is the best client on iOS anyway,  iPad and iPhone, says, don't panic.  They say it's not as bad as it sounds.  We're going to continue with our development on the desktop.  They have been planning to put out TweetBot  for a while on the desktop.  They're in a different position because they're grandfathered in,  as you said, Kevin.  If you're a new Twitter client, you have to stop at 100,000 users  unless Twitter says you can have more.

Start time: 874.38
End time: 890.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, this could discourage innovation for developers  when it comes to Twitter.  This could give rise to a competitor.  Someone's actually trying to kickstart a paid Twitter-like service  that would promise to be ad-free and have a very open...  Yeah, I'm using that app.net, which I love.

Start time: 890.34
End time: 896.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's 50 bucks to join, which is obviously not going to keep...  It's going to keep it from going mainstream.

Start time: 896.12
End time: 914.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It could, it could certainly.  I mean, and Twitter could also say, listen,  for these app developers, if they want to open it up,  I mean, the app developers could kick the cost to their users.  If you want to be on this piece of software,  pay X amount of dollars, we'll use that to pay Twitter to allow you in.  I mean, that could happen.  Twitter could squeeze it from multiple directions, but...  Yeah, I think that's going to have to happen

Start time: 915.12
End time: 936.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because people, as they reach their limits,  third-party applications are not going to be able to rely  on advertising revenue for themselves  because there will only be so many viewers or users that they can sell.  So they can't rely on that increasing ad revenue  so they will have to absolutely charge people to use their service.  And why would you want to build your business

Start time: 937.10
End time: 939.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  on something that you know there's a cap on?  Right.

Start time: 940.18
End time: 949.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there's always a risk of building your business  on something like this, on somebody else's business.  Well, right.  And I think people are learning that lesson,

Start time: 949.14
End time: 960.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and maybe they're not going to be as anxious to do that.  It's the same thing when you build your business on Facebook, isn't it?  If they change their rules, you got no recourse.  Or the iPad.  You got no recourse.

Start time: 961.47
End time: 963.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, any ecosystem...  Or the iPad.  ...is a mentor.

Start time: 964.43
End time: 980.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I guess you're right.  So I did this thing.  Do you know about Status People?  Fakers.statuspeople.com.  This is an interesting thing.  I found out that 19% of my Twitter followers are fake.

Start time: 981.16
End time: 981.51
Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So I don't know.

Start time: 982.40
End time: 984.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 985.10

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No, no.

Start time: 986.10
End time: 987.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't want to know how many Facebook followers I have.

Start time: 988.30
End time: 1007.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But what it does is it underscores how much spam and junk there is.  Oh, now I'm logged in as WastedLeo.  The good news is WastedLeo, which is a different account,  that's for when I'm drunk tweeting, is only 6% fake.  But let me just show you the...

Start time: 1007.10
End time: 1008.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the more relevant one.

Start time: 1008.66
End time: 1040.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the one you should follow, because there's fewer fakers on there.  But Leo Laporte is now 22% fake followers,  42% inactive followers.  Only about a third of my followers are active, according to this.  How are they determining fake?  Well, they're not super specific, but the implication is,  if it's somebody that has an egg for the profile, hasn't tweeted much,  doesn't have many followers themselves,  although that's deceptive because the way these spammers...  You know you can buy followers on eBay, right?  I've known people that have actually used services

Start time: 1042.10
End time: 1053.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that artificially inflate your Twitter account  so that they can get deals on hotels.  And get free goods from companies.  For cloud.  They say, look, I've got 100,000 Twitter followers.  They're all completely fake,  but some people just look at the number, that's their metric,  and there you go.

Transcript:  When I pitch shows, people want in the deck,  whether I'm pitching a project for a media company  or a viral campaign or an actual television show,  within the deck, people want to know the social outreach  of all the parties involved.  Like, you have to have a slide that shows your Twitter outreach  because that's now important.

Start time: 1085.91
End time: 1108.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And what's really important is that Twitter doesn't care.  It's as good for Twitter.  So here in absolute public, here's a site,  enter twitter.com, buy 1,000 followers for 14 bucks,  delivery within three days.  5,000 followers, 43 bucks.  These are fake followers.  You want 100,000 followers?  That could make a big difference.  Somebody has 100,000 followers, that's under 500 bucks.  Certainly.  It's worthwhile if you have a business

Start time: 1108.22
End time: 1114.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Start time: 1115.11
End time: 1124.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I'm just saying that this is starting to add up  to look less and less good for Twitter.  I guess real people don't care.  I guess 50 Cent doesn't care.  And the people who use Lady Gaga doesn't.

Transcript:  I'll be very interested to see as the market moves from,  as Hollywood, as you point out,  moves from seeing just numbers to actual influence.  Because as we all know, people with varying degrees of numbers  have varying degrees of influence  or actual interaction from their audience.  But who's going to determine that?  I think that's the next step.  Is it clout?

Transcript:  If you look at, like, Justin Bieber recently celebrated  his latest album, I believe it went platinum,  which is, I think, is that a million purchasers  or something of that nature?  See, that's real, right?  You don't have fake buyers.  Well, but that is a very small fraction of a percentage  of his Twitter followers, if you look at it that way.  It's like, you know, a 4% engagement  or something like that.  Now, these numbers I'm completely scattershot on  because I don't follow Bieber as closely as I should.  Well, how many, does he have that many followers?  It's a character flaw.

That there's a rack someplace  with just a bad lesbian comb over,  and it's the Biebernet system just sitting there,  just managing him.  That's amazing.  Shira, what were you going to say?

Transcript:  By the way, if you guys aren't following  Horse underscore eBooks, he is the single greatest.  I agree.  You know about Horse eBooks?  Oh my God, I put him on Attack of the Show a while back,  and we actually had a character come out in a horse head  with a cigar and read the tweets.  It was a terrible bit, but damn,  if those aren't hilarious tweets.  So this is apparently, we don't even know what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's completely random prose in their tweets.

Start time: 1276.00
End time: 1297.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a piece of software that goes out,  crawls the web, pulls out random sentences and whatnot,  and then tries to pass itself as human.  But what's the point?  To get followers so that they can do sponsored tweets.  Eventually, you will see in their timeline  tweets that have URLs.  Look at these, closed open, closed open, closed open,  closed open.  I love trout fishing sounds.  Crammed with scrumptious.

Start time: 1308.40
End time: 1320.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but most of these don't have links,  but some of them do.  So maybe the idea is, well, this is an interesting way  to play on an internet meme.  They've got 95,000 followers, mostly people like you, Kevin,  who think it's hysterical.

Start time: 1321.16
End time: 1342.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's absolutely great.  I mean, most of my followers get angry  whenever I retweet horsey books.  The ones who get it are my favorite.  One tweet here, the 13th of August,  the decline and fall of the first Italian.  What the hell does that mean?  It's brilliant.  Guaranteed roof or oatmeal muffins.  So great.  Cruise ship career.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But what am I playing into?  Like, fantastic.  They have a piece of software that's going out there  and crawling the net.  I know what it is.  I think it's hilarious.  I love that a piece of software can have more interesting  tweets than Taylor Swift.  It's totally non-secretary.

Start time: 1383.42
End time: 1401.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She did a live stream on YouTube recently,  and the engagement factor was interesting  because she has, what, a few million followers?  And she had 30,000 people watching live,  which is pretty incredible for this announcement.  But if you think about the percentage of people  that are actively engaged versus the people following her,  I mean, that's nothing, right?

Start time: 1402.28
End time: 1412.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think that's one of the points we're making.  And clearly with the Bieber sales,  that's one of the points that you're making, Kevin,  is that this proves that these Twitter numbers  are grotesquely inflated.

Start time: 1413.14
End time: 1435.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's quantity and there's quality,  just like there's always been with everything  that's quantifiable.  And I think people are starting to realize now  that having 5 million Twitter followers  is not nearly as interesting  as having 100,000 hyper-engaged followers.  And once the services figure out how to measure that properly  and one rises to the top, then it'll get better  for businesses across the board.  Yeah.  Agreed.

Transcript:  So what do we do about Twitter?  Do we ignore the new API?  Oh, I'm going to do my Twitter audit.  Wait a minute.  Let me just see.  I was going to see.  So according to Twitter audit,  they're analyzing right now my follower,  oh, it takes a while.  It'll be done in two hours.  Two hours?  It's going to take...  I expect some seriously good results from that.

Start time: 1462.18
End time: 1473.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It shouldn't be that hard.  I mean, I can understand why it's taking time  because it has to go through each follower and say,  well, do they tweet?  Do they have followers?  Do they have a profile picture?  Does their profile picture a porn star?  You know, I mean, they got to...

Start time: 1474.62
End time: 1481.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wonder if that two-hour limit is because the API  is actually limiting how many calls they can make  against your profile because they can only do  so many per hour.

Start time: 1482.18
End time: 1508.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It could be.  So they do it similarly to the other one  where they take a sample, in this case,  a 5,000-person sample, follower sample,  and they basically score a number of tweets,  date of the last tweet, and ratio of followers to friends.  I don't know how perfect that is,  but I'll be very curious to see if it comes out  compared to the other one.  It's by Dave C. and Gross Nasty.  Friends of yours, Shira.  I'm sorry to interrupt you.

End time: 1524.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think along those lines, what's fascinating to me  is Twitter sentiment engines right now.  To me, that's a very hot space  because it's one thing to do a search and say,  oh, look, people talked about cold case.  20 million people are talking about it.  But what are they saying?  Are they saying something that's good or bad?  I'll tell you what they're saying.  Ah, yeah!

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, that's the same question that Facebook,  you know, has on their hands when they let anybody  saying anything about a page that they liked  show up on that profile.  Ah, we can talk about that

Start time: 1548.10

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no.  A while back, you know, how pages will just automatically  show what everybody is saying about that.  Oh, your interests.  I forget what they called it.  But, you know, that's the same kind of concept  that we have this issue of, okay, yeah,  they may be talking about it,  but what are they actually saying?  Right.  And in Facebook's...

Start time: 1577.10

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, maybe it is.  Yeah, I feel like the internet sort of eroded that a little bit.  I feel like that equaled the playing field a little bit  for negative press.  I feel like that could be equally damaging to a brand.

Start time: 1594.73
End time: 1607.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Transcript:  All three of you have brands.  Isn't it a little scary that how easy it would be  for somebody to tarnish your brand?  Is that a threat?  I don't mean taint your brand.  Just tarnish it.  My brand has been so tarnished and tainted already.  The internet knows that.  It is a little bit scary though, isn't it?  That, you know, it's hard to control this.  You have the ability to talk back,  but this stuff gets a life of its own.

Start time: 1634.05
End time: 1651.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, of course it's scary,  and that potential is out there.  But in all of our cases, we have the...  We have a bit more ability to control it,  whereas large, huge companies, fortune, you know,  500 companies or whatever,  they have less of the ability to control that.  Look what happened to Rick Santorum.

And even if it's someone, you're like, oh, it's a troll.  It's someone that's from the Midwest  that lives in their parent's basement.  There are nobody.  Nobody can still have voices these days,  and that can get scary too.  Right.  Here's a good example.  Play the game online, go through Reddit.  They can just totally troll you everywhere.

Start time: 1711.10
End time: 1730.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll be honest though, the reason I asked it  is because I didn't hear that it wasn't true.  And studies have shown that the further away  you get from the root story  when you're just looking at discussions,  you're looking at comments and reactions,  people tend to take it as truth  because they assume the commentary is based  off of a kernel of truth,  a story that did fact checking and everything else,  and the internet has proven that that's not entirely true at all.

Oh, that's a classic.  ...quote unquote creating  and just put a link on Reddit  and next thing you know, everything has blown up  and people are talking about it like it's real  and it was completely fake and contrived.  But that all tells us  and what we're just talking about  that you should put a little bit of thought into  what you believe when you're reading something  and then just take it and go.  I mean, it's something we all have as a habit, I think.

Start time: 1775.24
End time: 1811.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was quite the story.  Day four is a Swedish blog  that published a fake image of an asymmetrical screw  and all of the Apple rumor blogs picked it up and said,  look, what Apple's...  partly because they believed it, you know,  that this is something Apple would do.  I think that's part of what this...  It's like urban myth, urban legend, right?  It has to be credible in some way.  It has to tap into something like,  oh, yeah, of course an insurance company would pay  to defend my mom's murderer.  Of course that would happen.  Otherwise it doesn't carry any weight.  It's a very...  I just find it's a little scary and depressing.

Start time: 1811.36
End time: 1824.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It also points to how like just an obsessive  and sometimes pathetic need  to constantly be craving new information  about things like a new iPhone.  It is our fault, isn't it?  Like the fact that...  Yeah, I mean, we all perpetuate it.  Yes, it is our fault.

Start time: 1825.26
End time: 1856.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not just a new iPhone.  When you have a blog that you're updating 24-7  and you want to report about something,  you know, a lot of people want to say they're the first  or they want to bring people the inside track to a story,  but that doesn't mean that it's real.  And then we definitely need to come up with some sort of way  of sifting through all this information  and figuring out what's credible, not credible.  You kind of got bit by this.  A rumor or gossip becomes like, oh, that's like in the headline.  Like it's still a rumor, but it's enough of a rumor  that we need to report it, right?

Start time: 1880.10
End time: 1921.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it was taken down and...  A minute.  It was interesting that it was less than a minute later,  but it was still a story that someone would have just tweeted that,  but then deleted it.  It wasn't even like it was a blog post yet,  but it really proved it was a lesson, a harsh lesson that won.  Even a credible outlet like Gizmodo or all these sites  that we look to for our tech information will post something,  even though the person maybe who posted it said,  sorry, this is not real.  Didn't matter.  And yet it's still a story.  It becomes real.  It becomes real.  Anyone's just trying to find any sort of story this day and age.  And also...

Start time: 1923.71

Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Transcript:  When we first started doing net cams on Tech TV,  and we started taking calls from people.  Nobody had ever done that before.  And I think people just kind of weren't thinking that,  yeah, this is going to be...  People are going to see what's behind you,  and there are flashlights and unmade bed...  Oh, wait a minute. Never mind.  Callie Lewis is also here,  and sorry that she is.  And of course, from GeekBeat.TV,  and of course, Shira Lazar from whatstrending.com.  More in a bit, but first a word from our friends at Citrix,  makers of the great Go To My PC.  Summertime is a great time to get away from work,  but sometimes getting away from work  is not the greatest thing.  How many times you come back to an inbox piled with mail,  you wish you could...  Maybe I could have cleared that out a little bit  during the vacation,  or maybe there's some important thing your boss says,  hey, where's that PowerPoint?  You've got to drive into work just to get the...  Wouldn't it be great if you could access your office computer  anytime, anywhere, from even from your iPad or your iPhone?  That's what Go To My PC makes possible.  Mac or PC, before you go on vacation,  I want you to visit gotomypc.com  from your office computer, install it.  You don't need IT help or anything.  It's very straightforward.  By the way, very secure.  And now hit the road,  and you can access your computer anywhere,  anytime from any other computer or your iPhone or your iPad.  It's actually great on your iPad.  And there's some additional advantages to it  because it means you could, for instance,  somebody was saying, well, how do I run Flash  on my iPhone or iPad?  Well, you can't, but you could with Go To My PC.  You run Go To My PC, surf back to your office computer,  and you can run it on your iPad.  You can go to My PC, surf back to your office computer,  and there you can see the Flash.  It lets you surf securely.  If you're in an open access spot and you're a little worried,  just surf back to the office, surf from there.  Lots of great uses for it.  I want you to try it free for 30 days.  The apps are free.  All you have to do is visit gotomypc.com.  There's that orange Try It Free button right in the middle there.  Click that and use our offer code TWIT.  From the great folks at Citrix,  it uses NAT traversal so you don't have to open ports on a firewall.  That's why it's secure.  It's also SSL, so it's 128-bit encrypted.  That's why it's secure.  Never been an exploit.  It's safe.  It's fast.  It's effective.  And you can do anything you could do at work.  Send and receive email, access any network resource,  run any program.  Go to mypc.com.  Try It Free offer code is TWIT.  Do you ever think, Shira Lazar,  that people are just going to throw up their hands at some point  and say the internet is a cesspool?  I can't trust anything I read.  I give up.

They just want to create and put it out there.  And if it does well, it does well.  And gains traction, it does.  But stop being so connected and tweeting stuff  just for the sake of tweeting it.  I'm just annoyed at the journalists in some of these outlets,  and I'm not going to name names,  but that continue to try to dig up things  when there's no story there.  And that's where you find the blogs that are about the rumors  and the gossip and, oh, it's not confirmed, but maybe.  And that's not information.  That's not news.  And I'm so sick of journalists propagating that as news.  Right?  Name some names, Shira.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because they look at themselves as the next channel.  Epic Meal Time, I don't know, it depends on the brand,  but they could create their own app  so that the future TVs,  instead of flipping through a channel,  you're flipping through apps,  and they're one of the most popular apps  because of brand recognition and their following.  So why jump into...  I mean, I think in the future,  we're going to have still the networks that we have loyalty to  and they're familiar to the viewers,  but you're going to have the brands that we're seeing  being created on YouTube and different digital platforms  that are going to end up becoming the future channels and networks,  and we're already seeing it.

Transcript:  Well, that segues us to this story about Apple  trying to woo cable operators  into piping their content through Apple TV.  This comes from the Wall Street Journal.  Apparently, Apple is in touch with cable operators.  What they really want, I guess,  is what you were talking about, Kevin,  is access to cable content on your Apple TV.

Transcript:  Over the top box, everybody's fighting to be that last device  that delivers a signal to the television  so they can overlay their experience and their ads  and wall their garden and charge you for their experience.  It's going to get really, really muddled for consumers  in the next few years when you have to...  I mean, already, if I want to legally watch a piece of content,  I have to check 15 different services from Netflix to Xbox to Sony  to iTunes to Amazon, and it may not even be there.  So then I just go to my trusty Torrent site,  and there it is in every version, every flavor and high def.  It's going to get worse before it gets better.  I think it's going to come down to the Apple, Google, Comcast,  and Viacom's of the world.  Yeah, it absolutely will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think if they can achieve this, Apple,  rather than doing the Apple TV, the TV itself,  I think if they can put this in a set-top box, essentially,  and get the cable providers to work with them,  which is going to be really tricky,  but the fact of combining traditional TV  and the online content is ideal in all worlds, for sure.  And I think that the cable operators,  they certainly need to take another look.  I mean, the amount of cable cutters are on the rise,  but let's say we have the Apple TV,  and you have both your online content  like you do now, as well as the traditional TV sources,  those cable cutters, because who wants a half-working device, right?  Those cable cutters could actually turn the cable back on  and start paying for that content again.  So I think it would be ideal for them to work with Apple on this, for sure.

Transcript:  It's an interesting balancing act that Apple is trying to do,  because on the one hand, I think they want the...  Well, perfect example, Game of Thrones.  You can't buy Game of Thrones  until a year after it's on HBO, because HBO is very restrictive.  I think you're right.  The stick that Apple can shake at cable operators is,  well, you're just going to bit-torrent it.  People are just going to steal it.  If you don't make it available, they can't buy it.  But then on the other hand, these cable operators also realize  Apple wants to bring original content, like the stuff Shira does,  to the television set, disintermediating the cable operators  and making an effect.  Apple be the channel for content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and you're going to see everyone.  I look at YouTube with the premium channels that they launched.  I look at that as a play, so when Google TV comes,  you'll have something, besides for the advertisers,  that is premium and that is the future series  that you would otherwise maybe would have watched in the past  on a cable network.  But it's going to become very competitive.  I see them pitting people against each other,  besides the actual cable networks and traditional networks.  The need for original, like what Netflix is doing  with the rest of development, everyone's going to be finding,  like, what is that original series?  Like, oh, you're on Google, well, you can't be on Apple then.  It's going to get very dirty.  Very messy.

Start time: 2659.10
End time: 2687.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, look, it's the age-old saying  that content is king, and everybody's realizing that  yet again in this new, brave era.  And so that's why Apple is going the licensing route,  where, to Leo's point, they have to play nice to get the content,  and then eventually they can start clamping down,  charging what they want.  Google is going original programming with YouTube  as well as agreements.  Netflix, clearly, as they're watching all of these content providers  pull their libraries from their streaming service,  they're saying, oh, wait a minute,  maybe we need to fund some original content.  Yeah, you could say content is king,

Start time: 2688.22
End time: 2717.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and certainly Comcast bought NBC  because they believed content was important,  but I think ultimately the companies that provide  the big fat pipes into our houses think they're the king.  Correct.  They think, well, you know, look at the battle between Viacom  and, is it Dish?  Where Dish says, hey, look, we're the gatekeeper.  We don't have to let you into that guy's house  unless you give us enough money, and they don't.  And that's where the battle is going to rage, is it not?  And they're all going to kill each other.

Transcript:  I'm sorry, Sher.  What was interesting about that whole debacle was I thought,  for sure, this would be a lightning rod for Viacom  to say, you know what, forget it.  Clearly, users are seeking out the content they can't get.  We're going to put up the pay gate, give us 99 cents a month  or $5.99 a month, and you got it online.  And what they did instead was shut down their online streaming  of many programs.  Which didn't make any sense to me.  Because the deal is, I think they're scared of going it alone right now.  They're scared of consumers paying directly,  and they make a lot of money off DirecTV.

Transcript:  We'll show it on iPad today on Thursday.  We got a demo of Aereo, which is Barry Diller's company  in New York City only right now.  They won the court case against them.  Cable companies are trying to put them out of business,  so it looks like they'll be everywhere.  What you do, they have...  They figured out a way to make dime-sized antennas,  and they put hundreds of them on a card,  and they put thousands of them in a box  that receive the over-the-air signals in New York City.  And then you, as a subscriber...  And it's $80 a year, by the way.  Wow.  As a subscriber, get the...  Whatever's coming into that antenna on your iPad.  They have built-in DVR capability.  So now you have the over-the-air signal,  and you don't have a cable company.  You don't have a satellite.  You just have this little online service called Aereo.  And the reason they won in court is because the judge said...  Believed them when they said,  well, all we're doing is renting them an antenna.  This is a one-to-one thing.  You've got an antenna.  It's piping it into your Internet access.  That's all we're doing.  They're going to do that nationwide.  I think that's interesting.  But Wall Street Journal also says that Apple intends...  And this, I think, will be very compelling,  and I'm curious what our audience thinks of this,  in their set-top box to erase the distinction  between live and on-demand.  Basically, you just pick the show you want to watch,  and even if it just started a minute ago,  you can watch it now.  You just watch whatever you want to watch  whenever you want to watch it.

I mean, look at Replay TV.  We've had the technology to do amazing things  with shifting our viewing habits  and getting it all around on different screens  and broadcasting wirelessly.  We've had that technology for years and years and years and years.  It's not a technological issue.  It's a monetary one.

They got in bed with all the major media distributors  and their hands are tied.  That's why I'm rallying against TV.  That's why I'm rallying against tiered internet again.  The notion that we're going to have be paying per gigabyte  on these devices very soon, and that might roll over  to some broadband cable modem plans is ridiculous,  because that's where they'll get you.  HBO will offer their service, HBO Go,  for four bucks a month or whatever.  And then Verizon's going to say, well, if you stream HBO Go,  that's going to go against your data plan,  unless you sign up for our service,  and you'll get unlimited streaming through us.  It's an end-around neutrality, and it's disgusting.  It's going to cripple innovation in so many industries,  not just wireless industries.  But can you imagine going back to worrying about streaming  a YouTube video or streaming Netflix  because you might be over your bandwidth cap for the month?

They're going to go to Netflix and say,  we would very much like to have you be a partner  in this program on Netflix.  But, first, you've got to show us what you got.  And you know what?

We completely lost that battle.  But to the AT&T thing about FaceTime,  they're saying you can FaceTime on 3G.  That's fine.  But you have to buy one of our shared data plans.

They make you pay for the SIM card  or whatever the card that goes into the device,  a couple bucks there.  You have to buy the device.  You have to sign up for two years,  or you pay more monthly.  Then once you bought the device, you have to pay  to tether it to the bandwidth plan that you're paying for.  It's like ordering a drink at a restaurant.  You have to pay to go in, pay to sit down, buy their glass,  buy the water for the glass, and then you have to pay  for a proprietary straw and the rights to use the straw  in the water you've already purchased.

You know what's good is we're getting a little bit of the Hollywood perspective here  with both Kevin and Shira because you're down in LA.  The perspective on technology is very different in LA than it is up here,  and I'm sure that it is in Dallas, because it's an entertainment capital.  I think LA has been circling around Silicon Valley for some time now.  It's really heating up now.  Like piranhas.

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by Squarespace.  The new Squarespace is here.  Everything you need to create an awesome website.  I don't say this enough, so I'm going to say it now.  It's hosting to start.  People always say, I need a great web host.  I know a content management system.  I know it's software, but I need a great web host.  Start with the web host, squarespace.com.  Then, what's beautiful about Squarespace is the tight integration  between the hosting they provide and the Squarespace software  and the new Squarespace.  Just fantastic.  You've got to try it.  They've taken Squarespace into the new era.  One of the things they've done is its responsive design.  That's the hot topic right now in web design.  Why? Because so many people are looking at your site  on a variety of different devices,  from a 3.5-inch iPhone to a 27-inch display  to everything in between.  How do you make your site?  Do you have a special mobile site?  That's the old way of doing it.  Now, what they do is responsive design.  Squarespace is doing that.  Every time you put an image, for instance, on your website,  they size seven different sizes,  so it looks great on any device.  When you do the design, it's automatically responsive.  You can arrange your site the way you like it.  You can start with those great templates,  over 50 wonderful templates,  and then you can customize it,  and the responsive design is automatic.  It's built in.  You don't make a separate site for mobile.  Latest web technologies like HTML5, CSS3,  JavaScript foundations for beautiful, beautiful pages.  They've got the Google fonts, 300-plus fonts,  so you're not limited to those same whole four web fonts.  Integration into your social media like Facebook.  Instagram, Google+, for the three people that use it,  including Shira Lazar, Twitter,  and Foursquare, Dropbox, LinkedIn, Pinterest,  StumbleUpon, it's all in there.  You're just going to love the new Squarespace,  but they've really done a great job.  What's it all about?  David Lee Roth for Squarespace.  Yes, I am!

We can make a Running With The Devil website right now.  Let's do it.  I'll show you how easy it is.  Go to squarespace.com, click the Get Started button.  I'll pick a template, but you know...  Oh, what did they do?  Did they log me in?  What happened?  Now I did something.  Because I have a Squarespace site.  Maybe it got confused.  Okay, there we go.  What do you think?  Atelier, Tac, Native, Front Row.  I like the surfboard.  We're going to start with that template.  All right.  We're going to pick that right there.  And we're going to set it up.  And then all you have to do,  you don't give them a credit card.  Just give them a name and address.  Let's do a spam.  I'm going to do at leoville.com,  because I don't want to get a lot of spam.  And the password will be David Lee Roth.  Okay?  So there we go.  We're going to create a site.  David Lee Roth.  So you'll log in with spam at leoville.com  and David Lee Roth.  Now I give it to you guys.  For two weeks now, you can do anything you want.  You can put the sound up there.  You can put an embedded video.  I want to see some creativity.  leo-leport.squarespace.com  There it is.  Start building that site.  I give it to you.  Now, that's absolutely free.  Cost me nothing.  I didn't even give them a credit card or anything.  If after two weeks you say,  hey, this is a pretty great David Lee Roth  running with the devil,  I want to keep it.  Look at the pricing here on Squarespace.  It's just fantastic.  They've kind of revamped the pricing.  So there's really two different plans.  That's it.  You can go monthly or yearly.  I recommend yearly,  because that's the best savings.  $8 a month for the basic,  but here's the one you're going to want.  $16 a month when you pay for the year.  Unlimited pages, galleries, and blogs.  Just so you can have every David Lee Roth  you can get.  I'm going to give it to you.  I'm going to give it to you.  I'm going to give it to you.  You can have every David Lee Roth image ever created.  Unlimited bandwidth.  So if a million people visit the site,  you don't care.  Unlimited, yeah.  Unlimited storage.  Oh, yes.  Unlimited contributors.  And we can hook it up with a custom domain name  with the annual plan.  Either annual plan, you get the domain name,  and they do all the hookup and everything absolutely free.  So you got to like this.  Squarespace.com.  He's David Lee Roth.  He's running with the Squarespace.  Offer code, by the way, if you decide to buy,  do use the offer code TWIT8.  TWIT in the number 8 because you get 10% off  your first purchase.  And if it's the annual plan, you'll save the most.  TWIT8 is our offer code this month  for the month of August.  Love Squarespace.  Running with the devil.  That's a great song, but I'm never  going to be able to listen to it again in the same way.  Nope.  You absolutely won't.  That is hysterical.  I love that.

Transcript:  You know, when Google bought them for what?  It was billions of dollars.  Four billion, something like that.  going to be sued out of existence.  In fact, I remember interviewing the guys who  started YouTube before Google bought them, right?  Like the month before, Steve Chen.  And I said, Steve, how are you going to stay in business?  Because the rights holders are going to kill you.  And he said, well, we'll worry about that later.

Transcript:  I think the partner program for them  was really revolutionary because they created a marketplace  on YouTube for people that got a lot of views.  But why would they stay there?  They could have gone into merch or started their own little,  you know, used their own video players on their own sites  and move the community there.  But because of this partner program,  it made it really easy for people to stay there.  And that was the win.  That was a big win.  And then it was obvious that the other outlets had to be there  too because that's where the community was.  That was the future generation of viewers.  So it's changed in a lot of ways.

He didn't know it was Steve Jobs' house.  It just was easy to break into because Jobs,  very famously, he talks about this in the biography,  did not want to have a fenced gated house.  He wanted his kids to grow up in a normal environment  in Palo Alto.  So the guy who stole it apparently gave his iPad  or sold his iPad.

Maybe they do have too many people in the stores,  which I would say if they had just left it at,  okay, they fired these people,  then yeah, maybe that was the right move.  But then he reversed his decision  and started hiring people back.  More people.  So more people.  I don't know if...

Start time: 3975.10
End time: 3991.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, was this because of...  You think this has anything to do with the stock price  when they announce,  oh, our employees are paid too much,  we're going to trim back,  we're going to make some cuts,  and then they go,  you know what, we're going to rehire  because stock volatility,  it won't go down as much  with the announcement of a rehiring  versus the announcement of pruning branches.  Are you saying you think it was planned that way?

Transcript:  Well, whatever they did,  they did the right thing.  This week on Friday,  Apple broke a new record  for market cap and stock price.  Yeah.  Record, record.  The company's now worth more than $600 billion.  So whatever they're doing,  they're doing okay.  In fact, it's interesting  because at the same time  as Apple is setting records,  everybody's starting to look at Facebook.  In fact, Facebook stopped tanked on a Thursday  because a number of employees,  the lockout, I guess you get 180-day lockout  after an initial public offering  where employees can't sell their stock  the minute they could, which is Thursday.  They apparently dumped quite a bit of stock  on the stock market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  who bought stock on the secondary market.  Who got through like shares post  and actually bought employee stock  before it was publicly available.  But I think the real story is that people are overreacting  to the news of the stock tanking  because depending upon who you ask,  it's still hyperinflated.  The price is still incredibly high.

He says, dear Facebook employees,  here's the truth about your stock price.  He says the stock crash has nothing to do  with the quality of Facebook as a company.  I think that's probably true, right?  The market is reassessing Facebook.  And the stock price is going to be okay.  The market is reassessing Facebook  because of the, you know,  decelerating revenue growth  and the shift to mobile and so forth.  All these factors suggest Facebook's unlikely  to be the next Google,  which is what people thought when it went public,  so that's why the price was so high.  And now reality has set in.  He says, that's the...  It's not your fault.  It's the investor's fault.  And he does point out, as you did, Kevin,  the stock is very expensive, still 31 times earnings.

These days, a lot of companies just sit there and say,  we're just going to try and get the user base  and try and get an audience  before we even think about what we're worth  or what making money and all of that.  This is a...  I feel like it has some connection, you know?

Transcript:  The scary thing is when you talk to investors or VCs,  the out is always like, okay, well, you get acquired,  you go public.  And the fact that, I mean, how many percent of companies  should be going public, actually?  I think we overestimate the amount of people  that should be going public,  but it's like it shows, improves your success  if you go public when companies shouldn't be going public.  Staying private and possibly they might not even get acquired,  but we expect this overnight success these days  with these rock star web digital properties.  Here's an interesting thing.

You know, they bought the engine that makes the trip  and they bought the engine that powers kayak.  They want you to purchase your plane tickets through them.  They want a piece of that industry.  And this gives them an overnight database  that can rival Yelp or TripAdvisor.  I mean, they tried to buy Yelp and they failed.  So this is their new approach.

You know, they're putting a ton of effort  into the local search,  into trying to make sure your whole trip can be planned out.  Whereas Microsoft with Bing is putting a lot of effort  and their focus into the social aspect of search  where you can ask your friends for advice.  If you combined those two approaches,  what we would have is, I think,  just an amazing search experience.  Yeah, but who uses guidebooks?  Does anybody still use guidebooks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google's going to promote their content first.  So when I search for a trip to Turks and Caicos,  I'm going to get, it's going to be Fromer's data,  but that's going to pop up before TripAdvisor or something else.  Shouldn't they have bought TripAdvisor?

Start time: 4326.79
End time: 4340.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Shouldn't they have bought Yelp?  They tried to buy Yelp.  They did try to buy Yelp, yeah.  I apologize.  The price that I gave was for Zagat guides.  They paid $23 million for Fromer's, a little bit less.  Well, that's...  That's a lot less.  Yeah, that's low.

Start time: 4341.42
End time: 4353.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And there's been controversy over the purchasing of those guides  and propagating their content,  and there's their results to the top of the search engines.  Some people are very upset about that,  but that's sort of the nature of their travel play.  That's the nature of their beast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess, I understand Zagat for $150 million  because they couldn't get Yelp,  and they wanted that kind of information,  but Yelp is more up-to-date.  Maybe there's some problems, potential problems with Yelp.  It just seems like an editorially-driven guidebook  like Fromer's compared to crowd-sourced information  like TripAdvisor.  Which would you choose?

Transcript:  I think what Callie says holds true  is that we're going to see a hybrid of that.  It's clear that Google has tried to activate social results  within their search engine.  They haven't had the best of luck.  I don't know if Bing is faring any better.  I just heard about Bing today.  Yeah, I hear this.  I asked Jeeves, and he told me about it.  But I think that once Google figures it out  and they switch it on, when you get a hybrid of  here's our information matched with the social results  of your friends, that, as Callie said,  that's an incredible result.  That could be the new gold standard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sure, how long are they going to be around?  But hopefully, you know, this happened when...  just shortly after Google Plus launched,  so it's been extremely useful.  So as Google takes their time releasing  all of these vanity URLs to the world,  and it's going to take some time,  those things are extremely useful.

While we roll it out of here, I'm going to talk about Stamps.com,  and then we will regroup with a more intimate Callie Lewis,  Kevin Pereira, and me.  Hey now.  Hey now.  But first, Stamps.com.  I got to tell you, I do not go to the post office anymore.  You needn't go to the post office anymore,  because Stamps.com lets you print official U.S. postage  right from your desk with your computer and your printer,  and it is awesomeness.  You can even, you don't ever have to go to the post office,  because the post office will come pick up the packages.  You can even schedule free pickups.  It's just fantastic.  A 24-7 solution for sending letters and packages.  Buy and print official U.S. postage anytime you need it.  They have, by the way, and you're going to get this,  I'm going to tell you how you can get it,  you can get this USB scale.  You plop the letter on there, so you always have the right postage,  a letter, a package.  It's just fantastic.  If you're sending international stuff, they fill out the forms for you.  eBay sellers, Amazon sellers, really awesome,  because you don't ever have to type in the address that you're mailing it to.  It just takes that right off the page.  It makes it so easy.  If you do a lot of mailing, and I think any business probably does,  Stamps.com is fantastic.  Visit Stamps.com right now.  You'll see an $80 bonus offer, and you might say,  Well, that's a pretty good deal. I'm going to take it.  Don't. I can get you a better deal.  Do not go for that $80 value.  Click the radio microphone.  Use the offer code TWIT.  It's going to turn into a $110 bonus offer, including, yes, the digital scale.  You just pay shipping and handling for that.  It's about five bucks.  You get $55 in free postage coupons.  Wow.  You get the supply kit and a four-week trial, all from Stamps.com.  Watch and try it right now,  but you've got to use the offer code TWIT to take full advantage of it.  Stamps.com.  Never go to the post office again.  All right. We've rearranged.  Look at that.

Start time: 4863.30
End time: 4900.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think you could pick apart every single new gadget  or whatever and say it's a copy of something else.  What's that saying?  There's nothing that's actually new.  But there are some similarities in the dock.  I think that's part of the dispute, how Samsung does the dock,  but I don't think that that's necessarily,  and I'm not a lawyer or anything, so I don't think that's necessarily a...

Start time: 4901.52
End time: 4908.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 4908.28
End time: 4934.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I say Apple just move on.  Let Samsung do their thing.  I don't think they're using that dock feature  that they had on whatever phone it was back then.  Whatever.  It's just like move on.  Yes, you do have to stand up for your patents,  and you have to go through those legal rights,  but just move on at this point.

End time: 5003.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're asleep too, huh?  Listen, these kind of issues, they stifle the industry.  They hold back innovation. It's terrible.  With that said, there was a site that did a great rundown,  a comparison of what their phones were like pre-iPhone  and what their user interface and phones were like post-iPhone.  Clearly some design cues were stolen or borrowed  or iterated upon from the dock to the icons,  to the overall design of the phone.  Remember when the first iPhone came out,  it was seen as a revolutionary design,  and then a year later, it was...  Everybody's doing it.  Yeah, so clearly some things were stolen,  but this kind of bickering and infighting  is only bad for the mobile industry.  But I also understand a company's need  to protect their design patents.  I get really worried when I see natural human gestures  being patented.  The fact that a Wave could be patented  by a Kinect device by Microsoft,  or Apple could say, we own the chicken wing,  which shuffles your iTunes tracks.  Like, no, this is something that I can naturally do.  You shouldn't be able to own that.  That's where I get concerned.

Start time: 5004.16
End time: 5011.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 5012.10
End time: 5024.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's all that's going to be left.  You're going to have robot moves to delete icons.  You're going to have the Wave dubstep dance.  Like, these are the only gestures that are left.  That would be pretty hilarious, but it's going to be sad.  Well, it's going to get worse.

Of course I need it, because someone else has it,  and it's faster.  So they got me.  They got me in their little tendrils.  But I really hope Google takes them down a peg or two.  They're getting really good.  I love the voice assistant search war that's brewing now.  Siri versus the Google voice.  Yeah, I love that.  Bring that on.

End time: 5362.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  New Siri, though, the new Siri,  the potential for that API to blow the doors off of the way  we interact with services is incredible.  To go from Siri, find me a steakhouse nearby,  to saying Siri, book me a reservation for four  at a steakhouse nearby,  and send me directions via the navigation app.  That's something that it could potentially comprehend  in the next one.  I love that.  Now it's going to get interesting.

Transcript:  It's not that it couldn't do it.  It's just that Apple, you know,  maybe because of the vast number of people  that would suddenly be using it, I don't know,  they couldn't do it.  The only thing that worries me,  and I've whined enough about it,  and I'm not going to whine anymore,  is this new dock connector.  Now we know, we believe we know,  it's a nine-pin dock connector,  which will be incompatible with all previous  Apple iPhone cables and dock connectors.  And again, what was I saying earlier,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Good point.  I think that 19-pin connector was getting old.  I think they held out for a long while with that connector,  and I'm sure we're going to see third-party solutions.  It'll be a little dongle or something that will convert  all your boxes and all your cars  and everything else that has the adapter.  I think it was about time to go to a smaller adapter  that might be faster and charge a little quicker.

Start time: 5437.57
End time: 5448.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't disagree.  I think it'll be nice to have that smaller adapter.  I almost wish it wasn't proprietary,  but again, we're talking about Apple, so.  What am I saying?

Start time: 5454.00
End time: 5469.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would be astonished if it didn't.  I think it clearly needs to sync faster  the way these sizes are increasing.  It takes forever to back up your device  and get photos off of it,  so I think it needs to sync faster and charge faster.  If it doesn't, what was the point in changing it?  You don't back up your device?

Transcript:  All right.  We'll talk about it right after this.  But first, let's talk a little bit about FreshBooks.  I tell you, I've been a FreshBooks customer since 2004.  That's when Amber MacArthur told me about it,  because I was complaining, moaning about how I had to do invoices.  Oh, this is such a pain in the butt.  And you know what would happen is I would never do the invoice,  or I would do it late, and then I wouldn't get paid,  and it was just frustrating as heck.  She said, you really got to try FreshBooks.  I did, and now I am one of, what is it?  They have it here, I think.  Three and a half million FreshBooks users  who have used the service since then.  Three and a half million.  So FreshBooks lets you create your own online invoices,  which you then can email to your clients.  And I'll tell you why an online invoice is better.  First of all, it looks great.  But there's also a button on the invoice.  I love this.  It says, pay Leo.  Pay Leo.  Well, in your case, it'll say pay you, which is fantastic.  You're going to get paid faster, because what I've learned is clients,  it's not that they don't want to pay you,  it's that it's just as much of a pain for them to go do the payroll,  or do the pay, write the checks that it is for you to invoice them.  So make it easy.  In fact, you can even set it up so that you're automatically invoicing,  and they're automatically paying every month.  Now, if they don't, they've got great follow-ups.  You could schedule them for 30, 60, 90 days.  They send late payment or reminders.  That helps a lot.  It's very professional-looking.  And by the way, they will print an invoice for those old-fashioned people  who still want to print an invoice.  That's not a problem at all.  If you do time and expenses, it's great, because they will take you.  They have an iPhone app that will automatically start, stop, start, stop.  Or you can do it on the web app, start, stop,  and then automatically puts them in the invoice.  It's great, too, getting data out of the invoice.  Your tax accountant will love you when it comes to tax time.  I liked it because I was billing Canada as well as the U.S.  It does currencies, all the currencies, very easily.  I'm just a big fan.  I want you to try it right now.  Visit freshbooks.com.  You can try it free for 30 days.

But if they do, mention you heard it on Twitter.  Say, I heard it on Twitter.  Very easy, no obligation or no credit card required either.  30 days free, very simple.  Freshbooks.com.

Start time: 5696.10
End time: 5714.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the only reason I would ever publicly.  But it is.  If you say I'm tainted and your followers have no idea who I am,  that would be talked about brand management earlier in the show.  That automatically puts a stigma upon me.  And that I understand.  But maybe we do have Kelly here.  Somebody asked me, somebody asked me,  no, we've got to do it now.  We started.

Start time: 5715.10

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somebody asked me, and by the way, Kelly really wants to know.  So somebody asked me on Twitter.  I'm dying.  They asked me on Twitter, why don't you ever have Kevin Perera  or Adam Sessler on Twitter?  And I said, because they're tainted by G4.  But not, which is not, I know Adam, I love Adam.  It was not to say that I don't like these guys.  It was to say, I don't, because you guys were the face of G4  for seven years, I didn't want to have anything to do with you.  I don't want to have anything to do with you.  I don't want to have anything to do with G4.  But we had a nice exchange offline as direct messages.  Absolutely.  And you made me cry, because you said I was,  I never meant to hurt you, Leo.  And that made me, so I said, well, I'm so sorry.  I wasn't meaning to slander you in any way at all.  If anything, I was slandering G4.  By the way, so you left G4, why did you leave?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, there's a myriad reasons.  But I mean, first and foremost, I've got my own personal projects going.  I have a new show coming out on SyFy.  I'm hosting a new syndicated game show.  I've got a series coming out for an online thing.  Yeah, just super busy.  And to be honest, there was a little bit of fatigue  of fighting a broken brand promise,  which is something that was always an uphill battle for the network  from day one to the TechTV merger to today  when there's a new president and a reformatting and a rebranding.  And I didn't know that I had it in me  to hang in there for another, to be the ambassador of another brand.  It's a very difficult, stressful process.  It's kind of a failed network, right?

Start time: 5806.10

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, let's be honest.

Start time: 5808.28
End time: 5847.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, well, it depends on how you look at it.  It really does.  I mean, there's certain spreadsheets where it's absolutely successful.  There's a certain core audience where it has resonated.  They're reformatting yet again.  So that's what remains to be seen, what will become of it.  I can tell you that that merger was bungled.  It was successful in the sense that it kept the lights on for a lot of people,  a lot of good people.  Yeah, not me.  Unfortunately, not anybody I know, but yeah.  Correct.  And I, well, no, and to that point, I witnessed that band-aid getting ripped off  and saw how tragic and how mishandled that merger was.  And it was painful to watch.  And even more painful to be the face of.

Start time: 5847.10
End time: 5856.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't really, yeah.  And that's where I felt bad because, you know, you got in the middle of it.  And look, you're working and you're trying to get a job.  I was a 23-year-old kid who was given a chance to host a show, by the way,

I'm standing in the same studio as Kevin Rose and Sarah Lane,  people that I used to admire and adore on television.  And now they're my coworkers.  So for me, this was the greatest experience ever.  And then slowly, the wool was pulled down over my eyes.  And it became this thing that I was the ambassador of hate and change  for a network that was mismanaging a merger.  Yeah, that's where I really felt bad for you, actually.

Transcript:  But with that said, listen, I'm glad, I'm really glad  and I appreciate the opportunity to come on your show  and just sort of say hello because I've always respected and admired you.  And I didn't take the tweet personally, but I did.  You know, I think you understand why I had to get defensive in a public manner about that  because for years, and maybe I'm hypersensitive to it,  but for years I have fought the G4 stigma when in reality I was more,  I think, tech TV at first and quite an actual nerd  who really appreciated what tech TV was doing.  So I had to speak up.

But I know many people who know you,  including Kevin and Sarah, who say good things about you.  So I knew you were a nice guy.  It wasn't really about that at all.  I just, I didn't want the words G4 to show up on Twitter.  And that's all.  But because you're a great guy and obviously you're impressive,  you're very smart, so I'm glad we had you on.

It's not good.  It would break my ankle or something and I would be very bad.  You don't want to be there for that.  We're going to work on you.  We mentioned the sponsored stories settlement.  So Facebook got sued.  This bugged me.  I remember I saw I would get these ads of Robert Scoble loves hair loss for men.  And I thought, why does Robert know that they're using his name?  I actually asked him on the show and he said, no.  These are the spot.  Remember this and the Facebook you'd get a sponsored story  that would say your friend likes this product.  Facebook got sued over it and lost.  And the proposed deal required Facebook to pay $10 million to the attorneys  and $10 million to nonprofit groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation.  A judge has said that's not enough.  And I'd like to know what...  Is it going to be a circle down to the users?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Judge Richard Seaborg in San Francisco,  a U.S. District Judge, has expressed skepticism about the settlement,  rejected it yesterday saying he has serious concerns  and wonders where'd that number come from?  So I think it's good to hold Facebook's feet to the fire on this.  It was pretty...  I thought it was pretty inappropriate, the sponsors stories thing.  And it probably adds to the drop in Facebook prices.  Facebook has said that the user controls,  the ability to opt out of it, which they have added,  have costed $125 million in advertising revenue.  So, by the way, I want to underscore that.  So Facebook initially just used your name.  They really didn't...  They didn't give you any control over it.  They lost $125 million when a judge said,  no, no, you have to let people opt out of this.  That just shows you how much money there is  in this kind of stealing of your identity that they do.

My habits, my user data, my likes, my dislikes,  that's me.  So if you want to leverage that,  I should be making the money off of it,  not the site or the service.  And that might become a viable argument  to switching to a new upcoming social network  in the near future,  depending upon who you are  and how you want to manage your graph.

Now, I think that's what's really scary  and not too tangent.  I think it's somewhat related is that a friend of mine  went and looked at a career opportunities page  for Facebook.  He's a coder and he was interested  in getting hired there.  He just loaded the page, browsed through,  and then left the page and moved on.  And within a day, he received a phone call  from Facebook saying, hey,  would you like to become a developer?  We noticed you looking at our careers page.  Wow.  I'm sure that again, in the terms of service,  they're within their right to do that.  But if they're actively stalking  that kind of stuff  and then pulling out user data like a cell phone  and calling a user because they browsed a page,  that concerns me with what might happen  in the near future in brands and products.  No, I agree with you.  I think it's happening all the time.

A grade to terms of services based on what licenses and rights  they give the end user and what they can do with your content  and how easy it is to opt out or get out of the site.  And it's nice because you can at a glance  see that Twitter is orange or TwitPick is red  because they can sell your photos that you tweet out.  Yeah.  It's a nice at a glance.

I just don't watch enough TV, so I cut the cable  a couple years ago.  But I guess you could have watched it online.  I don't really know.  I wasn't paying any attention to the Olympics.  I have a business to run and shows to produce, so I feel bad.  I think despite NBC's best efforts,

Start time: 6434.18
End time: 6487.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  you could watch a lot of it online and catch the best stuff.  They tried not to.  That's true.  The internet linked me to every clip that I need to know  and every story that I wouldn't have known  because it was being censored by our broadcaster here.  So that was my Olympic experience.  The notion that they could cut away during the opening ceremonies  into a Michael Phelps, Ryan Seacrest interview.  Oh, that was so horrible.  The fact that they could do that, like, could you imagine  had the BBC or Channel 4 done that during a 9-11 tribute?  Could you imagine the uproar?  And yet, NBC was like,  I wasn't tailored to an American audience.  When a Chinese fencer is crying on the stand  because an intern, a volunteer 16-year-old timekeeper,  robbed her from winning a match, and you don't know about that  unless you use Reddit or Twitter.  That's a travesty.  I agree.  I agree.  But it's also the Olympics, so I don't care.  What happened with OnLive?

Start time: 6488.59

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I should have really led with this story  because this is a very bizarre story.  I don't know if you're...  So OnLive initially, and they've been around for a couple of years.  I remember seeing them at E3 two years ago.  And then again last year.  The idea was you'd be able to use their servers  to play high-end video games, even on low-end hardware  like a tablet or just one of their on-line devices,  because all the work was being done on the server.  So smart.  It was a clever idea if it worked, and it did seem to work.  There was some latency, but it worked pretty well.  But it mustn't have been doing well  because then they did a little pivot  and they created the online live desktop,  which all of a sudden was a way that you could use Windows  and Office on your desktop, on your iPad or your Android tablet,  which was very different.  Same technology, but very different.  Cloud rendering.  I mean, that's to me...

Start time: 6537.10

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Look at what Otoi is doing.  Look at what OnLive is doing.  Gaikai or Gaikoo, I believe.  There's a bunch of services doing cloud rendering,  and it makes sense.  We're going to laugh.  But weren't these guys the first...  Processors and all these devices.  We're going to laugh in five years' time.  Let it be rendered in the cloud,  and as long as speeds are fast enough  and you're not past your Verizon 4Gig bandwidth allotment  for the month, you'll stream it.  There's a problem.  You'll stream it in 1080p to whatever thin client there is.  You just need 60 frames a second at that resolution.  But you're right.  They had to pivot because they thought, well, gaming,  that's going to be the killer app.  But they couldn't secure the games or the controllers  to really wrap up an experience that was as captivating  as a PC or a dedicated gaming console.  Interesting.  So that's what happened.  That's what happened.  Yeah, I mean, and look, Hindsight's 2020.  If I was on live, I would have done touch screen gaming  applications for bars and licensed out.  Think of the way bars have...  The trivia thing that they do.  Internet jukeboxes. Yeah.  I would have done play any game you want or a cyber cafe  instead of a cyber cafe having to do 40 machines  so people can play Diablo III.  They can do 40 e-machines or thin clients  and just license the technology from on live and get it there.  But I'm sure there were license agreements  that got in the way of that as well.

I think it was two days ago, maybe, Friday, I think.  And so the employees were saying they were being cut  and let go and online was dead.  But in reality, what actually happened was that  they're going bankrupt and they're getting bought  by another company as a different entity.  By a guy.  By a guy.  A single guy.  By one person.  It seems to me that this is all kind of preplanned  and this whole acquisition is just meant to kind of  get out of the bankruptcy, essentially.

Transcript:  So there's some information that's recently come out.  This is from computerandvideogames.com.  Steve Perlman apparently said the problem was the servers.  That in order to make online work,  we had to have enough servers for the peak number of users.  He said, we literally bought thousands of servers  and all the equipment and the network to go with it.  We had plenty of them, plenty of bandwidth,  but we didn't have enough users to get cash flow positive.  He says, if you've got 8,000 servers and 1,600 users,  how are you ever going to make money?  Now he's talking about concurrent users.  So...

Start time: 6701.10
End time: 6715.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, servers are super expensive.  Right.  So they just spent...  They had to have spent a lot of money on that  and the whole cloud processing.  I mean, just...  That's a huge expense.  So basically, it sounds like they burned through

Even though the Transcontinental Railroads  are a great idea and obvious way to make money,  in the short term, they couldn't.  And it may just be that on live, as you said, Kevin,  it was bad timing.  They were in the right place, but they just...  The timing wasn't right.

Transcript:  The first wave crash is the hardest, right?  I mean, they're the early adopters  and so were their customers.  And unfortunately, that might have been too much too soon.  Maybe now they'll scale back and rethink.  But I've used on live before  and had been thoroughly impressed by the experience.  As a gaming platform is one thing,  but as a video platform, as a social viewing platform,  as a VOD platform, that was really fascinating.  Yeah, because you can...  I mean, look, you could press a button on live,  and it would zoom you out to show you  100 concurrent video streams of live people, live playing.  And you could tap on anyone.  It would zoom in full screen, high-def,  and you could press a button and launch the game they were too.  So imagine that for co-viewing.  Imagine that for all the live streams that are happening  on various online video platforms like this one.  Someone could just tap, zoom in,  if they want to watch the show, they're watching as well.  Tap, zoom out, and there's every other show  being broadcast related to that.  That's the power of cloud rendering.  It's not going to drain any extra power  from the processor of this or from your computer.  But the problem is that it did require thousands of servers  and they didn't hit that critical mass point.

I think that's where we're heading.  It's just a little cost prohibitive right now.

These are quotes from the meeting that he had,  the all-hands meeting he had on Friday.  I guess somebody leaked.  Perlman is of the opinion that OnLive is,  quote, the entire future of everything,  or at least the buyer believes that.  I'm sorry, the buyer believes that,  but couldn't afford to rehire all of the 200 people  that OnLive employed, so that's why the layoffs.  I think they rehired maybe a quarter of the total.
