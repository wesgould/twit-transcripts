Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Minimally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that would be like the baseline. And then anything over and above that he can keep an eye on too.  That lovely female voice. We don't get many of those around here. It's Lisa Bettany from MostlyLisa.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hello.  And Vancouver.  And Vancouver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And wearing his Blue Beetle outfit and looking awfully swelled, Mr. Will Wheaton of Will Wheaton.  Hello.  Hello, sir. How are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm very well. Thank you. It's awesome that we were able to make this happen today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Never been on Twi2 before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know. It's so weird considering all the times we did screensavers together and all the friends we have in common.  Clearly, this was a massive error in the space-time continuum that needed correcting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I'm glad you made it. And it's really great to have you.  Now you know the way. Maybe we can get you on more often because I love it. It's just really great to have you.  Will, what I love about you. What's the name of your book?  Easy for you to say.  I am not Spock, right?  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're probably thinking about my book called Just a Geek.  Just a Geek.  I am not Spock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here's a guy. That would actually be a good name for a book.  Sorry, it took me a while.  But Just a Geek is, I think, exactly it. That's kind of how you self-identify now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is. I've been trying for years after spending the first, maybe, I don't know, two-thirds of my life, feeling like I had to apologize for being a geek and that all geeks had to apologize for these things that we love.  I just decided that I was not going to be ashamed of it and I wasn't going to be sorry for it and that I was going to help.  I was going to join the movement.  Like, I'm not leading it or anything.  It was already kind of going on, but I thought I would join the movement to make geek a non-pejorative term and something to be proud of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think Bill Gates did a lot by becoming the richest man in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but he was kind of a dick about the whole thing, too.  You know, I mean, it's like it's great.  It's great that he's the richest man in the world.  Like, good for him.  And I guess without him, there wouldn't be an Xbox 360.  So I'm grateful for that.  I know about that.  But well, I mean, with no Microsoft, I don't know if the 360, maybe, you know, this is like the butterfly flapping its wings.  You know, maybe things would be a little bit different than they are right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, but talk about being a dick.  Bill Gates speaking at the TED conference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, biggest dick move ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So he's talking about malaria and you know how he and his foundation are trying to eradicate malaria.  Brings out, whips out a jar of mosquitoes, lets him out, says, no, poor people shouldn't be the only people who have to suffer.  And lets him out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, that's like why not just serve a nice big buffet and then tell everyone that you've deliberately infected it with salmonella?  Because not only people who have, you know, who live in third world countries have to deal with that.  Like, you can make your point in a much more acceptable way.  But he did get a lot of press.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's something overlooked in the story, and I think the press is part of the problem.  What's that?  For not pointing this out.  It's illegal to import mosquitoes or any kind of disease vector into the state of California.  It violates a number of state and federal laws.  I know two or three people that have filed formal complaints against Bill in this idiotic stunt.  You're kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You mean people in the TED audience?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, just people who witnessed it on TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're, oh, that's very interesting.  Well, you know, I'm sure they weren't malaria infected, but has anybody?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't make any difference.  There's 50 different kinds of vectors that mosquitoes carry.  Not malaria, not the least of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's not like he these are irradiated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You cannot bring bugs into the state of California period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, maybe he got them in California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, now if he got him in California, that's different.  But I don't think he did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe he went to the mosquito shack on 101.  It's right there, like right outside of Palo Alto.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The mosquito shack, you know, where they also serve burgers, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They do, and I understand they're delicious.  Are mosquitoes right or wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  As long as there are mosquitoes.  But you make the point, which I think everybody in the audience must have been thinking,  is but we don't know.  I mean, there could be any number of things.  West Nile, this mosquito could be carrying, you don't know.  How do you know?  What do you examine each one individually with forceps?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe he bred them himself.  Well, listen, in his defense, who heard of Bill Gates before Ted?  He's famous now.  I mean, really, you know, everybody's following him on Twitter.  I might just have to go do a Chris Crocker-esque leave Bill Gates alone video  to kind of put the whole thing into perspective.  Lisa, did you go to Ted?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did you go to Ted, Will?  I did not.  John C. Dvorak, did you go to Ted?  No.  Okay, we're not at Ted.  Would you go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you know, I listened to all the talks online.  I love the Ted Talks.  Yeah.  So who actually meet, you know, like do you guys look forward to going to big trade shows?  Like something like CES?  I know John does it because he's always whining about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I love it.  That and sticking pins in my eyes are two of my favorite things.  Okay, so all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So we agree on this.  I hate going to trade shows.  I can't stand it.  And one of the things I really like about Ted is that all the talks that I would have  to go endure the crowds and the expense to go sit through, I can just get them all online.  So, you know, and also when I listen to Ted at home, 100% fewer mosquitoes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, the one thing that you go to these events for though,  is there's a lot of it's for socialization.  You go there.  So you can see all these people you haven't seen for maybe a year and then you can promise  to see them during the year, go have a lunch, have dinner and then never see them again  for another year.  You go to the event the next year and you say the same thing and that goes on forever  and that kind of maintains some sort of weird relationship.  I'd go to Ted if I got invited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'd like to go to Ted.  Ted looks really cool.  Why don't you go?  It's $6,000.  That's why.  Oh, peanuts for you.  Jay Adelson and Kevin Rose, Revision 3 went.  By the way, that would have hired entire staff, people that they've laid off.  Did anybody go to DragonCon?  No, but you lost Lisa.  You lost Lisa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  DragonCon happens in August and it actually directly conflicts with the Penny Arcade Expo  that I can't miss.  Penny Arcade Expo is like my Woodstock.  You're like, I have to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Patrick's a big Penny Arcade fan too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh, by the way, somebody points out you can also get anaphylactic shock.  Some people are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, if you're allergic to mosquitoes.  Yeah.  Man.  So, I mean, it seemed like a kind of a dick move, may we say.  No, just being silly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think I'm going to fill up a jar with like peanuts that are painted to look like ladybugs  and I'm going to dump them out on the floor at the next conference I go to and I'm going to say,  you know, you don't have to be at TED to be exposed to a stupid publicity stunt.  I better write that down.  That's good.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So here, talk about stupid.  I love this.  The Nielsen Corporation, which does the ratings, right?  The television ratings.  I guess this might have been precipitated by an executive who hit the reply all button  a couple of months ago and wrote some stupid things because the Nielsen Corporation,  with 35,000 employees worldwide, has removed the reply to all button from its outlook.  There's no longer a reply to all button on any of their computers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a bold move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's kind of a strange thing to do.  I can understand it.  If you've ever worked in a big corporation, which none of you have.  It doesn't make sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that reply to all.  Sometimes you get, there's a little messages that go around in big corporations, general  motors, let's say you got 20 people on this, on let's say having a discussion over email,  even though I know you and Lisa, neither one of you use email.  How do you know that?  I've been trying to correspond with her about something and she's.  She and I email all the time.  She's on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She talks to me all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I sent Leo an email this morning and he replied to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He replies on Sunday to email ladies and gentlemen out there who want to get a hold of Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now, you know what I just put on?  You know, it's funny you should say that because I just hired my sister to answer all my email  and I just put one of those responders, which I've always hated that says I'm not going  to read your email, but my sister is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Doing gates.  So anyway, so you have like 20 people and you want to reply to all.  We have you type in their name time after time.  It doesn't make any sense.  I guess you can cut and paste.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Would it make more sense to train the executives?  Tell them don't do that.  Yeah, but if you're going to try if you're going to try to do that, you know, you may  as well train them to, you know, I don't know care about their, you know, mid-level employees.  That's never going to happen.  Maybe if they would just if there was a greater knowledge and better understanding of the  most useful line in the email header, the BCC line, then it wouldn't be such an enormous  issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, maybe that's a good point.  It drives me take the BCC out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or just, you know, certainly they can afford to reconfigure their mail server and just  change the reply all so that it goes to you know, if it goes out to BCC or train them  to use mailing lists, it's not like mailing lists are brand new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's what they say.  They just use the mailing list don't reply to all, but I think it is kind of a key email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know why this is an interesting story because it well, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, you don't like it.  We'll move on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they should just have a team meeting where they talk about these issues and maybe  have a group hug or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We did.  We actually sent a reply to all got a lot of people in trouble at Tech TV because you  know, you'd write a snotty response actually, you know, you write a snotty response and  you forget that the person that you're responding to is on the still on the to list and you  reply to all and it goes out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Most people do that on purpose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Is that your technique?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and then you go, oh, what my mistake?  Whoops, didn't mean to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think it's a real problem.  I mean, if you're using something like Gmail, you know, it all sort of like your reply  sits in line with with your correspondence with that person.  No, it doesn't seem like it really adds a lot of bulk.  Do you know what I'm talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's not about bulk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not about fiber.  We're talking here.  It's about this executive vice president at the Nielsen Corporation, Mitchell Habib,  who six months ago replied to all with a particularly arrogant message about his  underlings that went to 35,000 Nielsen's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ah, gotcha.  Yeah.  You see, you don't want to change the process when people do stuff like that.  That's a good thing.  Yeah, you want to post our ways to be busted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's Darwinian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Speaking of which, by the way, Darwin's 200th anniversary of his birth is Friday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I want to mention something.  Congratulations.  Oh, geez, I forgot a couple of things I got to mention.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, get the paper out.  I got some things to mention too, as long as we're going to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Andrew Horowitz, one of our Twitterers is going to be on CNBC this week and a whole  hour of him on one of the shows.  And I can't remember the day.  I think it's Wednesday, but he's also going to be in the Jon Stewart show.  He's beat us both to the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's going to be on Jon Stewart.  That's big.  Have you been on Jon Stewart and well, you're the only celebrity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, no, no, no, no.  I in the in the in the hierarchy of people who get invited to do that sort of thing and  people who hope their entire lives to do that sort of thing.  I'm like way at the bottom of people who hope forever and ever and ever.  You don't care about that.  You've had no, no, I would love to do the Jon Stewart show, the Colbert report, you  know, like those sort of like intelligent shows.  But, you know, if like people, you know, sort of listen to me in certain places, but  pretty much everywhere I go when it's like, you know, celebrity, whatever, I don't  even I don't even make a blip on the radar, which is actually really, really nice.  I don't really want that to change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Was it hard when you were recognized?  Was it difficult?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, it's sort of a double edged sword.  I was never into like being famous and I was never really like I never really wanted  a lot of attention and and I never like I never did the things that that like you do  when you're famous never went to parties never, you know, I really tried not to go  to a lot of premieres and junk just because like, I don't know, I just didn't like  that stuff.  I didn't I didn't like being around a lot of people who were like super into that.  And now that that like I kind of don't have to deal with that.  I'm actually kind of really sort of grateful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the answer to that question is no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just think it's nice to be able to get tables at restaurants.  That's all I want to be famous for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's all you know, just lie about your age.  I say I'm well-witten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It usually works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So can I ask a Wil Wheaton question?  When when did you start blogging?  I mean, when did that come into play?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was around 2000 in the like toward toward the like the like the end of spring the  beginning of summer in 2000.  I guess no.  Yeah, it was right right before San Diego Comic-Con in 2000 when I started doing that.  That's a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's early days of blogging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, I remember the really early arguments about what we were going to call it and and  you know, like what it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think I started in February 2001.  So, I mean, that's a that's a long time 2000 really early days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  If you think these arguments about what Twitter is supposed to be and how you're supposed to  use Twitter are annoying.  Go back to anything written from about 1999 to 2002 about like what being a blogger is  about and how that's supposed to work and all these ridiculous calls for blogger ethics  panels and stupid things like that.  But it's yeah, it's it's been really fun to watch that world evolve and change and and  gain some sort of mainstream understanding and acceptance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Same thing with podcasting.  I kind of I kind of said, you know, we should as podcasters look at what happened to blogging  because we're just you know, five years after and the same thing will happen and it has  been in a way although it's been accelerated.  I think, you know, podcasting has already gone down market in the way that blogging went  down market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's real interesting to me to watch to watch how this stuff sort of filters out into the  like the, you know, mainstream kind of collective consciousness.  And I view podcasting the same way I view blogging.  I just I really see it as just another means of publishing and you know, and reaching  an audience and like my friend David says let a thousand flowers bloom and clean up  990 weeds and like I'm fine with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What about the fact that it's that blogging has now become the bastion mostly of big groups  like Engadget and Huffington Post.  You think the individual blogger like you and like Lisa is there a future for you guys?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I don't think it's a zero-sum game.  I don't I certainly don't see myself competing within Gadget and I don't see myself competing  with with Huffington Post, you know, I mean I do my thing and they do their thing and  just because we're published in the same medium doesn't really put us, you know, I don't  see that putting us into competition with one another at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How about you Lisa?  Do you worry that individuals are going to get kind of pushed aside?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that I mean I mainly blog as as a sort of creative outlet but also to share,  you know, you know, photography tips and just my life with with other things I do and it's  sort of complementary to the other things that I do.  So if I, you know, create a video or if I, you know, take a great picture I can share  that with a lot of people and it's also about the interaction with the community and that's  such a huge part of my online presence that I can interact, you know, sort of on a one-to-one  basis with people and they have a way of communicating with me and of sharing their what they're  doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I think blogging is still fun in that and I forgot John you've got a, what am I  saying?  You're a big, Dvorak Uncensored is probably the biggest blog of them all.  I mean of the individual blogs.  You're doing very well aren't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think Whedon probably does as well at least but he's right.  It's a just a publishing vehicle and it's whatever it is.  I mean it's just it just so happens to have a lot of critical massive readers and I also  don't think it's a zero sum game.  Although, you know, if you're going to do something that's a little, you know, you might  like to try to do a tech blog and then it would you would have to go after, you know,  you would be competing but generally speaking it's just a personality thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know one of the things...  Go ahead Lisa.  It's important that you have your niche and you know for me and Will and I think it's  like you have a very small place and as long as you continually create good content and  that it suits your niche then you're going to have people keep coming back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm primarily an entertainer whether it's as an actor or a writer or you know a  voice actor.  I entertain people and and I you know try to provide diversions for people and occasionally  I've been put in a position where I can you know be sort of a spokesperson for geek culture  gaming culture and things like that and what what I love the most about where we are right  now in the evolution of technology with regard to podcasting and also with blogging is it's  it's this like giant global distribution network with a self-selecting audience and  there's no tune-in time and it really is not a zero-sum sort of thing.  So a decade ago it would have been impossible for me to convince anybody to give me television  program would have been impossible for me to get a widely read magazine column just  because that really is zero-sum because you're really competing for space and an audience  and that sort of thing but but what what we're doing today with your show and what I do you  know five days a week on my blog is is totally different and and really couldn't exist at  any other time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We make our own space.  We don't need anybody to give us permission.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so I really like this.  This is I am about to embark on a really great experiment for the rest of this year where  I'm working on on supporting myself and my family and trying some new creative ventures  and and and some new styles of publishing and things exclusively using using the internet  and this stuff would not have been possible as recently as five years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'll give you an interesting fact.  This is this I just read.  I think it's fascinating.  The New York Times would actually be cheaper.  It would cost the New York Times about half as much to give their big subscribers people  been subscribing by more than for more than two years each and every one of them to give  them an Amazon Kindle and stop printing the paper.  It would be cost them half as much.  I saw that per year.  Just give them a Kindle and say no more print.  That's what they should do.  I think that's what they're going to do.  Whether they I don't know if they should do it.  I would very much miss the print version.  But the cost of print according to the Times quarterly there 10q they spend 63 million  a quarter on raw materials ink newsprint 148 million on wages and benefits.  And so you take take take actually take the 200 million out of their total costs for wages  benefits staffing their delivery costs and raw material costs 644 million a year.  They say they have 830,000 subscribers for who've been subscribing for more than two  years.  If you give each of them an Amazon Kindle it only cost you 297 million.  Eliminate the trucks the ink the newsprint.  I think that's inevitable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you think the public is going to go along with that?  I mean the transition from from print to to online because I've been working for the  Vancouver province and they're really making a drive to push people online.  But it's still you know really really slow goings at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well I you know I actually have a better example since PC Magazine did the transition  right.  They stopped.  I can tell you that a lot of people aren't too pleased.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are they do they is there circulation down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know what the Cirque figures are.  I mean I'm sure that sure it is somewhat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean it's apples to oranges because people don't read the website the way they would  read the magazine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No no but no they are no you're making you.  This is kind of more in line with the Kindle thinking because they have a version of the  magazine that was once the magazine now done with Zinio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh yeah yeah yeah right you download it.  Yeah I've looked at the Zinio version most people who want that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well you know the only guy that was really into it were years ago when Michael Miller  was at PC Magazine he used to carry around a note note one of those notebook computer  or notepad computers a big one which you know whatever happened to those they were supposed  to take over weren't they.  But anyway he used to have one he used to love Zinio because he'd have the magazine  he flipped the pages you know you'd have the whole thing was one page so it kind of  worked out but I find it inconvenient personally and a lot of people say hey you know I like  to read the thing casually maybe when I'm going to bed or when I'm on the train or if  I'm in my car I like paper doctor's office.  I mean what am I supposed to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like I really like paper and I really like being able to hand something off to somebody  yes if I if I'm on the train and I'm done with the sports section I can give it to the  guy next to me I can leave it behind when I'm done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a big problem with the copy protection on the Kindle you can't give it to somebody  else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want to like the Kindle so much I really I want to love it and I see the potential  in it but that is a huge drawback for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  However I guess my point is it's not really going to be up to the customers if the company  I mean the Times could go bankrupt this year they're they're operating costs are so through  the roof their revenue is so down thanks to Craigslist and other things that competition  from the internet that they may not have a choice it's not it's not like they're saying  the customers demanding it they're not saying that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wonder if a paper like the Times with you know looking looking back over the last like  look back at them during the Bush years if you look back at you know all those front  page columns Judith Miller wrote that were we all knew they were wrong and based on on  crap at the time but but now they're like you know these are it's really clear like  the front page of the New York Times was not a reliable trustworthy news source for a long  time that hurt him too.  And I wonder how much a lack of confidence I'm about halfway through this fascinating  book by Farhad Manjoo called true enough and it's all about how you like stick yourself  in an echo chamber and like you know how it's it's this wonderful book about how the  light can get around the world several times before the truth puts its shoe on you know  it's tying its shoes and I wonder how much old media print media whatever have hurt themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So wait a minute I mean if that's true in print media it's true in spades on the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Absolutely it totally is but I guess I wonder if it's it's a question of you know there's  a there's a topic in Delicious about the Times blaming the internet for really messing up  a story about Caroline Kennedy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah and and I just the Times by the way yeah you said it they blame the internet.  It's not our fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We have to screw up.  The thing is it's you could you could say the same thing about cable news you know like  in that race to it.  They made us do it.  We wanted to be first with the story in fact checking be damned.  I just think the day when you can't rely on journalists to tell the truth instead of this  this like wussy irresponsible he said she said kind of thing is when that you start  looking elsewhere for it to get your news and information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So John what's what is the experience of PC magazine is this was this a right move for

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  them was it the wrong guy was it was again it was like the New York Times it was no choice  didn't have a choice.  You have to do it you have to do because advertisers want something one way or the other  and the fact of the matter and I've written about this in one of my online columns which  is the advertisers the big boys the Intel's the AMD's the Dells everybody in between  Sony Panasonic they didn't they didn't want to advertise in these magazines anymore and  then PC magazine was the only one if you wanted to see a real sorry situation go take a look  at a copy of computer world if you can find one.  It's about an eight page you know kind of a thing on a small format and it's like whatever  happened to the old computer world you know which was a big giant newspaper and it's  because these advertisers and a lot of it has to do with the with the advertising business  itself has been slightly skewed with a big you know they brought over the year starting  around the late 1980s probably got it.  He had a steam in the 1990s.  They started to shift to using media buyers for most of the placements for the big companies  that come to get pretty big and then they'd hire a big ad agency and the ad agency would  have a quote unquote media buyer who you'd have to actually you know take a side because  they didn't know anything about the industries that they were placing advertising in.  They're all 20 something generally speaking women from Smith and oh Smith.  Well there were these you know Ivy League girls from these colleges in the back east  and they were all working on New York and they didn't know anything about computers  but they were given the Dell account for example and they were placing usually in magazines  that they maybe have heard of or somebody who had a usually to be honest about it.  It was the companies like Forbes that generally gave the best parties Forbes have put everybody  I've been on a couple of these things you get on that big Highlander that big yacht  that they keep in the New York Harbor and they load it up with all these media buyers  and they give them a ride a couple rides around the island and it's like when they feed the  best wine and food and they next thing you know they're taking ads out and put them in  Forbes.  It's kind of corrupted the whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So if I got a yacht you think I could sell more ads?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a big yacht we're talking about here not a you know dinghy.  I could afford a dinghy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I could take some advertisers out in the Petaluma River in my dinghy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That might work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  Just wear that nice captain's hat that you have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'll give them summer sausage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So anyway so the magazines you know the whole thing shifted and then you know the online  thing kind of you know sucked what they could away and I don't know.  That's what she said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's actually I got one more I got one more dumb dumb internet trick.  This is from the Maryland they don't call it the legislature.  They call it the General Assembly.  They've got some weird colonial notion of democracy.  The Maryland General Assembly's IT Department has decided that Facebook and MySpace are  laden with viruses and so they've they're blocking it now to all government offices  the General Assembly computers lawmakers and staff.  They can't go to Facebook or MySpace which is kind of a problem because like the  governor's got a Facebook page many of the states senators and they call them delegates  have Facebook pages that they communicate with constituents.  But you know they're loaded with with spyware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So do they do they know what loaded with viruses mean?  I don't think they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're scared and we're turning off the internet.  It's scary out there.  It's bad stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's just crazy.  The led by the way the legislators are not happy about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's got to be a different reason for that.  No that's what they said.  Well that's what they said but come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well what but they're all they're not blocking.  They're only blocking Facebook and MySpace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  That's why it's got to be a different reason if they're only blocking Facebook and MySpace  they're not blocking Twitter.  They're not blocking farts.  They don't know about Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They don't get it.  They're idiots.  You block Fark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No don't block Fark.  That's where all the Fark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's where all the viruses are.  No I love Fark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Drew Curtis is a friend.  I would never.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Drew is also a friend of mine.  Never block Fark.  Actually Leo if you want to talk to somebody about online advertising and and how bad news has gotten screwed up you should talk to Drew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How so?  What's his?  We'll get him on.  I'd love to get him on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Drew has a fantastic book.  We call it it's called the Fark Book.  The book is called It's Not News It's Fark How Mass Media Tries to Pass Off Crap as News.  And it's hilarious.  It's true.  It's based on it's based on these years of running Fark and looking at news stories every single day  and picking out patterns out of the noise and then watching advertising and see how advertising is changing and how the actual  results of advertising because you can track them so clearly online are so divorced from what advertisers have always wanted them to really be.  Interesting.  Yeah, it's it's fascinating to sit and listen to Drew talk about this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I thought he was just peddling boobies.  Little did I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He manages to you know, just to sneak some boobies and beer in there among, you know, the other the other things.  The news stories.  And God bless him for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Lisa was going to say something.  She got stoned.  I'm sorry, Lisa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I was just you know, where they're talking about how Facebook they're opening the API so that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm excited about that.  In fact, some say this is good.  Who said that Mark Cantor not that he's the bastion of credibility, but Mark Cantor said that it's that is Simon.  When Facebook announced their status page API that it reduced the value of Twitter by one half.  So you think so, Lisa, you think people would use Facebook instead of Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gosh, I don't know.  It's such a thing.  I don't like about Facebook is there's always it feels like they're selling this information.  They're gathering.  It does feel like that doesn't it?  It feels a bit scary to me.  And I felt that, you know, right at the beginning.  I was really apprehensive about it.  But it's sort of such a you think more than Twitter is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Twitter doesn't have access to any of the information that Facebook.  I guess not.  That's true.  You tell it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're not telling them, you know, your marital status, you know, your like where you work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And we call that Beacon Facebook basically said, yeah, we'll use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And then there's advertising on the side that sort of, you know, geared towards.  It says Lisa Bettany.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Lisa Bettany is downloading this software.  Shouldn't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's kind of a scary.  Yeah, it is.  And I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here's the deal.  So here's what what Facebook's basically said is you could make a Twitter like page that is a using our API.  That is Facebook statuses.  All the people I care about are my friends on Facebook.  Wouldn't I just do that instead of using Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I mean, Twitter's is is more than just a status update.  I mean, people use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I use my Facebook status that way.  I mean, I actually piped my Twitter into Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  So so we're going from from Twitter to Facebook rather than the other way around.  I mean, can you imagine like we're getting enough nom nom nom's to just go nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, do you hate this 25 things you don't know about me meme?  Do you hate this?  I hate this so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't do memes period.  I've never done it.  I don't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did it for my Market Watch column this weekend.  You actually did it.  You did 25 things you don't know about me.  25 things you didn't know about the tech scene and computers.  Well, see, that's okay.  I don't know how okay it was.  I didn't have anything else to write about.  So I figured, well, this is an interesting meme.  Let me just do this.  And it turns out they get, you know, more views than anything.  So what can you say?  Nom nom nom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Does it did you do a Facebook page 25 things you don't know about me?  Will Wheaton?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I did not.  I I don't trust Facebook at all.  Oh, you feel the same way.  I do not.  I trust Facebook less than I trust Google.  And I think that the day is coming maybe not right away, but I really  believe the day is eventually coming where Facebook takes all of that user  data that they've been aggregating for years and years and sells it somewhere.  And and and and bad things happen to the people that are that are the  subject of that data collection.  It's good.  I just I don't I tried to play around Facebook a little bit for a little  while and I just didn't like how it said, okay, well, if you want to do  this, you're granting the developer access to every single bit of information  about you ever.  I don't know why I need that if I'm going to play Scrabble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't see what the point of that is.  Will you reading between your your think this is not possible.  Why would anybody want to do anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See, I am I am I am I don't know.  Why would anyone want to have access to crazy amounts of data about  individuals and be able to attach that data to like surfing habits and  web page visits and and and and purchases and things like I can't imagine  what what what anyone would want to do with that information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Suddenly, I understand why Facebook is worth.  What is it 50 billion dollars 15 billion dollars, you know, but I really

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  find this implication that this opening of the API is going to kill Twitter.  One of the most ridiculous uses of of stupid hyperbole that I've heard  online in a very, very, very long time.  I mean, there's here's how you here's how you use Twitter.  You spend about 30 seconds to sign up and you're done and then you go and  to like to do Facebook.  You got to sign up.  You got to give them all your information.  Then you got to go through and set up all the privacy settings so that  they're not just, you know, broadcasting everything about you to everyone  that can find you there and I don't see how this kills Twitter or even  even makes a dent in in in what makes Twitter cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree.  Next topic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We haven't done chewing this topic, John.  We got to chew some now.

I mean they're not there's these are no these are no photoshopped pictures of  the new kindle and it doesn't look.  I mean awesomely better.  It's got a nice metal back.  They've changed the form factor.  The buttons aren't so big so you don't accidentally turn the page.  I'm a kindle fanatic though.  See I really I you I read everything on the kindle if I can I first listen to  see if I can get it on audible.  I listen then I then I if I can't I get on the kindle and paper is the  last resort because I really like the idea of having lots of books in this  little form factor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How often have you been using your original kindle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I don't have the new one.  So I have to use the original but how often oh, that's what I read on all  the every night.  Everything.  Yeah, you get the New York Times on it.  I love this.  You subscribe to the New York Times on it.  You get it at 3 in the morning that not that morning automatically just  comes in you get a bunch of newspapers that way.  It's not quite like reading the paper New York Times, but there are no  ads not I think not all the contents there like the crossword puzzle is  not there but it wouldn't make sense because you draw on the screen  and you'd ruin the kindle.  So but otherwise I think it's great.  You know, I got a chess book on the kindle and you actually get the  diagrams you can act.  It's really kind of cool.  It's like I had 600 positions in and I could just look at them one by one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I have a similar book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Transcript:  Are you because it's like some sort of heavy metal thing that I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's you know, it's it's actually not even  fire and flames on guitar hero is kind of like Greengrass and High  Tides on rock band.  It's not it's not a song that you play.  It's a song that you endure.  Yeah, it's like a song.  It's a song that you survive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Get ready.  Get ready to endure because here we go.  This is young Danny Johnston 14 years old of grapevine, Texas, who set  the new world record guitar hero 3 3 973,000 points playing Dragon  Forces through the fire and flame.  Just take a listen to how good this is.  You know what I really love about guitar hero is the slapping  sound on the on the little plastic guitar really enhances the music.  And of course, he's talking.  He's not even looking at this terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's talking as he's playing.  But you know what?  He's really good.  I mean, I have to say if you watch this whole as somebody in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  chat room said this kid will never have a girlfriend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are you kidding any girl who sees what this kid can do with his  fingers without even looking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's not even looking.  He's talking with his buddies.  But you know, you think he probably does have kind of sweaty hands

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and to get that proficient.  He's probably not working on other areas of his life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Lisa, you're a girl.  Do you find that, you know, hot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Honestly, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, it's really sad if this kid put that much effort into  actually playing a guitar.  Yeah, that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Listen, I I've got to disagree with with that.  I love guitar hero.  I love rock band.  I am a former bass player.  I've played a little bit of drums in my life, a little bit of, you  know, pick up and learn the tab for the solo in Stairway to Heaven  that that level of guitar playing.  I absolutely love rock band.  I absolutely love guitar hero because I'm not an actual musician  and I can feel like one.  It does feel like when I when I when I play these songs and the  point of this of things like this is not to be a musician.  It's to pretend to be a musician and get together with your  friends and goof off and a complaint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If he played a guitar at the same amount of time, he would be  a musician.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah, he would.  But what he's doing in this what he's doing with fire and flames,  it's not it's not it's nothing like playing music.  It's like learning a pattern.  He has more in common with Billy Mitchell than Billy Corrigan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's I think the time is better spent playing strip  poker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait, I'm sorry.  Did John Dvorak just say that he wants to play strip poker with  this 14 year old guitar hero?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's really sad is if you don't know any girls strip poker  really isn't much fun.  That's sadly true.  It is.  I've tried no fun.

Transcript:  Have you ever gotten back to my Mac work to work once?  Not very well.  I've never been able to access a Mac using back to my Mac  and you'd think that Apple would know this and would try  to fix it.  But it's been that way for a year and a half and now I can't  get on a mobile me.  It's just like it's like they don't it's like yeah, we can't  it.  We it doesn't work.  We can't figure it out.  They just gave up on it.  Robert Scobel.  Let me hear you.  Hey, does this sound better?  I hear every word excellent.  That was weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was like you were like what he sounds like he's in a bucket  a little bit, but it's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'm on a new Mac now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So the bucket Mac, you know, I know something maybe you've  noticed this.  I don't normally on Twitter follow everybody who follows  me because on Twitter you want to put together a list of  people that you're interested in and who say interesting  things, but I have one account twit live, which we use to  say, you know, we're broadcasting now.  And I turned on, you know, I asked the Twitter folks turn  that on that I follow everybody who follows me and lately  I've been looking and almost every follow when I follow them  responds with thanks for following me now get my free  wealth creation guide at go to wealth creation.com every one  of them is spam everyone out of 20 follows 19 or spam John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm getting the same thing, but a lot of people are now using  a tool called social to social to doing it.  Yeah, and you can you can set it to auto respond to people  like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's why I'm getting the honor response, but it  makes me think that all of this massive growth in Twitter is  just bogus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'd say some of it is not bogus because I'm actually seeing  real people on my tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I see a real budget, but you don't still follow  everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do now and I turned it I really hate that I had to turn  it on but a lot of people are asking are trying to direct  direct message me with news tips and business stuff, you

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  know, I mean, there's this thing now they got called email.  It's really cool where you know somebody like it send you  a message.  I don't use it Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, my sister reads it for me.  And of course Lisa doesn't either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I give up.  We all gave up on email.  I get a hundred messages an hour.  I can't answer all that.  I get a lot of spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that's not the spam.  Well, why don't you just go by the subject?  I get about a hundred emails a day or so and they I  don't look at all of them.  I just look at the subject line by the way, this is a tip  for anybody make it the subject line compelling.  You can tell if it's important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I tried to get people not to send me direct messages.  I pleaded with them don't send me direct messages.  They did anyway, and then they get pissed because they can't

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  because you can't direct message somebody who's not  following you.  Yeah.  I was really hurt.  I was really hurt because Sarah Myers of pop 17 sent me  a direct message saying hi Leo.  So I just responded hi back and says Sarah's not following  you.  You loser.  It's like I could see I know I know how people feel when

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you say somebody said they sent you a note back saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  that no Twitter does that automatically you can't you  can't D you can't direct message somebody who's not  following you.  Oh, which is a good thing because it keeps people from  spamming you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It also keeps you from interacting with jerks by the way  because I on tweet that guy see anybody who says I'm  something like that and if I try to call him back, it  doesn't let me do it because they're not following me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You shouldn't have that as a search term though, because  I find if you do have a search term, you're going to  get a lot of those messages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, which brings us to another topic which people  might be interested in which is curse bird.  What is curse bird?  I don't know that see you are se bird bird bird bird is  the word essentially a Ajax page and it Janet throws  every tweet that goes into the system that has a cuss  word in it gets posted and you can look yourself up  and I looked you up Leo and do I swear a lot not you  have a zero rating.  Yeah, baby and me too.  I have a zero rating.  I have not cursed on Twitter and I don't intend to and  I think it's and you watch it.  So it's a the game that we started to play actually  Adam Curry and I have developed this it's you you  look for people that you think are kind of interesting  but you see him cussing like a truck driver and then  you and he did for men you do women and women do men  and then you click on their page to see what they look  like and see what some of their posts are and then  you decide the name of the game is is this person a  psycho.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I'll tell you what I did.  I don't you know, I don't curse on Twitter.  I try not to curse on the show.  The fact that you probably heard a bleep storm a minute  ago because of a word that we were saying that we  bleeped out but so we try to keep it family-friendly.  Did I get bleeped?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Sorry about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But you don't get bleeped on a live stream because  I'm not that fast.  So everybody listening live got you know, that's why  you listen live so you can hear this your scopal  curse.  So but I was okay on Friday.  I did I do every Friday morning.  I do a little tech bit with the morning man in Los  Angeles on KFI Bill Handel number one show in LA.  It's a great show.  Bill is a little porn obsessed.  So I'm talking about Twitter and I'm saying Twitter  really has gone mainstream again a lot of movie  stars a lot of well-known people every presenter in  Britain is now on Twitter.  Stephen Fry is like, you know massive on Twitter and  I said and even porn stars are on Twitter.  No.  Oh, yeah.  I mean I didn't know this but the practically you  know the whole porn community is using but the  funny thing is their tweets are the most mundane  boring things you ever saw.  I mean they're worse than normal.  They don't curse.  You know, it's really boring.  But anyway, so I said that and then I thought well,  I probably should back this up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I I went on Twitter website with all the porn  stars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I did I went on Twitter and I said hi KFI listeners.  Thanks for following me.  I mentioned here's a list of celebrities on Twitter.  Here's a list of porn stars on Twitter.

He used to follow your Twitter, but that's not  happening anymore nor is his subscription to your  podcast continuing now both of our choices not just  mine by the way.

Transcript:  want to keep up when I'll do a droopy dog if you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you weren't on you can't win.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can't win.  I'm a double-edged sword.  Well, you're a double-edged what I realized is if you  stick your head up out of the crowd, somebody's going  to chop it off or they're going to try to yeah, they  haven't succeeded yet because I've got a neck brace  of steel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Those messages ever bother you.  I mean, oh yeah, that bothered me that one bothered

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  me.  I felt terrible.  Yeah, I know, you know, you can't let  any of those messages bother you unless there's something  extremely accurate about it and you realize that you  screwed up and and I do feel worse when that happens.  Yeah, I mean that more than you just you make up you  do a make good.  I mean, that's not a big deal.  But generally speaking most of the complaining is is  just people blowing off steam or they don't really like  you in the first place or they have a good upset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I felt better about it because I just blogged it.  I put it up on the blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's like the time I mentioned somebody being  cross-eyed or something.  We got that note from that guy because it's got a name  I guess and the guy said those cross-eyed people should  be making fun of him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, John, it's called Amblyopia and I have it.  So that was me.  I wrote through that note.  So don't know who that was.  Do you ever get stuff like that Robert?  Everybody loves Robert Scobel.

Transcript:  It's not just Valley wag.  You know, I have tweet deck running and people people are  having fun.  In fact, somebody said you're not an a-hole and I do follow  you.  So that's nice.  But it's that's not a lot nicer than so.  You're Robert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You are not an a-hole signed a fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

See you in an OR Scott's name goes with the MacArthur.  So it's called out of MacArthur and he's great and I don't  know but I imagine she's already created the Twitter account  and if she hasn't too late.  Oh, don't you do that now when you have a baby the first thing  you got to do.  In fact, you don't even name the baby till you check to see  if you can get the domain name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, smart money was born.  We did a Twitter ground.  We did an audio of his cry.  His first cry was on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Amber announced the birth.  That's the reason people don't like you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Amber announced the birth on tweet on Twitter as a tweet.  That's how we found out and her and her partner.  She said, I don't think they're married but her partner  Christic posted the picture on Flickr.  So they're very wired, you know, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I was at this founders breakfast this morning talking  a bunch of entrepreneurs and talking about the economy.  Everybody talks about the economy and you were at Davos

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  this week too.  And it sounded like a grim grim meeting at the World  Economic Forum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know why Davos was depressed?  I called Davos.  I'm in Davos depression was that there's a lot of freaked  out rich people and they don't have any answers about how  you got out of this hole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, because President Obama is going to reduce their  income to 500,000 a year.  Oh, what's going on now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Once he made that assertion a bunch of I think Bank of  America.  I think a couple other these guys are we going to get a  bunch of pot full of money said no, no, no, take the money  back.  We don't want the money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're not going to take the tarp funds.  So they don't have to take a cut and pay because the tarp

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  funds.  They're just going to bank them anyway.  And then the I love it.  The Republic.  They don't need to have these guys don't need the funds.  That's the joke of it.  And then this is just taking it there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a pile there and we'll take it all but a cut and pay.  Oh, no, I better not do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh man, I think Horowitz and I'll be discussing this later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you have this what is the founders breakfast?  What is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's about a hundred and something founders of startups  that get together once in a while over at somebody's  house.  Oh, that sounds neat.  Yeah, Greg Newmark was there.  In fact, I have a video of him that I'm going to try to  upload right after we're on the show.  Talking about what he's saying.  He's saying more fewer jobs more stuff being sold, you know,  people are getting as they get laid off.  They start selling their positions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Craigslist would be a really good indicator of that.  I bet.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, it's it's a anyways that I met Jet Li last week.  That was fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wow.  Was Jet Li at Davos?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  I was wondering which which would you prefer to be a Ted  or Davos?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I talked to Loic Lemur this morning and he said Ted is way  better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ted's more optimistic.  Except for the mosquitoes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, that's sort of fun.  Can you imagine if you had a picture of that on Twitter?  You know, hey, I got bit by Bill Gates mosquitoes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So this is kind of an old story, but I still like it.  It's a Street View hack.  There it was called the Street with a View project.  It was two art students in Pittsburgh.  Who's thought let's do this.  Let's because you know, Google Street View goes around with  cars with, you know, cameras on the roof.  I actually you could see the video and I thought it would  be like a van, but it's actually like a chevette with  this weird contraption on the on the roof and they just  drive down the street and take lots of pictures so that you  can use Google Street View of Google Maps.  So the the art students called Google said look what we'd  like to do is get know when you're going to come and set  up something.  So they've got a high school marching band.  They've got a guy grilling sausage.  They've got he's got a bizarre bunch of weird stuff down this  little alley and it's the funniest Street View and now the  reason it that happened in May now they're doing it an  exhibit at the Arlington Arts Center in Pittsburgh and you  can find out more and see the video at Street with a view  dot-com.  I love that idea.  That's that's hack and Street View.  But on the other hand privacy advocates a little bit more  concerned about a new Google feature called latitude.  Now Robert is latitude any different than what bright  kites doing or fire eagle or looped or any of these  location services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's different than bright kite because you can actually  follow me around you actually see my icon moving around  town as I'm moving around but the problem is right right

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  kite you actually have to press a button that says I am  here.  Yeah.  So you're saying that once you turn this thing on your  phone continually broadcast your location.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's actually pretty cool because like I was like  stalking to me.  It is totally stock.  In fact, that's how I said it on my blog.  I said if you want to stalk me go ahead and add me and  what's funny is I can't use latitude anymore because it  crashes instantly when I start because too many people are  following you too many people and actually the team talked  to me.  They said they only thought people would use it with a  hundred of their friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You see Robert Robert you're always an edge case.  You're always an edge case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Interesting you busted the system because it was not unexpected  consequences.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, but I have a you have to have a Symbian s60

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  phone or a Blackberry.  I'm going to have a G1.  I'm going to turn on my G1 and put it on the G1.  It doesn't work on the iPhone yet probably because the  iPhone will let you continually broadcast presence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're actually working on an iPhone version and that should  be out shortly with even more features.  But how will it work?  I mean how now you know, maybe maybe you'll have to hit a  button, you know where you are and I've been using I like

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  bright Kate, but but but unfortunately I keep posting my  home address on my it's not a good thing by accident.  You know, you mean I don't mean to do that.  You're supposed to be able to say I'm you know, just the  town not this the address.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I never turn location.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, if I were you I wouldn't ever.  Yeah, really if I were you Lisa, I wouldn't in fact, I  wouldn't even tell you say what country you're in right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I've had problems.  I just changed all my my who is IDs to private.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, because it because you have information in there  about your location.  Yes, do you have you have stalkers are people actually  bugging you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I mean most of my sort of fans are pretty positive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Worry about people like you and Justine and Veronica and

This kind of surprises me.  Juicy campus seemed like a natural.  This was the site where you would go to read the filthiest  vilest gossip about college kids posted by their quote,  friends and enemies.  It was a site that was blocked by many universities.  One college official called it a virtual bathroom wall of  hate and degrading speech.  It went offline on Thursday.  It was getting more than a million uniques a month.  People could post anonymously fraternities and sororities  would cruelly attack each other.  You'd see threads like biggest slut on campus easiest  freshman fattest coed.  That's not pretty file.  It was protected of course by free speech laws.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's interesting had a million hits a month.  We have that same number on the Devorka uncensored blog,  which is also really and disgusting really and you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that what it proves?  Yeah, it really does.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Really does.  Oh my goodness.  Now I'm looking at the map of Australia, the latest on CNN  and it is not it's not just Southeast.  It's not just the Bush.  It's not just Victoria.  It's spread all over the entire continent.  Terrible 100 wildfires.  100 people killed many many acres burning is terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There must be some was a must have some interesting weather  conditions that to yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you know, it's a yeah, it's a end of summer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I haven't had a break.  Yeah, I'm worried.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google is going to put some now.  This is an interesting story that does kind of tie into that  Kindle story.  Google is going to start putting ebooks 1.5 million public  domain ebooks online on devices like the T-Mobile G1 and the  iPhone.  In fact, Amazon also says it's going to start taking some of  the titles is making for Kindle and making them available on  other portable devices, which makes me wonder do you really  want to Kindle maybe the thing to do is just to get better  readers on your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I talked to the lady who runs the Google team who makes the  iPhone iPhone app that they just announced this morning  actually and she said you'll still want to Kindle for the  latest books because some books will be sold there and they're  not going to be available on Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  These are all public domain books.  I would guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  And also the device the Kindle device is interesting because  you can read it on the beach because it has a reflective  screen on it that uses very little power.  So the batteries last forever in an hour to 13 hours.  You can kill your iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Although we were talking I think it's Philip Ryu who wrote  this your friend Philip wrote this Lisa the classics application  on the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was going to bring that up because it's beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, it's really legible like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've never I never sort of thought.  Oh, you could read a book on a phone but with something like  that.  I mean if if other apps are developed and more literature  gets onto the iPhone, I mean it just seems like such, you know,  such a bulky thing to bring your phone and you're in a candle  and like who has I want someone to build a vest where you can  just have pockets for all these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Scott Bourne has that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they need to make those for maybe girls as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It only comes in one size and that's pretty big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'd wear it to be honest like I would you know, CF card  pocket that yes D and you've got your iPhone and you've got  your, you know, video camera all just in a kind of like a  bulletproof vest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think you know, I don't think this would kill the iPhone  back.  I mean, you're not going to read eight hours a day, but I think  this is it's very legible.  In fact, it's more legible in some ways Robert because the  iPhone is backlit so you don't need light for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Except if you're on the beach and sunlight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, so I'm not going to read this on the beach.  Would you really bring a kinder on the beach?  Yeah, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did it but I had to get the light.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I live in half moon Bay.  I mean, I'm going to go out on the everywhere's reach.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's no sun there.  Best thing in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Get a cheap paperback book.  You know, you don't really care if it gets sandy if it gets  wet if it gets mustard on it and you throw it away at the end  of the summer.  I know I think the Kindle is not beach wear mustard.  It absolutely is.  You don't bring mustard to the beach.  Not for my books.  Well, I find it's helpful in tanning.  Just me.  Maybe it's just me.  It could be just me.  It's just me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I travel too much to carry books around.  I mean, I have a stack of books here that I need to read and  they're heavy to carry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's why ebooks are great.  I agree with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You carry a lot of gear with you.  Don't you?  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not me.  Not me.  I got the Kindle.  I got the laptop.  That's all I need and my iPhone because I have like 40 or 50  books on audio the audible books and I really feel like I've  got a ton of entertainment.  In fact, you know, there's a now a TED Talks application for  the iPhone, which is great.  You can see all the movies all the audio.  It's just really wonderful.  So it was a good week for procrastinators.  Congress agreed to put off the switch to digital TV until June  12th.  So you could forget about it for another four or five months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what if they'll do it again?  Hey, how about this for an idea?  They never make the switch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That would make Verizon and AT&T a little angry since they  paid billions billions for access not to mention the fact  that there are emergency radios on these new frequencies.  These emergency channels are probably freaking out a little  bit because now they're not going to be able to occupy them  till June.  I think they were able to make an exception for some of those  frequencies.  And you know channels can you know most channels already are  digital.  It just means they don't have to turn off the analog till the  12th of June.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I had a you know, I was looking at the chat room.  Somebody sent me a link to a comparison of Dvorak.org,  Leoville and Twitch TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  These are worthless though because I know they're worthless,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but here's what's interesting.  They have a search analytics top keywords driving traffic to  Twitch TV.  One Dvorak.  No, no, no, no.  Let me do the joke.  Sorry, I'll get out of the way.  Number one, Twitch and number two, Twitch live.  The top keywords driving traffic to Leoville.com is Leo  Laporte and Leoville and the top two for Dvorak.org is John C  Dvorak and public urination India.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did you do an expose on public urination?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't remember ever seeing that.  That's pretty funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Was that driving traffic though?  Is that Google Analytics or is that compete?  Where is that from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Compete?  Complete.  Compete.  Or compete.  Yeah, yeah, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, those are those stats.  I you know are really questionable because I think they're  based on the Alexa toolbar.  Yeah, it's a fake but I just still when I look at my actual  numbers to Leoville or to it, they never match what these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had for a while.  I had like a couple of off.  I had two different search or these little analytic tools on  the website and then I had one on the server and then I'd  compare them to a Lexus and the Lexus in particular is really  bad because if you don't have a lot of you have a toolbar and  people don't know the toolbar sucks and it's it comes up  despite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, our users don't are smart enough not to use right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we're not going to have any of our readers or users that  are ever going to use the thing and then it doesn't work with  Firefox anyway, which is like the least half of my users 60%  of them use Firefox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, mine too.  Quite cast is actually the best one to watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There is a Google.  There's a bookmark now that Google does some analytics and  I presume that they pull it from whatever they know about.  I would think that would be fairly useful.  I'm trying to find the link because I used to have it on my  toolbar. I ended up taking it off.  But for a while I would go to sites and you could actually you  know, you could have a toolbar link you press this button.  It would give you all the analytics for that site.  It was kind of interesting.  Those seem like they'd be more useful more accurate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leah, what are you using to just monitor your own stats?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I use Google Analytics and Lookery which I was playing with  for a little bit.  There's there's a few things that give you see and you know,  I think about Google Analytics you get beautiful views.  I mean I have you know AWS and what you know, what is it  Weblizer I have all of those running on my server too, but  but I like Google Analytics.  I think you get nice little pretty pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Transcript:  I love mint.  It's minty fresh.  It is my NT.  Yeah, all of these are the same thing.  They put a Java little JavaScript stub on your page and  then they give you analytics based on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what's so good about mint?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's all these plugins that you can add that sort of are  very specific, you know search terms and you know,  you can sort of follow people, you know, if people come to  your site, you can sort of track they're called crushes,  you know how often they come back and it just I mean visually  it's a lot sort of taken but I think you can sort of really  useful stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah, just add the pieces that you want to follow and you  can sort of organize them that way sort of like a widget II  move drag and drop kind of have a mint.com have a mint.com

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is that what is have a mint?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, because there's also that mint that site that takes  all your financial information.  Go check it.  Check it out.  Yeah.  What do you use anything Robert?  Do you pay you probably don't even care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't care.  He's got numbers.  They're so astronomic that he doesn't even care.  Is this just under dig?  He's like Chuck Norris.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, we use Google Analytics.  Love you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Others the best scobel doesn't measure the internet.  The internet measures scobel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just watch tweet deck.  If they're talking about me, it's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's all you care about is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To tell you the truth that totally matches up with the  stats.  Anyways, if they're talking about you, your your hits go  up if they don't talk about you or you know, then your hits  go down.  So do you go ahead at least.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So how do you feel about sort of the influx of celebrities  on on Twitter?  Do you feel like they're encroaching on your territory?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not at all.  They're bringing new people into the system.  So and it must the people who they bring in though.  They don't care about that.  You know, no Devora.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You predicted you predicted this years a year ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John right off the bat.  Actually, I was saying it was going to that would be the  backbreaker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Same thing happens to podcasting.  It's happening to blogging is what we were talking about  before is when the big guys come in the the early adopters  the tech people like us were just you know, also bins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I wouldn't say you're a slouch on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, really?  How many thousands of followers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  86,000 but you know, Steve, yeah, Stephen Fry in a month  goes to 107,000 but

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know there are people who are more popular in the real  world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Rightly, Leo.  There are people more popular than you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's no one more popular.  I don't like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Imagine if Obama actually Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's got now a quarter of a million followers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But if he actually did it, he would go to millions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Stephen Fry's 155,000 CNN 144,000 Kevin Rose 102,000 Twitter  itself.  See, but this is weird because Twitter's had an account since  day one all of a sudden it goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, these numbers are weird because you know the funny  thing is I was it you've got about a year ago is fighting  to get into the top 10 and I think I got to number eight  and you know when the numbers weren't is what they are today  and then I kind of just once I got past I said, I don't even  care to follow it anymore.  Now.  I'm like number 30 or something like that fell way off and  because I haven't been you know, but remember I was pumping  it.  Remember the real Dvorak add me the real Dvorak and so you  could maintain but you know, we haven't been doing the kind  of promotion needed to keep those numbers up and I think  it's kind of tedious to keep it is I don't want to how  public I mean I did that with the Dvorak dot org slash blog  and I stopped doing that gag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The chat rooms having a Twitter backlash by the way, I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  they hate us talking about Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and they will send they should you should hate us for  this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Please actually working on posts of what you know what to do  instead of doing Twitter because it really doesn't help  you at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know.  I think in fact the fact that it's gone mainstream is actually  a sign that it's more powerful.  Don't you think you think it's less more less important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It depends who you're trying to reach, you know, Bill Gates  came up to me last week at Davos and said thanks for writing

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  writing about his annual letter, which I saw that that was  amazing.  So he actually read that was on friend feed, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, or on Twitter.  It doesn't matter and which proves the point.  He doesn't read Twitter and friend feed.  It was somebody who works for him who noticed all these hits  were coming from someplace on the internet and told him to  go check it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but then he knew you and he recognized you and he  connected the two.  Yeah, that's pretty impressive.  I don't think Bill Gates would walk up to me and say say I  mean I commented on I don't think he'd walk up to me.  I don't think you know who the hell I am.  So you don't think Gates knows who you are.  No, I hope to God.  He has no idea who I am.  He should know who you are.  I'm afraid of him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm you know, one of the nicest guys there is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's he's doing awesome work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So he's doing is you know, I read because I didn't want to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  start a friend fest here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, no, but because of Scoble's comment about it.  I did read it was a long article on the Gates Foundation about  what you can't like a year kind of year end letter and I was  very impressed with his analytic ability what he's decided  to spend his love the rest of his life doing and how important  it is.  I mean, I think it's really that's fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it is to us.  I think you should fix Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He doesn't have anything to do with it anymore.  And by the way, I think Windows 7 does fix Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Windows 7 they haven't loaded it up with all the  overhead yet.  Well, no, not yet.  That's how it's going to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it's done.  Next.  No, no, no, they've already said we don't want to change it.  This is this is complete.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guarantee they're going to throw a bunch of anti-security  crap and all kinds of overhead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, they did and that's one of our stories they did remember  there was a little fewer because they'd set you, you know, one  of the things they said well, we're going to fix UAC and we  know it bugs people.  So the way they fixed it they turned it down.  They made it less effective and people complained my god,  you've turned it down to the point where now and a bad guy  could get on your system and turn it off.  And at first Microsoft said well, we know that's that we  did it on purpose.  But the the furor was so great.  They just announced a couple of days ago.  Okay.  Okay, we're going to turn it up.  But when we ship Windows 7 UAC will be turned up all the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you say the furor was great?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, is that not correct?  The furor was great.  So great.  The great furor.  The furor was great and I will love him all my life.  I'm sorry.  I was channeling Kenneth Mars for a moment there.  I apologize.
