End time: 591.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  names yeah well so same same problem and Mark is so the people we talked about  this last week of course in fact we had Katie Benner the author of the Times  article on briefly she's great she's great credit to read albergati at the  information actually credit going back to Susan Fowler the blogger who yeah  yeah whole thing open and it's clear that harassment is pervasive throughout  the world wherever wherever men go wherever men go there goes harassment  and we all need to do better and so I don't think Silicon Valley is unique in  this respect what's surprising is that you expect better of the people we all  know who are you know kind of at least pay lip service to kind of forward  progressive thinking and so they know of course Dave McClure of 500 startups  after this article immediately pled Maya culpa right I said I'm a creep  literally in his medium post and has stepped down I'm a creep I'm sorry some  said that his apology didn't go far enough I don't know I at least he at  acknowledged it Chris Saka who was also named has not yet copped to it and but  Mark Cantor most of all sort of you sort of did you know I have more work to do  which is a bet as least I'll have more work to do yeah who doesn't just like a

End time: 687.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  we don't know I think I think I would say this like if it were my friend you  know something I've realized is for me as a white person you know when I see  people that may not be doing their part for people of color I have a  responsibility to speak up because there's just less risk for me as a white  person so I think if you're a dude in tech I I would personally appreciate if  you would like speak up and pull your friends aside and talk to them about  when I see somebody I don't know if I need to write you're not going to see it  the same way that we are you know it's such a tough it's so tough and I think  like one thing I would like it to see is more of a culture where people can make  mistakes and have a second chance I mean I know for me I would hope today in 2017  I'm a better ally to groups I'm not a part of than I was in 2010 right so I  think all of us are kind of waking up and realizing things need to change and  you know if someone comes forward and says you know I made a mistake I need to  do better my strongest inclination is to give them the benefit of the doubt that  they want to change you know give them a second chance maybe not a third chance  but you know give everybody a chance to make their mistakes right and then and I

Start time: 687.96
End time: 791.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  would add on to that I mean I think also give them that nudge part of why people  were upset with Dave was the there's this Christina Yeo wrote about it I think  it's in our show notes about these levels of inappropriateness and when  male sexual aggression all scales of it get lumped under inappropriate anything  from aggressive language to physical aggressive pursuits that is unsolicited  and even resisted all of those aren't equally inappropriate right so we need a  better language and a better scale and better reporting mechanisms within any  organization whether it's a nonprofit or a company and then I what the last thing  I would say I mean Brianna brought it up it's always useful to flip the switch  but I will second her notion about you know I will see racism way more easily  every time because every everything's racist but also you know as a there is a  there's a handoff in the battle for justice on the racial side where you're  just like okay white people you have things to do to help move this forward  that I will never be able to do and I think as men there are layers to the  society that if men aren't talking to other men about it it just won't move as  quickly and as deeply as it needs to so we need to have some uncomfortable  conversations as men with other men about the culture we've been brought up  in and about challenging each other our language our behavior and in the  aftermath of an incident like this you know for those of us who have access to  the men named and especially the ones not named you know bringing it up before  there's even further incidents to be repeated on top of that

Transcript:  hard work to do the range of inappropriate material you remember a  couple weeks ago some media outlets made a big deal about the fact that Donald  Trump had an Irish female reporter in his office in the Oval Office and he  kind of flirted with her he said something oh nice smile and on the range  of a scale of the things that Donald Trump has done in terms of harassing  them that's way on the innocent side in my opinion right yet it was they made a  big deal about I'm thinking wait a minute let's remember back to grab your  can you say the P word on I don't think you need to put everything in context

Start time: 826.04
End time: 865.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  what I'm saying I I would I would push back on you just a little bit on that  put yourself in that woman's shoes she's worked her entire career you know if you  are a woman journalist like talk to your friends that work that they're constantly  faced with being treated as sex objects and not professionals and here she is in  a really big moment of her career and she's being kind of treated as a sex  object and not a professional so I understand what you're saying about the  seriousness of that but I do think we need a culture where men kind of are  aware of them I'm sure it was very professionally embarrassing for her  yeah that's part of the problem isn't it is I would not as aware as we maybe

Start time: 866.06
End time: 884.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  ought to be of how things that sound you know I think many people many guys would  that's just saying something nice how is that and and we need to get more aware  of how that can be patronizing and problematic and there's a huge we're

Start time: 885.36
End time: 961.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  definitely not that we all grow up in the same perverse stew with all the  biases baked in and we I think what's fascinating about what's happening now is  that like we are having this conversation there is clearly a wave and  it's not just men's behavior that is less acceptable it's women feeling  increasingly comfortable stepping up I mean it this would not have happened to  this degree in the 50s in the 70s in the 90s or even in the earlier part of the  2000s and so you can have a Susan Fowler and a Christine Yeoh and a Sarah Kunst  and these are out on personal websites in the New York Times on blogs on in  video so there's something you know the culture is shifting and we all have to  kind of catch up and stay relevant and I think for you know this show and shows  like it like if you're in technology you're really proud of being on the  cutting edge you know you're an early adopter I think that early adoption  extends past the latest operating system and the latest Tesla model to like the  latest you know social interaction firmware and the latest sort of human  rights operating system and the latest like interhuman respect protocols that  we are now realized oh we have to update all of our stuff as well what kind of our

Start time: 962.14
End time: 1021.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  meat where I'm not just our software yeah if I could add one more thing to  this I think it is so easy to go after someone on Twitter and blast them and  attack them and I do think holding people accountable is very useful but  something I try to do is rather than attacking other people on this subject I  try to ask myself what do I need to do better because it's so much easier to  change yourself than other people so like the last game my studio put out we  had no characters that were people of color and we had a very small staff of  five people but none of those were people of color that were on our  engineering team and you know for me as a leader I have to hold myself  accountable and know that going forward I need to make different hiring  decisions so I just I wish all of us would take more of a look at ourselves  about what we need to change rather than constantly directing it towards others  because I just think it leads to this it just leads to everybody attacking

Start time: 1022.02
End time: 1036.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  everybody all the time well it's also interesting to think that Silicon Valley  which thinks of itself as a very progressive area really has a lot of  work to do and it cannot put itself in a superior position to be the rest of the  country but we can't sit here and complain about how people are acting in

Start time: 1037.14
End time: 1049.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the hinterland in fact if there is a right side to this that is it yeah  because we really I shouldn't say we I don't know if I include myself in this  but Silicon Valley definitely thinks is better than everybody else and it also

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Valley it's pretty undiverse it's really good to remember that because I think  technologists particularly in Silicon Valley we think we're smarter than  everybody else we're more sensitive we're more enlightened and it's  probably a very good message that now we're just as flawed as everybody else  maybe more so who knows well also the Silicon Valley is made of people it's

Transcript:  some of this software does it was the chaos computer club that did that Bert  there's a great video of them doing this crack they took a picture of a guy and  not even that much of a close-up picture with a simple point-and-shoot camera and  we're able to use that picture from a distance to create a as you say an image  of his iris which they then bent around something and it fooled the Samsung so  you always think of iris scanning as being the best way to do this right I  don't know I think this would be a bit of a shock but again Apple's not afraid  of that kind of thing remember Apple did the same thing with the headphone jack  right didn't we all a year ago say I'll don't never get rid of the headphone

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  think the security fact is there's no method of authentication that's a hundred  percent secure not password not a fingerprint not anything I mean so this  is gonna be just as fallible and I think it just yeah this is why Apple requires  you periodically to enter in your real password when you're doing things like  changing the system or anything really critical so you know I don't have any  huge objection to it it just seems a little shocking given you know all the  work they've done to get Apple pay up to a standard I mean if Apple pay and  to work with facial recognition that's great I just I think they'd have to for  the dark problem I think they'd have to have something like the the connect  sensor in there you know which it can sense in the dark because it's shooting  out IR beams so I don't know it's gonna be tough to solve yeah I think if

Start time: 2219.18
End time: 2255.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  there's you know we this is connected to another story that was in the rundown  but if if this were Google doing this that'd be more freaked out or Facebook  because they like to capture as much media information biometric data as  possible and hoard it and store it and sell it but Apple doesn't have that  business so I think if there is a company that's gonna be like taking 3d  scans of my face and I had to choose is it is it Amazon Apple Facebook or Google  I which I would choose the the least of the four evils with respect to privacy  which I think is Apple in this case I hear so there's always this impression

Start time: 2255.04
End time: 2267.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that Apple is protects your privacy better but I also hear again and again  and even security experts saying oh I would never use an Android phone if you  want to be secure use an iPhone do you do you all agree with that I don't agree

Start time: 2267.14
End time: 2280.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I hear it yeah I don't agree you don't agree I mean look I really I think  everything has a risk and androids have risks and there are probably somewhat  more risks on Android and they're on iOS but I don't know it's a risk I guess I'm

Start time: 2318.32
End time: 2337.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  well are we talking security or privacy I mean the one well there's two things I  brought up both yeah and they're both issues given one thing is that the  Apple Store is a little better at vetting apps in the Google Store is so  you're more likely to get an insecure app coming on to the Android platform  than the iOS that's true and then the privacy issue but again I'll raise that

Start time: 2337.58
End time: 2343.30

Start time: 2343.38
End time: 2375.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  we hear stories of them getting at the end of the day it's sort of like Brianna was talking about you know  there's no perfect security at the end of the day we're all responsible for our  own security I mean making sure you vet the apps you use making sure you don't  download rogue apps how many times have you looked for an app and you type in  the name of a product and you get another company's app that comes up in  the search and you blindly you know if you blindly install it and accept it you  could very well have a rogue app simply because you were just not quite careful  enough of what you downloaded so you know we're still responsible for I want

Start time: 2377.30
End time: 2403.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  to do a legal solution on that I think we've got to have a consumer bill of  rights when it comes to privacy like we're clearly having companies that have  predatory practices that just take advantage of normal people you know as  far as the question iPhone or Android I think both are fine operating systems  with fine security architecture to me it's the update issue you know Android  just does not update their operating system frequently enough for me to have

Transcript:  Google phone and I have the Nexus 6p for my second phone and you know I use that  so it's pretty solid but it's just so security if you can afford it basically  Google Play phone yeah basically you know and for me like I look at John  Podesta who basically you know caused a lot of problems by clicking links so I'm  very very cognizant of that right but I think ultimately the answers we've got  to you know I think we've got to pass new protections for consumers you know  we make sure our drugs are safe we make sure our roads are safe we make sure our  buildings are safe I think we need to start looking and making sure like your  software can't just suck up massive amounts of information about you.

Transcript:  The technologist who wants to be a legislator how do you, Ms. legislator, keep up with the  technology because Congress isn't particularly good at keeping up with  technology and how do you create laws that are kind of you know agnostic when it comes to  technology so that you don't wind up putting all that putting the technologists

Start time: 2466.12
End time: 2489.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  into a box? That's a great question you know the way I want to do it is I want  to say if you are holding massive amounts of data you are liable for  keeping that data safe now that doesn't mean you can't ever be hacked but it  means if you are not following the best practices of information security then  you know you could very well end up. Congress can say that but you can't tell

Start time: 2489.98
End time: 2493.98

Start time: 2494.16
End time: 2523.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  external boards that look at that and update it you know the the we just had a  political operation that let out a huge database of voter information out there  they threw it on a server in plain text without encryption and without even a  password that is massively reckless they should end up in court you know  someone that just makes it happens to get hacked when they're following best  practices you're good but I think until there's a legal consequence for this  it's expensive to do information security right. So that's two different

Start time: 2524.06
End time: 2555.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  things so there's there is and I agree with you there should be legal  consequences for not doing it right and letting stuff out but I think I also  agree with Larry I wouldn't want government to proscribe how to do it  right or even to say well you have to do it right I think what it strikes me that  what Congress should do is make penalties for doing it wrong. Yeah.  Isn't that seem do you understand the distinction I'm making? As a non

End time: 2625.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  legislator can I weigh in with some BS? Yeah. Totally uninformed but  theoretically possible we don't I think I the way the lines are being drawn I  like I would also add that there needs to be some regulatory or legislative  basically the people need to say what belongs to whom I think one of the  bigger the biggest problems with privacy and security around our private  information is that it is not seen as our information that this is now  intellectual property of Facebook intellectual property of Google and my  browser history my search history my location history my message history  doesn't belong to me and it can be shut off at any moment even though there's a  huge chunk of my identity and my own value tied up in these services I don't  have any recourse if they lose it or you know so it's the property line seems to  me is drawn in the wrong place whereas if we were talking about my clothes that  I purchased and owned or my home that I'm legally leasing if someone damaged  it or caused it to be damaged through reckless endangerment they would have  some sort of liability but their view of me is considered to be theirs as opposed

Start time: 2625.66
End time: 2663.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  to me. Yeah I completely agree with that though I think that's a very tricky  legal question to solve what I want to do is I want to put an external board  if you look at standards like you know H.264 right that standard is decided by  some engineers on a board that look at and make decisions I think with that  same way if we can get people that aren't politicians so it's not politicized  to be making a set of best standards the same way you know electrical engineers  come through and update the electrical code for the building we're all sitting  in I think that's the way to do it so keep it with experts and don't keep it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  those two lines cross isn't it well and think about what think about the dollars behind each  of those curves so the the cable household is paying i don't know an average of 120 a month  or something maybe for cable yeah and the opportunity to extract more money from them  is limited by just what that cable company offers maybe an occasional pay-per-view fight  maybe you get someone to upgrade their package uh maybe you add phone service or internet service  but there are these step functions there's not a lot of uh micro purchasing or incremental kind  of revenue being added whereas amazon prime which is what 100 bucks a year and then the purpose of  prime is to get you to spend more dollars like that the more you spend the more you get out of  that so like the return on that hundred is way higher to amazon than a return on the hundred  that goes to a comcast or a charter or whoever and that so the they're already they're already  winning and if you just think about how much money they're sucking out of the houses that are  prime members versus how much money a cable company is sucking out of houses who are subscribers

Transcript:  well you said you wanted to mention something is it well you know i i just so we've all heard about  donald trump cyber bullying everybody here has heard about i'm looking at my connect safety dot  over there if you're if you're if you're me if you're me yes yeah and you know and the fact is  i think that whatever you think of donald trump and i bet you there are people in our audience  who like him a great many support his policies and that's a legitimate thing to be but that doesn't  mean you have to support his behavior and so the point of this article and podcast the exam is to  examine what happens if you are a trump supporter you admire his policies but you do not admire his  the way in which he treats women the way in which he demeaned his opponents during the campaign  how do you talk to your children how do you explain that the most powerful person in the world who  our family may have voted for is acting badly and we don't want you to act that way so i sort  of explored that with some of the leading experts on cyber bullying in the world people like  patty aggitstin who's the head of the cyber bullying international bullying prevention  association and justin patchen who runs the cyber bullying research center and rosalyn  wyndham wiseman who wrote the book uh that was the basis for the movie mean girls and really  exploring how you talk to your children and it's kind of a fascinating set of advice that shows  up in both the column and in the podcast that you can separate out his behavior from his policies  and i mean i know a lot of people don't agree with his policies and that's fine too and i also make  the point that liberals have to be careful not to fall into the same trap so i was aghast that many  of my facebook friends made fun of chris chris chris chrissy last week for being on the beach  and they were absolutely right to criticize the fact that he was on a public beach that was closed  to the rest of the state but then they started with fat shaming and fat jokes and i think that  is very annoying you can criticize christy you can criticize trump you can criticize anybody  but stick to the issues and not start demeaning them as human beings and their physical  characteristics so that's kind of some of the things that you know i think we need a more civil  society regardless of the political realm which probably needs to be shaken up as well but uh i  say brianna when you get to congress treat everybody nicely even your opponents they're

Transcript:  yeah so um can we go to this well too often because remember we did this a couple of years  ago for sopa there was internet freedom day uh uh it seems like we've done this a few times  it's been successful in fact the whole issue of net neutrality uh probably wouldn't even exist  if the previous chairman of the fcc tom wheeler hadn't uh been slammed by millions of comments  telling him he should use title two and assert uh the right of the fcc to enforce net neutrality  that's what's at stake today there's a reversal of that existing fcc policy to support net neutrality  and the comments begin once again uh now there was the history of this is a little checkered uh  remember they opened for comments and then it was slammed by people commenting and then they said oh  this is a ddos attack and they shut the comments down never offering the fcc never offered any  evidence that it was in fact a ddos attack the ddos was a lot of people having an opinion about  john oliver had something to do with this john oliver uh created a website uh something something  the fcc screw the fcc uh f the fcc something like that um so i guess july 12th is the internet  wide day of action to save net neutrality a lot of companies even netflix which for a while said  oh we don't need to net neutrality anymore we we already won one thing is interesting is i i actually

Start time: 6531.02
End time: 6577.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  well i think that there's a case to be made right where if from a cost savings perspective  and we've been spent a lot of time talking about amazon deals and how they're not really deals but  if you get a cell phone and it has an allowance of you know two gigabytes a month of data but  youtube is thrown in for free or that provider's preferred music plan is thrown in for free  you could argue that consumers benefit and i think that's the twisted way  of painting this picture is that by sort of determining winners and losers at this high  corporate level you can offer that for free but it's at a great disservice to the potential  they're doing that anyway voice a new platform all right all right because i think i think there are  a counter argument against net neutrality yeah there are legitimate i have to say this there

Start time: 6580.18
End time: 6620.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  are legitimate people intelligent people who are in favor of dropping title two regulation for a  variety of reasons there are intelligent people who say the government including the fcc should  in no way govern the internet and i have to agree with that but i would i would point out  that that's not what we're asking the fcc to do we're not asking them to regulate the internet  we're asking them to regulate companies that bring the internet to millions of consumers who have  already shown that they would like to choose winners and losers on the internet and what we're  trying to say is this i think it's appropriate for government to regulate that and it's practically

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  now it's up to congress i think this is one of these i think this is one of these great issues  that it's not really a partisan issue i mean i know a lot of libertarians that feel just as  strongly about net neutrality as i do and you know one of the things i think is just so interesting  is engineers i talk to that work in tech we all understand the dangers that are here for you know  free dispersal of information so i i think the only i think there are some fringe people that  have a different opinion but i think generally speaking the people advocating for this are the  big telecom companies which have huge lobbying um you know firms in washington dc you know al  franken in his last book we were talking about that earlier leo you know he talks about uh working  with comcast and how they came and testified before congress with the mbc universal deal  and completely uh reneged on what they said they were going to do so you know i just think there's  every single reason to be skeptical that these giant telecom companies are going to  you know treat this correctly so i'm 100 in favor of it i guess i have to i should have booked

Transcript:  with uh with uh patents yeah and there's a big battle going on right now between apple and  qualcomm and uh the more i learned about this the more i'm kind of on the side of qualcomm believe  it or not really yeah so here's here's and you can argue tell me tell me why i'm wrong here kind of my  starting to think this way qualcomm did create a huge number of innovations they invented cdma they  made cdma radios that's where they made their big bucks of course cdma is being phased out now  but nevertheless anybody who makes a cell phone uh must license technology from qualcomm you just  have to they own so many patents in that area and and rightly they're not a patent troll they invented  so many technologies that are using cell phones apple uh was paying them a lot of money i'm told  it was it ended up being a few dollars per handset that's what samsung pays and others but at some  point apple decided we don't want to pay anymore and so they're suing qualcomm for a billion dollars  and stopped paying the license fees qualcomm has countersued saying we want our license fees  um i i'm you know and maybe you know this is of course patent law and so forth this is complicated  but there is a lot of here's qualcomm there's a little poster infographic that qualcomm made on  some of the patents and what qualcomm's latest uh blow in this is to go to the itc the u.s  international trade commission and say apple we want you to rule that apple cannot import any  iphones using the intel chips apple last year in the iphone 7 replaced the qualcomm chip in some  of their phones not all of them with intel radios the intel radios did for lte they didn't work as  well and apple this is another thing qualcomm's suing over apple slowed down the qualcomm radios  because they wanted them to be the same they wanted every iphone to be the same so i have an intel  radio in my iphone because i got it from t-mobile i think it was a it was at at t-mobile have the  intel chips because they're they're gsm right and uh apple slowed down the uh the verizon and sprint  phones so that they would all be equally slow which qualcomm was mad about our technology is  better but apple's making it limp um and so they're they've asked the itc to block to ban all  intel-based iphones from the united states it seems like part of the um go ahead briana and then

Start time: 7110.72
End time: 7198.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  yeah yeah my husband he is head of ip uh for major uh for major company on the nasdaq right so we  talk about uh you know intellectual property a lot in our house i i definitely agree with you that  qualcomm has an awesome case here and they did invent you know the core technology there but the  way that this was negotiated originally with the iphone it's not that they're paying a standard fee  for these core technologies it's that they're getting a certain percentage of every single  iphone sale period and apple isn't saying we don't want to pay anything for your patents  they are saying we want to bring you back to the table and pay you a more standard fee  something we talk about a lot in um you know intellectual property is a reasonable licensing  rate for core technologies like cdma so i think that this is one of the situations where i think  both people are right you know qualcomm did a lot of innovation there but the reason people buy  iphone today or at least this is apple's argument has more to do with the screen technology the  the responsiveness of it touch id you know the camera those core features and apple's argument  is you know that that cdma technology inside of it the speed of it that's not why people are buying  phones so i think that's that's a believable argument so i think here's the counter argument

Start time: 7198.16
End time: 7213.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  if they're not buying phones for that take that out of your phone and see if they buy your phone  right yeah right right i think you may say they're not buying the phones because of that  but if you take it out they ain't buying the phone that sounds to me like those are critical

Start time: 7213.80
End time: 7241.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  technologies sure and that's i'm not saying i believe that i'm saying that's apple's argument  i would say this for core technologies i do think we need to make sure that people don't like set  the fees so high that consumers end up paying unreasonable fees to you know basically pay for  these patents so we need reasonable licensing rates for core technologies yeah isn't it franned

Start time: 7241.82
End time: 7258.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  fair and reasonable i can't remember what fran stands for but i i don't know how many of these  are franned patents at least six qualcomm asserts are not franned they're not essential but apple  uses them and as a result apple should pay for them if you're going to use them pay for them

Start time: 7259.42
End time: 7274.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  i don't know you know the problem is that that apple doesn't want to pay a percentage you know  of these phone sales they're too much cash is going out as a percentage they could just lower  the price of the iphone and effectively pay qualcomm less money we would all be happier
