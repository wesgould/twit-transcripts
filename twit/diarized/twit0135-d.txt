Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For your free audiobook, visit Audible.com slash twit.  And by listeners like you.  Thanks for your donations.  It's time for twit and ladies and gentlemen, we have a great twit panel today.  Joining us, Jerry Pornell, who hasn't been on in a while because he's not been feeling well and his voice is still a little gravelly,  but he says he's going to whisper and it'll sound better.  Hey, Jerry.  Hi, I'm going to talk soft.  You sound fine when you talk soft.  So just whisper.  And the magic of technology.  We can hear you fine.  We also hear your breathing.  So whisper, but don't breathe if you don't mind.  I don't know if you can figure that out.  Do that.  Also here, Jason Calacanis, who is,  you know, basically this is the panel of people who didn't go to South by Southwest and there's about four of you.  Jason had just finished playing basketball on quick.com and now he's here with us.  He is a multimedia guy.  Hey, Jason.  Hey, thanks for having me.  Always glad to have you on.  You've become a welcome regular on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's getting a little momentum.  I feel it's I think I'm making up for that episode 57, the infamous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what everybody says?  I hated Calacanis when I first heard him, but now I kind of like him.  And you know, that's what they said about the Dvorak too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's what people have been telling me my whole life.  I hated you at first.  I met you.  I thought you were a real jerk, but now I really like you.  Now I like you.  Story of my life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's a sign of a good personality.  Love him or hate him.  Also here, somebody everybody loves, Will Harris from GB, the UK.  Seriously, you never got a negative review.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I wish my mother could hear you say those lovely words.  Awesome to be here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  After last week's tweet, I thought I'm going to go with the pros.  Although I thought it was great last week.  We had Dave Weiner on and I think people, you know, Dave rubbed people the wrong way.  What was the reaction?  People, Dave rubs people the wrong way.  And I think some of it was people thought he was a little pugnacious,  but I don't think he was.  I think he was just, you know, talking about his thing, which was RSS, which I found fascinating.  Overall, most of the reactions were very positive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have known Dave Weiner for 30 years and he has not changed his style a bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, he doesn't care if he's abrasive, does he?  Not at all.  And you know what?  The guy's got some standing to talk about things.  So I don't have a problem with it.  I don't find him abrasive to be honest with you.  I've always enjoyed his company.  Exactly.  It's like a strong belt of scotch.  We're going to get a lot of talk about it.  Really a lot of it is gossip.  Maybe I'll start with the news.  And then we'll get to the gossip because the news is really boring.  In fact, you were on with me Jason on the gang.  I guess they call it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The old yeah, the Gilmore gang that we can't call the Gilmore gang because of some bad blood  between Steve Gilmore and Adam Curry.  You're kidding.  That's why there's some from I don't know from Steve because I asked Steve a thousand times about it.  And he would never tell me what you think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got some Adam like sued him and said I own the rights to that name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Basically, he said from I heard the second hand.  So this is all, you know, respected.  But it's Adam Curry banned him from using Gilmore gang and he had a contract with him  or something.  And so that basically Adam Curry killed the gang and nobody wants to say that but he killed  it for a year and then Steve Gilmore came back and started the gang because the gang

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the Gilmore gang was originally a pod show show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was a part was one of the first pod show shows and then it got and right when it started to  hit steam and people were really getting into it.  Boom.  He just cut it.  It was like Dylan going to Woodstock or something and now it's back and it's doing really well.  But you know Steve it's like the anti twit that show, you know, is no structure.  None of the guests get an introduction and it rambles.  So it's incredibly insider and stream of consciousness and annoying but it has moments of brilliant.  So I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's true.  I didn't know who I was talking to on the call until after it was over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like if it doesn't it doesn't matter.  Why would it matter?  Why would you introduce the guests on a talk show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess I know like you got to love that you got it.  You got to that's what's this medium is all about is breaking the rules and I think that's  fine.  But but one of the things we tried to talk about on there and frankly, it's a snore is  what Microsoft did at mix08.  So let's just cover it briefly here because it is I guess there are two mainstream stories  from this week.  One is mix08 Microsoft and Vegas saying the internet is ours resistance is feudal.  The other was Apple announcing its iPhone SDK saying to iPhone developers your apps  are your apps is mine resistance is feudal to us your apps all your apps belong to us.  We'll deal with those and then we'll get to the fun stuff, which is the juicy ass guy.  Excuse me, the juicy gossip coming out of South by Southwest Valley wag.  Madness do you think if it weren't for Valley wag Jason, we would have so much gossip going  on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that Valley wag has changed the entire nature of the internet industry in terms of  you know, there was all this stuff that just wasn't important that now, you know becomes  half the conversation.  It's sort of stupid, you know, but like Jimmy Wells is sex life.  Yeah, I mean that is really I mean who I mean, I don't even want to have to imagine that.  I mean that is brutal, you know, like if of all the things we could talk about that is

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  perhaps the most revolting more brutal for us than him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.  I'm pretty brutal for him too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know the thing about it is are we going to talk about the Jimmy Wells thing?  Well, might as well now.  Yes, the cat's out of the bag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think if you start with sex, then you go into Microsoft and Apple and then you come  out with sex, you're going to have an overall good show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  So here let me give you my 10,000 for view on Jimmy Wells.  I think he's one of the most disingenuous dishonest guys in the business.  And I think that's and I you know, don't mean to be blunt but and I'll tell you why I met a  guy named Larry Sanger Larry Sanger is the co-founder of the Wikipedia.  In fact, he's the guy who will pull up the Wikipedia will Harris will probably do it right  now because it's kind of guy he is and it's it will explain he always does that anyway,  right?  He'll read it.  So he's like having a researcher on the phone.  But anyway, he basically whitewashed Larry Sanger being the co-founder of the Wikipedia.  And so everybody says Jimmy Wells founder of Wikipedia.  And if you say co-founder, he will correct you.  But even the Wikipedians who you know are basically drunk on Jimmy juice and a lot of cases  like they will not whitewash Larry Sanger.  Larry Sanger came to Jimmy Wells who was running Newpedia with the idea of putting a  wiki together.  He was the editor of Newpedia Larry Sanger and Jimmy Wells basically won't give this guy  his due as being the co-founder.  And in fact, there would be no wiki and Wikipedia if it hadn't been for Larry Sanger, which  ergo there would be no Wikipedia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What was what was Wales doing before Wikipedia?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He was doing a softcore porn site called bonus.  Okay, another another disingenuous thing.  I mean the guy has got his own revisionist history that once you get into it, you just  realize the guy has no ethics.  I mean he he basically was running a porn site.  Then he denied he was running a porn site.  They put it back on the Wikipedia.  He took it off and that's what this whole thing is about.  I think is the ethics side of it.  Forget about the fact of what a sex life is who cares.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's his business or whether but or what is expensing is because it sounds like the  accountants at Wikipedia handled that properly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think that's sort of an ethics issue.  If you submit a thirteen hundred dollar stake bill and they turned it down though, they  turned it down.  I know but if you I mean if you're running a nonprofit and the guy who is like the figure  head is trying it tries to do something unethical if you try to do something unethical for  me, that's the same as doing something unethical in my mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it's really interesting if you look up on Wikipedia at the moment.  I mean number one Jimmy Wales is page has a whole section dedicated to role of Wikipedia  creators and the controversy of that.  Although if you look at Larry Sanger's page, Larry Sanger is actually credited as co-founder  as of Wikipedia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  And there's no criticisms on wiki on Jimmy Wales's page since this whole thing blew up.  Yeah, isn't that incredible?  Like the rest of us who have Wikipedia pages like the criticism section becomes twice as  long as your regular bio and everybody with an axe to grind and then they basically are  whitewashing his whole, you know, all this stuff is just whitewashed.  It's unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jerry, you defended Dave Weiner.  You want to defend Jimmy Wales?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not a bit.  I actually pay very little attention to my Wikipedia page because people are always putting  things on there that just don't happen to be true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You were supposed to Jason weren't you supposed to put that I dated?  Who was it?  Somebody somebody hot.  Sharon Stone.  Sharon Stone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that was the ongoing joke.  And it keeps going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We put that in last time.  It kept getting bounced off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Take it on and off.  It goes on and off.  But it's it's you know, the the guy has got an ethics problem.  I think and you know, because I know that he he based I had a run-in with him as well  and he he basically like had I had dinner with the guy at the Wikipedia conference and  we talked for an hour about how to like put advertising and stuff like that on sites and  how to make money and he knew exactly who I was and he came and sat down next to me  and talked to me about weblogs Inc.  And everything and then he wrote a blog post about how he had no idea that he'd ever  met me and I must have been a really boring person or whatever.  And so he sort of like uses really dismissive tone.  I think what you're seeing is like all this pent up like anger towards him because of  the sort of disingenuous stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think that's what happened with Danny Wool who's a former board member and a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  really nice guy.  I've met him a bunch of times sweetheart of a guy who worked really hard and he got  driven out of the foundation.  I mean the whole place is a mess.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's too bad too because Wikipedia has a very great potential.  It's very valuable in many ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think we can save Wikipedia.  Let's not throw the baby out with the bath water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's what they're trying to do.  I mean the people who are the real Wikipedia and are basically trying to distance themselves  from Jimmy Wells and Danny Wool said there was a whole conversation about trying to get  the board was trying to get Jimmy off the board and get him just away from Wikipedia.  And there's a whole Jimmy Wool, Danny Wool has been putting all the stuff at allswool.vlogspot.com  and like the stuff coming out is crazy.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is.  It does feel like there's a bunch of people with a lot of bad feelings that have been  pent up who are now just letting it out.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So did we ever decide that Jimmy Wells is far more interesting than anything to come  out of mix this week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, okay, I'm going to change the subject mix.  I'll tell you what I'll summarize what I think happened to mix and you tell me where  I'm wrong.  Okay, Microsoft freaking out because they look stayed.  They look old.  They look out of touch.  Google's eaten their lunch.  They say we've got to we've got to read.  It's the thing is designed to reach out to developers.  We've got to reach out to developers show them a we know that the internet is happening  the web 2.0 is happening.  We have a strategy.  We are we're here to play.  They you know, a lot of cool demos Steve Ballmer took I think a big risk and came off very  well by letting guy Kawasaki the former Apple dude interview him and I think he Ballmer  showed himself pretty capable of much better than Mark Zuckerberg and we'll get to that  in a second of handling an interview.  But ultimately when it comes out of it is silverlight to you know, silverlight, which  was essentially a flat the originally civil like one was a flash video clone.  Silverlight to now brings dotnet to the web.  It is real.  They've got NBC, you know, was going to do the Olympic site in it.  They've got that great demo at Hard Rock Cafe.  But other than that, what else do you have?  Is there is there anything coming out of that that makes you think Microsoft really does  get it?  Wait, well we had IE 8 right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I'm sorry.  So so what the so that's it to that IE 8 and it's going to be standards-based.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's yeah, there's three modes of IE 8.  There's an IE 6 mode.  There's an IE 7 mode and there's a standards-based they decided contrary to what they previously  decided to make the standards mode be the default mode.  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that's absolutely quite a big thing.  Although arguably it's about five years too late.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I agree with that.  Do you think silverlight is people are going to download silverlight?  You think silverlight is going to get the attention it deserves?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well Nokia said they were going to put it on some of their new phones.  So that's that's something if Nokia is sort of trying to make a play for  much more, you know with the N80 and the I know Jason you've got a Nokia that you stream with right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I have the N95.  So I mean listen the the fact that you know Apple won't run flash on their machines is  I think a big part of this story as well.  Like you bet everybody's fighting to have some platform for the interactive web, you know,  something that takes you know, because Ajax was basically a hack, right?  So now like what can we do next?  Seems like silverlight, flash which is the incumbent and I guess the iPhone SDK are all going to try to be the place where developers make apps.  And then you also have open social and all the apps being made on Facebook.  So it's it's sort of back to the future for development platforms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is there there if clearly Apple's not going to adopt silverlight?  I don't think course.  They wait a minute.  I shouldn't say that because they're using ActiveSync and they're supporting exchange.  So maybe they will.  I don't know.  But I have to say it sounds like with if Apple's not going to do silverlight, they're not going to flash.  What are they going to do?  Are they going to do SVG or some sort of open source?  You know SVG is scalable vector graphics.  It's a worldwide web consortium open standard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Surely they want everyone just to use QuickTime.  I mean nobody's particularly bothered.  I mean I say nobody's particularly bothered.  The major application for flash on the web is video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But QuickTime doesn't have the interactive features of either flash or silverlight.  I mean, yeah, that's where I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, I mean QuickTime you can do some interactive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It used to but Apple abandoned it.  That's the funny thing.  They were way ahead of the game and early QuickTime had all sorts of interactivity.  And they had it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does that mean that their Apple is killing flash because it will compete on a video level with QuickTime?  Yeah, but they basically are throwing the baby out with the bathwater because it has all these other great features in interactive  and it's got this massive penetration.  And is it Adobe the company that really helped Mac get massive penetration?  I mean, it seems like they're sort of stabbing them in the back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a good point.  Why would that be new?  Have you noticed what's going on here?  There was a time when Microsoft was essentially in the standard setting business,  but their formidable marketing team has become so bureaucratized.  They can't even figure out that infinite numbers of editions of Vista is a stupid idea.  Why would they be able to figure out how to set standards anymore?  They've become such a bureaucracy in what used to be the most powerful marketing outfit in the world  that is just deteriorating as you watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, also at the same time, I think the world's moved away from Microsoft.  Does anybody want Microsoft to set a standard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  People want standards.  I don't care who sets them.  The problem is there is no one with the power to make a standard happen anymore.  It used to be Microsoft could do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They got the default standard just by doing it by making Windows by making it 99% of the market.  That's the standard.  Same thing with IT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are we at the case now where in actual fact the standards that went out then are not the ones that are trumpeted by any particular major player,  but the best standards?  Is that a danger?  Can we think that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what it's supposed to be right?  I mean, HTML, RSS, OPML.  Let the market choose.  Linux, Apache, MySQL.  I mean, the open source standard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The problem is there's no equality in the market.  You have people buying the vote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, I want to we're going to interrupt this conversation because Robert Scoble has just come on the line.  Hey, Robert.  Hey, how are you doing?  Doing very well.  Everybody.  Can you hear Robert Scoble?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hear Robert Scoble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  You can probably hear him from Austin without any electronic intervention.  Robert said South by Southwest.  He just got out of a panel on gossip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep, with Valley Wagon and the New York Times, the whole bunch of people.  We were doing an interesting session because we talked further about the Mark Zuckerberg interview by Sarah Lacey.  And by Jimmy Wales.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you know what we started this show about Robert and I won't keep you because you probably want to move on somewhere.  There's probably a party with your name on it somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, there's like 15.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we won't keep you for more than 10 minutes.  But what we did start this show was saying that Valley Wag alone has really changed the landscape in technology news.  Yeah.  All of a sudden we have to talk about Jimmy Wales.  We have to talk about.  Well, let's talk about this Sarah Lacey thing.  So Mark Zuckerberg does not give a lot of speeches, does not come out in public a lot, certainly doesn't give any interviews.  He gave what was billed as a keynote, but it was really an interview with Businessweek reporter Sarah Lacey, who's written a book on Web 2.0.  She's also done a Newsweek cover story.  She's ostensibly a good journalist.  What you were in the room, Robert, what happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, she was hard to explain because there's some body language stuff that you sort of have to watch the video to get the nuance of her body language.  But a lot of people I've talked to since then say it seemed like she was flirting with him and that was the body language part of it.  So let's leave that aside.  She asked a lot of questions that have already been covered in the media.  Let's back up.  The South by audience is different than any other audience that you'll ever speak in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the first thing to say is these guys are interactive.  They talk back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, first of all, they're interactive.  They're on Twitter.  I mean, I walk into a party and everybody is like talking to me about what's going on in Twitter in the last five minutes.  You know, and who's giving you this or who's this or you know, what's going on with that or you know, and it's all Twitter conversation.  In fact, the parties here are being planned in live time on Twitter.  I have a video of how we got tired of waiting in the Google line and we just started a party within the eight minutes.  And within an hour there was 60 people at the party and you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mike Arrington has been bitching about the fact that Twitter has taken South by Southwest taken over Twitter.  And I did in fact dump some people who were going, were kind of meaningless.  But I have kept a lot of people.  It is kind of fun to watch this at a distance.  This is where Twitter had a coming out party last year.  And man, I mean, it is Twitter is the place to see what's going on South by Southwest at least in 140 by.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you get a little little little bit, but not not much of what's really going.  So I think she I don't know that she's ever been to a South by Southwest.  And I guess that's a lesson for future speakers.  If you shouldn't accept this job unless you've been to because you need to understand this audience is a very heavy web developer audience.  It's a very creative audience.  A lot of their filmmakers walk around.  There's musicians walk around.  But it's a very technical audience and a very tied in to the hardcore audience.  In fact, I bet most of your audience, you know, most of the people in at South by Southwest listen to Twitter.  I bet if you ask in a in a session how many people know who Leo Laporte is, I bet all the hands would go out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me read. I'm going to read some of your Twitter posts as this thing develops.  So you started I'm not at the Zuckersburg speech.  I'm leaving Hilton now.  We'll solder over there to find out if he said anything interesting.  Then you say he's giving a lot of PR answers.  Lacey's asking too many business questions.  Yeah, Twitter and Lacey.  Sarah Lacey lost control of the interview.  Twitter's going crazy with her critiques.  She's getting defensive now.  Poor empathy for the audience.  The audience is asking better questions.  I've never seen such a bad interview of anyone on the stage here.  Totally disappointing.  I mean, it's just it's is she mad at you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, she said yeah on her Twitter.  She actually Twitter toward me and I just put her in apology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is she blaming you for what happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think she's very defensive.  She doesn't I don't think she understood what was going on on stage.  I think she just didn't understand what this audience was expecting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You said it was even worse in the overflow room.  What were people saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, people were saying exactly that.  Where's the hard question?  Where's the why are you asking him about Billy, you know, being a billionaire or why are you asking such softball questions and not forcing him to answer  the PR speak that you know, but is it possible?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it possible?  That's why she was entering interviewing him because I knew her.  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't the reason she was in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have the inside line on this by the way.  All right, Jason Callicannis.  What's the story?  Okay.  She wrote a book about like Kevin Rose and Mark Zuckerberg and I had dinner with her in France and a bunch of people and she is really into Mark Zuckerberg.  I mean, she calls him like Zuck and she was like dropping his name like oh,  Zuck this and Zuck that.  I'm going to throw up in my mouth.  Excuse me.  I would just say I know it but I think she really likes the guy.  She's married.  She's got a husband.  I had dinner with her husband.  It's very cool.  I don't think it's that kind of thing.  But as a journalist, I've watched her operate.  She flirts with people to get information.  It's how she does what she does and she was very upfront about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The South by Southwest audience would hate that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, of course.  So you have and then she I don't think that she's a particularly good interviewer because I saw her do another interview.  And so be you know, what makes for a good journalist in print versus what makes for a good host on a show like Twitter or whatever.  It's two very different things and on stage and being able to ask hard questions and shut up and let the person answer very very different skill set.  I don't think she has that skill set and she's developed a personal relationship with him,  which is really annoying if you're in the audience because nobody knows what you're talking about.  And if you're a fanboy, then it's even worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go ahead.  She bought several of that.  She made the story about her.  She talked about hanging out with him last night at parties and I do that on my blog all the time,  but people give me shit about it and I know I'm sensitive to it when I'm on stage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know that that's not good journalism and I get beat up all the time for doing softball interviews because I don't want to I understand how she feels and I'm sympathetic for her.  But I also think it's really interesting to see an audience at a conference stand up like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you don't see that.  Well, she just built up that the motion you're seeing in my Twitter was what the audience was feeling and what what this is like the revolt there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're about pitchforks and torches here.  Burn the most.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It got worse because at one point she made a flip answer to Zuckerberg.  Zuckerberg said something like ask me a question and the whole audience just erupted.  I mean, I've never seen for 20 seconds they applauded.  Like thank you.  Somebody's asking her to ask a question not just, you know, you know, go on about herself.  And and then she got defensive and that was absolutely the wrong thing to do because she didn't understand where that feedback that fervor was coming from.  And she got defensive and then she she felt that she lost control of the interview at that point and the audience basically took it over and then everybody was cringing.  Right.  You know, it was not a comfortable interview at that point to be in the audience of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've been there.  I mean, I think, you know, this there's some analogy here to like when Dave Weiner heckled me at Nome decks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it gave you a hard time for being too commercial in your speech at Nome decks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. And I, you know, I basically give the same talk.  I talk for one third about an industry issue.  I talk for a third about what I'm doing.  And then one third I have the audience ask questions.  I've been doing it for over a decade.  It works fine.  But he felt compelled to yell at me from the back row like you're spamming us and he didn't want to hear about Mahalo even though I was there to talk about Mahalo.  Whatever.  But the point is these events in our industry has changed and blogging is what did it.  The people in the audience because they're bloggers and Twitter is a level playing field and you can tell Scoble he's an ass or you can tell me I'm an ass and you can get direct contact with us.  And because blogs, you know, Alan Stern from Center Networks is like and Matt Ingram like these two nobodies.  I'm putting my air quotes on nobodies to nobodies are in the top five ten links on tech meme every day.  You know, they have equal share of voice now.  And so people are sitting there in the audience and they believe I have equal share of voice.  It's my right to stop the person on the audience on the stage because I'm as important as them.  It's my time to and it's just a different vibe now.  And in some ways it's better.  And then in some ways it gets really ugly like this.  It's got a terrifying mainstream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've seen I've seen audiences in the early 90s do this.  I was in a Shelby Speed Steal speech one time and audience did exactly the same thing.  So it's it's it's happened in audiences before.  It's just this one because everybody's so tied in it.  I don't I don't know if Twitter because Twitter is making a mob mentality and the back channel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The back channel means that people can you know, it's it's I've been in the mall before things happen in mobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You do things you would never do because the mob acquires a personality of its own.  I've never it's interesting to see something like Twitter become that that medium for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It happened at the web like three four years ago.  I remember when Mina Trott was on stage and the back channel and crazy and I told the week I was like,  I don't really want to speak at the web.  I'll take a pass.  I'll just be an audience member or something.  If you're going to put a big IRC behind me so people can be like, hey, you know, jerk off, you know,  it's like if somebody wants to be, you know, confrontational step up to the microphone, right?  Tell me your name. Tell me what company you're with.  Ask me a question, you know, that's the way I feel about it.  Let's have let's let's go at it.  I'll mix it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's funny, Robert, because you used to be regular in my chat room of the radio show and I always used to call you guys  the wise ass kids in the back of the room.  And I actually enjoyed it, but I could see what you were saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually want to give a talk with Twitter both in front of me so I can see the feedback as well as in back of me  because I find that to be challenging as a speaker.  But it's not for every speaker.  It's unfortunate that Sarah just didn't know why the audience turned on her at that point.  And and then she got defensive about it and and I couldn't save it.  Couldn't make a joke to pull it back or or, you know, get get control of the situation again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's just lack of experience that and that can happen to anybody.  I wouldn't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Believe me, I would not do as well.  That's a tough thing to do.  Okay, let's take audience questions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just you know, walk off the stage at that point.  By the way, I just got a Twitter from Kevin Rose.  He's heading with Mark Zuckerberg.  I'm sorry, Zuck, because that's what Kevin calls him to apparently to the Shakespeare's come out.  I know you want to get there Robert real quickly though before you go.  How's South by Southwest?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a great conference.  I got it.  It's not so much that you're going to learn a lot in the in the sessions.  All those sessions have been very good.  It almost feels like a gathering of some gathering of the tribe of the Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It feels like Woodstock.  It felt like that last two years ago more so last year, but this year really it seems like everybody is there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's bigger.  They I think they added a thousand to two thousand people to the interactive this year and it's definitely bigger.  There's a lot more parties and a lot more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't even get into the parties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Well, you said it.  You don't really care because if you can't get into one party, go to the next one.  If you can't get in that one, you you find a bar that's empty and you Twitter and within an hour 60 people show up.  I mean, it's just incredible the way that you can organize things here.  So in certain cases organized against her at the same at the same speed.  Well, Scope, I'm sorry for my part.  You know, it's tough to be at the middle of a firestorm.  I've been I've been in the middle of a firestorm.  I've been on Valley Way 25 times and I'm sorry that Sarah had a bad day.  And hopefully at some point we can sit down and and I'll, you know, discuss with her what what went wrong if she wants to learn what went wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sounds like Larry Niven's flash crowds in action.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is, isn't it?  It's exactly what it is.  It's the flash crowd.  Well, Kevin, Kevin Zucker heading to Shakespeare.  Scope, you got to get over there.  Scope, the Scope, the Scope, the Bobo.  I really appreciate your calling in.  Hey, no problem.  Thanks. Take care.  Robert Scobel.  There you go.  I thought we'd get a I love this breaking news.  Direct from the scene, Robert Scobel back to you.  So and by the way, Jimmy Wales, he's having dinner with friends and I know that because I'm on his following him on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So should I supposedly in on Necker Island this weekend?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Direct message him Jimmy Stakes on me.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think he's on Necker Island.  Like what's Necker Island?  Necker Island is what's his name's Island.  Richard Branson's.  There's some summit going on there this weekend for global warming.  But there's a really interesting post up on Danny Wolse thing that he just posted like in the last hour basically saying there's an inside.  This is the first anybody's going to hear about this because this post literally got out like a minute or two ago.  And he emailed me there are some he's got some conspiracy theory going that and because Danny was involved with the board and work there that elevation partners is trying to basically commercialize and move the Wikipedia from a nonprofit into a for-profit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's really interesting.  I was at a meeting on Monday with that Robert Mcme happened to be at and he was talking about.  How much can I talk about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, he's mentioned in this post, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He was talking about the notion of exactly that and he said something.  It kind of my jaw dropped.  He said Google's dead Google's history.  You can't index the web.  He sees these kinds of privatized Wikipedia's as the future of search, you know, in a way that's what you're doing.  It's expert search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think people see it.  I mean the writings on the wall, but this is really interesting.  It's he says here Jimmy and Form Sue and Sue is somebody who works there.  This is in June of last year.  She must meet with Roger McNamee of elevation partners in San Francisco that Monday before the holiday and she that the but that this must be kept discreet.  She flies there flies back the same day.  And then they put this guy Eric resigns from the board then becomes a full time person.  And then he goes and meets with Roger McNamee of the elevation partners, which is Bono's investment firm.  Very interesting.  I think what they're trying to do.  I mean, this is really interesting if they're trying to take the nonprofit and then convert it into a pro for profit.  I mean, this could be a couple of billionaires come out of this.  I mean, it's really sketchy what's going on here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And this is you know, it's almost a little bit of a coup isn't it at this point where I mean the same thing happened.  I remember to the CD service.  What was that called when you know, what I'm talking about with looked up the CD, where is it basically the community had developed this CDDB CDDB had developed this database and then went private.  And I wonder if the same thing happened with Wikipedia.  That'd be a hell of an outroar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, isn't that impossible?  But I mean, isn't all well, here's what happens.  Isn't that isn't the particular license that Wikipedia is licensed under?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You are correct.  You are correct.  But then look at this December 1st, Sue assembles Sue assumes role of executive director Jimbo announces at the Wikimedia Foundation will adopt a creative comments compatible license.  And this is what they've been trying to do for a while.  Even insiders like David Gerard seem surprised.  The decision was announced at the San Francisco party hosted by elevation partners.  Oh, so it seems like what they're trying to do is can the inside board members are trying to restructure the license of Wikipedia in order to basically steal it or leverage it in some way and make Jimmy a lot of money.  It's basically what it is.  I mean, from what I heard from the insiders, Jimmy Wells is extremely frustrated by the fact that he basically turned the new PDA into Wikipedia made it a nonprofit.  And it was like the reason he made a nonprofit because it had like three or four thousand dollars a month in bills.  Did you want to pay?  And so spent it all of a sudden.  He makes it a nonprofit.  He doesn't pay much attention to it and explodes and it would be worth, you know, five billion dollars today easily.  That's the conversation you had with him is just add ads and it would be worth a hundred million in advertising a year and I would pay for everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so but then he said, no, I'm going to stay pure.  Adding ads would corrupt it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. And here's the email that he posted to the Wikipedia list on October 15th in 2006.  I would like to gather for the communities of some examples of works you would like to see made free.  Dream big.  Imagine there existed a budget of 100 million to purchase copyrights to be available under a free license.  What would you like to see purchased and released under a free license?  Photo libraries, textbooks.  I was recently asked this question by someone who is potentially in a position to make this happen.  And he wanted to know what we need, what we dream of that we can't accomplish on our own or what we would expect to take a long time to accomplish on our own.  So basically there's some sort of I mean, this is like, you know, three days in the condor or something like that.  There's some deep, you know, French connection stuff going on here.  And Danny Wool was the guy who was there who was like Jimmy's assistant during the time.  And he's got all the emails.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So obviously he's he knows the story.  Jerry, you've been covering this industry for 30 years.  Is this is this the kind of stuff that's always gone on and it just wasn't as public or are we in a very interesting Wild West phase here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think we're in a Wild West phase.  I think back in Dave Winner's day, there was a lot more social responsibility and a lot.  Nobody thought they would become billionaires out of this stuff.  Millionaires maybe, but not billions.  Now there is so much money out there that it's the usual.  The free market will eventually drive itself to selling children in the marketplace.  Slavery, human meat.  I mean, without regulation, the market will do anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so because so much money has gotten into this, it's just completely gotten out of hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There is so much money.  If you offer a billion dollars, there is nothing that somebody won't do.  And by nothing, I mean atom bombs, poison.  Now that's so much money that you and I would not do some terrible things for it.  But someone would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now you my sense of your politics is that you are not a big government guy.  You're not interventionist, but isn't this where government comes in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But of course, look, I make no secret.  I am conservative with a libertarian vector, but you must have government.  Otherwise, the market will just drive itself to the least common denominator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jason, you're the ultimate capitalist and entrepreneur.  You agree?  Is that what we're seeing here?  Is there so much money that Jimmy Wales and the board would just go, who cares?  It's billions.  We'll do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think there's two things that are colliding that's different than before.  You have this open source movement.  I mean, there's always been people who are in technology and typically they love technology,  which is, you know, myself included.  And the fact that, you know, it's a growing space so you can make a lot of money in it.  But I didn't get into computers because I could make a lot of money.  I got into it because I had a passion for it, which is basically,  I think, majority of people.  If you came into it just for the money, you're probably going to fail.  You have to love what you do, obviously, because you got to do it for seven days a week,  ten hours a day.  But what's different now is there was this whole nonprofit, goody-two-shoes, open source space, right?  We're all going to build, you know, these nonprofit open source companies and we're just doing it  for the good of the community, right?  And it was all very lovey-dovey like Wikipedia.  And then all of a sudden people say, oh, my SQL selling for a billion dollars.  You can actually make open source is just a marketing tool in some ways, right?  It's a marketing program.  And so if you have a creative...  It's true though.  If you think about it, an open source license, basically, or creative commons license,  creative commons is a better way to say it.  Creative commons is a marketing tool, maybe not open source as much.  But creative commons is saying, oh, well, anybody can take my content as long as they link back to me.  What is the currency of the web?  Links, right?  According to Google.  So it's just basically syndication without getting paid and getting paid by the link.  And so what you see happening here is, okay, let's take all this content.  We'll make it free.  Maybe we'll move it over to Jimmy's Wiki, you know, and get the people from...  And Jimmy hired a bunch of people from Wikipedia to come work on Wikia.  And there's, you know, massive confusion in the market as to are they separate companies?  Most people think Wikia search is a, you know, part of Wikipedia.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the for-profit arm of it, Wikia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wikia is Jimmy Wells' company, back-end venture capitalist.  That he's basically...  And the real inside track there is they basically won't allow certain types of content on Wikipedia, right?  If you try to put episode guides or, you know, the 15th or 20th Jedi Knight in Star Wars, they tell you,  no, go put that on Wikipedia.  Right.  Oh, who owns Wikipedia?  Yeah.  Oh, Jimmy Wells does.  Yep.  So they're basically anchoring the Wikipedia, not...  They basically...  And this is a huge conflict of interests that I think could get them into a lot of trouble.  Perhaps even financial trouble is if you're saying take the assets off of this site and go put them onto this for-profit one.  Oh, man.  There's something funky going on there.  Now, what they can fall back on is, oh, well, the license says, you know, there's a lot of gray here, you know, like, oh, there's a license.  Anybody can go take this work.  It's free.  So, you know, Leo, you can make Wikipedia too and take it and whatever.  Go run with it.  But it's all pretty shady in my mind.  Will, you got any thoughts on this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm just absolutely amazed by the phrase Wookiee people.  Anything that awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's actually the busiest Wiki site of all.  It's huge page views.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Man, that is just...  That blows my mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you know what?  I mean, it's so weird this whole like becoming such a, you know, ridiculous, you know, web celebrity.  Because remember we had web celebrities in Web 1.0?  Yeah.  And it, you know, it sort of didn't mean much.  It meant you got some press on TV.  But now it's like it means that people are like obsessing over you and, you know, getting your chats of your five or six different affairs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, Valiwag feeds into that.  But I wonder if we slightly overstate its importance because fundamentally, you know, web celebs are an easy way into a story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's also an echo chamber.  I mean, we all hear this because we're in the, you know, in the mix.  But does the gen...  I mean, you go out in the street.  Does anybody know what's going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I mean, that's it.  I mean, web celebs are an easy way for the man on the street to get a story about technology and about the internet.  And as the internet and technology gets more and more important, so these stories become a little bit more high profile.  You know, whether it's Zuckerberg and his girlfriend or whether it's whales and his activities.  And I think that the collaboration in gossip, sorry, the correlation in web gossip, web celebrities and time is going up based on how important the internet and technology is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think that's exactly what Jason was saying, is that now it's mainstream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  On value ag or something, you know, which is sort of picking up on the trend, but isn't necessarily driving it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow, I just, you know, it feels like it all changed on this show.  I mean, I know this is something that's been building up for a long time, but we're watching it happen right now, almost in real time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, the funny thing is that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was here to talk about Mix and Apple's SDK.  And what happens?  It's about Sarah Lacey and Wikipedia.  So we are in echo chat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This week in gossip, quick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This week in gossip indeed, but how much of this gets beyond that conference?  I mean, I can remember big crises when we used to go to the hackers conference, but nobody ever heard of them outside of our talking to each other.  Good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good point.  I mean, that's the...  I guess that's the ultimate thing.  I mean, in a way, if you'd want to talk about Silverlight, you want to talk about the SDK, these are things that are going to make a difference.  These are things that change people's lives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the iPhone SDK is going to change very many lives.  I've just recently started playing with an iPhone, which was oddly enough bought for me by a consulting group because they wanted my opinions on it.  So they sent me an iPhone to play with and it's a lot of fun.  But I think that SDK is going to just change the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's what the iPhone needed.  I mean, the iPhone is a great platform, but it's a platform and without apps, what do you got?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You may remember that in the moat in God's eye in 1974, I described the pocket computer, which in those days was just...  I pulled it out of my fingernails.  Or somewhere.  Yeah, but the fact is that I described a utility tool, something that if you had one, you would really love it.  Right.  And we put that in the story.  Well, I have one in my pocket now.  It's an iPhone.  It's a little crippled.  It doesn't do a lot of the things, but it has a lot of memory.  It has a lot of computing power.  It has a lot of potential.  There is no reason it can't do many of those things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The developers are complaining about a couple of things.  First of all, of course, the initial complaint is that the only way to put an app on the iPhone is to go through Apple.  You can make free apps, but if you want to charge for it, Apple takes 30%.  Now, they're going to put an app store on iPhone 2.0.  It'll be available right there on your iPhone.  And that's got to be of some value to developers.  But some developers are saying, I don't want to give Apple 30%.  There's no choice.  The other one that's maybe even more significant, and people are determining this from reading the EULA and reading the SDK,  is that you cannot multitask on the iPhone.  That if your application is running and the phone rings, your application will quit.  There is no state from application to application.  Nothing can run in the background.  And some developers are saying, whoa, that really limits what we can do.  Of course it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But this is the first edition of the iPhone 2.  Right.  And EULA's change, SDKs change, nothing's fixed in stone.  This is not 1.0.  This is like 0.75.  That's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And a couple of really interesting things, you know, on that with the SDK.  And number one is that, you know, Apple caved to the pressure to let people run their own apps on the iPhone.  Hallelujah.  But they're obviously still very, very keen to make sure that whatever anybody else does,  like, okay, you can have your apps, but nothing is going to alter or impinge or detract from our iPhone experience.  Like nothing you can put on this phone is going to hinder anything on the iPhone.  So as soon as the phone rings, you know, your app is going to get dumped and we're going to go back to Apple's iPhone experience.  We can't afford for any kind of, you know, memory hogging applications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I have to say on Windows Mobile, that's one of the problems.  That's the major problem.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you not think this is the right idea that Apple is doing the right thing by making it?  No, I have.  It is after all a telephone.  Right.  And you want it to be a telephone for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I absolutely agree.  I think it's exactly the right thing to do.  The other thing is that, you know, the major problem, you know, Apple's biggest nightmare has got to be that someone writes a program for the iPhone and it's a virus.  And suddenly the headlines everywhere are, you know, major iPhone virus breaks out, everybody's screwed.  And that is such bad PR.  And that just makes Apple every other platform out there.  So by restricting it to, you know, you've got to sign your code, you can only go through our platform, etc.  I think they're doing the right thing because there is no, you know, there is not going to be any malicious code getting through there.  And that is a better user experience.  The trade off is some freedom for developer versus an awesome user experience.  And if you're Apple, you can see why you'd go for the awesome user experience because your entire reputation is built on an awesome user experience.  Hear, hear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Two things.  One, they plan this all along.  So it's not like they bow to, you know, people saying we have to allow applications.  They plan this all along.  Just Steve Jobs is not going to, you know, even discuss with any of us mere mortals, you know, when he's going to put applications on there, if he's going to do it.  He just said, you know, he just didn't answer questions about applications.  Yeah, we'll do it when we do it.  And so he planned it all along.  Number two, how long before somebody writes an application that like records your phone call and like streams it onto the web somewhere and like makes a or turns on your, you know, turns on your phone and automatically dials.  And like, you know, let you eavesdrop on it.  I mean, it's a really dangerous thing to develop on these things.  So, of course, they have to make it closed.  But I think that there are kinks in Apple's armor, you know, like we always say on the show and other ones like when you're when you're winning, you can be closed when you're losing.  You go for open, right?  So Google searches, you know, sort of a black box because they're winning there.  But, you know, on the phone, they're totally open.  And, you know, if you look at Apple, they have massive, you know, market share in iTunes and MP3s and whatever and selling songs.  So they're closed and the iPhone, they're going to have massive market share.  They're going to be closed until people like Amazon come along.  And Amazon's been selling these non-DRM MP3s.  And I'm hearing more and more every week.  Somebody tells me, hey, I'm buying MP3s on Amazon.  Me too.  Because I don't you're doing it too, right?  I went to the site and I actually looked at it.  It was a little kludgy, you know, that it wasn't as elegant as iTunes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I was like, but my 256 kilobit, they're cheaper and they're unprotected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And yeah.  And so who wants to have to take, you know, if I have to go to iTunes, buy a song, rip it to a CD, then re rip it back to get it, you know, or use some hacking software.  It's obvious choice.  So now that that and all the music companies like, yeah, let's sell on DRM's music.  And if Amazon lets us set the price, which Steve Jobs won't, people are going to go to it.  I mean, Steve is very.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What happens when Amazon comes along and says, Mr. Jobs, we'd like to do an application on the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He'll probably come up with some way to block him.  I mean, he's not selling them, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they won't let people.  But doesn't that then open him to antitrust?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.  I mean, that's going to happen at some point with the iTunes.  I mean, you know, Microsoft is getting, you know, their butts kicked all the time about antitrust stuff.  You know, the fact that I can't plug another MP3 player into iTunes and download my music is kind of weird.  I mean, and nobody ever brings it up because no other MP3 player is anywhere near as good as, you know, your iPod.  Except now I have this Nokia phone.  I would like to sing podcasts onto it through iTunes.  I would like to plug my BlackBerry into iTunes.  And so he's going to be closed until it makes business sense to be open or the government gets involved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you're a chess player, if you're a chess player, and I would never want to play chess against Steve Jobs because he clearly looks many more moves ahead than I do.  But if you're a chess player, you might say this is a blunder because he's made a move that inevitably leads to antitrust regulation because the next step is Amazon says, great Steve, an SDK.  Here's our application so you can buy music on the iTunes store and put it on your iPhone.  And then Steve has to say no.  Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, Jerry.  Inevitable is a long time.  When you're dealing antitrust and you can afford the lawyers the jobs can afford.  You are not talking about something that happened within the next couple of years.  So he's saying bring it on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can make a lot of money.  You can make a lot of money during the inevitability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Bring it on fat boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The whole Microsoft thing was that no amount of antitrust fine now can undo Microsoft's complete market dominance.  Right.  You can't penalize really in the amount that they have now won, which is 99% or whatever it is of the PC market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And now having won, they are dismantling themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's an interesting another announcement at Apple's.  We shouldn't overlook it at Apple's event is that they are now supporting exchange and they are now adding ActiveSync.  I mean, Apple a long time ago gave up on the business market.  Are they are they aiming at the business market again?  Is the iPhone a wedge into the business market for I think they are creeping towards it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, but I think their approach is they are going to make sure the user experience is fabulous.  That way the business guy will say why should my kids have a better experience on the phone than I do?  And at that point you start getting business saying look, let's us be able to do some of this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it becomes very interesting because as we all know the iPod with the lever by which Mac adoption has been driven in the consumer marketplace for the last few years.  If executives are starting to get to the point where they've got iPhones, they've got exchange and they're thinking here's a really great user experience.  Do they you know, does that become the same kind of Trojan horse for getting business adoption of Macs that you know iPods were for consumer adoption?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Meanwhile, I'll give you another one.  The air it is so cool that a lot of executive computer isn't it?  Yeah, you've got it.  That's the kind of thing that the CEO would carry.  It is just so cool.  You know what that's Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what we missed on the air is it's part of their business strategy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I mean, I bought three of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, this consulting group bought me one too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I like this consulting group Jerry.  You got some good friends now.  I do indeed.  I love it.  You haven't got the air yet though.  Tomorrow.  It comes tomorrow.  We'll get your review and I know we should mention that Jerry while he hasn't written Chaos Manor for Byte sometime.  I don't know what happened to Byte but Chaos Manor lives on at JerryPornel.com.  And at Chaos Manor reviews.  And I tell you I have to say I cut my teeth on your reviews.  I'm not going to say I grew up to you Jerry because I was an adult but that was what inspired me to want to get into this kind of journalism where you represent the end user and their experience in the real world.  And I just I still love reading at JerryPornel.com or ChaosManorReviews.com.  And I'm sure I'll look forward to the air review because you've got that touch.  You got the human touch.  We're going to take a break for our audible commercial.  Jerry, do you have a sci-fi book you'd like to pick for our audible?  Your friend Larry Niven's all over it, but I only you only have Star Swarm on Audible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have to look into it.  I've been spending too much time in medical waiting rooms lately to have paid too much attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're going to I'll tell you what I'm going to recommend Ringworld because while I would absolutely love to recommend Moten God's Eye and you should read it in paper, there's no audio version of it.  But Ringworld is I think considered by many to be one of the seminal sci-fi books by your buddy Larry Niven, your co-author, a guy who works with you Larry Niven, and just a fascinating I think hard science book that really raises some interesting issues.  And it's just great reading.  Highly recommend it. Ringworld won this 1970 Hugo Award for Best Novel, the 1970 Nebula Award for Best Novel.  It is it is one of the great sci-fi books.  Now, if you've never read it, please by all means get it.  And that's how I read it.  Tom Parker does a great job narrating it.  If you have read it and you haven't read it recently, read it again.  It's one of many great books, a lot of great sci-fi.  We're going to get more pornell on audible.com.  Audible is a great way to read when you're driving, when you're working out, when you're doing other things.  Your hands aren't free.  You can't look at a book, but you can get reading done.  I'll tell you if it weren't for audible, I think audible is the cure for road rage.  I've been doing a lot of driving lately.  I had to drive to San Francisco last couple of days.  I'm driving down to San Jose next couple of days and audible cures my road rage.  I don't care if the traffic's bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll tell you when I you know what?  I love it.  I love it when I'm like on a plane and my eyes are a little tired.  I can't read a book, you know, but I don't want to go to bed.  And so I got an hour between that and I just you know, I pop on.  I got the Blade Runner off of audible.  They have Blade Runner.  It's just so pleasant to actually listen to it, you know, to you know, do  Android stream of luxury sleep.  Just you really can you get a lot more when you when you work backwards from  your favorite films to the books, you can just get so much more, you know,  color obviously inside the head to the characters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean that Philip K Dick novel do androids dream of electric sheep.  Oh, yes.  Yes.  What a great night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can I just throw in one more recommendation?  Yeah, go ahead.  We're having a book fest.  You know what?  The whole wookie pedia inspired me.  So audible has the Timothy's on air to the Empire trilogy, which is generally  considered to be the best three books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I never read it.  Oh, I'm so excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what so if you imagine Return of the Jedi, so it's three books by this  guy, Timothy's on chronicling the post Jeddah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I stay away from books about, you know, based on movies.  I oh sure.  The Star Wars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  These three these three are considered the best Star Wars books.  They are absolutely fantastic.  I've read them all and audible has them narrated by Anthony Daniels, the guy that  played C3PO writes reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You want to hear a little bit of C3PO?  Yeah, he's just great.  Actually, this is a Denny Lawson is reading this but Jerry, you know, you know these  books Jerry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, I do.  I'm not the world's biggest Star Trek fan.  I only wrote one episode but Star Trek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You wrote an episode of Star Trek long time ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I used to be pretty good friends with Gene Roddenberry.  I didn't know that.  Which episode did you write?  Oh, no, don't worry about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's I'm sure it's on Wikipedia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If it's not moving to wookiepedia, you probably won't find it.  It was in collaboration with some other people, but don't worry about it.  Yeah, Roddenberry and I used to we were at the Library of Congress conference on  science and science fiction and literature about 20 years ago.  There was a big conference with Sir Fred Hoyle and Gene and me and a bunch of other people.  We had this big big literary conference and I got to know Gene pretty well for as a  result of that, but that was a long time ago.  Have any of you been listening to books on the Kindle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, I haven't put them on the Kindle, but you can put audible books on the  Kindle.  Do you have a Kindle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have a Kindle.  I take it with me everywhere.  I have about 20 books on it.  I have audible books.  I can listen to them.  I can read them.  It is it is awkward at first because you hit buttons you didn't expect to know.  But once you get used to it, it is really very pleasant experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well now that Amazon owns ours buying audible, maybe we could start doing Amazon commercials.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think we already did for the MP3s.  I mean, great company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Leo, I think Amazon see what's great about the Kindle is not so much the technology of  the Kindle.  It's the integrated marketing.  They are doing.  I can sit there in a waiting room and think I want to read an old Nero Wolf novel.  Yep.  And in two minutes for five bucks, I've got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've done the same thing.  And once everything once I would like every book in the world to be on audible and Amazon  and then you would never you could read anything or listen to anything you want.  That's the way it should be.  And let me wrap this commercial up and then we can talk some more Jerry because I've already  got a charge of three times as much for this commercial audible.  You get a free book by going to audible.com slash twit.  Look, there's no question.  This is the way to read to listen and get that Star Wars the Thrawn trilogy.  They've got all three books on there by Timothy's on or Larry Niven Ringworld or get all four.  I don't care.  I'm going to put the Thrawn trilogy on my wish list.  Now, it's just a great way to listen to what you read audible.com slash twit.  We thank you for their support.  Sorry.  I didn't mean to cut you off Jerry.  I just this is getting too good and I don't the problem.  I'll tell you the problem.  The audible ad has to be cut out of the stuff that we give to a AOL for AOL radio.  So if there's too much good meat in there, then I lose too much.  Why do they cut it out?  Why do they cut it out?  AOL radio has a deal.  They have a podcast channel.  They provide us bandwidth in return for us on the podcast channel.  But the deal is that they're commercial free for the subscribers.  So we have to cut ads out for the stuff that runs on the AOL podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  But if this is okay, so we're back to the content portion of the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, we are now done with the commercial.  This will appear on AOL radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if I just said as one of the members of the twit crew that I love audible and I'm not getting paid.  It's not an ad anymore.  No, it's not an ad.  I'm just saying for the record that Jason Calacanis endorses audible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Jerry Pornell endorses Kindle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, I'm very fond of my Kindle.  As I say, it takes a little while to get used to the mechanics of it.  But once you do, it's automatic.  And it is just so terribly convenient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've been reading Knights Dawn Trilogy, which is the Peter F. Hamilton book, which if I were carrying that around,  my arm would be three inches longer because it's a huge book and I have it on the Kindle and it's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I even have Macaulay's History of England on it, which is five volumes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what they got to do.  They got to put things like Gibbon, the Oxford English Dictionary.  They got to put that really big stuff.  They got to put that on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have an eight gigabyte card from Kingston.  They sent me this SD card, eight gigabytes.  You would be amazed at how many books you can put on eight gigabytes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We forget because we have all this heavy media that the text in there.  That's not very heavy, is it?  Not much to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's see.  Even as audible books, it's a lot of books.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Audible books are about 100 megabytes typically.  That's about seven or eight hours.  Yeah, that's quite a few books in there.  I almost don't want to talk about news anymore.  We're just having way too much fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just want to say about when we talk about innovation in the space and Steve Jobs gets a ton of credit,  you have to give a lot of credit to Bezos because for a company that started as just selling books,  it was like a retail retailer, which is a pretty basic business.  The guy has really innovated between one click and then going on to this no DRM,  and then he's doing EC3 and the Kindle and buying audible.  S3, let's not forget.  S3, all that stuff is just like, it's brilliant stuff.  He doesn't get the same fan base as, let's say, Apple products.  But am I the only one who orders from Amazon every week?  Every week.  Every week.  I'm an Amazon fan.  Every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I buy toilet paper from Amazon.  Yeah, it's probably every day.  Once you're Amazon Prime, you don't go anywhere else.  And the store is always open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I noticed that because I went there at like two in the morning the other day and the website was actually open,  Jerry, it was crazy.  I was like, I can't believe it.  Who's working at the place at two in the morning?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I ordered this, get this.  Amazon has a subscription thing, which I don't think a lot of people know about,  but you buy toilet paper and every two months you set the frequency.  It just automatically sends you more toilet paper, razor blades, cereal.  The stuff that I buy every day, I just get it from Amazon.  I probably unload $10,000 a year on Amazon.com.  It's a brilliant model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And do you do it through your own associate account so you get a rebate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, Jerry, I am so stupid.  I just realized the other day I'm not doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I get a good discount on everything I buy by just buying it through my own associate account.  Now, what do you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because I was trying to like make the Amazon.com homepage be an associate page.  You can't. You have to link it to an item, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, I just paste in my account designation at the end of the item when I order.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the modern way to cut coupons.  You know, so if you're an Amazon associate, so my Amazon associate account,  anybody wants to send me money, this is the way to do it.  When you're buying on Amazon, add leoville0f-20 to the URL and I will get, what is it, like 4%.  I get a huge amount.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Something like that.  A lot of my readers order books through my associate account and I get, oh, I don't know, it's a fair amount.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You get more. I think you get more.  I don't know about your deals with the publishers, but I got more from Amazon than I ever got from my publisher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, no, you're in computer books.  I get real money.  Oh, good. I'm glad to hear that.  Authors of real books get like 10% of the cover price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's good. Yeah, I never got more than 4%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, I mean, just on the same topic, just to go back to the iTunes thing,  do you see Paul McCartney has finally got the Beatles on iTunes?  After the divorce, though. Let's not rush things.  No, $400 million to do it.  And it won't go on Amazon, will it?  No, it's just going to be on iTunes.  That's pretty, yeah, that's been supposed to be happening for ages, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, thank you. Hallelujah.  He says right now he's mired in this bitter divorce, but as soon as the divorce is over,  so she doesn't get any, she's going to get like, she was married to the guy for two years.  She's going to get $30 million out of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not a bad rate of return, right?  Forget entrepreneurship. Just marry up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Good wages for what she must have paid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Heather Mills. I don't know if she's a gold digger or what, but it's a bitter divorce,  but I don't blame Paul for saying,  we're going to wait until after the divorce, then you can have my record.  Because that's a lot of money. He doesn't want to split it with her.  Now, but it's not just Paul, right?  I mean, Ringo's going to get some and the estates of George Harrison and John Lennon will get some.  But not as much as...  How can Paul get so much?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, because he's listed as the primary songwriter.  Oh, Lennon would get some. Lennon would share equally then.  So, no, so a few years ago, there was a bit of a stink because McCartney petitions to have legally  a lot of the songs changed from Lennon McCartney to McCartley Lennon.  And that gives you like a massive hike on the royalties on the back end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jerry, you're right. People will do anything for money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It does get a little crazy.  I'm shocked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Leo, I didn't quite say that.  What I said is someone will do anything for money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there's one in every crowd. I agree with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, apparently Paul's one of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, can I just tell you something?  I think this podcasting thing is actually going to work.  I know he said a couple years ago, I didn't think it was going to work.  Actually, I was wrong.  I think this podcasting thing is good and this vlogging thing because the band...  You think it's going somewhere?  I actually, no, come on, not everybody's Twitter.  What's changed?  What's changed?  I think that the production value of these shows is getting better.  And people are doing consistent publishing, which they weren't in the beginning.  That's very important, yeah. I've learned that lesson.  The quality and the tools are getting so much better that like I met this guy,  Gary from Wine Library TV when I was...  Gary Vaynerchuk. He's like a star.  And he is like, I could care less about wine.  I don't drink really. I have a scotch once in a while.  And now I'm like watching your show.  I want to hang out with this guy and drink some wine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apparently, it's South by Southwest. Everybody is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apparently.  And then watching just the appearances I have on Twitter,  I am getting the day after Twitter, Mahalo gets probably another thousand people  typing the word Mahalo into search engines.  I watch it every Google Analytics.  And then I must get a hundred to two hundred people adding me on Facebook  like within 24 hours of the MP3 file coming out.  It's insane like how...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, here's... Let me tell you what I'm doing next.  And I'm just curious what you guys will think of this.  I haven't really gone public with this, but we've just rented the downstairs.  I'm in an old Victorian...  I'm in a cottage that was part of a bed and breakfast converted back to offices,  but it was built at the turn of the century by a lumber baron.  It's beautiful. Mahogany paneling downstairs, mahogany ceiling, mahogany floors.  I've just rented that.  We've got the cameras. We're setting up lights.  I've just... My wife went to an auction, just bought a bunch of furniture.  Dan, I didn't tell you this, but you've got a desk.  We've got ash trays and old... Anyway, we're oriental carpets.  We're furnishing it as a Victorian.  We're going to set up the cameras.  We are going to stream everything we do like this live,  but we're also going to start doing...  And I hope you guys will come to come up to Petaluma.  We'll have wine. We'll have food.  Every Saturday night, we're going to do kind of Saturday night live with the tech industry.  And I'm hoping this is going to take off.  I want to reinvent television.  I think television needs to go away.  And I think the idea of episodic and limited time needs to go away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Leo, is there any way to have remote video?  Yes.  Like we do remote by telephone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The same technology we're using right now.  We'll do Skype.  I'm going to have a plasma screen behind me.  I'm going to dedicate a T1 for Skype so that you can be on that screen,  big and bright and beautiful, and it'll be just like you're there.  But I'm hoping...  I think it's going to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll tell you why.  I have now with this, you know, Nokia N95 and Quick.  You've done a lot of video.  The other day, I had a hundred people in the room within 15 minutes.  I watched you drive.  I watched you drive a car, Jason.  What I do is on the way home from Mahalo, I open it up,  I put it in the cup holder, and then I drive.  When I get to a stoplight, because I drive home on the streets,  I like taking the streets.  You're talking back to the chatters.  I look at the chat room and I talk to them.  So I was talking to them about the controversy of the day, whatever,  and it's building up this audience.  And then I went on...  I was in a cafe, you know, when I was on my flight back from the secret conference  I was at, and I had the Nokia running, and somebody said,  oh, you should check out Yahoo Live.  I put on Yahoo Live.  I had Yahoo Live looking at me.  I had the Nokia looking out at the Starbucks.  You're crossing the...  I had people on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, tell us exactly what you're using.  What telephone is this?  It's a Nokia N95.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a Nokia N95 with 3G, but I also...  This is the other crazy thing.  I got this little box that I plug my Evdo card in that makes my own little Wi-Fi network.  Oh, you got the cradle.  You got the cradle point.  I got the cradle.  It's unbelievable.  So I put that on the desk.  It's battery powered.  I got...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what this does is it takes an EVDO card and makes it into Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.  So now I've got my air on the Evdo.  I'm doing Yahoo Live.  I used my jsonkalakannis at yahoo.com email address.  So I was basically up and running in seven seconds as long as it took to log in.  I had like 50 people in that room.  I had a hundred people in the other room.  And then some people were in both watching me and my view on two different services.  And I'm just thinking to myself, and then you watch Perillo.  He has 500 people there.  Watching him do nothing.  Right.  I mean, he's the most boring person in the world.  And he has 500 people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to do the same thing Perillo is doing with people like you.  And I hope people will come visit.  I know I'm in Petaluma, which is at least it's in the San Francisco Bay area, but it's a little harder to get to.  But I'm hoping it'll be worthwhile.  It's a wine country.  It's beautiful.  We'll have a guest bedroom.  The room we're in now is our new green room, by the way.  Painted green.  We're going to have a bedroom in here.  It's got a shower.  You could spend the night.  You're in the wine country.  You're all invited.  Will, the next time you're out here with your lovely wife.  Dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm looking to make a little...  My wife wants to make a little road trip.  Maybe we'll do that.  That'd be fun.  You're welcome. Bring the Bulldogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh really?  Can we bring the Bulldogs?  That'd be great.  Hell yeah.  So we're going to start doing that in the next couple of months.  You know, we have some bandwidth to acquire and so forth.  But I'm excited by the opportunity that presents.  It's something I've actually wanted to do for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Will, how's your business going in podcasting?  Because I know you're taking this slow steady approach.  How's it going?  How's the viewership?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's been really, really good.  I mean, we launched the channel flip, you know, with all the channels in October.  Channelflip.com.  It's been going up.  You know, we launched it from nothing out of my living room.  We slowly acquired.  We got a smaller space that we worked out of.  We're now moving to some bigger space, taking some money to do that.  And we're up now serving about just over half a million videos a month.  I think this is going to be big.  I'm excited.  Which to start from nothing and they're only these kind of like little five-minute videos.  We haven't spent the whole thing up until now to get to half a million videos a month.  We funded out of my back pocket.  And believe me, I don't have a very big back pocket.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't need one.  That's the beauty of this now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, the next stage for us is get to a million videos served every month, which  we're hoping to do in the next few months.  Wow.  We just land our first biggest.  We've hopefully got one large advertiser lined up to line up a few of those and then  get to two million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's another thing that's changing is the advertisers are coming along for the ride.  They're slowly but surely getting it.  How could they not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, look at the value that Audible gets from being the main sponsor of Twitter.  I mean, it's cheap.  I was at this double secret conference and I was hanging out with Don Katz, the CEO of  Audible.  Oh.  First thing he says when he comes up to me, I love your ads on Twitter.  You're not even doing the ads.  And then he's like, and I really can't stand that guy, Corey Doctorow.  Because he did the whole DRM.  He said, I hate DRM.  Right in the middle of the ad.  Yeah.  And so I said to him, I said, well, why don't you go on Twitter?  And he's like, yeah, I want to do that.  I was like, you and Corey Doctorow should be on Twitter talking about Audible's DRM issues.  And I was like, think about that.  Now the conversation has grown, you know, out of the commercial into, you know, it's  just crazy.  I mean, it's like the ClueTrain Manifesto has manifested itself and the resulting product  is so compelling that it...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we do have to walk a tightrope though.  And I have to say that is one thing that is always a challenge is preserving that  independence of editorial.  And you know, we never have vendors on Twitter.  And that is challenging because you love your sponsors.  They're making it possible.  But you also have to make it clear to the audience that they are not buying you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  But Corey is not part of the sponsorship.  He dragged it out of the sponsorship box and pulled it into the show.  I agree.  So that makes it a fair game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did not cut it out for that reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it makes it fair game.  So then you could have him on and just have him do his five minute debate with him.  Anyway, the point is, you know, the advertising works incredible.  I mean, remember Adam Curry with the Splenda stuff?  Yeah.  I mean, that flavored Splenda is good stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, I can't get flavored Splenda out of my head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've never seen it in the United States, but I'm like, I want to get some of that raspberry,  you know, I'm like, where's my...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'm hopeful.  I'm very, I'm hopeful.  And I want to do long form video.  Everybody's doing short form and I understand why people don't have the patience.  I want to do long form streaming as well as a download.  And I just think this is a chance for everybody to experiment, to try stuff.  And really, I think, change the world of media.  It's very exciting.  It's very interesting.  Yeah.  By the way, Veronica just Twittered.  I just, if anybody's at the Web Awards, she needs an Advil.  So anybody at the Web Awards?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, wait a second.  That's not a good use of Twitter.  You cannot use it like the bath phone or for medical emergency, non-medical emergency.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.  Shit.  Now you said she's getting a million downloads.  Mahalo Daily is getting a million downloads a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's broken a million a month.  I set them the goal of, you know, 2 million a month, 25 million a year,  because I think we're probably wound up spending a quarter million dollars a year on the show.  You have five people working on it or whatever and we're doing it five days a week.  And if it gets to 25 million views a year and I can sell it for $10 CPM, you know, on average,  and I could probably get more for that at some times, 20 at some times, 0 at others,  it's going to break even.  And if it breaks even, I have a 2 million people watching it a month and it sort of,  it doesn't promote Mahalo, but it is called Mahalo Daily.  It drives pages.  Yeah, you bet.  And it's called Mahalo Daily and we're covering like the most interesting things.  I sort of consider it like the new corporate blog is a vlog.  Right.  Jerry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wonder if I'm in you guys league.  I'm pretty proud of having 150 to 200,000 unique visits a month.  That's pretty good.  As a circulation for my columns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's excellent.  What was the circulation of Byte?  About that.  There you go.  You're as big as bigger than Byte.  That was a fake circulation.  Yeah, that was circulation to goof.  You know, that is true because when somebody comes to a webpage,  you know, they're reading it as opposed to subscribing to a magazine that ends up in the,  you know, bottom of the pile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Of course, Byte was really big in the McGraw Hill days.  Oh, I love Byte.  And Byte used to solve the problem of editorial versus advertising.  McGraw Hill was wonderful that way.  It's one reason I don't take ads.  I just use public radio subscription model.  Right.  And that usually, if I'm on Twitter, I'll usually get another 20 subscribers as a result of being here.  So good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  JerryPornel.com.  What do you know?  Do you have any idea what your subscription rate is?  Like the percentage of readers who subscribe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's down in the low.  Well, it's under 5%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's awesome.  That same for us.  And that, you know, I think I remember public radio saying 4% was common on their pledge drives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They seem to and I don't get that much.  I mean, I don't nag people as much as I never nag people.  Whenever I nag people, I get a lot.  We should nag more.  Well, I'm very careful how I nag and I'll, you know, I make sure I tell people I am not after your rent money.  I don't want your eating money.  I just want your beer money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a health thing.  Actually, we ask for $2 a month recurring.  I like the recurring because then I know I have a revenue stream and you know, rent is recurring.  Dane is recurring.  You know, server space is recurring.  So we ask $2, which I feel is pretty, I mean, that's less than a latte a month.  And I, you know, I don't want more than that from people.  I just want people who don't contribute to, you know, to just do that.  And if I could get the percentage up to even 4%, I wouldn't need to be honest.  I wouldn't need to run ads.  But because it is only 1% or 2%, we have to run ads.  There's no other way to do it.  I'm a little better than that.  Yeah.  But I'm not up to 4%.  Yeah, I'd like to get to 4 or 5.  But anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  On the other hand, there is now, I didn't start this, but some of my readers have started a campaign to get me 1000 subscribers and $100 a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's do it.  JerryPornel.com.  Go there now.  Subscribe now.  Hey, I want to thank everybody for being here.  What a fun tweet this has been, especially with the new gossip format.  I think we're going to do that from now on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's half the show.  Basically, we just get Valleywag out and we'll just run down the headlines.  No, please don't.  I'll kill myself.  This has to be the one and only time we bring up anything gossipy.  You got it.  Jason Galacanis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's the founder of Mahalo, M-A-H-A-L-O.com.  And of course, has a great blog, which is a must read.  And one of the things we wanted to talk about was your story.  It was very controversial where you said if you're a startup, hire workaholics.  We were going to talk about that.  When you come back, we'll talk about it next time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or if you maybe want to, don't you do like a daily show too?  I noticed today you were on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's my radio show.  I do a weekly weekend, Saturday and Sunday radio show.  That's the actual mainstream media stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think what I'm going to do is I'm just going to tweet you and we'll both get on like Yahoo and we'll just talk about it.  Absolutely.  Like we should do like an interrupt tweet.  Like we should do a midweek tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wednesday, you, me, we'll talk about it.  Midweek tweet.  On video.  And that's kind of the idea.  I want to do this kind of almost constant streaming video and just have these conversations.  They're always ongoing because look, you know, the great thing about tweet is we know there's so many great people who are part of it.  And I just love to get you guys on and talk.  It's like a mini-tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, it's like a mini-tweet.  And it could be ad hoc.  You could just be like, you should actually call it that mini-tweet01, mini-tweet02.  And people could subscribe to a different RSS feed if they want that, you know, granularity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is why he's Jason Calacanis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mini-tweet.  Mini-tweet.  Oh wait, before you publish this, you better go buy that domain name.  Because I'm going to go buy it right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have a, we're going to do a lot of this stuff under the twitlive.tv banner.
