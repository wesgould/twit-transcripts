Transcript:  Beep beep beep beep boop. All right, listen, it's been a crazy weekend. Things are going nuts on the interwebs about Reddit.  I don't know if everybody's following this story. I'm assuming people are.

Start time: 246.00
End time: 247.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they're melting down.

Start time: 247.52
End time: 271.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It is a complete and utter meltdown. They fired the woman who was running AMAs.  Victoria.  Victoria.  She was incredibly well loved by the admins, the community managers who were running all the subreddits.  Yeah.  They fired her. The people who run the subreddits, as I understand it, decided they would shut down in protest all the subreddits yesterday.

Start time: 271.14
End time: 274.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, there was something like 130 or so that it got shut down, I think over the course of the past few days.

Start time: 275.00
End time: 277.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Which is the equivalent of a factory shutdown.

Start time: 278.04
End time: 281.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a strike.  It's literally the site went on strike.

Start time: 282.68
End time: 308.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And then I go to the homepage and the homepage is literally, I don't know if there's 15 stories on the Reddit homepage,  but 14 of them are brutally attacking Ellen Pao, the interim CEO, key point.  And some of them pretty horrible, misogynistic, racist, horrible stuff.  But let's just call it what it is. The whole place is melting down. Peter, what are your thoughts on this and why it's happened?

Start time: 309.18
End time: 391.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I think that there has been a lot of frustration on the part of the mods.  I think people who are familiar with Reddit understand that the mods are basically unpaid volunteers who do a lot of administrative work and heavy lifting for the site.  And so they organize each of these individual channels, they keep them clean, they moderate them, remove spam,  and do a lot of stuff that you couldn't operate Reddit if you had to pay this army of people to do all this work.  And so a lot of them have been frustrated with the way that Reddit has been run.  There's been a lack of communication, I think, from the executive team there, from the management team at Reddit, to these mods.  And I think what happened was when they brought in Victoria, I think which was a couple of years ago,  it was actually to help facilitate better communication from the management to the mods of the subreddits and really help improve the experience for them.  And that seems to have worked because people actually loved her.  People were happy, the AMAs were, because what happened was the AMAs were blowing up.  The Ask Me Anything feature.  Yeah, and it was becoming kind of like a Wild West where celebrities were being impersonated.  They needed to have a little bit more control.  And so they brought in Victoria to help organize that.  And I think getting rid of her and not communicating why, we still don't know why she left, why she was removed, as far as I know.

Start time: 392.08
End time: 411.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The rumors, I guess, people are going a little bit wild speculating that they were trying to commercialize the AMAs.  They obviously came out with an AMA app at some point.  And that maybe she was filibustering the commercialization of it.  Christina or Dokta, what are either of your takes on this?  And why was she fired? Does anybody know yet?

Start time: 412.74
End time: 447.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. So just closure, I know Victoria.  I knew her before she joined Reddit when she was at ID, which is a big talent agency.  And she actually did a lot of AMAs on behalf of clients at ID.  And I think that's how she met the Reddit people.  I saw her on Monday when she was still at Reddit.  She came into our office to give a presentation on Reddit.  You know, I haven't talked to her, but I have other to express my support and tell her that I'm rooting for her and whatnot.  But no, I mean, you know, like Peter said, the community loves her.  She was truly like somebody who it wasn't just a job.  Like she was a legit like got the community spirit.  Like it wasn't one of those things.

Start time: 448.00
End time: 452.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She had no idea this was coming.  It wasn't like there was no indication when you saw her on Monday that that something was amiss.

Start time: 453.41
End time: 453.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, not at all.

Start time: 454.00
End time: 476.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And she's been working there for two years, Christina.  Yeah, yes.  What percentage of the site would you estimate she actually runs and is responsible for if we were to think about it?  Because you have this management team that's keeping the servers up and maybe trying to make an ad business on top of Reddit.  But then there's the community side.  Is there like a whole community team at Reddit that's taking care of the community or was she running all the mods and then the mods are taking care of the site?

Start time: 477.00
End time: 588.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, she was basically in charge of the AMA section, the IMA section.  She was kind of the liaison between the community and some of the admins.  And so if you if you look at Reddit and you look at like what the part is that gets the most public press that's positive, that's not, you know, about the terrible, you know, misogynistic, awful, like hatred, you know, like like like, you know, the fappening type of stuff, like the stuff that makes us embarrassed to be, you know, denizens of the Internet.  The good stuff from Reddit usually comes from the AMA's.  And that was all stuff that she helped coordinate.  So she would usually not always, but oftentimes, you know, sit side by side with a lot of the celebrities and type their answers, you know, because she can type really fast.  You know, she would do a lot to verify to make to get with their management to get with the, you know, whoever was doing the AMA to verify them to the community.  She would take back kind of act as a liaison between, you know, the the moderators and the regular, you know, and their staff at Reddit.  You know, she was one of the few people still in New York.  But from what I understand, it didn't seem like, you know, that was going to have to change.  I don't think it was the moving to New York or moving to San Francisco part that had anything to do with it.  I think that core thread that seems the most likely to me, I can't really.  It seemed to totally take her by surprise.  And when I saw her on Monday, you know, she there was absolutely no indication that anything was happening.  So, I mean, she was she was in her office on behalf of Reddit.  So it was it was a total shock, I think, to kind of all of us.  But she one thing I would like to stress about her is that she's like a legit person, like who got the community.  You know, there are some people who act in kind of community manager roles and kind of liaison roles between users and community people and, you know, the staff from social networks who kind of don't get the ecosystem.  She legit got it and was, you know, somebody who used Reddit before she joined and got it and was part of kind of that's why she was so loved because she could speak their language.

Start time: 588.00
End time: 599.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  She actually did the work to get to know the community, which completely, you know, it's it's very hard to build a community at this scale.  And it's very easy to break it, obviously, as we've seen.  Oh, doctor, what's your take on all this?

Start time: 600.30
End time: 641.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just in general, pure speculation.  It just seems so out of the blue that someone went to a meeting and was trying to tell her something and she was trying to explain how it actually works.  And somebody had a knee jerk reaction.  Well, if you're not on board, then you're out.  Because how can you just annex someone that is so beloved and so ingrained in your system?  Out of the blue like that and then not have any kind of response, no kind of gesture, no, oh, peaceful parting ways like don't you know somebody in PR or anything like you just set a wave on a on a small island and you just let everything get wiped out.  You don't send a recovery, no water, no nothing.  You just not at all.  Wipe away.  So it's completely quiet.  So this somebody I think it's a childish movie.

Start time: 642.04
End time: 644.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This is a very good point, which is the failure of man.

Start time: 645.10
End time: 655.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they should have been ahead of this.  I mean, you should understand that you can't make a change like that.  You can't change a public facing part of your business like that without having a plan for how you communicate that to the community.  Right.

Start time: 657.60
End time: 716.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  OK, so I want to ask the question that's not very politically correct.  I don't think and it's pretty controversial, which is why is Ellen Powell running this site?  She's never been CEO of a company.  I think at this point, this is her first job as CEO.  And if you were going to think about who the worst person you could match with this community would be, I think you would be hard pressed to find another executive in Silicon Valley who would be the antithesis of what this community would want in a leader.  She's quiet.  She's, I guess, in the bucket that most people would say social justice warrior.  And then you have this other contingent that's incredibly loud on Reddit, which is provocative, pushing the line of free speech, pushing the lines of offensiveness.  How much of this is Ellen Powell's fault because she's not qualified?  How much of it is she's getting beat up and she shouldn't be beat up?  I mean, this is the topic I think that is the key here.  Is the community ever going to accept Ellen Powell?

Start time: 716.28
End time: 742.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think in general, before somebody smarter says something for me, the things you said, the contrast is also a business decision.  You can't say you have a group of animals and you're going to let another animal run that business.  You would want someone structured and someone a little bit removed from that environment to try and get it stable and have some kind of structure to it.  That's the only thing I could say in her defense to what she just asked a question.

Start time: 743.20
End time: 746.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And I'm not what I'm trying to get at is, is she the right person for the job?

Start time: 748.24
End time: 830.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think most people, I think very few people are the right person for that job.  So I don't think it's necessarily a failing of Ellen Powell.  Right.  I think it's that I think very few people have that innate understanding of communities.  And that's why most communities like this that grow and it tends to be the founder who has been there since the first since the day one who has nurtured it and and stuck with the community and kind of knows it in and out who usually is able to get it through times like this.  And I know Alexis, who's one of the co founders and he's working there now.  And he's back there now.  I know that he did kind of piss some people off with some some kind of flippant comments, but it does seem like he's trying to, you know, take the trust that the community has in him as the founder and somebody's been there since the beginning to kind of help them get through this.  Yeah.  I mean, I will say, you know, I think that the fact that there is, I mean, there is a misogyny problem on Reddit.  For sure.  Yeah. Amongst other problems.  So I think having someone who is outspoken as a feminist may be a good thing for a community like that.  But, you know, I think that there are very, very, very few people, like I said earlier, who have the qualities to be able to manage a community of this size that is very unruly and that it's not just that they don't just want one thing.  It's a lot of different things and different communities that all may want different things and to kind of make all those people happy is very, very, very, very hard.

Start time: 831.00
End time: 835.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Christina, where your thoughts on Ellen Powell and the job she's done as the interim CEO?  Yeah.

Start time: 837.90
End time: 917.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I mean, honestly, I mean, I think the Reddit's whole kind of management structure has been kind of, you know, a cluster of, you know, kind of for quite some time.  I mean, I don't think Yashon did a great job.  And I think that when things started to kind of get really, you know, publicly look really bad, I think his response was bad.  I mean, I don't think that she I think that her, you know, her status as an investor, I don't think necessarily qualifies or unqualifies her.  I don't know how good of a cultural fit she is with Reddit.  I didn't I don't get the sense that she's really somebody who's part of the community.  I don't think that her being a woman or being, you know, Ellen Powell again disqualifies her.  What I will say is I was bothered by kind of an interview she gave to Mike Isaac of the New York Times when this happened, where she kind of was kind of flipping and said, you know, the majority of the community doesn't care about these blacked out separatists.  They don't they don't care about Victoria.  And saying that means she should have just kept her mouth shut and not said anything about Victoria at all.  Just just, you know, stayed out of it and just said, we're trying to, you know, respond to the community and, you know, do what we can to get things running again, rather than being so flip about, oh, well, you know, the vast majority of the people who come to the site don't care about this.  Because to me, that's just as completely, I guess, proving that she's not connected to the community, which to me just kind of leads me to think she's not a great cultural fit.

Start time: 918.34
End time: 929.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I the sense I get is she does not have any interest in being part of that community.  It's a job to manage it.  But if you're not in that, you kind of have to be participating.

Start time: 929.75
End time: 936.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You have to be a participant.  Same way that that if you want to be the CEO of Twitter, you probably should be active on Twitter.

Start time: 937.49
End time: 940.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, if you want to run Gmail, it'd be good if you use Gmail.

Start time: 940.46
End time: 951.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. Yeah. And I think that, you know, we've seen communities revolt before.  We saw dig right. The dig community revolted.  Yeah. And that was six, seven years ago.

Start time: 951.26
End time: 955.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I mean, it was really the reason I think Reddit made it to the next level.  Yeah, it is.  Everybody went to Reddit.

Start time: 956.59
End time: 979.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it is.  And it's you know, and it's funny to see that there are a few kind of Reddit clones that are, I think, trying to vote, I think is one of them.  Take advantage of the.  But was it you that said, I mean, how even I mean, should you know, should something like Reddit even be a for profit centralized enterprise?  Maybe it should be like a decentralized protocol that just organizes communities and people.

Start time: 981.32
End time: 1024.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, I mean, it is. It does seem to me that the game of Reddit is to see how far you can push the envelope and how non-corporate you can be.  And I think Steve Huffman and Alexis both understood that.  And they kind of let the community push the boundaries and said, yeah, we understand that this last five percent over here, the majority of us don't like.  But it is free speech.  Yeah.  And so if you want to talk about dead babies, it's pretty horrific.  But comedians make jokes about those things.  And ambulance, you know, people, you know, have to deal with babies dying.  And there is a place in the world for people to talk about this horrific subject.  But they just recently went, I don't know, a month ago and started getting rid of certain subreddits that had to do with hate.

Start time: 1025.20
End time: 1027.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they banned a few like I hate fat people.  Yeah.

Start time: 1028.58
End time: 1066.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Again, and I'm a fat person and I got a problem with that.  I mean, at the end of the day, everybody lately just needs to like take a breath and make fun of their mom or something, because everybody is so insane about this offends me.  That offends me. Like everything's offensive to somebody.  But again, we live in a country where you're allowed to say things, you know, and my personal response to that is like all this hate against gay marriage and stuff.  I'm like, look, don't quiet those voices.  I want to see the snakes in my grass.  If you quiet up all these people and push them in the closet, you just let the gay people out of there like roaches are going to be all in the infrastructure of my house.  And I'm not going to see them coming when everything falls apart.

Start time: 1067.14
End time: 1070.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You'd rather shine light on them.  Yes. Say no where they are.

Start time: 1071.08
End time: 1094.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. And if you don't like what somebody's saying, there's all kinds of buttons to mute, to not see the high to whatever you want to do.  As long as you're not talking about physically coming to someone's house and hurting someone, you should be able to say whatever you want to say and deleting something and deleting the core.  The core of your business is a slippery slope because when do you stop?  Because everything's offensive to somebody.  Where do we stop?

Start time: 1096.12
End time: 1157.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, I think that there's also though that, you know, when you build a community like this, and I'm somebody who's built communities in the past, is that if you let them become overrun with spam or abusiveness or a corrosive kind of dialogue,  it drives out people that have insightful, useful contributions to make.  And I think the thing about Reddit is they've done a great job of, I guess up until this point, being a place where, yeah, on the margins, there's some terrible stuff.  But a lot of really great things get generated every day.  And there's a lot of very thoughtful people that contribute either links or comments or whatever to that platform, to that site.  And I think that, you know, if you don't have some level, you have to draw a line somewhere.  And I think it's I think you want to, you know, be as open to free speech and being open to free speech means being open to offensive speech.  But you also don't want to be a place that just becomes a haven for, you know, bullying or, I mean, Twitter is facing this problem.  Facebook has faced this problem.

Start time: 1158.32
End time: 1182.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Christina, what are your thoughts on the fringe of Reddit?  How would you handle it?  How has the current management team, Ellen Pau, handled it?  Have they handled it well?  How much of the issue do you think is just a mismatch of Ellen Pau to this community?  And can you actually put Rails on a community like Reddit without destroying it?  I mean, that's, I think, the key here.  Can we put Rails on Reddit, Christina?

Start time: 1183.99
End time: 1355.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I don't know if we can.  I mean, I think that the doc actually kind of mentioned something interesting.  He said something about, you know, when you have kind of a business of doing stuff.  I think that what has made Reddit, the reason all these problems are happening is that it started out as this site, you know, that was gaining kind of a following and that Condé paid, what, like $15 million for or something.  And they were kind of maintaining on a shoestring budget and then it got bigger and bigger and bigger.  And all of a sudden it started getting real traffic, becoming one of the most visited sites in the world, becoming a real place where you could conceivably make real money off of it.  And at that point, all of a sudden everybody starts paying attention and we start, they start taking external financing and in advance start to realize, hey, this thing that we bought and kind of ignored could have the potential to be a real cash cow because it's getting so much real traffic.  And so when it becomes a business, the paradigm changes, right?  So you could before when it's just kind of, you know, say la vie, you can talk about it being kind of a free speech haven place for both for good and for ill.  And I'm personally a believer in free speech, even when that means, and especially when it means, you know, awful speech, you know, that's the stuff you need to protect the most.  But at the same time, there's some there's a way to balance, I think, speech and also making a community that people actually want to be a part of.  I think the challenge with Reddit is taking what had been a pretty freewheeling community and one that we see in this instance where literally the users were have been able to kind of shut the site down because they're able to take it private.  Whereas the people who run the site, who own the site, the actual employees can't do anything to get it up again.  And when that can happen, I think that kind of shows how ill prepared this company is for dealing with the realities of having this really kind of weird fringe community that is also happens to be a huge hub of traffic.  And so they want to profit off of it, but they don't really know how to harness in the community that is built up around it, primarily because it was kind of where anything could go.  I don't have the answer to that, but I don't think what they're doing is the right way to do it, especially with the messaging.  I think that it's one thing if they said, look, we're not banning you from talking about these topics.  The reason we ban these communities is because the people in them started to harass individuals and go after them in their real life.  And that becomes a problem. And that's why they're shutting them down.  I think if you explain things that way, rather than kind of, oh, we've got this anti harassment policy and this other stuff, that's when people start to go, wait a minute.  It's great for everybody to be nice to one another. But this is the Internet and this is Reddit.  And part of the deal is that people say terrible, hateful things.  And this is the same company that a couple of years ago was defending some of the upshot communities and saying we're not going to delete this stuff because it's not illegal, even though it's distasteful.  So I don't know.

When we when we get back, I want to talk about if you think I'm going to ask each of our panelists if Ellen Pao is going to make it out of the summer as the CEO of Reddit or not.  The line between free speech and hate speech.  And then are you going to pay for iTunes radio music or not? Yes or no.  When we get back after these messages about an amazing company, which I use all the time called Wealthfront.  I'm also an investor. Let's let's let's hand it off to Leo for the commercial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We'll get back to this. We can take it a bit.  I have returned to speak to you about this is the first time we've ever had a sponsor that I'm not allowed to use the product.  Thanks to SEC regulations. I'm talking about Wealthfront.  This is a really interesting, especially for us geeks, way to invest your money using really well proven philosophies that I actually have known about for more than 10 years and believe in.  But they do it automatically. It's automated with software.  And it's really clever.  Well, I want you to hear about this. Wealthfront.  W e a l t h f r o n t dot com Wealthfront dot com.  And if you go to Wealthfront dot com slash tweet, we've got a special deal.  I'll explain that in a second. So, you know, normally when you're investing, you get an investment advisor and they're going to charge you a fee.  And that fee could be one percent. I think my mom's investment advisor.  She was giving her a good deal. One percent. But it could be two percent.  What are you paying if you have an investment advisor? Three percent.  It could be very expensive. And that's not including any transaction fees, you know, changes, things like that.  That can it can really add up and eat away at your investment.  Wealthfront is going to give anyone anyone who wants it access to world class long term investment manager.  This is not for. In fact, I know some of you are like day traders.  You do investing for fun. It's like a game for you.  That's not what this is. This is long term growth of your nest egg, whether you're saving for retirement or, you know, maybe I want to say for a boat.  So I could sail away, save for a house. This is what this is for.  Long term investments. And they do so many very clever things.  Now you can if you go to Wealthfront dot com, you can actually get started at no cost and just see what their portfolio would be for you.  So that's that's very helpful to get an idea of what they're talking about.  And that you can do right now at Wealthfront dot com slash twit.  This is commission free. And let me tell you, it's done by it's done in software.  Very clever idea. They're they're using investment strategies that have been around for a long time.  Investment strategies I've used. But because the software is monitoring it, even interday all the time, they can do things like they maximize your tax savings.  They do something that's interday trading called tax lost harvesting, direct indexing.  Even if you're somebody who's trading actively for your own account, just for fun or for profit.  This is a great solution to put your money away, not worry about it.  It's automatically managed at a very low cost. Twenty five basis points.  That's right. Twenty five basis points. That's one quarter of one percent a year.  Remember I said these other guys charging one, two, three percent.  This is one quarter of one percent per year.  And there are no commissions, no hidden fees, no additional charges for any of the services you get from Wealthfront.  This is really smart. This was created by some really smart guys who said, you know, you can do this strategy very effectively using software and produce very reliable results.  Do the tax loss harvesting, which is kind of hard to do unless you're using software and really benefit people by a huge amount.  It's no surprise they are now managing two point four billion dollars in client assets that's grown over 20 times in the last two years.  They're just exploding right now. And because of SEC rules, turns out if you're if you're doing this, you can't use client testimonials in your ads.  I can't sign up. It's killing me.  But you can for compliance purposes.  I have to tell you, Wealthfront Incorporated is an SEC registered investment advisor.  Brokerage services are offered through Wealthfront Brokerage Corporation member FINRA and SIPC.

You can't you can't you can't McDonald's turn into Chick-fil-A overnight because they sell burgers like that.  That's you. It just hurts me so bad.  You shouldn't be allowed to talk about killing people or threatening someone's life or showing up their home.  Everything else, as far as Reddit is concerned, whether it's drunk babies or kicking dogs down the street, that's what floats your boat.  The problem is they don't understand what their business actually is.  So they have no clue how to monetize it or how to wrangle it or control it because they really don't understand what it is.  You can't silence something that makes you money. You tell everybody to shut up.  Where's the money coming from? Do you know how to make it?

Transcript:  I think it's like a yeah. In the mid 100. Yeah.  Yeah. 150 or something. Here's one of the things. I'll give some information.  I've been getting pinged by a lot of employees who have left because they think that some of the projects I'm working on might be good places to land.  They're telling me that nobody will go work there, that they've set all the salaries at like the same rate so you can't negotiate your salary.  So great people who want to go there, who make slightly more than whatever they set the specific salary at, are disqualified.  That was Alan's policy. I remember. Which is the stupidest policy I've ever heard.  I mean, this has there ever been a stupider policy that no negotiations or salary?  I mean, I don't mean to I don't want to make this because people are going to think I'm beating up on Alan Powell, but she is a first time CEO.  And this is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.  Christina, what do you think of this? Mashable? Are people allowed to negotiate their salaries or is it not allowed?

Start time: 1826.22
End time: 1830.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. No, people are definitely allowed. I've definitely negotiated mine.

Start time: 1830.40
End time: 1842.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, I mean, I think you're a woman. I thought you were incapable of negotiating your salary. Right. Yeah.  No, I know. That's Alan Powell's position is that women don't negotiate as well.  Well, no, therefore we should take away the negotiation of salaries. It sounds completely stupid to me.

Start time: 1842.04
End time: 1890.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which sort of bothered me. I understand sort of where she's coming from saying that women historically are less comfortable negotiating their salaries.  And so to make, I guess, the playing field more even, there's just no negotiation.  Instead, I think the better response is let's teach women how to negotiate their salaries.  If you're a woman and you need help, like you need advice, like how to negotiate your salary, like call me, like film girl, like call me on Twitter.  I've helped plenty of younger colleagues, men and women, but especially women with that.  So, yeah, I mean, I think the real thing is like teach women how to negotiate.  Don't get rid of negotiating period, because like you said, you end up getting ruling out a ton of people who would be great in the job.  And then you end up making, you know, it's an unpleasant experience if you're coming into a new job and you don't have any room to negotiate.  It's like, OK, so I'm going to take a pay cut or I mean, it's just it's ridiculous.

Transcript:  And let's just end this by just is she going to make it out of the let's just say the year.  Will Ellen Powell be the CEO come January 1st, 2016?  Oh, doctor. Yes or no.  I don't think so.  That's a no.  Christina, will Ellen Powell be the CEO?  No, definitely not.  Peter?

Start time: 1911.26
End time: 1935.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, she's interim CEO now.  Right.  So it actually will be relatively easy for the board to bring in a full time CEO and say we vended our search and we found a full time permanent CEO.  Right. I think that I think that she will I'd be surprised if they offer her the opportunity to transition to being a permanent CEO.

Start time: 1937.16
End time: 1984.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And the correct answer is she will not make it out of the year.  I cannot tell you exactly how I know this, but I am certain of it.  Let's move over to and just, you know, I think as much as the board is going to not allow her to and this gets into sort of corporate governance, not allow her to continue.  Was this a bad decision to put her in charge of this to begin with, Peter?  Like I start to wonder, like first time CEO.  And you said before, this is the hardest job you can imagine.  And what's the harder job than this?  Blackberry or AOL or Reddit, which is the which is the hardest.  Which company would be the hardest one to run for you, Peter?  Which one would you in order would you take those jobs?  I would actually take the Blackberry job first.  I would too. OK, because then which one we take second AOL five years ago.

I'm kind of embarrassed about it.  It took me no less than three or four minutes to find it.  I was like, where is it?  I downloaded the new updates.  I get on my desktop and they're telling me, oh, my God, you have it.  Where is it?  How do you find it?  Yeah.  Am I the only person who had this experience of feeling really stupid that I was looking for the Apple radio icon on my desktop and searching in iTunes trying to find it?  How long did it take you to find it, Peter?

Start time: 2048.33

They showed me the new white icon, which I hate.  No, I mean, it's the old music icon.  It used to be orange-ish and now it's white.  And there's the iTunes store, which still is where you buy your stuff and download your tracks.  Got it.  But that's different from all of your music and where your radio stuff is.  That's all in one app.  And then your podcast is still a separate app, too.  But on the desktop, it's still one app, iTunes, which is a bloated mess.

I have to say, I was listening for about 35 seconds before they played that new Pharrell song,  which I think they're contractually obliged to play.  Oh, really?  Have you noticed this?

Transcript:  Just let me rant real quick because...  OK, good. Rant away.  That's why you're here.  First of all, the Beats 1 radio is really awesome.  It's like a thousand times better than paying for Pandora.  The selection, the fact that they bring in all kinds of crazy music.  They've got me to buy four songs.  I haven't bought music from iTunes in like three years,  but they got me to buy like four singles because they just put this crazy stuff like on my playlist.  That's awesome.  The quality, though, is about 50 percent the quality streaming that Pandora is.  And how do I know this?  Because I have a concert in my car.  I have 3000 watts in my car and I'll be bumping.  And when I listen to Pandora, I can't sit in my seat.  My back hurts.  I'm listening to this and I'm trying to blow out the button, turn up the volume because it's just not really good quality.  Then on top of the fact that you put all this junk in my face and you hit away my 400 gigs of music.  I got like 30,000 albums.  I got so much music and all my music is over here on this one little tab.  Once I get there, I got to flip through the four things you want to lift the top before I can get the score.  But you got this new crap, which I don't care about.  You got the heart, which again, I don't care about because I'm what is the heart?

So, yeah, that's fine.  Like I said, I have good taste in music too, but there's some...  There's some of the rare stuff, I guess, a lot of EDM stuff and certain indie stuff,  and certain like, I guess, like Euro stuff is on Spotify more.  There's some more mainstream stuff on Apple Music.  We did find out in our testing, weirdly, Ace of Base.  Remember Ace of Base?  Yes, of course, Ace of Base.  Ace of Base.

Not that it hasn't always been a sham, but right now it's like, oh, well, they're kind of running my music and they're sort of paying me for it.  But if you're on the mid to lower level, you're getting screwed.  You're not getting anything.  So Spotify, making however much money they're making, they still don't make any money.  And I personally, I own most of my own music and that's one of the things I actually spend money on.  Right.  But I prefer to have it.  But they're not making money.  Like how long is this pyramid going to exist?  Like Pandora is like on pins and needles begging for extensions to keep their boat afloat and they're playing I'm Happy 42 billion times an hour and Pharrell gets 32 cents a year.  Like it's really a scam system and all the cards are going to fall, blah, blah, blah, blah.  All right.

Transcript:  When we get back to this commercial break, I want to know what's the future of these services.  Is the music industry going to shut them all down?  Which one should we buy?  And what impact iTunes music is going to make on Spotify?  Is this going to validate the category or is it going to cut into their 20 million subscribers when we get back?  And after this amazing message from our good pal, Leo Laporte.

Transcript:  It's time to talk about my mattress.  Hi, everybody.  Leo Laporte here.  Jumping in, barging in.  We're going to get back to the show in just a second.  But I want to tell you about Casper.  They're amazing mattresses made in the U.S.  Premium quality for a fraction of the cost.  Mattresses that are so great that I use them.  I sent one to my son.  My daughter is going to get one in the fall when she goes back to school.  They come in a box.  First of all, this mattress is a lot smaller in the box than it's going to be when you open it up.  That makes it really easy to get into an apartment, to get up the stairs, to get into your guest room.  That was a huge deal.  You see here our mattress.  They give you a tool.  You open it up.  It goes and then you get the most amazing mattress you can get.  The most amazing mattress you have ever tried.  Soft, comfortable, but firm.  It's subtly firm.  I don't know how to describe this.  It has just the right sink and bounce.  It feels good on your back, but your hips aren't getting bruised by the firm.  I can't describe it, but you've got to try it.  And one of the things I love about Casper is they do let you try it for a hundred nights.  This blows me away.  I think they had to do this because frankly people are saying, well, I want to try a mattress before I buy it.  But we all know, and I've done this and I've been very unhappy with the results,  we've all gone to a mattress store lying on a mattress.  Is that good?  Yeah, I guess so.  I mean, it's completely unlike sleeping on one.  You're there for a couple of minutes with a sales lady staring at you, giving you the stink eye.  That's no way to try a mattress.  This is so much better.  Casper will deliver it free.  You sleep on it for as many as a hundred nights.  If you don't like it, they'll take it back.  No cost to you.  Shipping free everything.  So you have a hundred day guarantee, which is unbelievable.  This is such a great mattress.  They started $500 for a twin.  They're easy for a student, for somebody getting started or somebody who's just not happy with their mattress.  This is a great mattress.  We've sold so many of them now and I've heard from so many of you who say you love your Caspers.  Try it out at casper.com slash twit.  Enter the promo code twit and you're going to get $50 off.  And that makes it even better.  Casper.com slash twit.  Use the offer code twit to save 50 bucks on your new mattress, your favorite mattress ever.  Casper.com slash twit.  And we thank them for their support of This Week in Tech.  Back to the news.

Transcript:  I'm going to get one of those Casper mattresses and I'm going to log into Wealthfront and I'm just going to set my risk profile.  They got their money's worth in that ad.  I would watch that again.  The ad was hilarious.  I like these in the field ads of Leo rolling around.  They should do one of him just rolling around in audiobooks for audible.  I was hoping we'd have an audible ad today.  I've got so many great selections.  I feel horrible we don't have it.  Is this Peter when a product when Apple embraces the vertical you're in and you're Spotify and you own it.  Let's face it.  They have 20 million.  They own it up to now.  Yeah.  It's an incredible product.  They just added podcasts to it, which is amazing.  They reached out to me.  I'm not sure exactly what they're looking to do there.

Transcript:  Oh, so they probably need me to sign off on it or something.  I don't know.  I don't care.  I don't cut my ads out of it.  I'm fine with it.  Is this a net positive for Spotify in that more people become aware of the space and then compare Coke and Pepsi?  Or is this going to cut into the 20 million people?  Would you be long or short Spotify?

Start time: 2762.48
End time: 2787.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, so I think it does validate the category for Spotify, which is a good thing.  I think it does suck a lot of the oxygen out of the room for anybody that isn't Spotify and Apple Music.  So you're referring to title.  Title. Well, title is barely worth even mentioning.  But I think RDO, Rapsody.  Rapsody.  I use Rapsody.  I love it.  I guess Google's option.  Google has an option too in this?

End time: 2827.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So Spotify will be around.  Obviously, this will validate it.  iTunes will get better as a product.  It's a little bit clunky right now.  Let's assume they let Ian Rogers clean that hole mess up a little bit, make the software a little bit cleaner.  It's a 1.0.  It'll be a two horse race, then you think?

Start time: 2827.18
End time: 2875.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it'll be a two horse race with the smaller competitors will be in there.  It kind of reminds me of the airline business where they're big businesses, but really low margin and hard to make any money.  But you kind of can't get out.  It's like when you run an airline, you have these really high fixed costs, which are fuel, pilots, and planes, and rent and all these things.  And these services are the same.  I mean, Spotify pays 70 cents plus out of every dollar.  Pandora's been crying about their deal every year since they started.  I think that there's this big gap between what the market values music at and what the industry values music at.  And bridging that gap is very difficult.  And we sort of come at this $10 a month way to split the difference.  Which is 10 CDs a year.

Start time: 2877.00
End time: 2879.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But that's more than most people ever spent.

Start time: 2879.20
End time: 2882.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you look historically, most people only spent about $60 a year on music.

Start time: 2884.02
End time: 2889.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So this is a huge uplift, Christina.  If everybody in the country who bought CDs then wound up doing this, it would be a huge uplift, wouldn't it?

Start time: 2890.14
End time: 2913.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It would. And the only way that this works, I mean, I spoke on Monday, I spoke with Jimmy Iovine, I spoke with Eddie Q, and I spoke with Trent Rosner about Apple Music.  And Eddie Q was really clear that even because I asked him, I said, look, all these products are basically having the same library.  They're kind of offering the same kind of utility.  What's your differentiator?  How are you going to make a difference?

Start time: 2914.02
End time: 2915.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Like using UI?

Start time: 2916.00
End time: 2972.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, that's part of it.  I think their recommendations actually are a lot better than Spotify's.  I've been a Spotify user for like six years.  I like Spotify.  But if you're a new user kind of getting into it, I think that the advantage of having all of your purchases sit alongside the rest of the library, sitting alongside radio, sitting alongside recommendations works really well.  I think that their onboarding experience is superior.  I think that the beats one thing.  It could be a differentiator.  But I mean, really, they're aware that the experience is going to be what has to differentiate them.  But I mean, Jimmy Iovine was really a key in saying, he said, look, the only way this works, the only way that the record industry, that the artist, that anybody makes any money off of this is if it scales.  And the only way it scales is if it's more than a utility and people see it as a service.  And scale is not 20 million.  20 million is a drop in the bucket.  Scale to me, I would say, is like 100 million, 200 million.  That's what that that's if this is going to work is what it has to reach.

Start time: 2972.36
End time: 2979.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, because right now it's it's only going to be a billion dollars in revenue in the United States or something.  And that's not enough for the music industry.

Start time: 2980.22
End time: 2983.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The music industry historically was never that big of a business.

Start time: 2983.04
End time: 2984.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yes. So they're just crying.

Start time: 2985.81
End time: 3057.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was kind of a problem because it blew up.  It reached these heights kind of the same time as the dot coms era.  Because of CDs.  Yeah.  Because of CDs, 1999, 2000, with the height of Napster, everything happened where the music industry reached these historic highs.  And that was an anomaly in retrospect.  But then kind of there was the crash.  There was kind of the digital thing that happened.  And frankly, the music industry is still responding to what happened 15 years ago with Napster.  They are still not dealing with what happened with that situation.  They still haven't embraced reality.  And I think streaming is is kind of their last hope if they want this to be something that can work.  And so I think if Trent Reznor was saying, you know, he's gone through kind of the gamut, you know, as a legacy artist, he has gone through the highs and the lows.  He left the record industry kind of establishment, tried to do the pay your own thing, tried to kind of do his own crowdfunding.  Exactly. And he said, you know, at the end of the day, all of it felt like gimmicks.  And so, you know, he said, I don't regret doing it at the time, but I wouldn't do it again.  So, you know, if Trent Reznor is saying I can't make the sort of thing work and he had to go back to being on a more traditional label and try to figure things out, he's saying, look, at the end of the day, I'm an artist, period.  But his goal is to try to make it so that people can make a living doing this.

Transcript:  I just I just want to say that that scale issue is the one big thing that Apple can provide to a music genre.  They like there are people that I know they're call me up because they're not savvy, whatever, like, oh, this thing came on.  It's free for three months. I tried.  I'm like, well, it's free for three months. Why wouldn't you try it?  And so they installed it.  So a lot of people they're going to get like that that have never paid for Spotify.  I know people that don't use Pandora.  Is it going to automatically bill all of us?

Start time: 3090.14
End time: 3102.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Who put the trial on in three months?  It does. Yes. Oh, so I'm going to have to unsubscribe.  And so they'll. Yeah.  So I'm going to find out that I'm a subscriber a month before when they get the bill.  Yes. Nobody ever looks at their bills for iTunes for three months.

Start time: 3103.08
End time: 3126.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They get the hooking people like they get you to like it.  They get you to use it. And hopefully they make a couple of tweaks and upgrades to it.  But Apple has that ability to say, hey, I'm putting a cookie on everybody's plate.  Take a bite if you want, as opposed to Google with different phones and different services, different like Apple's ubiquity is just awesome for that scale.  So hopefully it works out for the music industry that way.

Start time: 3151.06
End time: 3158.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

End time: 3183.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He actually did. AT&T actually did.  They had a family plan with Beats Music, actually, where you could get a discount.  And I think Sprint did to note it was T-Mobile, T-Mobile, who offered you some sort of free data transfer if you also used your streaming service.  So, yeah, I mean, different people have tried to bundle it.  And I think that honestly, having iTunes, having it part of your Apple account makes it easier for a lot of people because they've already got your credit card.  So that just makes it easier for that charge than anything else.

Transcript:  Apple is so profitable now and they're trying to go downstream, Peter.  Would it not make sense for Apple to say, we'll just pay for the first year of anybody who buys a new device with us because it's costing them seven bucks a month.  Maybe they can get the carrier to pick up three fifty of it.  They pick up three fifty of it.  And just like when you buy an iPhone or you buy the new Mac, it's just like, hey, guess what?  You're not if you buy a Windows machine or you buy whatever else an Android, you're not going to get unlimited music for your first year.  Wouldn't that be like a huge differentiator in buying?

Start time: 3214.08
End time: 3240.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, I think that they probably realized that there might get an anti-competitive.  Yeah.  Because if you are going to give something away like that, bundling is a bundling is anti-competitive.  It creates an anti-trust, anti-competition issue.  And if you have market share, which they don't.  Well, except that they have market share in terms of the platform.  And so Microsoft had this issue when they were trying to get into browsers, which they had zero market share of the browser.  So they bundled it, they made the browser free.  Exactly. And so.

I think it's 100 bucks now.  It's 100 bucks, 99 dollars.  I didn't even know this was going up.  I cannot live without prime.  How many people in the studio are primed?  I would pay 150.  Oh my God.  Literally almost everybody except for the kid who's here with his mom.  He didn't.  Your mom has prime.  Don't worry.  I'm pretty sure.  I mean, and prime, how many people who have prime have watched an Amazon video in the  last 30 days?  Last 30 days?  No.  Okay.  Yeah, I watch TV on it all the time.  There's a lot of great stuff on Amazon Prime.  It's like, I basically, it's maybe in our household, I would say 60 percent Netflix,  40 percent Amazon Prime.  Why wouldn't Amazon just include this in their prime and make prime a little bit more expensive?  They do.

Transcript:  They have a music service.  The problem is that they can't afford to put the a la carte offering, I think, in the service.  I think that it would honestly hit their margins too much.  So instead what they have is they have the radio, the Pandora type thing.  They have the music match, which lets you upload your existing purchases to their library  and then stream that.  And then they have, I don't know, maybe like 150,000, 200,000 albums.  Actually, I think it's more than that.  It might be like 2 million.

Start time: 3337.44

Start time: 3339.66
End time: 3357.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly.  It's very limited compared to Spotify.  The great thing, though, is that if you've uploaded your music, like me, I tend to have  a mirror of my iTunes uploaded to Amazon.  I can use my Amazon Echo and be like, play whatever and it'll play that album from my  playlist.  So that's the one advantage.

Start time: 3357.72

Transcript:  They have higher fidelity?  And Deezer's the same way.  Yeah, they have higher fidelity streaming.  And to be clear, there's kind of a difference between FLAC and then having 24-bit FLAC.  Because you could just have FLAC that would be from a CD file that would still be 16-bit  and technically wouldn't sound any better in a lot of A-B tests than just having an  MP3, like a lame VO or MP3 file or something like that.  But if you've got like a 24-bit FLAC file, that's quote-unquote HD audio.  If you've got really good ear hearing and good speakers, then I guess that has better  fidelity.

Oh, athletes, how did this guy make $300 million?  I'm like, I don't care if he's made $300 million.  Who could cut that check?  How much money are they making so I can cut the check?  Jay-Z gets paid.  Jay-Z's out there shaking his butt on the stage like everybody else to get paid.  But the problem is I don't have a problem with getting paid.

Transcript:  This is why Taylor Swift is so smart with her letter because she pointed out the fact  that, look, I'm fine.  I'm making enough money to pay my people, but it's the smaller artists who aren't making  money.  Like a photographer?  Like a photographer?  Well, I mean, who is this?  I'm just saying.  When she did her open letter to Apple, yeah, you know, I mean, she played that perfectly.  She was able to say, look, I have enough money.  This isn't about me being a petulant child.  It's about the artists who can't afford to do this.  And so I'm taking a stand.  So you know, because I'm the only one who can kind of say this and then Apple can't  screw me over.  If the title artist had said that, then I think that it would have been a different  conversation.  Instead, it came across like the rich people are saying, we're not making enough money.  Pay us more.  And you know, whether or not they're really fighting or care about, you know, the indie  artist, the unsigned artist is irrelevant because it just the messaging came across.  The optics looked like rich people complaining.

Transcript:  I'm not saying they were great about it.  I'm just I'm just getting a little perspective to the situation.  Yes, they still look douchey.  But at the same time, they said we had a full douche.  Yeah, it was like a half douche moment.  It's like, man, you're you got all this money.  You're complaining and you're complaining about the wrong thing.  But you have a point to complain, I guess, if that's you.  I mean, if I'm at a job and I've got a job.  Yeah.  And everything else they did was wrong.  Like if you're going to do this, first of all, actually hire somebody who knows design,  steal somebody because the real problem was it looked like trash.  I opened it up and I thought my daughter made it and she's a pretty good artist.  I'm like, well, if she made this, I'd be awesome.  Good job, girl.

Transcript:  All right. Here's something bizarre.  The FBI is investigating 11 attacks on San Francisco area Internet lines.  FBI is currently investigating at least 11 physical attacks on high capacity Internet  cables in California's San Francisco Bay area dating back a year, including one early  Tuesday morning. Agents confirm the attack.  The latest attack disrupted Internet service for businesses, yada yada yada.  FBI declined to specify how significantly the attack affected customers citing an  ongoing investigation.  But these are physical attacks and they were done where there are no cameras.  Does anybody have any idea or any theory on what this might be?  Because literally in the stories I read about it, they were just like a USA to the  story and it kind of went away.  There doesn't seem to be any follow up to this or any safeguards about the lines.  And is this terrorist terrorism motivated?  Is it a disgruntled employee?  Why would somebody go around cutting fiber lines?  They hate the Internet.

Start time: 4034.40
End time: 4050.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think there's enough redundancy in the Bay Area that it wouldn't be a problem,  though I don't know. I don't know the extent of what's being done here.  If I had to guess, it'd probably be people that are sort of disgruntled by the influx  of tech people into the Bay Area.  Or if I just had to guess without knowing any more than you think it's the anarchists.

Start time: 4051.64

Transcript:  Is somebody angry about the influx of inequality in that area?  And a guy works on a pole somewhere hooking up cable lines.  He's walking into somebody's house.  And it used to be a crappy brownstone and somebody moves in, puts 40 million into it.  And it looks like a chateau because he knows where all the cameras are.  He knows how to get to all the lines.  Obviously, somebody who works in that area to know what's going on around him to do it.  Yeah. So, I mean, it's probably disgruntled guy.  I can't afford to live here anymore.

Start time: 4171.50
End time: 4189.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Nobody cares.  So, yeah, Blackberry, what they did is they supported the Android runtime environment.  So you could, yes, you could side load Android apps or developers could very easily port their apps over to the Blackberry store.  We did for Inside.com.  And then they actually also, I think, added support for the Amazon Android.

Start time: 4189.80
End time: 4214.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. Now, the Amazon App Store actually comes pre-installed on it.  So you can just install the apps that way.  They don't have the Google Play services.  So you still can't get Snapchat or Instagram or Netflix or Uber.  But you can get other stuff.  I mean, like, yeah, I mean, like genuinely at this point, I mean, I've been saying for like well over a year now, like they just need to stop making devices all together and just become a MDM company.  But, yeah, I don't know.

Start time: 4266.26
End time: 4296.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So I think two comments on that.  I mean, when a talk show guy starts making gadgets, that's sort of proof that we are in a bubble.  And then two, they were clearly suing him to stop him from doing exactly this, which is the new product they have,  which is now on the screen, which to me, if I could take my iPhone 6 and slide up and have a keyboard, I would be so happy right now.  Why do you think the Apple will ever do this?  Because it seems never, never, never, never, never, ever.  That was Steve Jobs' thing, right?

Start time: 4296.38

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They will not.  I will say that, and I know this from sources that I have.  Yes, as the founder of Gizmodo and Engadget.

Start time: 4319.22
End time: 4340.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They were interested, but it was one of those things where I don't think that they felt like it made sense to kind of fork the path that they were on.  They kind of thought eventually the software based keyboards will get to a place where.  Have they?  Have the keyboards gotten there?  They have improved a lot.  If you go back and use an original iPhone on the original iOS, you would notice a huge difference in the response.

Transcript:  Make sure you check out all the great shows here on the Twitter network.  And this story is bizarre and not from the onion.  Google mistakenly tags black people as gorillas, showing limits of algorithms.  Google is the leader in artificial intelligence and machine learning, but the company's computers  still have a lot to learn, judging by a major blunder of its photos app this week.  The app tagged two black people as gorillas, according to Jack.  I will be seeing a web developer who spotted the error and tweeted the photo.  Google photos, y'all, effed up.  My friends, not a gorilla, he wrote on Twitter.  Google apologized and said it's tweaking its algorithms to fix the problems.  Thoughts to the panel?

Start time: 4867.96
End time: 4912.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As a black man, I'll start off by saying sometimes people do look like gorillas.  You know what I mean?  Sometimes you say a big dude.  I mean a big nose.  I got a cousin that's blacker than my iPhone and I might miscommunicate him with someone  swinging from a tree if he was running, cutting grass or something.  I don't know.  I mean, something like this happened a long time ago.  I'm just making a joke.  See, I was talking about people being sensitive.  I'm black.  I can say it.  Ain't nobody gonna say nothing to me.  But, you know, there was something like this that happened before with one of the webcams  or something.  When you track black people.  Right, they wouldn't see them.  And, you know, yeah, like I was like, I love stuff like that.  I mean, I could rob somebody when nobody even knows I was out just coming in like a shade  in the night.  So if I went on to the wrong place and they thought I was a gorilla, I could get away  with something.  So it was good and bad and everything, you know.

I mean, a few weeks ago, right, Google Photos launched and we were all going nuts over how  great it was.  You could enter a word and it would automatically pull up.  You would just, you know, search for something.  And if you entered like tables, it'd pick up every tiny table in the background.  So yeah, we're sort of reaching the limits of machine learning and how, you know, you  still need human beings on some part of this process to say, you know what, for this we  got to start to pull back the filter a little bit, be a little less.

Transcript:  All right.  Moving on from this obvious insanity, crazy story that is just breaking out last night  from the intercept, X key score at a glance, the NSA headquarters is got 700, no fewer  than 700 servers at 150 sites all over the world.  And they are analyzing at a level that is considered better than Google or as good as  Google from these documents that the guardian has released.  They seem to have the flow from fiber optics cables that make up the backbone of the world's  communication network, among other sources for processing.  As of 2008, the surveillance system boasted approximately 150 field sites in the United  States, Mexico, Brazil, United Kingdom, yada, yada, yada.  And this is where it gets interesting.  These servers store full take data at the collection sites, meaning that they capture  all of the traffic collected and as of 2009 stored content for three to five days and  metadata for 30 to 45 days.  NSA documents indicate that tens of billions of records are stored in its database.  It is a fully distributed processing and query system that runs on machines around the world.  At field sites, key store can run on multiple computers that gives the ability to scale  in both processing power and storage.  And they're able to essentially track everything that anybody on the internet does just by  knowing your email.  It's worse than we thought.  Is this a shock or a surprise to you, Christina?

Start time: 5096.67
End time: 5126.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sadly, no, it's not.  Because I mean, this is all kind of coming out of the revelations that the Edward Snowden  released now two years ago.  But I think still, even though I'm not surprised, seeing it and seeing the documents in black  and white is still one of those things that makes me as an American, especially July 4th,  we can go really, really, this is this is what our country has kind of come to this  level of mass surveillance.  I'm not surprised, but it's still really eye opening and in a lot of ways kind of terrifying.

Transcript:  I have friends that work for Lockheed Martin and one tidbit information that's really neat.  They would never have that Google facial recognition problem because I have a friend who made some  software that can not only once it sees who you are, if it sees a picture of you with  a beard with a hat with glasses on, it still knows somehow that it's you.  And it's like so freakishly accurate.  It's insane. Like, so that's the stuff that the government's buying that's being made.  And Google apparently is mixing me up with a gorilla.  So I would totally agree and understand that that's how things are moving.  And it doesn't shock me at all from the other things that I hear that get bought.

Start time: 5172.88

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Here's the government. Here's an interesting fact, Peter, to all this, which is the NSA's  ability to piggyback off of private companies tracking of their own users through cookies,  I'm assuming here, is a vital instrument that allows the agency to trace the data it collects  to individual users.  It makes no difference if visitors switch to public Wi-Fi networks or connect to VPNs  to change their IP addresses.  The tracking cookie will follow them around as long as they are using the same web browser  and fail to clear all their cookies.  How complicit do you think the technology companies have been historically and are they complicit  now? Will this be unraveled at the end of Obama's administration?

Start time: 5210.04
End time: 5251.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I actually think, I mean, if, you know, looking at the stuff about X-key score, it  sounds like what they're doing is by monitoring the fiber optic, you know, tapping the fiber  optic cables directly, they're actually just, you know, capturing the raw data that's passing  through and then searching and making sense of it.  I think, and I may be wrong here, is because, you know, these fiber optic cables are outside  of the United States, the NSA considers them to be fair game, right?  The rules for NSA, and I admit they have been sort of bent and broken a lot of ways, but  generally speaking, the NSA considers anything outside of the actual physical jurisdiction  of the United States to be fair game, even if it's a communication by a U.S. citizen.

Start time: 5252.38
End time: 5260.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And so...  So as a U.S. citizen in the United States, you obviously have more rights than outside  of the United States.  We can spy on Americans outside the United States, no problem.  Yeah.

End time: 5321.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In their world.  If you're going to call to a foreign country, that's different than making a phone call  within the United States.  I mean, I think that this stuff is not going to get wrapped up at the end of the Obama  administration.  I mean, if anything, whoever becomes president is probably going to be more aggressive in  feeling justified in collecting this data.  I think the tech companies are, I mean, the tech companies are complicit in the sense  that they are creating a service which encourages people to create and share a lot of personal  data about themselves.  For the most part, I mean, Google and Facebook and Twitter, they do...  They don't willingly give this information up to the government.  They give it up under the...  Under duress.  Under court orders, basically.  The issue is that the FISA court has...  And this is slightly separate than this ex-key source up, but the FISA court doesn't push  back on any requests for information.  So it's not like...  If the government wants to, or the police want to listen in on your phone calls in the  United States, they have to get a warrant.  And that's perfectly legal.  You get a warrant and you can listen, tap somebody's phone calls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Somebody has to be the voice of reason and say, you know what?  It is in the public's interest to tap this person, known terrorist, who's on this message  board with other terrorists, ISIS.  We should do this.

Start time: 5332.94
End time: 5358.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that what we should have is we should have an actual adversarial process by which  the government has to prove that they actually need this information rather than...  Like they used to.  Now it's sort of like they want to have it because they want to be able to search it  and just go through it, you know, to be in the interest of what they perceived to be  the national security threat.  But I think that it should be that you have to be able to establish just in the same way

Start time: 5359.06
End time: 5366.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_10

End time: 5396.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  There have been reports to say that it doesn't.  And technically, let me put my full hat back on.  I told you that it was an inside job.  Maybe it was the NSA cutting on them fiber lines in San Francisco trying to put a little  filter coupling in so they can get what's going on.  I'm not saying they did it.  I'm just saying they wouldn't.  And, you know, if Snow didn't say something, all that stuff you talk about due diligence  wouldn't be out here in the world for us to know.  So things that people should do aren't always what they shouldn't do.  And I still eat cookies.  I'm just saying.

Transcript:  You could come back with that.  Do you think that this is actually contributing to a safer society in America?  Obviously, it's contributing to less privacy.  We know that.  But is it actually preventing another 9-11?  Is it preventing another, you know, I guess it was September 7th was the or October 7th  was the bombings in Europe.  Is this preventing terrorist acts, you think?  Or is it just a huge waste of time?

Start time: 5434.14
End time: 5513.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know if it's a huge waste of time, but I'm also not really convinced that it's  preventing, you know, other attacks.  If it is, I would love to actually see them show us some proof of things that have been  supported and say this is why we need these things.  But at the same time, I mean, this is why we have the FISA court.  I would much prefer that we go through the legal mechanisms we have, the courts we have,  you know, which are very easy to kind of go through.  It's one of those things.  If it's really necessary, I think that they go through those processes.  Absolutely.  I mean, there's a need, you know, for us to do counter surveillance and counterintelligence  and to protect our country and protect our state.  But I wonder, you know, just seeing just the broad swath of things that are happening and  knowing how much information is out there and knowing how much data is being collected.  You know, I'm genuinely concerned with do they even have the amount of people necessary  to even go through this and find the stuff that might be able to prevent an attack or  are they just getting so much other stuff that could then be used for really more nefarious  purposes?  I don't know.  I mean, it's a tough balancing act.  I don't have the right answer for that.  Fortunately, I don't have to make those sorts of calls.  But I'm not utterly convinced that it's been warranted.  I wish that I had more trust in our government that it was warranted, but I just genuinely  don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And on a serious note, just to piggyback off that, when someone wants to do something wrong  and they know that you're watching everything that they do digitally, they go hand to hand.  They talk to a person, they put them on a plane.  So you tell me that you're in my life and everything that you're doing.  That guy walked into a church and killed nine people and his friends said, oh, I thought  he was going to do something like this.  But nobody knew because he was one man on an island talking amongst his friends.  He wasn't posting stuff or doing anything crazy where it could have been caught.  So you telling me and telling the whole world, we're listening to everything you say, makes  them go, all right, we're face to face now.  We're hand to hand.  You're going to do this and do that.

I have a pit bull.  I got a gun.  break the door in any way.  People are going to find a way to do what they want to do.  You just have to prepare yourself the best we can.  And this seems to make people feel better at the same time.  Because a lot of people I know say, oh, the privacy doesn't matter.  And I'm like, OK.

You probably do catch some of those lone wolves, but you're not catching the legit terrorists.

Transcript:  I think that, you know, a good intelligence service doesn't rely on just mass surveillance  in the way that you would want to.  I mean, I think you have to be able to have great sources and be able to infiltrate and  be able to track things.  Like I said, I have no problem with if there is, you know, people that have been identified  as a risk, being able to and that, you know, being able to get a court order to say that  somebody could justify it.  Somebody could explain this is justifiable.  But if not, I think that like that we have to have a balance in what we give up.  And I think that preserving a lot of the basic, you know, Fourth Amendment rights and things  like that are really, really important long term for us as a society.

Transcript:  He's making that calculation of I am going to be responsible of one of two things.  People being upset, the privacy freaks being upset about my privacy, the privacy issue,  which is maybe 10 percent of the country, or another terrorist attack, God forbid another  9-11, 100 percent of the country is going to blame me.  Yeah.

Transcript:  And at the same time, you can't give the president of the United States all that power because  even things that he wants to get done has to go through a system.  And sometimes that system is against you.  So again, he can say whatever he wants.  But there are checks and balances and those checks and balances are getting paid by lobbyists  that need X, Y and Z. And so he sits there like, OK, well, I can shut down Guantanamo  Bay or I can push through Obamacare and shove it on people's throat.  Well, I want people to have health care because they're never going to give up the war.  There's games and there's so much BS and politics that saying thinking Obama's going to do something  is a joke because he is a very puppeteer type person where he's got only a few strings that  he can actually pull and get something done.

Transcript:  Interesting comment in the chat room.  Omega Project says perhaps Ted Kaczynski, the bomber, the Unabomber was not so far off  base.  If you look at that manifesto, the manifesto, somebody took quotes from that manifesto and  put them up against like Bill Gates or other people.  It's kind of offensive, but he did have, as some crazy, highly intelligent people do,  had some points about the eroding nature of human freedoms and whatnot.

Transcript:  The reason why we put these structures and these limits on power is not for when we have  good wise leaders.  It's for the inevitability that sooner or later we have really corrupt, not even just  sorry.  This is a family program.  Not even necessarily corrupt, but you just say ish.  Ish is the new way.  You know, incompetent or low quality leadership.  So the reason that you put these structures in place is so that maybe it's like the stuff  with like the drones, right?  It's like maybe you trust Obama to make the right decisions about how we use drones.  But the thing is, we should have limits.  We should put limits in place now over how they're used, because sooner or later we're  going to have some.  You're going to have the emperor.  Yeah, you're going to have somebody that maybe we disagree with.

Transcript:  Yeah.  And he's like, oh, well, I can use drones to strike in America.  Yeah.  Like we're killing Americans.  We're killing Americans with drones outside the United States.  And that seems like, hmm, did we really just kill an American?  Well, he's a terrorist and he's a member of ISIS.  Okay.

Start time: 5877.70
End time: 5885.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How would you feel about that?  I think that we'd have a real problem.  I think that I would have a problem with that.  What if the you have to have due process, right?  To kill an American, I think.  Okay.

Start time: 5886.34

Transcript:  But what if he knew it was the bombers from Boston?  We knew they were in a location and we said, F it.  We'll just we'll send a drone in to get them so nobody has to risk their life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Totally.  You're against that.  I think that I think that we should try to do.  I think, first of all, I think that a lot of cases that are terrorists, especially in  the U.S., are really they should be treated like crimes, right?  Like they should be prosecuted.  Due process.  There should be due process.  A court trial.  Well, the reason that we do that is not is because, again, this it becomes a slippery  slope and eventually you have someone that you don't trust to make those decisions and  you want them to be constrained.

Transcript:  Even with all that common sense, we still got the guy in Colorado waiting for trial  that shot up the movie theater, like because they just don't know what to do or that execute  the person.  Like politics is so much of a game anymore.  Like all things that are great and common sense and the way things should work.  Like, hey, let's put checks and balances in so nothing bad goes wrong when something crazy  comes in.  But if a reasonable person comes in, we should listen to that person.  If only things work that way.  And it doesn't anymore.  It's all about money and lobbyists and fun stuff.
