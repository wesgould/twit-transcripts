Transcript:  Alright, in 3, 2, 1. Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, welcome to another edition  of Twit, Twit number 46. Joining us today, John C. Dvorak, Alex, Lindsay, Roger Chang,  David Prager, and I'm Patrick Norton. Leo Laporte is missing in action, last seen somewhere  between Petaluma and Toronto.  We've also been sightings in Georgia and the Lower East Side of Manhattan, but we won't  get into that. I'm Patrick Norton. What are we going to start with, guys? What's the big  story? Is it...  It's sitting right behind you, Patrick.  The DOJ... So this is bigger than the DOJ story.  Don't you think?  Bigger than the Google DOJ.  In the long run, the repercussions will be bigger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tell the listeners what I'm pointing to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My God, it's a copy of Windows XP running on a Macintosh Mini.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  On a Macintosh Mini.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  On a Macintosh Mini.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No graphics drivers.  It works.  No wireless drivers.  It works.  No network drivers.  But it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you can play Windows Native Solitaire on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And you can go into the set up in Control Pail.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's pretty nifty.  But can you dual boot yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  Really?  No, that dual boot... When you start it up... This is using the one that was posted for  the 13th...  The slipstream one?  Yeah, the slipstream one.  So when you start it up, you hit Page Up or Page Down and you go OS X or Windows.  And then you hit Enter and you're good to go.  You have two partitions on there.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then you manually install each of the operating systems after you've created the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  partitions?  Yeah, I will admit that I didn't do it.  Ben Durbin here did it.  But we were doing it for MacBreak.  And he partitioned the drive and then installed each operating system on each...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did you install one first or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you install the OS X version first.  And it's really on that bleeding edge side of things where two hours before we needed  it they did a new patch to work just with that mini.  What did you need it for?  The patch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I mean what did you need to do this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We wanted to see if we could do it while we were shooting MacBreak.  So we were shooting all day and we were like, hey, let's see if we can actually...  It had just come out the day before so we wanted to see if we could make it work before  the end of the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's using the NT bootloader to swap between?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know what it's using.  It's using magic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I read that most of the work was in configuring the booting part of Windows to function natively  architecture is based on what I guess the new Pentium processor is doing in the...  Not Pentium but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm just watching you slowly lose momentum in the center.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well one of the guy who did the hack, $14,000, like $13,854.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's pretty exciting.  I think it's really cool.  You know, I think that there's a lot of people who...  You know, obviously this version isn't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You pay his legal expenses when Apple sues him.  Well it's two people, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apparently this is legal.  This is completely legal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What do you mean, we say apparently?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It says that they're keen to keep their anonymity and are known only by the handles, Narf and  Blanca.  Narf?  Oh my God.  Narf 2006.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the difference.  That's not different than the old Narf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the other guy named us after...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is on the BBC News website.  Oh, that place filled with lies.  And the price is $7,895.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what are you saying, John?  Where's the DMCA violation?  Where's the lawsuit here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It depends on whether there's a license agreement when you buy a Macintosh or not.  When you buy a Macintosh and you open OSX, or whatever they want to call it.  It's called OSX.  Everyone says 10, 10.  You're agreeing to a shrink-wrapped license, right?  Right.  Well, in there, there may be something about this.  I don't know.  I agree with those things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Didn't Apple say they're not going to fight anybody or touch anybody that they...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apple said we're not going to do anything to stop people from putting XP on.  It's not something we're promoting, obviously.  Well, you know why, right?  Well, it's going to double their market share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, that and because they're going to do it themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You have to go through this again, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just a thought.  I think it would be more likely that Apple would find a way to run Windows applications  in the OSX operating system than it would be for them to port.  To allow Windows Dells to run OSX.  Like natively run.  Like virtual PC.  Yeah, but not like virtual PC.  Like just run it.  I think that would be more like...  Oh, I see.  Without the OS overhead.  You just double-click on a Windows app and it opens in OSX.  I think it's more likely that that would happen than Apple exposing themselves by releasing  it to Dell.  So that's my...  That's his theory.  He's sticking to it.  That's my story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apple is hanging over and greasing up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So what happens next?  You're talking about certain wireless drivers aren't there, certain graphics drivers aren't  there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, the networking drivers aren't in place.  They don't have a native video driver for it yet.  So it's run at a stock 640x480 VGA driver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It doesn't look like 640x480 on that thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Last one I saw they hadn't had a proper VGA driver.  Or a proper driver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, there is no hardware driver for the video.  So I mean when you move the window around it does the little stutter bit.  Because the CPU is redrawing the screen itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I'm fairly sure that's 1024x768.  I'd have to go over and look.  It doesn't look like...  Yeah, it looks like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what it looks like.  Okay.  Well, maybe they've gotten something working.  But no doom to me on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I'm a PC user and I want a Mac and I would love to be able to continue using my  Windows apps on it.  I'm sure most people who are running Macs want to be able to run Windows apps.  I already have Windows.  I just want to be able to run Mac apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm in a situation where there's a handful...  I have a PC because there's a handful of programs that I need for visual effects production  that are on a PC.  And I would love to be able to just run them on my G5 or whatever the next...  My Super Duo tower, whatever it's going to be.  That would be fantastic.  And I'd get rid of my PC.  Heavy, awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, okay.  Well, I guess that topic died.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So someone's saying that Leo might be in Vegas because there's a lot of people there doing  the NCAA tournament, if anyone cares about that.  But I thought...  Is that like a basketball thing?  There's a basketball thing.  But there's a good tech into this.  CBS is doing a thing, like a lot of people have done it, but you can watch every game  VOD.  You can watch it all for free.  And they're providing this with the understanding that they're going to get their costs back  as ad revenue.  And I mean, I think it's really cool.  You can go back and watch the highlights of any game like that.  You can go watch any game live as it's happening like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they're not charging a dime.  I wonder what the model is though, because ad revenue is based on viewership.  And they pay in advance.  Say I take out an ad and it's on one of these basketball games, and the next thing you know  there's 20 million downloads.  Am I supposed to pay more money?  And if I'm not supposed to pay more money, how is CBS making money on...  I don't know how they...  The whole model doesn't sound wacky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's a lot less wacky for the people who are normally advertising on CBS or ESPN  than it is for say somebody who would be advertising on this podcast.  If you're buying in terms of CPMs and you're already buying for millions of eyeballs, having  a couple million more isn't going to exactly kill you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I mean, yes, but you don't want to get surprised.  People do have budgets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but the salespeople are not that stupid.  They're going to sit down, they're going to put it in the contract.  Salespeople are not that stupid.  Neither are the ad buyers.  They're going to put a cap in it and they're going to rotate.  Yes, they're going to rotate in on their advertisers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When they did the Olympics, they sold, I heard that they sold ads and they promised a certain  number of viewers, but they weren't positive because some of the other networks were ramping  up their big shows like Lost and some of those others to really take on the Olympics.  And so I know that some of these contracts had, we project...  So many viewers.  Seven million viewers for such and such.  And if we get five or four, we're going to give you your money back or we'll give you  free ad space on our other stuff until we reach what our goal was.  I don't know how they broke it for this, but according to the AFP, they said that the first  day of games, they had over 1.2 million internet viewers, according to CBS.  And then they said they...  CBS claimed that they set a new internet record for a live entertainment event of more than  268,000 simultaneous streams.  Was it live eight figures?  They said that that was the biggest and they want to break that or they just broke it,  which is AOL's little music portal that did the live eight ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know if I call it little music portal.  I know.  Above and beyond the relationship that Twit has with AOL distributing the bandwidth, live  eight was pretty big.  Okay, who's seen AOL's television?  Television.  AOL.com forward slash into TV.  It's cool.  Pinky in the Brain is back.  This is still my...  It is.  It's like a bizarre collection of Warner, I guess Warner Brothers shows.  Warner Brothers.  Alice in Babylon 5.  Beetlejuice.  Chico and the Man.  Dark Justice was a pretty bad show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  F.F. Falcon Crest.  Freakazoid.  One, specific and certain episodes of Wonder Woman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Lefem Nechita, Lois and Clark.  The New Adventures of Batman.  New Adventures of Batman, love it.  Good.  V. Welcome Back Carter.  V.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cotter, but I can't even say that.  Have you seen that they're going to release, I think it's 10 episodes of Office that are  internet only?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Over the summer.  Is it the British The Office?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not positive which one it is.  They're going to put it out over the summer.  It's going to be on, I think it's on NBC's website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is this because they have too much content to put out or because it's an experiment?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's an experiment.  Well Channel 4 in the UK is actually putting out episodes of their kind of IT sitcom called  The IT Crowd.  I'm not sure if anyone's watched it.  The IT Crowd.  The IT Crowd.  It's funny, I mean in a British, very British way.  But I think a lot of them are just trying to see if they can generate enough eyeballs  to make a self-sustaining revenue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well I mean when you look at selling something on iTunes, the rumor is they're making about  a buck fifty per show when people are buying them.  Apple's not making much as usual because it's just a push for the iPod.  A buck fifty to the studios.  A buck fifty to the studios.  Now on average that's three times as much as that they make on advertising.  What they're hoping to make is forty five cents, fifty cents per viewer across for advertising.  So they're actually doing significantly better.  I think that they're going to get to a point where they start releasing more of these shows  ahead of time.  You know more of them a week early on iTunes.  Fifty cents a viewer?  Fifty cents a viewer on the advertising.  That seems pretty high to me.  That's, you know I read it.  Is that an industry number?  It's an industry number.  I read it.  It must be the truth.  I'd like to look into it.  That doesn't sound right.  Okay, check it out.  If it's lower than that, then it's a, if it's lower than that then the argument becomes  even more intense that they would be more likely if iTunes continues to pick up speed  or other online sales, they'd be more likely to do downloads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the advertising rate of five hundred dollars a thousand.  This doesn't make any mathematical sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As I said, it's a number that was, I read it in an industry thing so I don't have it  right in front of me.  I'll have to go look for it.  But if it's lower than that, if it's a lot lower than that, then what you're, it still  makes the point that they're more likely to let you download it and buy it first.  I think five cents has got to be the number.  If it's five cents, it's even, the bottom line is regardless of whether it's five cents  or fifty cents, it is, it is, I mean that number doesn't make any difference other than  it's either three or thirty percent.  Right, this is a higher number.  It's a much higher number for the downloads per, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, they're making a buck and a half per viewer.  You know, you could pass it around.  I mean if I download it and my kid wanted to watch it, there goes the per viewer rate,  seventy-five cents.  I mean I could cut it in half again by handing it over to somebody else or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I get, you know, and I guess there's probably, I'm sure, but you know, if those people are  going to do that, they're just as likely to go get it in BitTorrent anyway.  So you're most likely, you know, I mean it's, I mean, you know, if they're going to pass  it, if once they start breaking the law, why bother going to iTunes?  Once you start breaking the law.  Once you start breaking the law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Once you realize you can get everything at higher rates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Does anybody know the, you know, another story that's on the list is, does anybody know the  details on this French situation?  Which French, the one where they said, okay, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All the MP3 players have to be interoperable and Apple's going to have to open up the iTunes  playback on portables.  Apple is just going to pull out of the market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is this because of the French or is it because of another company that's decided to fight  it in France?  It's because of a, I think it's a French government initiative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, they've had a lot of initiatives.  I think the most recent, the other most recent kind of newsmaker was the one where they allowed,  let's say BitTorrent, peer-to-peer sharing of media and stuff and not classified as illegal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So are they serving?  Well, there is nothing wrong with peer-to-peer sharing.  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, exactly with copyrighted material.  It was, remember they wrote it, it was about two months ago.  They said that it was no longer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll see if I can look the story up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, everyone's moaning and groaning because I happen to be plugging into the network because  of some reason, Prager and I can't get on the wireless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That sharing of copyrighted material over peer-to-peer or similar style networks in  France is not considered a crime.  Or rather, it's a bill.  It's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, so let's take a step back.  On March 16th, this is Businessweek, an article about this, France's National Assembly is  expected to vote on legislation known as the Author of Rights Laws amongst its many provisions.  The bill calls for lightening the punishment on unauthorized downloads of copyrighted music.  Which is kind of interesting is offenders would go, the fines would drop from $300,000  to 38 euros, which is less than $50.  Well that's an illegal sharing.  It should be like a traffic ticket.  Well, that's kind of high.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it should be like a traffic ticket.  What's wrong with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, what's interesting is the other thing is the legislation of PASS would also require  vendors to make their music compatible with all media players.  So that means everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Does that mean all of a sudden you could download the Beatles on the iTunes music?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean this is like...  Well I think they're saying you couldn't do a vertical integration where you own the software  and the delivery as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It also means you'd have to be able to play WMV on iPods, you know what I mean?  So that would go both ways.  There's no way to restrict it.  Or it would kill off all DRM on audio inside of France.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the whole thing is...  I mean Apple's not even thinking about it.  Because it's France?  No, it's just the market's not big enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well it's not Apple, it's Apple, it's Microsoft, it's everybody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And if they have to open that up, the French market isn't big enough for them to change  their entire business model for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So at the cafeteria in Cupertino they're serving freedom fries?  No, I don't think they...  They didn't even bother.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think they're even upset about it.  But they did take crepes off of there.  Oh by the way, just to zigzag back to the ad revenue, it's per show not per commercial.  So you're talking about 30 commercials going across.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's how that number works.  Well let's see, yeah, you'd have...  Today's TV is 40 minutes of show and 20 minutes of commercial in each show.  Each one is going to be...  Four-an-hour-long show.  That's 40...  That's a penny a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  A person.  More or less, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that's the...  Yeah, okay.  Yeah, because there's 40 ads.  Right.  Or 40 30-second ads.  Of course some of those are house ads and whatever.  Aha.  So you were just sitting there grinding away on this.  I was, I couldn't help it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was like, I'm gonna let Dvorak win.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I just...  I knew that the math was wrong, I had to figure it out and that was the math.  Okay, whatever works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So what was the source again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I just did it in my head.  I didn't look anywhere.  I was like, why does that math work?  We work within our heads here on this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, yeah, yeah.  So okay, here's my favorite one.  This is my favorite story, by the way.  Site sues Google over search rankings.  Oh, the...  KinderQuest.  Can you imagine?  Over search rankings?  Well, they're saying they downgraded.  Oh, yeah, this is a great story.  This company, what is the name of them?  Kinder...  KinderQuest.  KinderStart.com, according to CNN.  KinderStart.com seeks financial damages along with information on how Google ranks Internet  sites.  Apparently, they went down in ranking, way down, and now they blame Google for lost revenue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they said...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they sued them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They said that a cataclysmic 70% fall in its audience resulting in an 80% decline in revenue.  But...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This, by the way, is the top story on the dvorak.org slash blog, blog, right now as  we speak, in case you...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, the worst part is I didn't even know that Google ranked anything.  I mean, I'm sure it does, but I didn't know it was a public thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, they say that they employ a technology that's based on algorithms that...  I mean, the most commonly known thing to the public is that...  It's called undergraduates.  ...however many people link to your stuff, when you search for something...  If I have a site about volleyball and everyone links to me, when you type in volleyball on  Google, you'll probably get my site as one of the top two or three.  And then I guess they've got a bunch of other underlying things that they don't want to  give up, which is their intellectual property.  And I think that's the only reason that this is even maybe construed as half of an interesting  story because I could care...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's more than interesting because the fact of the matter is anyone who does  a lot of stuff online knows that Google probably provides at least 50% of all their hits, all  the page views.  I mean, at least my blog, which gets about...  I don't know, I'm getting about 60,000 people or 60,000 page views a day, which is reasonable  for a blog.  But you know what else is funny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're all half of them from Google.  This company is called KinderStart, and they say when you type in KinderStart in a search  engine on Yahoo or someone else or MSN, ours is the top site.  But how many people are looking for a site that caters to what they're doing and type  in KinderStart?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they just go kinderstart.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because I would think that you'd figure out that, but they're basing it on searching.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  KinderStart's a search engine, which makes it more interesting.  Why should Google put another search engine on any of their results?  Well, clearly some actions obviously...  Well, that's what Kinder is saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But what Kinder Heart is saying is that Google modified the ratings so that they basically  made KinderStart disappear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that's actually probably true.  Why?  Why would it be true?  Well, all of a sudden, if you type in KinderStart on Google, you get like kinderstart.co.uk.  You go to any other web browser, it takes you to kinderstart.com.  Maybe there's some weird anomaly in their algorithm, but it seems like something just  happened.  The KinderStart UK folks have to...  Now, the other thing is, why the hell, why the hell does Google give a flipping in?  They don't.  That's the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the other thing.  Why would they care?  Well, in some cases, I think they have.  A lot of people suggested a myth.  Google says that they take...  I think it's a myth.  I don't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, if somebody can come up with some concrete evidence that Google is playing games, I think  it would be great, but no one's going to...  It's not going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The only reason I've heard of Google playing games with the way people's stuff is ranked  is if they are trying to take advantage of the way their page rank system works.  If someone's trying to like, quote unquote, hack their system so they get a good...  Then Google will say, hey, you're out.  You're out, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's plenty of evidence of that, but there's a good reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Maybe it was Kinderstart maybe tweaking with some stuff, and I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.  But nobody knows.  We'll find out in court.  Anyway, I think this is a bad precedent if this actually gets anywhere, because you can't...  You start suing the search engine companies and these guys might as well just pull up  their tents.  You can't...  I mean, they won't be able to do anything.  It's going to just cripple them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just think it's...  I guess I just think it's absurd.  I mean, they're doing whatever they're doing.  You're happy that they're there.  I mean, you don't have a contract with those search countries.  They didn't promise you anything.  They can do what...  It's free advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If these guys have a problem, why don't they just take out an ad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I like what the lawyer for Kinderstart says.  They hope to prove Google...  This is an Associated Press article.  It hopes to prove Google has become an essential facility that should be required to warn websites  before dropping them from the index.  We don't really feel that there is enough transparency and openness in a service that  has become so important.  I like Kinderstart.  So who is this person?  That's the lawyer for Kinderstart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This lawyer guy or woman sounds a little flaky.  Lawyer guy or woman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I bet you Kinderstart has a lot more traffic now than they did before Google made it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, actually they're making hay with this lawsuit, another one of those suits that get  you publicity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Speaking of which, Department of DOJ, the judge sells to DOJ that Google doesn't have  to turn over the gigantic number, like the billions of URLs and search requests.  The judge said instead of two months' worth of user search queries, they get 50,000.  And Google has agreed to comply with that.  So that's kind of interesting.  So for the most recent 50,000?  I don't know if it's the most recent or if it's a select 50,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Cherry Pickum?  It's a fishing expedition, whatever it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The federal government is trying to pull together proof that COPPA, which has been struck down  in more ways than one, should be reinstated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's another story that's kind of interesting to me.  Australian IT, apparently in the magazine Australian IT, apparently licenses might be  required for IPTV, according to the government's flow to the idea of forcing internet providers  to apply for licenses to offer web-based TV services.  You mean in Australia?  Yeah, what do you think of that, Alex?  Say that again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's the definition of a web-based TV service?  He's still doing the math on this.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Australian government has floated the idea of forcing internet providers to apply  for licenses to offer web-based TV services, in other words IPTV.  In other words, you now have to be like a broadcasting license to send a crappy video  or something across the board.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So of course the question that's going to come up is when you do that, does that mean  that anybody who broadcasts on the web, do they have to come to Australia and get a license?  Can I broadcast over the web from the United States?  If so, then all the people who are making web TV are just going to move out of Australia.  I mean, they'll put their server in Vanuatu and call it a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, if you do have an account on YouTube and upload a video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The bottom line is they'll just move their server.  I'm sure it makes sense to some politician in their kooky little head.  Who doesn't understand it.  Yeah, who has no idea what they're...  Yeah, well, we will regulate them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It makes a lot of sense to a politician that's been poked with a sharp stick and a bag full  of money by a lobbyist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Totally.  But why?  But the lobbyist would know.  What lobby would want this?  Except the traditional broadcasters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, what do they have to protect?  You know, this is like Bell South.  Why would Bell South want to throttle back, you know, make money on traffic going both  ways?  Well, because, you know, they want to make more money or because it's either traditional,  you know, business model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They don't want to change their business models under any circumstances.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think a lot of the...  I mean, whether it's the RIA or broadcasters, what they want to do is they want to slow  the movement down so they can try to figure out some way to catch up.  You know, so they want to have something, whether it works or not, they want to slow  the process down so that they can figure out, you know, how to take advantage of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, there's stuff similar.  I mean, even outside of traditional just technology.  I mean, even, for example, with airlines, I think Qantas wanted to reprieve from the  Australian government to have Singapore Airlines fly the US-Australia flight route just because,  you know, they want to keep that market share to themselves.  So I mean, similar is the same thing.  I mean, you have a state broadcaster, ABC, and you also have the three other channels  that exist in Australia.  Well, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somebody says it's like, you know, there's two ways of looking at it.  That they're trying to have online programmers follow the same set of rules that traditional  broadcasters have to apply, you know, have to follow.  And I don't know.  It's, there's some pretty funny quotes in Australia about it, too.  It's, I don't know.  I would not want to get litigated in Australia.  It's pretty random.  You don't want to get arrested in Australia.  Well, I don't have to piss off the Aussies here or there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Speaking of regulation, the XXX is back, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Good news.  Yeah, yeah.  XXX.  Your startup is getting momentum.  I actually wrote about this almost 10 years ago, thinking it was a good idea because it  would segment things.  And people, you know, although, you know, there's a bunch of characters came along,  many of them Christian conservatives, who thought that it would just legitimatize, or  I don't know what they were thinking, to be honest about it.  But there was one group in particular I wrote about it in PC Magazine.  They gave me an award, by the way, this women's group, or women Christians for America's  America's on the House of the Year.  Yeah.  Something jerk off of the year or something like that.  No pun intended.  But I was in good company with everybody else on the list, apparently, was, you know, they  were normal people.  But anyway, it looks like it's back in play.  And I still think it's a good idea.  I don't know.  Does anybody see why it's not a good idea?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think it's a great idea.  And then you also, what's funny is that on both sides, the Christian coalition or whoever's,  you know, pushing that.  Yeah, I don't know if I can look it up.  They should be thinking about, you know, the fact that the porn industry is trying to fight  it as well because they don't want to be segmented.  And the ACLU is saying that...  Yeah, they were in bed with the porn industry.  That's what's so weird about it.  Yeah.  So, you know, they shouldn't be pushed into a certain, you know, quote unquote, online  red light area.  But I think it makes a lot of sense.  I think it makes it a lot easier to, you know, get off.  Well it makes it easier to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It doesn't make it easier.  You still have to have a, you just can't type in, you know, anything.  Donkey porn.  .xxx.  .xxx.  But this...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that it, I think it doesn't make it any easier than it is already.  I think that what it does do is it allows you to apply, you know, for filter systems,  for your kids, or for whatever.  Yeah, for filter systems is a great idea.  It makes it really simple.  You know, that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If it actually works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it won't work in the beginning.  It pulls all the prong off of the other locations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This group is called Concerned Women for America.  And they're the ones who made a big stink about...  They're the ones who forced ICON to drop the idea.  You know, the ICON basically caved with these women, which is one of these pressure groups.  I mean, I think that what would happen is that...  Phrase women.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like the way you phrased that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Concerned Women for America is the name of it.  So they are women.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think what you probably also see is that if...  And I think this is what the porn industry is worried about, is that if you really were  able to effectively get not all of it, but 90, 95% of the sites into XXX, there would  be ISPs whose entire business model was based on, we block it at the server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  You know, we...  You don't have to worry about it at home.  Great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I won't be buying it from them.  I'll try other people to get their access.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wouldn't bother you.  I don't have any interest in looking at it.  Yeah, they could probably filter it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm the only person involved in Twitter that has any pretty interested, deviant behavior.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nobody but you, Patrick, even thinks about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Whether any of us would or not, there's a lot of...  If I had kids at home that are...  I would definitely do that.  I would have no interest in having that.  See, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See, the last time I checked, any 13-year-old in the rabid throes of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're talking about 8-year-olds, not 13-year-olds, who happen to be confronted with something  that they're going to ask a lot of questions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, great.  Then all we got to do is shut down email, because think of all the crap that comes over  email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not on my system, I don't get spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The port industry is going to make the same amount of money, the same supply and demand  is going to be there.  It's not going to change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not even saying that, but I'm saying it's like, okay, that would be one set.  If there's a child at home, if they force him into a XXX domain, and you can filter  that out, that's okay.  Then you have to basically push everybody else on the planet off of the dot-coms and  the dot-nets.  Assume if you can figure out a legal way to do that without spending the next 20 years  going back and forth to the Supreme Court.  No, this is the problem.  The next thing is to figure out how to clean out all the email spam.  The next thing we got to do is we go after the double entendres.  The next thing we do is we go over cable television and broadcast television.  Am I or am I not?  At what point, is it softcore porn, is it hardcore porn, is it all-period sexual content?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you just think everything should be porn?  I think we should go back to 1950.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah, that's me.  They've got to take David and the Louvre, man.  But if you're watching cable television after-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, we're not talking about double entendres.  We're talking about XXX websites and maybe pushing these people over there over time.  No, they're not going to rush over there, and they'd be crazy if they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know.  Is it a nice idea?  Sure.  Should we have a XXX domain?  Is anybody going to give up their large profitable business on a dot-com domain to get forced  into triple X?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, you know, it's a start.  That's the way I see it.  It's better than sitting on your ass doing nothing, which is essentially what's been  going on.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's your point.  That's your point.  That's your point.  That's your point.  Other twist.  It's in the can.  Whatever.  Let's talk about PlayStation 3.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Woo-hoo.  No PlayStation 3 until at least November.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But when it comes, it's going to come with a 60-gig hard drive.  And Linux.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  See, when it comes ...  Xbox, everyone says it's going to be ... A lot of people say it's going to be better  than PlayStation ... I mean, than Xbox.  It's going to outsell Xbox.  Xbox is getting one hell of a head start right now.  Three letters.  Fah.  And a lot of people say the Xbox is really well-designed.  And then ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nobody seemed to actually program games for it, is the rumor.  I like the Xbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For the PS3 or the ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So the story is they're holding off on the release because they're not ready with the  Blu-ray yet.  Is that what I ...  That's not the story I heard.  The story I heard.  The story I heard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I hear that the Blu-ray is a convenient smoke screen for the incredible problems people  are having writing for the cell processor.  That Sony learned absolutely nothing about the programming debacle for the PS2, and they  did the same exact thing to their developer base with the PS3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not flabbergasted by any means.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, there's also rumors that they're trying to push it back until they can kind of reduce  the amount of cost per unit to an acceptable level so that people are ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's interesting.  They're saying the Blu-ray drives are going to be out what, June or July?  Blu-ray drives for computers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Toshiba is supposed to be the first one up the game.  I hear that Sony is going to be releasing Blu-ray to ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're talking about consumer electronics, standalone players.  I'm talking about in-writeable, burnable Blu-ray discs are going to be available.  Not too ... What is it?  Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think I have this story somewhere.  Drat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  $1,000 for the next generation DVD drives for computers would be about $1,000.  Sony Viope C with a Blu-ray drive for about $2,300.  That's pretty cool, actually.  They'll have 25 gigabyte ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What do we think?  Does anybody ... Let's take a poll.  How many people think Blu-ray is going to beat HD DVD?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have no idea.  I think they're going to be battling still a bit longer.  There's movie titles coming out from Sony for Blu-ray, and there are movie titles coming  out by ... Who's the company that's heading up HD DVD?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Warner Brothers Delayed is delayed indefinitely.  It's launched for the HD ... Toshiba's going to deliver HD DVD consumer electronics players  with no movies in the channel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because I hear rumors that there will be movies on Blu-ray.  Maybe this is common knowledge.  There'll be a lot of politics going on.  Starting in May.  Starting in May, they're releasing titles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what ... May 23rd is the launch date for Blu-ray, and they've got eight titles.  Most of them are Sony titles coming out on Blu-ray.  They were supposed to ... I guess the end of March was supposed to be the launch date  for HD DVD consumer electronics players.  Warner Brothers has pulled out indefinitely on the launch date.  Warner Brothers was supposed to have the disc for HD DVD, and they have been delayed indefinitely.  At least that was the word last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I still think all of this is going to build up to the fact that by the time one of them  wins, all we're going to be doing is downloading them anyway.  You know, it's an interesting ... Well, it's pretty big files.  Yeah, and they're big files, and they're ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And USA with our crappy bandwidth.  I don't see that happening anytime soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but you have Verizon starting to experiment with small towns doing fiber where you're  getting a thousand times the speed of DSL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they do a lot of experimenting, and nothing comes of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they have ... I think they have a vested interest in having those high-speed lines  go because what they want to do is deliver those movies.  They want to bypass the HD market.  They want to do all of those things, and there's a lot of money there for them to do it, and  they're trying to find a way to get beyond just you paying for the connection.  They've got to have you start buying stuff, or they're not going to survive.  And the way to get you to start buying it, if you look at Seoul, Korea, South Korea, you're  seeing people buy it, spend a lot of money on a lot of stuff online because it is screaming  fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, Kuduragi, the guy with the big guy in charge of PS3, or one of them, he specifically  said that it's being delayed, pushed back because of delays in developing copyright  protection technology for Blu-ray, which has an additional layer of copy protection, and  that and other technical problems with these cell processors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you think about the timeline here, Patrick's argument makes more sense because if they're  going to bring out the DVD consumer player, they should have these issues resolved already.  They're not going to be resolved.  I mean, if they're not resolved by the time they roll out the commercial product, they're  not going to be further resolved in November.  I don't know.  I think there's something to issue about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think those things are going to ... And I've heard this through a second person, but when  the original PlayStation launched, I guess the original unit cost for those things was  $900 each unit.  They were selling, I think, at the time, retail 300, so I mean, they were taking ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, this New York Times article says it thinks that Sony might be buying time to bring  down the production of half of these components, and that they ... Analysts say Sony would  probably try to sell the PS3 for about $500, which is ... And then when the PS2 came out,  it was $300, which is still, what, $100 more than the Xbox 360?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They turned in on IBM on delivering enough processors.  A large, complicated processor.  Yes.  And who else?  I think also the Rambas, right?  They don't build that in-house.  They buy it from a third-party source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a strange story in the register about HD DVD coming out with a region-free version  in Europe.  Did anybody see that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's because all the movies that you do want to watch in Europe don't come from  there.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Someone's going to send me a present letter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know who's going to send you anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So this PS3 is now going to include a 60-gigabyte drive, which apparently they announced last  week.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Should be fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, well.  So we can play Grand Prix.  I think Linux as well, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Linux operating software and the ability to handle high-speed Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, duh, of course.  Yeah, it's supposed to also be a broadband router.  I'm just reading the thing.  Oh, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hold on, hold on.  So they've only delayed the HD DVD releases to mid-April.  Three films in HD DVD format April 18, an additional 17 the following weeks instead  of releasing 50.  Why are the HD DVD players less expensive, it seems like, when they come out, they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  going to be retailing for less money than the Blu-ray.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're going to lose money on it.  That's why.  There's just a marketing scheme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, really?  And then, of course, if this PS3 is out, that Blu-ray player that it has in it is only less  than $500 then, and you get the rest of the computer that comes in the PS3.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess that's what Sony's hedging their bet on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, if there were a lot of movie titles and I don't care about playing games, I'd  still buy the PS3 if there were a lot of Blu-ray titles and I could watch them on that thing.  I'd buy it, independent of it being a video game player.  Well, it also depends on how much they street for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If it's street for $600, you're still going to be so hot to buy one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, because if I wanted a Blu-ray player, is he halfway interesting?  They'll be on the second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You just wait one year and the Blu-ray players will be $399.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They'll be $399 by Christmas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's going to be more fun games.  You're right.  I'm not buying one anytime soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'll be excited to have one because when DVDs came out, how much cooler were DVDs than  renting a DVD movie than a VHS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's because you lived in a part of the country where they actually had DVDs for rent.  And I think this is going to be bigger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't care if it's HD DVD or Blu-ray.  It's going to be a bigger difference watching these high definition movies.  Do you have an HD TV?  Do you have an HD TV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It depends on what story you're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right now, I don't.  But I'm saying, yeah, it takes more components to do it.  But I think the difference in watching and being able to see these movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Honestly, I think most of this country is probably going to sit on their ass when that  stuff comes out.  Because people don't want to, I mean, that's a large chunk of change to upgrade your home  theater, especially if you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we've got a couple thousand for a TV.  We've got 500 to a thousand for an HD DVD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it's just expensive.  I mean, you know, I think people would rather spend their money on things like that count,  like electricity, power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How do you really get a good torrent to food to boot like these movies?  Car with enough gas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mortgage payments.  Mortgage payments.  Alimony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's amazing.  They're selling a huge number of huge number of HD televisions are being sold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think anybody wants to spend their money on alimony.  No one wants to, but the crowd forces you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Roger still deal with all those child support payments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So long ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And depressing news, the team that built Katamari Damacy, Nehart Katamari and My My Katamari  has dissolved.  You know, I never mean there will be no sequels to the games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I never realized this until I went to Chicago to do a thing for GameSpot at the, you know,  was it the Museum of Science and Industry?  They had this little traveling video game exhibit that Katamari Damacy was actually  created as kind of a college project.  It wasn't, you know, initially designed as a commercial product, but it became such  a hit that they published it as such and made a couple of sequels.  That's how Apple started, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a couple of guys screwing around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, one guy screwing around, the other guy going to other people.  Hey, you want to buy this, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's how Microsoft started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's how the podcast started.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yahoo launches local news.  What?  Yep.  Where are they going to get their feeds from?  That's a really good question.  Where'd that story, I didn't see that story.  That's good.  Ooh, I wonder if the Guardian.  Location specific URLs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you could go anywhere and just look at the local news through Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Unfortunately, for some reason, I'm getting Madison area news.  Let me change my location.  Madison, Wisconsin.  Apparently.  Hold on, I'm changing my location now.  Where did you take us, Alex?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're this little kid that quote unquote hacked the news.google.com by figuring out  how they tries to aggregate press releases and he created a press release that said,  I'm the youngest employee hired by Google and he made it very official speak and made  quotes by.  Official speak.  You know.  It's like news speak.  You got to leave quotes from the CEO and the CTO and someone.  And all of a sudden it gets picked up by Google news as a press release and they start feeling  stuff and Google didn't quite know at first, to the best of my knowledge, whether or not  it was true and this kid starts getting calls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that story came out.  It was awesome.  It was pretty funny.  We'll pay you three times as much.  That kid is a marketing genius.  We should track him down and use him for something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The kinder website should hire him.  I know, right?  They can solve all their problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Yahoo's local news, they list basically stories from the local newspapers.  Not much of a big deal.  No, it's kind of cool if you want like your area stuff.  I want to know what happened on my stream yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you know, Google bought rightly, which is that online word processor we talked about  on the show some weeks ago.  And now it looks like their next target probably is going to be an online spreadsheet.  There's a couple out there already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm starting to think who are the people that did the Java based office suite that never  come anywhere?  There's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know that.  I don't know.  I mean, I know that at one time, Coralix and Patrick start typing seriously.  I don't have the internet.  What the hell?  Oh, you know, it's too bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought you I thought you were set up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is anybody excited about the next generation of office?  I'll use my brain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I think it's his machine that was interfering with it.  He's got something wrong with his.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I can connect to his via infrared.  I've been hacking into this.  This is just leaking, you know, draining.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Still all his MP3s.  iRose is the one that seems to be a fairly decent one.  iRose.com.  I have an open review.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's not Irish Rose consulting, is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So do you have to be online to access your documents then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, of course, I haven't played with this one, but it seems as though they have some  sort of an offline thing you can do.  A download component?  I guess yes.  It's not iRose.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I-W-R-O-S.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  R-R-O-W.  I-R-O-W-S.  iRose.com.  Was it iRoe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Irish Rose consulting is iRose.com.  Who needs this stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  People that use dumb terminals?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it's not iRose.  iRose.  Data management matters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know, but when you said that originally, I thought you said Rose R-O-S-E.  Oh, I see, yeah.  By any other name would smell just as sweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I like keeping doing stuff online, but I'll just use OpenOffice and archive this stuff  on an online drive if I want to access it somewhere else.  Why use a spreadsheet online?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what people say.  They say it's crazy.  Well, we start talking about online office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This gets back into this judge orders Gmail disclosure.  So in a lawsuit brought by the Federal Trade Admin, this is on CNET, by the FTC, a subpoena  is sent to Google for the complete contents of a Gmail account, including deleted email  messages.  This is unrelated to the subpoena that Google had for the other stuff.  So this is, you know, we want your Gmail, even the, because you don't know when, if  you delete it, if I delete it on my drive, I have some sense of when it's, when it was  deleted.  Right.  When you delete it online, it may be sitting there for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So same thing applies to Yahoo and Hotmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So if somebody does their spreadsheets online, there's a possibility exists that you can  be open for investigation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, if you don't have full control over it, you can never be sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but the thing is, I mean, you know, even if you are, do you have full control  over it?  How hard is it to, you know, if the federal government comes in and hits your ISP with  a subpoena or hits you with a subpoena.  Same thing.  You know, you get a choice between a contempt of court for modifying the log files or disappearing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  underground across the border.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the question is, for a lot of those ISPs, for a lot of those ISPs, I mean, they, we  talked about this before, they delete most of that stuff just out of storage.  I mean, you know, just for storage reasons, they don't keep that stuff around.  They don't keep your log files around.  I mean, they keep them around for some period of time, but not, but a very fairly short  because when they have, when you have thousands of subscribers generating.  It's a couple of months, right?  I think it's, what I heard was a couple of weeks, you know, and after that it's gone  because they just don't have the time to, I mean, they don't have the storage, they're  not going to expend storage on it.  Yeah, well, the only thing it would open them up to is having the government talk to them  all the time.  So why bother?  Unless they're forced to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, the guy who did that, you know, the company.com guy, PUD, he would just erase  everything instantly.  And you know, there's all kinds of slander and libel on that site.  And it's just like, you couldn't track any of it.  And he managed to keep that site up for a really long time.  There's the DOD wipe and the PUD wipe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The PUD wipe was apparently pretty good, I guess, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But he did the, you know, it was a weird situation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I remember that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I think, I think that that used to be very popular with the ZDTV folks because there  was all kinds of, there was a bunch of creepy guys that apparently that worked at Tech TV  that were posting all kinds of weird stuff.  And it was all on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Also, we were all there when like the dot com boom kind of was nearing its end.  And so like this company had stuff about all these dying dot com companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can I point out that every time you guys say that, that Alex has to go in and bleep that out.  Oh, should we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, you do it.  We've only said it twice.  Had 102 and 103.  I said three times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, FC now has Personals.  FC?  It does?  Delete Exploitive Company has Personals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It does.  Now does it have the same sort of style as the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't know, don't want to know.  I just noticed it there on the page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm poor and broke looking for someone else who's poor and broke.  I mean...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So we got anything else before we finish?  We're almost done?  Almost.  As far as I'm concerned.  Oh man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anybody been playing around with the live dot com?  The Microsoft thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I haven't.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not going to play.  It doesn't work on my Mac.  Actually, it'll work on Firefox on the Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It just doesn't work on Safari on the Mac.  I've got to try it.  Safari's terrible.  Safari, yes.  Safari has issues.  The other thing I thought was funny is Verizon and T-Mobile.  JD Powers did a call quality survey.  Verizon and T-Mobile got the ratings for the clearest crawls across the country and Singular  has trouble making connections off of a survey of roughly 24,000 wireless users.  I thought that was pretty funny.  Verizon had the best service in the Mid-Atlantic and the Southeast.  T-Mobile ranked highest in the Southwest and West.  And US Cellular did best in Illinois, Wisconsin, Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Spottily.  I mean, everyone that has Verizon around here complains bitterly about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Verizon just wouldn't...  When we moved into our new house, Verizon just wouldn't work in our house in the surrounding  three blocks.  It was the most bizarre thing I've ever run into.  So we ended up having to just dump it.  It is a normal...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I've been to Patrick's place.  He's got aluminum foil up everywhere for some reason.  He wears a hat.  Even outside with no hat on.  It's a baseball cap.  It's inside the baseball cap that he stuffs the aluminum foil.  So it looks pretty normal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, man.  Don't diss the safety hat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What I find is funny is that the places that you would think would use it the most, I mean,  with all of this stuff, in San Francisco...  I couldn't figure out what was wrong with my Bluetooth, my little Bluetooth headset for  my trio.  And in San Francisco, so I'm walking around and it's always messed up and everything else.  And of course, I go to Pennsylvania to visit my family.  And it works perfectly.  Clear as a bell.  You know, it was just the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, what's interesting, right, is one of the things that I found out from Sasha Sagan,  who does all the cell phone interviews at PCMag, is one of the things, basically, if  you look for the company that had...  Basically, each of the R-Box essentially got first hit on the lower frequency signals,  which penetrate better, which have better signal...  What do you call it when signals travel?  It goes through the walls better.  Propagation.  And so basically, the R-Box got the good signal frequencies in every area.  And then everybody who came in later got the not so good, the higher frequencies.  So whoever is...  Whoever basically, you go to the area of, you know, if you're in the south, you end  up with...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nothing's been as good as those old analog cell phones.  Man, those things sounded great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they still sound great for a lot of people who live in the sticks.  But 2007, they're phasing out all the analog cell phones.  Yeah, well, because they're not efficient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Smoke signals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's like basically all the older vendors.  I guess, would it be Verizon in New York?  Was Verizon started by 9X?  It all bleeds together after a while.  It's all slowly going back together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's all becoming AT&T again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I know.  AT&T got broken up, and now it's like bigger than it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like Terminator 3.  It just keeps coming back.  Whatever you do, it just keeps reforming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is that what Arnold Schwarzenegger is going to do as soon as he loses the next Star of  the Cell Phone Company?  He's going to go back and do Terminator 4.  Might as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why is it that a robot can age?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did I just make a prediction?  Uh-oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You want to talk about who's running for president in 2008?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's not running for president.  The more likely it is George Bush will go for a third term.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's going to be Hillary Clinton versus somebody.  All right, stop.  Just don't even go there.  No politics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can tell you, I'll do one political thing.  I'm going to tell you right now.  It's going to be McCain and Giuliani.  That's your ticket.  McCain?  Unbeatable.  Unbeatable.  The Democrats can't beat it.  The Republicans can't beat it.  That's your ticket.  You heard it here first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sitting there thinking like, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But to say it's too smart, it wouldn't work.  It's a done deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it's already a done deal.  That's where McCain's got up all these years.  So a mixed ticket like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'll do another mixed ticket.  All right, all right, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, let's get back to tech.  We're almost done.  We're almost done.  Politics and porn right up there.  You want to do it?  You want to finish?  We could do it as a, we've got to do it as the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Someone printed a bunch of porn euros and they were passing them off and I guess half  these countries-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, it's-  Go check it out.  It's very funny.  I would.  I have no internet.  taking them as real money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So he made this porn look like a euro note?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I'll show you.  It's really funny.  It's quite humorous actually.  Wow.  www.dvorak.org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  One of these vendors sees this and is like, I don't recognize this.  Oh, it's a new one that hasn't been distributed yet.  And so the news magazine stand guy is like, oh, okay.  It's a 600 note so it gives out 500 some odd euros in change, which is probably about six,  700 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's the 300 euro note.  It's got a couple of strippers on it.  It's quite humorous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow, I can attest to it.  It is quite humorous.  Although it is kind of aliased around the you know what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm shielding my eyes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It belongs to the XXX.  Yeah, I think it's a dot XXX.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  They don't look at it?  I mean, I don't know.  It's colorful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It has a watermark.  It looks like Monopoly money.  I don't know.  I think they made a fake one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually Monopoly money looks like that.  I would have played Monopoly a lot more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The kicker gag is where they have, you know, the European Union thing with the circle of  stars.  It's the same stars, but they're in the form of a heart.  Yeah.
