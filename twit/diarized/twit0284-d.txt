Transcript:  So I'm doing what you were doing, Leo.  I'm trying to lose weight and using Twitter to do it.  I set up an account called 50 pounds by June, and that's my goal.  And I'm trying to lose 50 pounds.  I tweet my weight every day and sometimes what I'm eating and kind of the struggles  of trying to find the food I want and it's work and I'm losing weight.  Yeah. Make it Twitter. Keep it honest.

Transcript:  Public accountability is one of the most powerful psychological tricks you can use for that.  They have done experiments where they make people...  It's called shame.  Yeah. Well, it's that social proof.  You want to be consistent with what you've said in the past.  And if you do it in public, that kind of pledge really works.

Start time: 214.28
End time: 221.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Transcript:  Photoshop your picture and lie.  We talked a little bit before the show, but I think I should mention that  Gina has never been on Twitter before, not through any fault of my own.  I've been trying to get her on the show since 2005.  She is my old friend, my co-host from radio, my co-author of my first book,  my co-host of my first TV show, former ABC technology correspondent,  former CEO of Nick Computing, author of I Was, Steve Wozniak's autobiography,  co-author, I guess I should say.  And currently she's starting up Byte Magazine, Byte.com.  That is so huge. I feel so small. Reincarnating that old lady.  She is a witch of the first order.  Gina Smith, so good to see you again.  I missed you at CES. We missed each other.  It's just been ages.

Start time: 284.38
End time: 292.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It has been ages. You and I hosted a radio show together.  We saw each other every Sunday for so many years.  And my life has been, well, there's been a vacuum in my life.

Start time: 294.25
End time: 316.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, dear. And so it begins.  And now I feel fulfilled.  Good. Well, so good.  Thanks for having me.  Thank you for being on.  And I think in your capacity as editor in chief of Byte Magazine,  I hope you'll come back more.  And maybe we should talk about a Byte podcast because that would be fun.  Maybe you and Jerry and John and we could just do a Byte show would be really fun.

Start time: 317.06

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Could there be a section of the podcast where they just say aloud  all the lines to a basic program for you to type in at home?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Go to twenty.  Go to twenty. That would be fun.  That would be hilarious.  I used to, it was Compute Magazine that would always have those basic codes.

Start time: 333.82
End time: 355.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I remember I used to get, I think it was Enter Magazine.  It was the kids version that eventually got folded into 321 Contact.  I mean, I remember my parents spent hours and hours typing in.  Such a pain in the ass.  But it was so rewarding.  I mean, those are the magic days, man.  You had an incredible gizmo that you could program  and then going in there and changing little things.  So the words instead of the end, I had to say, you suck, you know, it was awesome.

Start time: 355.34
End time: 363.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But let me ask you, because I was talking to Richard Hart, who you all know.  He hosted The Next Step and before that CNET Television.

Start time: 363.62
End time: 366.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I hosted a show with Richard Hart on CNET.  Well, there you go.

Start time: 367.90
End time: 396.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And he's now teaching television production at the Academy of Art in San Francisco.  And I said, oh, that must be great, Richard.  I saw him at Showstoppers to see us.  That must be great.  You get to talk to kids who are really into technology, really understanding.  He said, you know, you'd be surprised.  Kids today, they don't have the wonder that we had growing up.  They never typed in any basic code.  They don't see technology as something unusual or exciting or magical.  For them, it's commonplace.  And so they don't have the same deep understanding that we had to have.

Start time: 397.38
End time: 409.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  I think they get the same wonder for playing with the technology.  I mean, you see that.  I mean, just on something as rudimentary as YouTube, people really enjoy trying to...  Well, it's different, isn't it?

Start time: 409.32
End time: 415.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Instead of knowing a command line or how to format a disk, they know how to edit video.  Yeah, exactly.

Start time: 415.44
End time: 430.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They know how to tell complicated stories and they know how to write these tutorials  for each other.  For them, it's like it's the wonder of like, holy crap, I got 30,000 people checking out  my shooting a gun tutorial.  And then that, I mean, how advanced is that over, you know, 10, go to 20 from back in  our day?

Start time: 430.94
End time: 456.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Brian, this is such a really excellent point because I guess in our generation, when  we were doing this, we were talking about, you know, the technology and the newer generation  who was giving trophies, whether or not they, you know, were on the team or not, was always  told you're great, you're great, you won, even if you lost.  This generation coming up, it's all about me, you know, I mean, meaning it's all about  them.  So the most interesting thing for them is, you know, I want to, I want to, I want to

Start time: 458.10
End time: 470.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  rampage.  And that's a good point too.  In our day, you could win a regional trophy for your T-ball skills.  Nowadays, if you want to tell a story on the internet, you are competing with the entire  globe.  Oh, it's a little tougher.  It's, I think it's fascinating.

Start time: 470.44
End time: 477.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a little tougher.  You've got, you've got angry orange to compete with.  It's not easy.  Exactly.  Is it talking orange?  It could, you know, whoop your butt.  Whip your...

Start time: 478.09
End time: 478.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I knew it could whip mine.

Start time: 479.95
End time: 515.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess, I guess, I guess here's my question.  There's always been a percentage of people interested in this stuff.  I just, and so there's certainly are still kids who know how to format a hard drive and  they all listen to this show.  So they're mad as hell at me for saying that right now.  And I'm sure that there's, I'm sure there's plenty of kids out there who, you know, are  deeply interested and enthusiastic about technology.  But I just wonder if the percentage is different.  I wonder if, I mean, really, if you grow up with this stuff, we weren't, you know, there  was no wonder in the television set for our, for our...  Exactly.  I get so excited about it, as I'm sure my parents did.

Start time: 516.34
End time: 526.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Except I think there's always a group of people who want to know how it works.  There's always going to be that.  Right.  They want to dive in and they want to figure out how it works.  And those are the ones who end up making it work better later.

Start time: 526.44
End time: 533.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  And thank goodness, because if that weren't the case, it'd be idiocracy.  We'd be all sitting here with technology.  Nobody knew how to use or fix or improve.  Well, there's that too.

Start time: 534.26
End time: 535.27

Start time: 536.16
End time: 537.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's still, that's here too.

Start time: 537.74
End time: 555.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's important also to acknowledge the difference between the dumbing down of  society and the segment, the fragmentation of our knowledge base.  Right?  There are kids out there who don't know how to defrag a hard drive, but they are experiencing  the joy of having written their own app for the app store.  You know, they don't understand proper maintenance of their computer, but they...  That's something I'll never get around to doing.

Start time: 555.64
End time: 557.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll give you that.  That's absolutely true.

Start time: 557.86
End time: 579.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but I'll tell you something just to add to this and back to memory, Lanelea, you  and I were once in a hotel room and we had never seen the web before.  hotel room in Vegas and said, here is the first web page on the internet because before  that there was no web.  And you and I looked at each other and said, should we buy up all the web names?  No, that wouldn't be...

Start time: 579.54
End time: 586.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, wasn't that stupid of us?  We sat here.  We could have bought sex.com.  We could have bought tv.com.

Start time: 588.18
End time: 594.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All of it.  We decided not to because it wouldn't be ethical as journalists.  Ethics before the...

Start time: 594.54
End time: 610.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ethics smashed the fix.  This show has ended up being a saga of missed opportunities.  We were talking before the show began about how both Jean and I got offered 10,000 shares  of CNET stock for 10 grand when we first consulted for them and there was only two guys doing  it and we both said, nah.

Start time: 611.38
End time: 613.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We took the money instead of the stock.

Start time: 613.34
End time: 619.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, that was the last time I listened to Dvorak.  That's when he said, nah, they're never going anywhere.  Their history.

Transcript:  Me too.

Start time: 622.00
End time: 631.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't listen to him as a rule now as a result of that.  He also said the same thing when Apple stock dived.  Don't buy Apple stock.  Apple's dead.

Start time: 632.98
End time: 654.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On the day that Apple went public, I bought 10 shares and kept it for like three or four  years and at one point shortly after they went public, it started to go down.  I think I bought it at like 25 and it went down to like 21 and 19 and I thought, oh,  I better get rid of this turkey.  And I did.  And I went back and looked the other day.

Start time: 654.54
End time: 658.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, Apple could never really, I mean, okay, man, what did you lose?  It couldn't have possibly gone over $35, could it?

Start time: 659.96
End time: 669.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, well, it didn't.  But if I had held on to it, it would be worth it.  I wouldn't be sitting here talking to you.  Let's put it that way.

Start time: 669.70
End time: 673.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I see.  So obviously you get some money and you're too good for Leo Laporte.  Oh, excuse me.

Start time: 673.78
End time: 677.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, so you're only in it for the money.  He's getting those $20.

Start time: 678.16
End time: 679.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was in it for the money.

Start time: 679.14
End time: 702.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Boy, are you on the wrong show.  Holy cow.  Holy cow.  He's in it for the money, folks.  Actually this show, you're not in it for the money because I have no idea what the commercials  are and my entire staff is in New York City.  So no commercials.  I'm announcing it.  It's a commercial free tweet.  And apparently I've got the number wrong too.  Is it 284?  That's what the docs says.

Start time: 704.26
End time: 708.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Could be a holdover.  Although you know what?  Actually, I'm looking at the doc.  It jumps from 284 to 282 to 279.

Start time: 710.50
End time: 729.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have no idea.  Let's talk about tech.  You know, it's funny.  We all were at CES.  And I guess it would be appropriate, apropos at this time, to ask each and every one of  you, now that you've had a week to decompress, what your impressions were of this year's  Consumer Electronics Show.  Let's start with Schwud.

Start time: 729.78
End time: 762.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As you know, this is my first CES and I'm betting this is a surprise only to me and  that it's a surprise to no one else.  The most exciting thing about actually going to CES is meeting in meet space with all these  other names that you only know by reputation and over Skype.  That overshadowed all the...  I thought all the major announcements were kind of a snore.  It was all 3D social media tablets.  Some of my favorite stuff came from these small cheap booths in the back.  As I've already said before, my favorite thing is the speakers that screw into your light  socket that are powered.  That was a cool product that I didn't see.

Start time: 762.22
End time: 764.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If it weren't for you, I would not have known about it.

Start time: 764.36
End time: 790.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's just novel.  It's that old school ingenuity that I enjoyed, but it's an amazing experience.  I really look forward to going back and experiencing again.  I wonder how long so many products are going to stay under just one umbrella.  It really was like five shows in one.  You had an auto show in one hall.  You had a small clever electronic show in another hall.  You had a little bit of game stuff in another hall.  It's almost too big of an idea now for me.

Start time: 791.12
End time: 821.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, Gina, I think you will vouch for this.  Gina popped my cherry.  You took me to Las Vegas for the first time and Comdex.  It wasn't CES.  Yeah, I think we've been in 90,000 of them.  Yeah, you've been to them all.  But that was exactly my experience.  It was like I'm seeing and meeting all these people that I only see.  But now it's Twitter and Facebook.  But at the time it was writers from PC Magazine and other magazines.  It was so exciting.

Start time: 823.08
End time: 851.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think for information, we can bite.com this time.  This was the first time I didn't get to go to parties or schmooze or see the people,  like you just said.  We actually took 60, 70, 80 video demos of stuff on the floor.  We worked constantly inside a ton of stuff.  And you're right, it was all about tablets.  It was all about auto tech.  But I saw this thing, this invent this inventor had this kinetically charged device.  It kind of looked like an up like a vertical.  I have it.

Start time: 851.46

Start time: 859.84
End time: 878.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The jiggling up and down harnesses the kinetic energy and you just walk around the block  and you can plug in your iPhone.  How cool is that?  The inventor came up with the idea while he was hiking the Appalachian Trail and walk,  walk, walk, he thought, how can I harness this energy?  And he's patented that thing up.  I think that's going to be huge.

Start time: 878.16

Start time: 885.50
End time: 898.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, you know, it's funny because their suite was on the same floor as my hotel room and  I walked by that suite every day of the week.  And did I ever go in and you know why I didn't go in Gina Smith?  Because it's freaking Real Networks.

Start time: 916.80
End time: 921.18

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right.  Right.  So all the well, except for Jive software went down yesterday and like the whole world  went down.  What went down?  What went down?  Jive software, which Jive software, which powers the Wikis at like giant corporations  when I work.  Oh, dear.  So yeah, what could go down?  Clouds can go down.  But Unifi was interesting.  You can upload all your photos, videos and music up into the cloud and then download  them to any device for they said between five and ten dollars a month.  They announced in March.

Start time: 981.98
End time: 991.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And plus one that is generally viewed with skepticism and dislike.  You know, it seems like why not launch a new brand?  I don't understand the importance of why.  Why tie real to this idea?

Start time: 991.40
End time: 1012.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have they're casting about for relevance is what they're doing.  They're trying to find something that makes them relevant after they no longer are.  And this is tangentially related to it.  I mean, it's music, it's audio.  So it's tangentially related.  What I want to know is that sounds an awful lot like the original incarnation of MP3.com.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Shut down by the music labels.

Start time: 1012.54
End time: 1016.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, because they'll be you will upload your commercial music and then you can play it

Start time: 1016.82
End time: 1018.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  anywhere that was the difference with MP3.com.

Start time: 1019.56
End time: 1060.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If I remember the original scheme with MP3.com happened at a time when bandwidth was so tight  that you didn't want to actually have to upload your music to MP3.com.  So instead, what you could do is the scheme that got them in trouble is your physical  media disc.  It would read the Red Book audio data.  It would realize this is definitely a copy of Tones on Tail from 1982.  And it would say you now have access to that album on ours.  So but since it wasn't technically you ripping your own CD and then uploading it to them,  it was technically them making available to you a copy of the music that you did not  purchase.  And then even though it's the exact same data, all the same digital bits, they nailed them  on that.  And that's how it got shut down as I understood it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I skipped last year.  I didn't go in 2010.  I skipped last year and I went again this year and it had the whiff to me of Comdex.  I was at the last Comdex before it imploded and it's too big.  I think that it's gotten to the point where it's almost it's very difficult to get  anything done if you are certainly there by yourself.  And if you have a team, you know, it's hugely expensive.  So I'm not sure how long it's going to survive.  I'll say a Dvorak thing and I like CES is domed.  Really? It was the biggest CES ever.

Start time: 1343.48

And now that said, there were some cool things that the I think people are not  quite getting how big Android tablets are going to be.  I'm a big iPad fan, but having seen kind of what's coming and both  what was there in the hopper.  I think, yeah, they're everywhere and they're good.  And I think that you're going to see kind of a fundamental change  in the way the masses do computing and it's not going to come from Apple.  I think it's going to ultimately come from Android.  And again, I love the iPad, but I think what's happening to the iPhone  is going to easily happen to to the iPad.  And I also loved in terms of just the coolest little thing was this little ball  toy called Sphero.  I love Sphero.  Sphero was awesome.  It's a little ball that's controlled by an iPhone or Android app.  And you drive the ball around on the floor.  A friend of mine called it a hundred and one ways to drive a cat insane.  And and I want a Sphero just has no point at all.  None at all. It glows and it bobbles around.  And I just want it just because I want it.

Transcript:  Can I can I just say real quick, I think Dwight is dead on the money  because of a complaint that I heard actually on the panel saying that CES  has become the worst possible time to make any kind of announcement  because there is so much it gets lost in the shuffle.  And that's when you're losing money on the table.  And I don't see if it is to survive.  I think it would behoove them to do a South by Southwest thing  where a few days of track one, a few days of track two and a few days  of track three, where you actually expand it, maybe reduce the size  of the show floor, but rotate out the stock over time.  So you get more announcements of greater significance  that can be heard by more people over a longer period of time.

Start time: 1455.96
End time: 1468.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, Brian, that's dead on.  I mean, I think that's why CES this year did showstoppers  an evening event where they showed a bunch of stuff  that you might not have gotten to in the floor.  Good stuff like that thing with the balls.  Digital experience. I mean, there were.

Start time: 1470.16
End time: 1500.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They've always had those.  They do those every year. Everybody's always done.  I disagree with you guys 100 percent.  I think that for one thing, because there's five thousand press there.  Yes, you're right. A lot of the releases get buried.  But if you have a big release, it's a it's a huge opportunity.  So because the attention is there and if you can manage to be one of the,  say, the top five announcements at CES,  you're going to get a lot of attention from that five thousand press.  I think there's something to be said for that.  I don't know. I think CES felt vital, exciting.  It felt like it was really a happening place.

Start time: 1500.80

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They didn't do that during CES and they could have.  They could have done that during CES.  But, you know, Apple didn't want to do it.  And I think Apple's got the right approach there.  And I just think that no matter what you do in terms of a large  announcement, you're going to get press whether there's five thousand people

End time: 1557.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  sitting in one room or not. Yeah. All right. All right. All right.  But I don't I don't think it's going anywhere.  I think that remember the main point of CES is dealers come to meet the vendors  so that they can order for the next year.  There's certainly a need for that.  The reason a lot of trade shows have gone under is because the Internet  certainly is a better place for disseminating information, finding out facts.  You don't really need trade shows unless, you know,  well, it's the spectacle of it. I just think it's really fun.

That was actually the big story of CES and it happened the next week.  Yeah, that's right. Or the fact that it wasn't announced.  I'll tell you another.  There was another big story at CES, and it has to do a little bit  with our sponsor, the folks at Ford.  Ford chose to announce its electric focus, not at CES,  not at the Detroit Auto Show, which is going on right now, but at CES.  It's interesting.  They announced a new car at a consumer electronics show.

Is he going to get it? No, no.  Here's the deal.  We had a little contest for a little contest to send listeners to Madrid  to test drive the Ford Focus.  And it turns out that that test drive at the National Testing Center  in Madrid, Spain, is the is the day before I get back from my trip  to South America. I can't go.  I'm in Machu Picchu that day.

I'm going to go.  That's nice. That's nice.  He has a little life.  Anyway, I'm glad because we have a number of listeners  who are going to Madrid to test drive the Ford Focus.  It's exciting.  And each of them will ten thousand dollars for their charity of choice.  We'll talk a little bit about who those winners are in a little bit.

And can I tell you what my next car is?  It's a Ford Focus electric.  In fact, I'm so excited.  I got to sit in the Ford Focus.  The electric is going to be a while before it's out.  I think it's next year.  The Focus, though, is an incredible car.  They're going to have gas.  They're going to have hybrid.  They're going to have plug in hybrid.  They're going to have diesel and they're going to have electric.  Same essential body worldwide.  And I was talking to Alan Mulally, the CEO of Ford, watch that, by the way,  we have it on the special stream.  And he said, and I thought this is very cool.  They're building a single assembly line that can do all five versions of the focus.  This is this solves the conundrum, you know, of building electric cars,  because the car company say, well, we got to wait till demand.  There's no demand till the cars are out there and people have the charge reports.  They solved it.  They can now build them as demand increases.  They build as many as necessary.

But I'll tell you, I have been a Ford family ever since I got that Mustang  a couple of years ago. I love it.  I can't wait. My next card is a Ford Focus lithium ion batteries,  higher capacity than the Ford hybrid electric and plug in hybrid batteries.  You plug it into an electric outlet, your standard 120 volt.  But if you've got the 240 and they're going to have Best Buy, by the way,  the Geek Squad's will come and install this.  They actually did a deal with Best Buy to make it very simple  to get that electricity in there.  Get this three hour charging, three hour charge.  They're not talking about range yet, but the range will be absolutely  comparable with everybody else, which makes me, you know,  probably 40 miles, which is I can't wait.  And the thing is, I can go to San Francisco.  I wouldn't be able to get back unless there's civic urban chargers everywhere.  And I think that that's the next big thing is you're going to see GE  had some beautiful chargers that they were demonstrating  that cities are putting in everywhere.  I think this car is going to power an electric revolution in this country.  I'm very excited about it.  And of course, yes, the Ford sync with my Ford Touch is in there.  Not only can you control your music, make hands free calls,  of course, the 911 alerts and all of that.  But you also can do battery management via voice as you're driving.  They have an iPhone, an Android app that you can check your battery.  You can see how it's charging.  You turn on charging later when it's cheaper.  This is so sophisticated.  The sync now understands Alan told me more than 10,000 commands.  Wow. Wow.  I think you stay connected by keeping your eyes on the road, your hands on the wheel.  We thank Ford for supporting our coverage of CES.  I couldn't be more excited about where Ford is going with their electric vehicles.  That was to me a big announcement at CES that they could have made.  There was a logical place to make.  I mean, there's a reason why they did it at CES.  Maybe it's just to let to telegraph that, hey, we understand  this is consumer electronics as much as a vehicle.  But I don't think I don't think CES is obsolete.  And I would hate to see it go away because I'll tell you what, we have a lot of fun.

Stitcher allows you to stitch together podcasts like this very podcast  in a row or NPR News or whatever you want to listen to as long as you can  download it and you listen to or stream it and you listen to a Stitcher.  That kills talk radio. I think this kills broadcast radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's what I think with Pandora.  I think it absolutely enhances radio from a consumer standpoint.  You get a better radio experience from a consumer standpoint,  but it does kill radio as far as a collective consciousness experience.  There are certain songs.

Start time: 2145.90
End time: 2163.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yes. Yeah. But like specifically, there are certain songs that we all know.  Even if we all hate that song, we all know it because the radio played it to death.  Never going to give you and it doesn't.  And that's not going to happen anymore.  It's you down with Pandora.  Never going to want to hear you sing the rest of the song.  We may make a mashup.

Transcript:  So so I don't think I don't think radio is going to go away.  Mainly because for one reason, in most cases,  even if the programming is done, you know, collectively,  nationally by a corporation, it's really pretty local.  And Pandora is not local.  People listen to it.  They have an affinity with their local radio station.  And it's it's similar to what I think newspapers are trying to do  where they're trying to intensely localize everything because that's the strength.  And I think that radio broadcast radio will continue,  maybe not as a collective place to hear the songs we're all listening to.  But I think it'll be kind of a community thing.

Start time: 2222.92

Transcript:  You know, I grew up in the days of what they called full service radio  was was hyper local.  You talk about the, you know, the dog show, the, you know,  you'd have classified ads on.  And I love that kind of old school radio.  That's coming back, which has died out. Yeah.  But you know, it's interesting, Dwight, is that  the slices aren't just geographic.  There's also, for instance, I think we're hyper local  in that sense for tech enthusiasts, right?

Transcript:  So in a way we are doing it, even though  Twitter is global in the most extreme sense, you know, more than  a third of our audience is international.  We are local in the sense that we're, you know,  a tight little group of people with a very specific interest,  which we hyper serve.  That's what local radio is.  It turns out, you know, for news, you might care more about  what's going on down the street.  But when it comes to computers or something out, you know,  whatever it is, Pez dispensers, local for you.  What are you laughing?  Gina, are you a Pez dispenser collector?

End time: 2315.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a particular kind of niche that applies to a certain kind of thing.  But I think there are many niches and not just the local niche.  And that's the point I'm making in that Pandora and other Internet  services can serve non-local niches.  You're right. They can't be local.  But there's plenty of other niches like our niche.

I thought this was a great rumor that Rupert Murdoch would join Steve Jobs  on the stage at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art next week  to announce their iPad daily.  Somebody said somebody said, boy, how appropriate to introduce.  I think it was Jeff Jarvis said, how appropriate to introduce the daily in a museum.  Jeff is funny.  Jeff Jeff was right on on that.

Transcript:  Well, also, also the jobs or Apple supposedly is telling publishers  that they're not going to allow them to offer free subscriptions  to the iPad app to their print subscribers, which is what  newspaper publishers really want.  They want to be able to bundle it. Sure.  And they're not going to let them do that.

Start time: 2422.86
End time: 2448.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know that. I mean, in the short term, I hate that because, of course,  I want anything free.  But I think it may be very forward thinking in that they're saying  what people want is the experience of reading the article.  What's so great about the fact that they happen to be printed on dead trees?  And they're trying to cut out that that they're trying to preserve  the value of the content as what you really want.  And you don't get the content for free because you're buying the dead paper.  You've got you just buy the content is that what Apple wants.

Start time: 2448.30
End time: 2459.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What Apple wants is not so much that they're after their 30 percent.  If people don't spend for the iPad app and they get it free,  Apple doesn't get its cut.  So that's a it's a financial argument for them.

There's a difference between what everyone says they're going to do  and what they're going to do.  I believe 23 percent say they're going to switch or say they really  hate the current situation. They won't. They won't.

If you're in a family plan, it's kind of difficult to switch  because you end up losing that connection between your family for free voice calls.  You I think it's a lot harder to jump away.  I think over time you may see a lot of defections,  but you're not going to see a lot of defections with this phone.  I think a lot of people will also wait for iPhone 5.

Transcript:  Well, that's the question I've been asking my radio listeners is, OK,  you're on Verizon. You've been waiting for a year.  You've heard the rumors for a year.  You've been dying for an iPhone.  Yay. Or in the words of John Oliver of The Daily Show, F.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you know what's funny is that Andy Anacko, MacBreak Weekly, was at this event  and he said it was very strange.  We're all sitting there quietly waiting for Verizon to come on stage  and somebody all of a sudden jumps up and goes, F.  Yeah. And everybody looks over and it's John Oliver with the cameras.  And obviously they're pre taping this reaction.  Oh, that's hilarious.  And then he says and then he does it again.  Obviously, they wanted a second angle, as anybody who's worked on TV  knows this was all fake.  And then, of course, they cut it appropriately because they put the F.  Yeah. Right after the announcement.  That's awesome. I know. I love I love the daily.  It's the greatest TV show in the world.

Start time: 2739.02
End time: 2753.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And anyway, it's totally ruined the ambiance, the announcement.  You know, Verizon tried to have this little jazz music going on.  The guys.  Oh, yeah.  It was great that they just destroyed the ambiance.  So I was like, that's John Oliver right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In any event, my point is that there are a lot of Verizon  owners who have, you know, for a year been dying for this to happen.  And maybe they will jump, you know, maybe maybe they will jump.  But this is what I told my radio audience.  Ask yourself how you're going to feel in June when an iPhone 5 is announced  Let's say the Verizon 4G network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People don't realize all the little ways that we have carrots on sticks  that trap us into our current situation with AT&T, the first of which is  imagine everyone, you know, who has an iPhone right now, right now,  every time you call them, whether it's morning, noon or night,  you are calling absolutely free.  You're spending no minutes nonstop.  You're able to access your data while you're on the phone with them.  And you are obviously you have to pay a termination fee to get out of the contract.  Then you have to pay even more hundreds of dollars to buy the exact same phone  that you just bought on a different network.  And then that phone is not going to have data while you talk on it.  And here's the part that I think people don't realize.  Expect to see a lot of these stories right now.  We have sort of an Obama situation with Verizon where we all hate AT&T  and we project this imaginary face onto Verizon.  It's going to be this magical wonderland where we never drop calls.  And we're going to find out that Verizon is human, just like the rest of us.  And those are the stories that we're going to be hearing about two months from now.

Transcript:  You know, also, you know, I don't think iPhone five is going to be an LTE phone.  You don't know.  Apple, Apple didn't jump that fast.  Remember what happened with took a long time to go to 3G.  I took a long time to go.  I think they'll wait. They'll do.  They want to do two things.  They probably want to wait till AT&T's network is a little built out,  which starts at the middle of this year.  And they're going to want to wait until LTE is mature before they do that.  And then they'll do a single chip that will be able to handle both networks  and they'll be off and running.

Start time: 2893.38
End time: 2897.87

Start time: 2898.84

Start time: 2905.68

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But also keep in mind that right now, Verizon is tiering the data pricing for LTE.  But they don't have an unlimited data plan for LTE.  They do have an unlimited data plan for 3G.  So if you if you want to make that jump, it's going to be a lot more expensive, I think.

Start time: 2926.86
End time: 2950.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That in fact, you actually brought up one other thing as well.  Keep in mind, also, most of the people I know who have an iPhone are still  grandfathered in to their unlimited AT&T contract.  And they all know that once the load gets lightened on the AT&T network,  they're going to get a lot more service out of it.  And they'll be glad to have that unlimited.  And granted, you will.  They are offering unlimited over at Verizon.  But it's a big change and it's a big leap and it's a big unknown with how happy you're going to be.

Start time: 2950.38
End time: 2954.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

End time: 2982.84

Our phone work in the damn.  Did you carry torches and pitchforks?  Pretty much.  And the guy literally said, go to the iPhone store and ask them.  So we did. We went with our pitchforks and torches to the iPhone store.  And they said, go back to AT&T and ask them, which is the old Microsoft,  you know, software thing where they were always pointing fingers.  But it'll be really interesting.

Transcript:  Yes. And the idea is, is once it assumes I've died,  once I fail to check in and thinks I've kicked the bucket,  it will take all of my tweets and all of my posts, all my social updates,  and it will create a digital simulacrum of a living Brian.  Oh, you read demon. This is straight out of demon.  I know what you're doing. I actually haven't read it, but but it will continue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the idea also is here's what blows me away, because I thought it's just  a crazy idea, because I didn't know if it was morbid or not.  But the questions people are coming up with are amazing.  Like, can you pre-write tweets to be released to say the things  you could never say when you were alive?  Like Mark Twain? Yes, exactly. Yes, exactly. Right.  And or and then other people said, can somebody can you eventually  and analyze your tweet cloud and come up with new content?  Where it finds articles.

Start time: 3421.28

Start time: 3425.90
End time: 3433.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

So I'm going to actually record a video that says,  if you're watching this, I am dead.  And then I was going to just, you know, tell give give people my instructions.  That's awesome. You totally should do that.  Brian, wash your frickin hair.  No, no, I don't know what it'll be.  But, you know, I was thinking actually, you know, I don't know.  I have a disaster mentality and where I will I will kind of think about  I don't I don't dwell on I don't get obsessive.  I think about like, what if the worst happens?

This is a new world that we live in where the problems that the abilities we have  to to extend our personalities and just as we call the chat room,  your prosthetic brain, you inject your personality into your tweets,  your updates and so on.  And here's the whole idea kind of flashbacks.  Two years ago, I was a friend of mine, my best friend from college,  committed suicide, right?  Oh, dear. But the way I heard about it was from a dubious source.  And I believe it because it was this flaky kid from high school.  And I didn't know if he was messing with me or not.

Transcript:  You want to talk about iOS 4.3 beta?  Yeah. So have you looked at it? Have you played with it?  I mean, I haven't gotten hands on with it.  All I knew, like I got as far as reading hardware switch on iPad equals orientation lock.  And I was dancing and I didn't read anything else.  Like, I do not understand why they ever took away that feature  and decided we needed a mute switch on the iPad.

Start time: 4169.50
End time: 4185.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They wanted to make it consistent with the iPhone.  But it's a stupid decision because you don't need it that much on the iPad.  You got to have the orientation lock on the iPad.  It's got to be quick and it's got to be right there.  And it was just a really dumb idea.  And why they didn't make give you a choice from the start, I don't know.

It would just it would very quickly go down.  It was all we needed.  In fact, I actually never upgraded to the I still don't have multitasking on my iPad.

Transcript:  Now, I'm a little concerned because I'm hearing conflicting reports  that you may not be able to do email on the Blackberry Playbook unless you have a Blackberry  and you can tether it to the Blackberry.  I don't know if that's true. We'll wait and see.  Rim has said that the Playbook, which does beautiful multitasking,  it's a variation of the QNX operating system, will come out in the first quarter with Wi-Fi.  If you have the Blackberry Bridge software and you have a Blackberry smartphone  connected to a Blackberry enterprise server, a little too much Blackberry for my mind,  you'll be able to get 3G wireless connectivity through your Bluetooth.  If you are all Blackberry.  And apparently that's how you're supposed to get email.  There will be security 256-bit encryption during file transfer back and forth with the Playbook.  I just thought that the way they did it was beautiful. Did you see it? Did you play with it?

Start time: 4398.78
End time: 4437.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So let me move on. So the way you multitask. So you've got an app full screen on the playbook.  And by the way, unlike the Zoom where you couldn't play with it, you could only watch a video of how it was supposed to work.  BlackBerry actually let me play with this.  If you're in the playbook and there's a full screen, you swipe your finger up and whatever is running on the screen minimizes to a cover flow style display.  And it continues to run. It's the true multitasking you were talking about.  So if it's a YouTube video, Brian, the video will continue to play. If it's a game, the game will continue to play in this cover flow.  They're all running at the same time. It's really good multitasking.

Start time: 4437.78

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And this is why they're having a hard time getting the battery life to last.  Well, they didn't mention the battery life.  Because everything runs in the background and they're having a hard time making it competitive in terms of battery life.  What is the battery life? Do you know?  I haven't heard, but everything I've seen when you ask them why it isn't out yet, they keep talking about we're optimizing the battery life.  Yeah, in other words.  And as from what I understand, it's difficult for them.

Start time: 4460.90
End time: 4486.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that doesn't surprise me. It's not an easy thing to do, frankly.  And maybe that's going to be the fly in the ointment.  Or the trade-off.  Yeah.  It's the trade-off.  But how much better? I mean, look, if it had four hours, I could live with it.  I mean, that's all the Samsung Galaxy Tab has.  I mean, it doesn't have to have 10.  But if it has one, it's not going to work.  Well, the point depends on how much you're doing and the more you do.

Start time: 4486.40
End time: 4489.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Start time: 4489.94
End time: 4497.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, given that they haven't said anything, that means it doesn't have any battery.  It has half of that.  Half of zero.  Half of zero is what is half of zero?

Start time: 4498.56
End time: 4503.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Transcript:  Now, both the Zoom and the BlackBerry Playbook will be running this new Tegra 2 processor from Nvidia,  which I think is part of the power of this.  I mean, it's dual gigahertz processors, a gig of RAM.  I mean, this is pretty impressive.  So I don't know. I think you're right, Dwight, when you say tablets.  I thought it was funny because I thought a lot of people came to CES looking for  it to be a big tablet expo.  And probably they were a little bit disappointed.  You had a look in the nooks and crannies.  But I think you're right.  I think this is going to be the year of the tablet.  There's no question.

Start time: 4535.66
End time: 4573.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's also the I think it's the year of Android.  And again, I am more of an Apple iOS fan.  But I really think that what is happening with Android on tablets is being really underestimated.  I mean, if you wanted to see a tablet, unless you saw the BlackBerry Playbook  and a handful of Windows Slates, as they call them,  what you saw was Android and what you saw in the back rooms was all Android.  And I really think that by this time next year,  I think we're all going to kind of be a little astounded at what's happened.

Yeah, with I think the revitalized chaos manner.  But I do want to mention our friends at Citrix.  Again, another Gina Smith connection  because you and me and Ed Iacobucci,  who started Citrix.  He's moved on, but Citrix really was.  The reason Ed knew so much about how to multitask on Windows,  how to do remote access on Windows,  is because he wrote Windows NT.  He was on loan from IBM.  He wrote OS 2.  He wrote OS 2.  No, that was the story though, is that yes,  he was on the OS 2 team at IBM.  And IBM lent engineers to Microsoft to work on the NT kernel.  And he was one of them.  And Windows, Microsoft lent engineering staff to OS 2.  And the story always was, of course, it's not fully true,  but the story always was that pretty much IBM wrote NT  and Microsoft wrote OS 2.  And yet Ed was the guy on the IBM OS 2 team,  who in fact did a lot of the Windows kernel.  And what that led to is the best remote access.  It's still used everywhere, the Citrix Enterprise server  for remote access in enterprise.  And of course, they also do great consumer products like this,  gotoassist.com.  This is a remote access product that's used by support professionals  all over the world to get their job done.  In fact, I just read a study that said the people who use  gotoassist report about a 40% increase in productivity.  It's like two extra days a week,  because they don't have to go down the hall.  They don't have to get on the phone and walk you through it.  They don't have to travel to help you with your problem.  They just get on gotoassist and fix it right there  through the internet.  In fact, you don't even have to have it installed ahead of time.  If the support person has it, they just send you a link,  you install it, and boom, they're fixing your computer.  I do this with my mom. It's amazing.  If you are in the support business, we all have our tools.  This is the tool you got to have for remote access.  gotoassist.com slash twit.  You can try it free for 30 days.  gotoassist.com, try it free for 30 days.  You don't want to have those long phone calls.  You don't want to have that feeling of,  I wish I could help them, but I can't because I'm not right there.  You want to fix the problem.  You want gotoassist Express.

I had that feeling that this was going to be a seminal event,  a watershed in technology that from then on, and I was right,  that the conversation would include iPad, that that's a device.

Transcript:  Basically, that's what happened.  It was a shocker for those of us who've been living in a  Wintel world for the last couple of decades.  Apple is reportedly working on an A5 CPU, a successor to the CPU than the iPhone 4 and the iPad,  that will be based on the A9.  It'll be dual core, just as the Tegra 2 is.  Now, the Tegra 2 has Nvidia GeForce technology in there, GPU.  I would imagine Apple is also looking at upgrading the GPU in their chip.  Here's what's interesting.  Now, this is again just rumor Apple doesn't say, but Engadget says the iPad 2 or the iPhone 5  will have a Qualcomm chipset in it that does CDMA, GSM, and UMTS.  In other words...

Okay, that just means I'm throwing the whole article out if they say that.  That's right.

Transcript:  All right.  We've got two more stories I want to mention.  This was a big story.  We talked a lot about it on This Week in Google.  I don't know if we've talked it out, but Google has announced...  Now, this is a little inside baseball, so let me explain.  There is a new HTML standard.  As you well know, HTML5.  Everybody's getting behind it.  Apple, Google, everybody, even Microsoft.  And in HTML5, there is a tag, bracket, video bracket.  And the idea is if we could only decide what standard to use for video,  then it would be so easy for a website to embed video.  They just use this bracket video.  You wouldn't need a plugin.  All the browsers would support it.  There is no agreement right now on what that standard should be.  The de facto standard for video is what you're watching right now, which is H.264.  That's the video format we use.  That's all our streaming partners.  Even if it's wrapped in Flash, it's H.264.  Google has announced we will not support H.264.  That is not going to be our choice for the video tag in Chrome.  They're hoping to throw their market weight behind something called WebM.  They have bought WebM from On2 when they bought the company.  And they're open sourcing it.  They're licensing it to anybody can use it, royalty free.  There's some debate over the quality of the codec.  That's not really the issue.  I guess the issue is, isn't H.264 a de facto standard?  Is WebM even out there?  What are you going to re-encode all the YouTube videos?  You're going to tell me I have to start encoding my stuff in WebM so that you can embed it?  And here's the big, I think the big interesting story that we talked about on this week in Google,  doesn't this in a way give a win to Adobe Flash?  Because if it's not built into the browser, everybody's going to have to download Flash to play it.

Start time: 5567.92
End time: 5583.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and this was what I like most about Dwight's article because  Dwight wrote about this on blogs.chron.com.  Specifically, Dwight points out that, okay, I get it.  You're saying you're preferring open over closed.  Well, if that's the case, why don't you yank Flash support out of Chrome, right, Dwight?

Start time: 5584.24
End time: 5595.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  The thing is that Google could end up, could use H.264.  Their argument is also one of cost.  But yeah, they can afford it.

Start time: 5595.80
End time: 5598.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 5605.06
End time: 5609.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  right now we don't have to pay a royalty to MPEG LA,  but there's no reason why we might not have to down the road.  In the future.

Start time: 5610.14
End time: 5642.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right.  Right.  And but are you going to yank it just kind of because of what might happen?  You know, Ed Bott did a really nice piece looking at the costs.  It was an excellent piece.  Yes, on the cost of exactly what H.264 costs.  And for Google, it's like, you know, it's a rounding error.  It doesn't, it's not much at all.  And so, you know, I think it's a little bit disingenuous to them.  They're trying to force the standard that they want to do.  The only problem is, is that Chrome doesn't have that kind of share to force the standard.  If this was...

Start time: 5642.24
End time: 5649.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, but if you combine Chrome and Mozilla,  by the way, the Mozilla group also does not support H.264 for the video tag.  Microsoft is.

Start time: 5651.50
End time: 5684.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's regardless of how much share they've lost.  They are still the most used by plurality.  Are they?  Yes.  Oh, yeah, but they're not half of the audience.  No, no, but they're still, you know, they still are a big player.  And Safari is also doing it.  And not only that, but there's all these iOS devices that are out there.  I've thought about this long and hard because, you know, my initial reaction is,  you know, screw you, Google.  But in fact...  Which is a good initial reaction for anything.  Yeah, it's, you know, pretty much works in every formal or informal occasion.

Start time: 5686.16
End time: 5689.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 5689.40

Transcript:  They're trying to promote open standards.  And I think that's a good thing.  And I think that's a good thing.  I think Google's on the side of the angels.  They're trying to promote open standards.  They make the point that H.264 has patented, has encumbered.  And you cannot predict what MPEG-LA is going to do.  Admittedly, it's not that expensive now.  I don't pay a royalty now, but that could change.  WebM isn't, you know, some people say, well, you know, there's going to be lawsuits about WebM  because even though they claim to be open, there's also a counterclaim that there's some code in there  that isn't...  That is proprietary.  And so there is going to be lawsuits.  It's going to be a mess.  And Google, I think, is saying, yeah, we know it's going to be a mess,  but in the long run, it needs to be open.  And I think if it's...  You can always do plugins.  This isn't about whether you can run Flash.  And Google supports Flash.  It's not that, you know, and Google's going to...  It's not about plugins.  It's about what does HTML5 support as a open, free codec?  And I think WebM is the only choice that's appropriate for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it might be.  And you're right.  And a lot of people accuse Google of profiteering on this,  that this isn't really about open.  I disagree.  I don't think Google's trying to make money out of this.  I would agree with you.  Or that it's going after Apple.  Some people say that's a handy Apple.

Transcript:  If you care about your users and you want it to be as simple and as basic a problem.  Yeah, you can install plugins, but you know what?  You shouldn't have to.  It has to be in the browser.  If you care about your users, you want it to be as simple.  You want your browser to support everything that's thrown at it and you want to do it natively.  If they're serious about not about supporting open, then get rid of Flash.

Start time: 5823.80
End time: 5877.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's in fact what Kevin Marks said.  He quoted Postel's law, which says be very open about what you support,  be very narrow about what you do, but be very open about what you support.  Support everything, in other words, because it's easier for users.  I just think what Google's doing, and I kind of admire them for this,  is they're saying we're going to take some pain, we're going to bite the bullet,  because in the long run, open is better.  It will not be easy at first, but in the long run...  Now, they're doing it for us, but you can always use a different browser.  You can always put in Flash.  You can always put in a plugin, but I think they're doing the right thing here.  I don't think it's an easy thing for them to do.  I think that there's a lot of good reasons to dislike it,  but if we five years from now, if we look back and we say,  hey, this is great, there's a standard video codec, there are others out there,  but that's open, nobody has to ever pay for,  that's supported by all browsers universally, I think it will have been worth it.

Start time: 5877.92
End time: 5897.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to defer to you because you obviously no more...  You have a more vested interest in video codecs than I do.  Well, I have a dog in this hunt to quote Gina Smith.  But me as a consumer, I'm super annoyed that Chrome has always been the lightest,  most felt browser, and that's why I loved it and started using it.  Well, the way this makes it more so.  Well, but no, because now there's a lot of sites I have to install a plugin on now.  And I'm annoyed.

Start time: 5912.32

He's not happy about it, but I would say that's fairly safe to say.  We're going to wrap up with some numbers.  You want to hear some numbers?  The internet in 2010.
