So you get one extra second  to do anything you want with.  I'm going to yell.

Start time: 615.87
End time: 638.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He gave a little interview to  the New York Times after the  event.  So apparently it was a little  bit like that scene from E.T.  where they quarantine the house  and they've got a tent and a  tube going all the way out  and they've got federal agents  with guns or if you saw it  later without guns the  the president's car pulled  up into the tent.

Did you write that joke?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  No, I'm going much lower than  that.  I have just interacted with  and done some meetings with  the public engagement office  at the White House.  Basically advised them in the  past on how they think about  communicating with the public  and what's fascinating.  This White House is like came  of age.  Yeah.  Really in a digital media  era Bush just missed it.  And and the president Obama  is like snapchats here.  YouTube is full on wireless  networks.  So we used to count on the  official media the formal  credentialed media to relay  messages from the executive  branch and to interrogate them  on our behalf.  And now that is not the case  anymore.  The White House publishes a  whole bunch of its own stuff  there have primary outlets on  all these social channels.  But then they also go to niche  media to try to get their  message out.  I mean the first lady has done  all this stuff around her.  Let's move initiative targeting  I village and like very  particular communities.  That's the equivalent of doing  like local press back in the  day.  So they do they so they talk to

So I went down and it was me  the guy who was doing Ivy.  You remember that service that  got sued out of existence  because they were just  rebroadcasting.  There were a couple of people  from YouTube there a couple of  Google legal representatives.  It was really interesting  because they were just kind of  fact-finding.  They wanted to know like  what are your concerns.  You know what are the issues  that you face trying to get your  message out on the Internet.  And I think they were also  collecting information for  themselves for what baritone  day is talking about.

They did talk about of course  the Charleston killings had  happened the day before on  Wednesday.  So they talked a lot you know  they had some serious  conversation thing about Marin  is he likes correct me if I'm  wrong but just from listening  to the show.

I don't follow it anymore.  He said so I didn't think of  political questions to ask the  president I was going to do it  my way engage in a personal  way but he knows all the  tricks says Marin he's the  president I wasn't going to put  anything over on him by acting  more comfortable than I was  but it was weird he came over  he made me very comfortable  very quickly.  He was very engaged he was  looking forward to having a  nice chat and I think I steam  rolled into the conversation  very intensely very quickly  like I do sometimes especially  when I'm a little bit nervous.  They asked him the times asked  him how did this happen he  said well you know we would  have this conversation between  my producer in the White House  and then over the last month  or so it became clear like it  might happen and then Mark  says but where am I going to do  it do I go to the Oval Office  do I go to his hotel then they  told him no he wants to come to  your garage.  So that's pretty wild big  secret service there were  snipers on my neighbor's roof a  sniper on my garage roof LAPD  around the perimeter 40 secret  service people they asked and  this I was kind of interested  in this question.  Did you were you given any  guidelines or restrictions  about what you could discuss  with the president and Marin  said no no guidelines no  restrictions and we had final  edit.  Wow.

He now runs Funny or Dies DC  office.  They have a real office down  there.  And he was a big part of  connecting the White House to  the L.A.  community the Hollywood  community especially comedians  and a lot of the videos that  came out for Obamacare that  Funny or Die did they ended up  driving enrollment like they  were trying to reach that  community of young people who  hang out and watch funny videos  online and that's not going to  be drive time radio and it's  not going to be ABC news or NBC  nightly news.  So they are I think that part  of their strategy is probably  Merritt has an audience that  they want this president to be  exposed to maybe he's doing a  closing lap to I'm just like  who am I not touched.

I had my phone I threw it to my  monitor through Apple TV and I  was just curious what would  happen if I tried to make a  snapchat of what my camera saw  which was what my camera was  seeing.  So I created this Hall of  Mirrors effect.  It's like fractal effect  basically because there's a  latency between each image.  So the longer you focus on what  you're focusing on what you're  focusing on it just creates  this tunnel effect and then I  played around with filters and  rotation angles and things like  that.

Transcript:  So Taylor Swift on her  tumblr log writes to Apple  love Taylor but like many  Taylor Swift songs this is  really about breaking up.  I'll write this to explain why  I'm holding back my album.  She's killing getting good at  this.  Remember Taylor held back  1989 from Spotify because they  wouldn't let her take it off  the free tier.  I'm holding back my album  1989 from the new streaming  service Apple Music.  I feel this deserves an  explanation because Apple has  been and will continue to be  one of my best partners in  selling music.  This is kind of weird and  creating ways for me to  connect with my fans.  I respect the company and the  truly ingenious minds that  have created a legacy based on  innovation and pushing the  right boundaries.  I'm sure you are aware she  goes on to write that Apple  Music will be offering a free  three month trial to anyone  who signs up for the service  that starts by the way at the  end of the month next month  no this month it should be  any day now right July June  29th.

Transcript:  So the problem is Apple is  going to give you a free  trial for three months on  both the Mac on IOS when you  get 8.4 not on Android no  free trial when it comes out  on Android but Windows I guess  will also get a free trial  and Apple has said and Taylor  says I'm sure you know Apple  will not be paying will not  be paying writers producers  or artists for those three  months.  I find it to be shocking she  says disappointing and  completely unlike this  historically progressive and  generous company.  This is not about me and she  obviously understands that  people are going to say Oh  Taylor you you're rich you're  you're being she says no I'm  not being these are not the  complaints of a spoiled  petulant child she writes she  says I'm on my fifth album I  can support myself my band my  crew an entire management team  just by paint playing live  shows but and she makes this  is I think an excellent point  this is about the new artist  or band that has just released  their first single and won't  be paid.  I mean imagine you just come  out with your hit single and  for three months people can  listen to it for free on and

Start time: 1754.80
End time: 1823.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  when you think about and I  don't know what the curve  looks like for music is there a  power curve basically a play  volume like it spikes in the  first few weeks or months and  then it probably tapers off as  people discover artists and so  you're you're probably not  missing out in a year's period  you may be missing out on more  than a quarter of the  compensation that that first  quarter of release may  represent a half of your plays  for that year on this platform.  So I like the dear John letter  that Taylor Swift wrote Apple  she felt a little political  felt like the politician goes  into like a small town or  company and like the good  people of Iowa are always  you know hard-working  ingenious minds you've  contributed so much to the  American economy when then  they follow that with no  ripping them a bit but the  case for the new musician I  thought was strong and unique  it wasn't the way Metallica  was like way back in the day  where like you're stealing our  money and it's hard to feel  sympathy for someone you assume  is very highly compensated.  So I felt like she was taking  a hit on behalf of people who  don't have a voice it was  actually quite a political  move.  I like it.

Transcript:  recognize as an artist the  direct relationship you have  you know based on the phone  you're using like she probably  wrote that on an Apple device  I mean like yeah so so she is  grateful for that iTunes has  changed the whole game and  maybe allowed someone like her  to rise like them and Google  especially together probably  changed the total relationship  Apple takes credit for and then  her other big point I think is  look you you're asking the  weakest among us to subsidize  your product launch and so  the US Treasury has 50 billion  dollars on hand.  Apple has 160 billion dollars  on hand.  You think they can't afford to  offer the artists on whose back  the service depends like  without musicians Apple music  is just an empty vessel.  So she's like look why don't  you if you want this product  to see so much you invest in  it don't force your suppliers  like the heart of your product  to make that investment and

Start time: 1895.34
End time: 1938.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  without asking to here's my  guess about what happened here  though is instead of giving the  70 percent that normally a  Spotify will take Apple agreed  to more some people say it's  71.5 I guess in Europe at 73  and my guess is that Apple  agreed to that in exchange for  the three-month free exclusive  they said well that'll balance  it out.  We'll give you a larger amount  over time if we can juice up  the stats at the beginning with  three months free and the labels  agreed to that.  So this isn't really about Apple  versus the artist.  This was about the labels once  again selling out their artists  as it always has because they  they'll get their money down the  line even if it hurts some  individual artists along the way

Start time: 1938.90
End time: 1970.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but I wonder I'm by the I wonder  if like that because artists  are rarely at the table they're  represented by publishers who  have the rights to these songs  about the music labels who have  other rights.  So maybe it's just the case of  labels not fighting hard enough  maybe they were just totally  whipped by Apple.  They know they're going to lose  in any rate because how do you  tell is a very awkward  conversation.  I feel like to be like yeah  we're going to ask your artists  to pay for this and you're saying  that from like a throne that  you're sitting in which is made  of solid gold.

Transcript:  I think though all right.  Look obviously she on the face  of it she's right.  But for years now artists have  accepted that you're not going to  make much money on radio play.  In fact as a performer you make  zero only the publisher the  songwriter gets any money.  You're not going to make a lot of  money even with the other  streaming music services like  Pandora Spotify.  But if you're a new artist that's  how your music gets out.  She herself says I make my money  touring isn't that really just  the fact of life these days.

Transcript:  Josh Constantine over at Tech  Crunch had a great point which  was the company that gets this  will start selling merch and  concert tickets through their  streaming service.  Exactly cutting in the artist  where they make their actual  money and no one will care so  much about all these individual  streams which are minuscule.

Transcript:  And that's what that's already I  mean that's been happening in  since Yahoo music service from  built on Rhapsody forever ago  and right Spotify has a concert  you can follow an artist and get  notifications.  I assume it's like an affiliate  link deal if you buy a ticket  based on that click because  they're the ones who are  responsible for you discovering  that this is nothing new either

There are limits kind of draconian limits  which I wasn't really aware of  to how many times you can redownload  your own music.  I think you only can do it a couple of times a year.  Okay, there's all sorts of issues  with Google music.  And I love the idea  because my collection is in  Google music with 30 million other songs.  So as you say Tom, I can supplement  the Beatles and so forth.  Double Twist actually has just launched  a solution to get around this.  I love this.  Called Cloud Player.  I tried to download it this morning.  I couldn't get it.  But the idea is  if your music is on Dropbox  you can stream it to Double Twist on Android.  And I guess it does it also use Google Drive?  Yes, Dropbox OneDrive or Google Drive.  And so it gets it literally by classes  all of Google's restrictions about  how many times you can download your music  who owns it.  You can only authorize five devices with Google.  All of that's bypassed by Double Twist.  Good.  Ah, you've got to wonder what Google's going to do in response.

But this is this is if you see if you if your ex is putting  up nude pictures of you and as revenge you can fill out a  form which is not yet available but will be soon saying  hey, I did not give permission for this imagery to be on the  internet.  Would you please take down the search results?  And I think that's a good thing.  Agreed if it's not on Google, it doesn't exist.

Transcript:  And I like the idea that you have seems like for such a  long time that was a very hands-off like outside of the  realm of morality and ethics attitude about the power of  this technology to do great harm right and to go we're just  an algorithm right just just doing what the machines tell us  to do like that's how you end up with some pretty bad outcomes  some from time to time.  So for Google to be saying like look this information it's  our job.  I'm paraphrasing like their mission is to organize the  world's information, but it's really to organize the world's  valuable information and this information has no value in  it only has harm attached to it.  So it's not a good look for them to be connected to a place  where you can go to find ways to hurt people and destroy the  reputation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think that puts the argument where it's supposed to  be which is saying what is the line between what should be  allowed and what shouldn't be allowed.  I mean it just like freedom of expression says you can't yell  fire in a crowded theater.  There is a line there is a line where where you say you can't  say everything right.  We try to try to make it as abundant as possible.  And I think Google is saying revenge porn is on that side of  the line.  There is no value to it.  No one would question right to be forgotten.  Right.  Sometimes there is still value to that because it's actual  facts.  It's not necessarily libelous or slanderous.  It's just old and I think I'm sympathetic to the argument  where they're saying I think you should have a higher burden  of proof that something like that should be removed from  search results.

Transcript:  Yeah, well I would just I mean I would love to jump in on  the on the on the conversation.  I think the one point I would make is I think in in Tekken  around some of these issues in particular the kind of slippery  slope argument gets a little oversold and and I say this  is someone who takes it very very seriously.  I mean actually my background in University is not tech.  It was political science and actually constitutional law  specifically.  So the the concept of slippery slope and the First Amendment  and all the sorts of things is something that I've certainly  understand very well and rings very true that said I feel  like the argument of this is a step down a slippery slope is  taken so far to the extreme.  The reality is everything is on the slope and and and it's  kind of insulting to suggest that we that no one has the  judgment to figure out where and when where we can go.  I mean so you get you literally get arguments of people  arguing that private corporations should not put some sort  of limit on truly egregious awful behavior or speech in the  name of a slippery slope argument that one is nonsensical  if you actually back up and think about it.  Two is is kind of insulting and three private corporations  are covered by the First Amendment anyway, so I mean I'm  good on Google for doing this and good on the the taking it  a little easy on the slippery slope argument.

Start time: 2789.14
End time: 2838.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The only I'm and I'm not making the slippery slope argument  really because of a hobby horse.  No, no, no, but I had to jump on it, but I'm going to jump  on it.  I will I will kind of take the that the point of view just  to give you more to push against you can certainly make the  case that if there's editorial discretion of any kind if it's  not completely algorithmic then that changes the whole per  you know complexion of the matter then where does that end  editorial discretion and shouldn't it be entirely algorithmic  and there should be no human intervention at all if if in  all.  I don't know that I would address in other words address  revenge point at the source.  Why does Google have to change its algorithm take down the  you know go to that certainly go to the sites where they're  it's up there and as they did recently throw them in jail

Start time: 2839.46
End time: 2881.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because it was a point of leverage and can actually make  a difference.  I mean if we if we didn't act except at the root source of  every problem, we wouldn't do anything right wouldn't have  energy if we felt that way we don't fly to the Sun to get  it like we have to have intermediate methods of getting  things done and Google represents a major gateway and  they've made a call that says that we're not the cause of  the problem, but we contribute by making by creating a market  for this.  Yeah, we search is a market people's look up folks's  information and if this is what they find on someone which is  only an act of malice not the fact-based journalistic stuff  that Tom was talking about earlier that has no value and  for Google to be like, oh we didn't we didn't start the fire.  Does that mean you don't help put it out?

Start time: 2883.16
End time: 2904.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think there's also an argument to be made in high  Ben.  I'm Tom nice to meet you.  Oh Tom Tom Merritt and I think there's I think there's an  argument to be made to that.  This is Google admitting that their algorithm isn't perfect  and that if their algorithm was perfect, it would be able  to tell that this was valueless content and kick it out, but  it can't and so you have to put a patch on it a human  patch for the time being.

Start time: 2905.48

Transcript:  Well, that idea that to is the idea that that a bit the best  world is one where that doesn't require human intervention.  No, that's the sky net world.  We've seen that documentary so many times before and I don't  know that that's the highest level of like creative  achievement is one where no people are required like that  shouldn't be the goal.  You guys are pushing me.

Start time: 2928.82
End time: 2955.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're pushing me in the opposite direction.  Now the more I hear this the more I don't like this idea.  I feel like if you're going to say I'm going to make a search  engine, what you should do is make a search engine that indexes  what's on the net regardless of content because that's what's  on the net.  Your job is to reflect what's on the net and give the best  results not to editorialize and then if you don't like something  that's on the net, you should go to where it is on the net  not take the search engine to task.

Start time: 2956.92
End time: 2970.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there's two there's two issues we owe and for the record  I'm very sympathetic.  I mean I like I I had a similar position recently and so I  get it.  I think there's I would look there's plenty of stuff.

Start time: 2970.38
End time: 3000.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would love to take down on the net.  Everybody knows that so I'm not I'm arguing against my own  interest, but I think it's in all of our interest that Google  be an independent aggregator of whatever reflection of what's  on the net and not with any human editorial intervention  because editorial intervention always introduces bias.  So the problem though is who writes the algorithms?  Yeah, actually Ben you go and then I think that's an interesting  point Baratunde you do you get the next one.

Start time: 3001.76
End time: 3006.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 3018.46
End time: 3101.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The the the truth is one humans write algorithms and so there  is going to be some level of bias already in them to Google  has already made this decision to censor some sort of content.  They have a long-standing as noted policy to not show child  pornography.  For example, they also don't show certain piracy piracy  results on them because they have to some of them because  they choose not to there's a whole list of stuff.  They choose not to feature sites that wink to themselves and  have all that sort of stuff in the various, you know, Penguin  updates and Panda and Peregrine and whatever the names are.  The reality is is that the search algorithm itself is a  very human endeavor and we can't pretend that it is inherently  objective when it's not more broadly.  We need to deal with the world as it is not with a theoretical  world where there's an impartial computer answering our  questions.  The reality is is that in a world of infinite information  the point that organizes that information for better or worse  has unbelievable power and leverage and frankly in Google's  interest if they don't take the responsibility they shouldn't  be surprised if governments take the responsibility for them.  So this is actually probably a self-finished move on.

Start time: 3101.38
End time: 3130.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I agree with that but that's but that's kind of a politically  realistic point of view.  I disagree.  I think an algorithm can be completely objective.  In fact PageRank at its fundamental root is it takes no  account of the content at all.  No, but it merely says if somebody else if people are  linking to this page, it's highly ranked the higher the rank  of the pages that are linking to the page the higher the rank  of the page.  If you just do that, that's purely algorithmic without human  intervention and it is it is completely objective and there's  no editorial.

Start time: 3130.94
End time: 3181.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the editorial happened when someone decided that PageRank  equal important like the word rank is a human value that says  a page is important because of this algorithmic definition of  inbound outbound links, etc.  So the pure doesn't belong in this discussion.  There's no there's no idea of purity here because someone  created that it's like saying a test, you know an academic  test measures intelligence.  Make it makes a certain type of intelligence PageRank measures  a certain type of importance, but it can be argued that  there are other relevant factors for the position of a web  page and the result for a certain term that PageRank  doesn't capture at all.  So pay very limited human value imposed from the source like  the code itself has values imposed by a thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But Leo you so okay, if you're going to say it's not perfect,  but it's better than having a human decide.  Yeah, what I would say is it's better to have a human decide  to not include revenge porn than to not.  I mean the point of the fact of the matter is one once you've  established it's not perfect.  Then you're making judgment calls and once you're making  judgment calls.  I well, that's why I say you leave that's why I agree with

Start time: 3210.58
End time: 3229.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you revenge porn is obviously wrong.  But the point is as soon as you this is the slippery slope  argument.  You hate so much.  But as soon as you say abandon the completely computer-based  algorithm and start saying well except this isn't so good  and this isn't so good.  That's very risky because that's a that's a judgment call.

Start time: 3229.46
End time: 3247.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the problem is your that argument only holds moral water  if you start with the assumption that the original judgment  is perfect.  Yeah, what is perfect?  If it merely reflects the know it's perfect according to  certain parameters.  I mean perfect.

Start time: 3247.84
End time: 3252.36

Start time: 3255.64
End time: 3272.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I understand Google's abandoning that by the way what you  think but I just I can't imagine a world where you think  that they happen to stumble into the absolute across all time  best and most perfect way to determine the page.  Maybe there's a better way to do it.

Start time: 3272.28
End time: 3274.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 3275.26
End time: 3277.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If there's something better than this is not perfect.

Start time: 3277.84
End time: 3324.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I would say what's absolutely imperfect is imposing  some sort of moral judgment or moral compass because that  changes that is that is highly subjective.  Whereas you can you can pick an out.  Let's just pick an algorithm doesn't matter if it's  page rank, but there is some method that I'm using that  is you know the point of page rank is to try to determine  which pages are the most important which page is the  least important and then give it in order according to your  search term.  So let's we want to perfect that we want to make that better  and better.  But the minute you say except let's take these results out  and let's take these results out.  Now your search algorithm isn't showing an accurate picture  of the web.  If the web is full of crap, which it is by the way, right?  Who's going to decide what to take out?

Start time: 3324.90
End time: 3368.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the except started the moment that they pulled out  link farms.  They said that's not a valuable result and page rank was  making a mistake by ranking those.  So we have to tweak then they pulled out bank account numbers  and child pornography and now revenge porn.  So really the conversation to me isn't about whether there  should be human intervention in the algorithm because there  has been all the way back to the beginning.  The question is are they intervening in the right places?  So and exactly.  Oh, I think you you hit the nail on the head when you said  are you making a moral right?  And and and is revenge porn or child pornography a moral  judgment or just a class that they say, you know what if  we had the perfect algorithm it would eliminate that on its  own.

Start time: 3369.86
End time: 3432.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean if of course look algorithms are it's made  of people like everything else, but there is the goal that  you're trying to achieve with the algorithm and one would  be to try to accurately reflect however we do it the  actual state of the net that to me seems the right and  good way to create a search engine.  The other would be to say let's show the results of the  net of stuff.  We don't disagree with whatever that is that you don't  disagree with the fact that we can all agree the revenge  porn is bad does not mean that it should be abandoned  because that is just because we all agree about it.  We might all agree that African-American people are all  bad and that has happened in time should the algorithm  be adjusted.  No, it should not be based on that kind of judgment.  What you're trying to do is mathematically accurately  reflect that big that that data pool that is the net however  creepy it is.  Let's have an accurate search result.  That's all I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But there's a there's a world where there was a there's a  great Ted talk that came out this year about our whole  perception of anything is imperfect.  It's incomplete.  We don't see like infrared without some extra tools like  you don't write there the idea that we could accurately  reflect the net like the word accurate and the word net are  both very subjective and hard to wrap some comprehensive case  around and I think you know a pure quote-unquote pure search  engine can exist but to Tom's point it would actually be a  pile of crap.  Yes, because that's what's on the net.

Start time: 3477.80

Transcript:  Let's take a break.  There's lots more to talk about including an article on the  Wall Street Journal that said Apple should abandon the Mac.  I'd like to know if you agree, especially you Ben see that  article.  Our show today brought you by gazelle a great way if you  are in is this gazelle time?  I think it is isn't it?  Yeah, a great way if you are into gadgets to get new gadgets  without breaking the bank and see when you're done with a  phone or a tablet or a computer or a screen.  Do you just kind of throw it in a pile somewhere maybe stick  in a drawer that be like taking $100 bills and saying I don't  need this anymore and just put it in the drawer instead go to  gazelle.com at least do yourself a favor get a quote for  well, how much is that old iPhone 5 worth and then when  you see it's worth a hundred bucks, maybe you won't throw  it in the door.  Maybe you'll send it to gazelle.  The point is you can get that quote no, you know obligation  no cost to you $175.  Okay, and now we're talking it's good for 30 days.  So you don't have to decide right away.  In fact, if there's a new thing coming and you want to get it.  It's a great idea to go to gazelle now and get that quote  so you can lock it in then when you get the new thing new  thing transfer the data off the old thing and send it to gazelle  they pay the postage on anything worth more than a buck.  You might ask I know many have well, what happens to the  goods, you know the stuff that gazelle gets well the stuff  that's in the best shape they actually will turn around and  sell pre-owned certified from gazelle devices are available  from gazelle in two conditions certified like new nothing more  to say about that.  They're as good as new certified good.  They show some general signs of where but you're going to  get even more savings.  The thing to know is everything's been put through gazelle's  rigorous 30-point inspection.  So they're fully functional and you have a 30-day risk-free  return.  So it's great.  It's if you if you lose your phone, this is the place to go  if your kids break their phone or their tablet.  This is the place to go gazelle you get paid in cash payment  is fast.  It's risk-free.  They'll wipe your data.  If you forget gazelle's paid out over 200 million dollars now  over a million customers very happy me.  I'm one of them.  I love gazelle and now you can buy from gazelle to buy or sell  remember gazelle gazelle.com we thank you for their support.  I don't know what what what what sick game Christopher Mims  is up to in the Wall Street Journal.  What sick game why Apple should kill off the Mac actually,  I guess from a purely business point of view it might make  sense to I mean the Mac is such a small part of their business.  They make so much money on the iPhone.  It might make sense to kill off the computer that really put  Apple on the map after the Apple 2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, but I mean you know you do know, but you do know not this  kind, but you look at numbers.  You understand business what the business is and you've said  some interesting maybe even provocative things Google for  instance no longer a top of their game.  Well, I think this is a reasonable strategy for Apple.

Start time: 3735.56
End time: 3801.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well for the record, I think the issue with Google is is the  advertising market shifting to or the addition of branded  advertising.  They're not strong, but that aside.  No, I it's a ridiculous.  Okay, good.  Thank you article the as far as I can ascertain Mims argument  is that Apple needs more focus.  But the it's just a I don't know.  It's a really poorly thought out idea.  I mean for lots of reasons.  I mean the the most obvious one is one well from a business  perspective.  It's still a very successful large and profitable business.  I mean anything compared to the iPhone is small the Mac  compared to any other PC manufacturer is very very strong  and very very good and very very profitable relative to  anyone else to it kind of raise the question like well, how  are you going to make apps for the iPhone and for the iPad?  And and Mims answer a follow-up column is like well, you have  a really decked out iPad and then like well, why don't you  just change the name then and call it a Mac.

Start time: 3802.56
End time: 3854.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  And then the third point though is the big reason why iOS was  able to start a fresh was able to have a simpler approach is  because it didn't need to do everything because there was  already something that did everything and that was the Mac  the iPad and the iPhone particularly the beginning before  we knew what these categories were make sense in a world  where there already is a fully capable fully thought out tool  on one side and we can distill the essence into a new product  on the other and that need hasn't gone away.  I mean we're all sitting on Macs right now because to record  a podcast on an iPad well theoretically possible doesn't  make sense.  I'm not sure you probably couldn't do a multi-headed  recording that's or well, maybe the reality is it'd be let

Transcript:  If I could try to make an attempt to draw a point out of  here.  He I think his major and honestly, I think he's trying to  write an article that people will click and read but his  major premise here is that the PC market is dying and I think  it's it's taken.  I think he exaggerates that too much.  If Apple should focus they should get rid of the iPod which  is definitely a dying market.  There's a good for they get rid of PCs.

Transcript:  I didn't I didn't get that from it.  What I got was the loss of focus argument and I read it  during the gazelle ad.  Sorry gazelle.  I was just I was Google.  We do the ads to give you a chance to yeah relevant search  result despite being imperfect the the idea the loss of focus  and the fact that they're trying to do TVs watches pads  and phones and this desktop device that the representation  of their revenue was like 9% which he argues they don't need  and they could kind of redirects all the labor going into  that 9% to some of these other areas.  They want to master I would just be happy if they didn't  change all of our connecting ports all the damn time right  for no particular reason and make obsolete all of my  accessories that would that be really nice.  Now they would do that.  I don't want them to shut down a whole business unit just  to have a bit more mercy when you're jumping from USB  whatever to the new thing that makes me feel like an idiot.

I don't think but I think it's a movie that this audience  the Twitter audience, especially with love.  It is a very geeky techie movie under the guise of these  high schoolers who are obsessed with 1990s hip-hop who find  themselves in some tricky situations that they have to  get themselves out of.  It's very funny.  It's very sharp satire, but it's one of the best uses of  attack in a very pop culture movie.  It's not like a deep dive into any aspect of tech.  It's not about technology, but it integrates it so naturally  and it's about how young people are using it that I just when  I saw it as a yo twit would love this.  I have to mention it.  So I have no relationship to the movie except that I saw and  love it.

You might know a little bit this time and I don't know if  you want to recuse yourself because of course Eileen your  wife works at the YouTube space in Los Angeles.  YouTube is building a twitch killer.  We hear the YouTube gaming service.  They tried to buy twitch lost out to Amazon which paid a lot  for the service YouTube's twitch killer.  But here's some here's some pictures of it from Ronam  audio at Ars Technica.  So is this is this let's play videos is that seems like  that's what this is.

Basically YouTube is lever trying to leverage their  advantage of having lots of gameplay footage archived,  right?  Which is where it started right archive.  Yeah, and they have live streaming for YouTube that is  powered through Hangouts, but you can also go directly.  You don't have to use Hangouts to stream and so they're  creating an app.  It's in beta.  Now you have to be invited in but it's going to launch later  this summer that will allow you to not only live stream your  games but automatically archive them and then the app as  a viewer will let you just drill down by the player that  you want to see all the Trump's videos if he's on there  you can find them you can go by game if you want to see  all the Hearthstone videos or by publisher if you're into  the publisher so they get some branded money that way too.

That's very exciting.  That's I felt hip and cool and what the kids are into very  very much on fleek like Lila port, but I did like this  article is worth reading one.  It just it looked like the best looking interface maybe  that Google's ever made.

Start time: 4334.50
End time: 4337.84

Transcript:  Yeah, YouTube is pretty garbage actually and and I have  lots of love for YouTube.  I don't have to feel like I have to do a Taylor Swift apology,  but this looks so much better than anything YouTube has  ever done and I was into it for that reason and then yeah,  the thing you talked about Tom the way they mind their  archives to just populate the system that's smart with  something only Google could do right because they've been  indexing information for so long and that was just a very  I don't even know if they thought that when they started  you know when they acquired YouTube in the beginning like  eight years from now, however many years it's been we'll  be able to launch a service based on what people have  already shared with us and recontextualize it.  That's that's pretty intelligent.

Start time: 4384.10
End time: 4396.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's it's it's actually worse than than Spotify.  I mean the at the end of the day Spotify financially.  Yes.  Well one Spotify doesn't have that many users in the grand  scheme things 70 million or I mean Spotify's got what they

Start time: 4396.86
End time: 4399.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 4399.64
End time: 4452.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the issue with Spotify though is in any sort of content  you have two sides.  You have the content production you have the content consumption  Apple will have the same production side as as Spotify.  I think I missed Apple music discussion.  Sorry, but the whole point why Apple's hands are relatively  tight here is because music is utterly and completely controlled  by the labels right the positive side of that is that Apple  immediately has the same library that Spotify does right.  So the production side is the same and then they can do battle  for for the consumption side and again Apple has big advantages  here.  They have a built-in their default but Spotify's big  manages to they have a freeware that Apple doesn't and actually  the real kind of important player in the room is YouTube,  which is where speaking of all the kids that's where they're  what that's where they're getting all my both my 20 and 23

Start time: 4461.70
End time: 4516.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the issue with YouTube gaming and Twitch is that Twitch  has a two-sided network going on.  They have the people who are doing the playing and the people  who are doing the watching and it's much harder to break  into a two-sided network because you need to get both sides  to switch at the same right and a nice interface will help  but it's only going to get you so far.  So that's why there's been talk about them paying some players  doing some various stuff to give people switch over which  which they'll they will need to do.  Frankly, the big screw-up was not buying Twitch.  It wasn't that expensive.  It was like 900 million should have on it or something.  Yeah, and frankly this gets to a bigger problem with Google,  which is they probably have the worst case of not invented  here syndrome of anyone in the Valley and they bought YouTube  and look how well that turned out for them.  But for some reason the lesson that took away is we shouldn't  do big acquisitions.  We should just copy the leader and try to build it ourselves  which hasn't succeeded at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They should still buy Twitter.  I think why not now?

Start time: 4528.78
End time: 4571.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, because when and if they do they're paying 10x what  they would have had to pay a few years ago.  They should have bought a cheaper but they can afford Twitter  product that frankly hasn't evolved since they considered  buying the first time so I'm not sure what they're paying for  the the but this is a consistent problem for Google and something  that Facebook to its credit has learned about and done differently  is that appreciating like the actually for big company,  which have your big product your big breakthrough product.  The best way to next big through product is to use the profits  from the first one to buy it.  This whole bias towards we have to invent it and NIH not invented  here syndrome is debilitating and it's a problem for Google  and you're seeing it play out right here.

Start time: 4572.32
End time: 4587.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Excellent point.  So really what we're saying is Google Google gaming is compared  to to a twitch as maybe Yahoo video would be compared to  YouTube.  It's like it's too late.  All the creators are at Twitch.

End time: 4631.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, the question is whether live-streaming eSports is  solidified at Twitch if it is then Ben's absolutely right and  what YouTube is gambling on is we are the hard drive that  Twitch streamers store to we have PewDiePie and a few other  people if we can pay the publishers in the eSports organizations  and wrench them away.  Maybe we have a shot it is still a tall ask though Ben's  absolutely right.

Start time: 4631.86
End time: 4641.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  What they like they may succeed.  You're right.  The point is though.  I don't think that changes the fact they were wrong to not  pay 1.2 billion for Twitch or over what you would have  taken.

Yeah.  And so I think as I understand it that was the primary driver  that said, you know now they're to Tom's point, you know  certainly if if Twitch needs help building up their  infrastructure and their hard drive capability you could  hardly ask for a better partner.

Transcript:  Yeah, like you know the challenge that Google will have  with luring the game broadcasters over feels real and  very different from the one that Apple has of luring musicians  over because to your point been it's the same players on one  side and they're much more portable.  But I just I suspect that the streaming gaming eSports  universe is so young that in 15 years you could be like what  was Twitch?  Yeah, you might be right because I think about you all

Transcript:  It was this year for sure.  We didn't have any big hardware announcements.  In fact everybody thought we were going to get more hardware  announcements around the virtual reality sets Oculus made  their announcement last week and project Morpheus.  They didn't say a whole lot about in the Sony announcement.  The biggest announcement to me is not what everybody else  thinks was the biggest announcement, but it was the  project or Sony's PlayStation view television service came  to LA and San Francisco so I could finally sign up.  Can you see it?  Are you watching it?  Yeah, yeah, it's an interesting interface.  It misses all the ABC Disney channels, but otherwise it looks  like a regular cable service with you know, lots of cable  channels and it works really well.

Start time: 4816.46
End time: 4818.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In fact, of course Apple is going to get all the Disney  stuff.

Start time: 4819.54
End time: 4829.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but it does TV has a bunch of the ABC Disney stuff.  So if you cobble those two together problem is sling TV  isn't on Sony PlayStation 4.  So you have to have two devices.

Transcript:  So Sony is interesting did kind of beat Apple to the punch  with this live streaming thing.  Apple didn't release the new Apple TV at WWDC as everybody  thought and come E3 a week later Sony steals the attention.  How about Steam VR?  I thought a lot of people were very interested in this combination  between HTC's Vive VR headset and Steam and people I've  talked to who've tried all of the different VR headsets  are saying this is the one.  Any thoughts about that time?  Did you have you tried the VS team?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I haven't tried the Vive but you're right everybody.  I know who's tried it.  They're going crazy.  It's great.  Yeah, everybody likes the new Oculus as well.  The Vive is going to beat the Oculus to market if they hit  their date and that might give them a little bit of an  advantage there.  But they didn't make any big announcements.  The biggest announcement around the Steam VR was that Microsoft  said they would support it.  But of course valve didn't really say much about it and it  ended up being more about well, it'll work on Windows machines  is what it sounds like.

Transcript:  Microsoft showed once again and they've done it now three  times a look at their augmented reality HoloLens glasses.  And again the complaints that it's just a little slot you're  looking through.  In fact, some people were a little upset at the Microsoft  video that they showed at the Xbox One press conference  because it implied that you had a much bigger field of view.  They shot showed a guy look at a table and his Minecraft  castle is emerging from the table.  They didn't show it the way the guy was seeing it, which is  like looking through a cereal box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Some of the people who played that Minecraft thing said it  was still pretty cool.  Even with the limited field of view seems cool.  It got mixed reviews.  Mixed.  All right.  Anything else?  The biggest thing to come out of E3 was the fallout shelter  app for iOS.

Start time: 4942.32
End time: 4963.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That is an awesome app.  It's really good.  Bethesda is not dumb because they're of course they're  marketing fallout 4 which will come out not for a month or  so, right?  August I think.  Or is it not till next year?  I can't see this is the problem with E3.  You look at this stuff and it's like, oh I got to wait eight  months for this fallout 4 and the Pip Boy edition.  November 10th.  November.

Transcript:  I don't know.  I feel like this is a little the conversation is a little  dismissive for an industry that is I think 92 billion dollars  larger than movies and music combined.  I believe or at least it's close to it.  And we don't have a problem with movies showing trailers  a year in advance.  We all win bananas about the Star Wars trailer.  Yeah.  So I guess from my I don't know for my estimation it seemed  to be a pretty a pretty positive E3 by and large and the  hardware is I mean the hardware is what it is.  It's going to come out every five six six seven years.  I think what's what's interesting is the is that I think  people in tech just just have never really taken gaming  probably as seriously as they should and everyone including  me at one point has been like profsying its doom in the face  of phones and all this sort of stuff and the reality is is  it provides particularly this high-end sort of gaming that  again, we're all probably too old to figure out the 47  buttons that you need to do it.  It provides a very differentiated experience that people  are demonstrably willing to pay for just as people are willing  to pay for movies and willing to pay for high-quality TV.  And I think once you view it through that lens the entire  conference and industry starts to make a lot more sense.

Transcript:  Yeah, there were some big game announcements, you're absolutely  right Ben.  If there was a criticism was that we saw a lot of sequels  and especially under Sony a lot of those big names just like  a movie in the next year like the movie but yeah, it is very  similar.  I think though you should play Fallout Shelter on iOS.  It's awesome because then I think you still might agree  that that was the biggest thing to come out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, the whole idea is it's kind of a...  It's a sim for your Fallout Shelter and it's the prequel  to Fallout 4 because the whole point of Fallout 4 is you've  been in a Fallout Shelter for a hundred years and you come  out and you emerge into this dystopian world.  But at least until that happens in November we can manage  our Fallout Shelter.  I love that Bethesda's really got the style.  It's like a disaster prep app.  I like that.  Yeah, it's disaster prep.

Transcript:  I have to say I've had it on my iPad for a while and it's  really fun.  Unfortunately, I have to now log in the game center to get  my game.  So I'll just...  I don't remember the code for my Fallout Shelter.  Yeah.  Let's take a break.  We're going to talk about the future of Twitter.  It's a little bit up in the air.  Little bit, little teeny weeny bit up in the air.  But first a word from personal capital.  If you are like a lot of people, you're putting, I hope,  putting money aside for your future, for your rainy day  fund, for your retirement.  But if you're like a lot of geeks, you're probably doing  one of two things either.  And I think most geeks don't do this, but maybe you've like  hired an investment advisor and maybe you weren't really  thinking about it.  But you know, often cases that guy's really just a salesman.  His whole goal is to get you to trade more to buy stocks  so he can make more money.  Or see this is what I did.  Oh, no, I'll do it all myself using a, you know, online  service and I'll pay close attention then you forget.  And you just pay no attention to your investment and you  don't know what's happening.  Personal capital is designed to really do a better job for  you on both counts.  For the geek among us, in fact, you go there right now  personalcapital.com slash twit.  You could sign up absolutely free for their dashboard,  which will combine all your accounts together, give you  a great idea, not only of your net worth, but where your  investments are going and where years are being shaved off  your retirement by hidden costs, brokerage fees, high,  low mutual funds, things like that.  It'll also help you keep track of and this is really important  your asset allocation so that you make sure that as your  portfolio works and you gain you rebalance it so you make  sure that everything is properly done for your time frame  for your, you know, when you retire your risk tolerance,  what your goals are and all of that.  It makes it easy to do that.  They have an Apple Watch app that will give you alerts.  They have an Android Wear app.  Same thing.  It's available for desktop, for mobile, for tablet, and this  is free.  And by the way, very secure.  Don't worry.  It's absolutely secure to do this.  You can open your free account, link your investments in  your bank account and in seconds, you're going to get  a complete view of your net worth in real time in one  secure place.  It's got, they call it, I think this is true.  It's like a fitness tracker for your finances.  Now let's talk about the financial advisor side of it  because if you do have a salesman as a stock broker,  you're really getting terrible advice.  I'm going to be honest.  The financial advisors at Personal Capital have a fiduciary  responsibility for your best interest.  They do not work on commission.  They work for you.  They are set up carefully to avoid any conflict of interest.  So in fact, you're getting great advice.  You can even take advantage of it for free.  If you put $100,000 or more into your assets on the Personal  Capital Dashboard, and that's a lot easier than you think  if you've been saving, you'll get a free 30-minute review  of your financial goals, your risk tolerance, get to know  a financial advisor.  They'll help you with your time, horizon, and your retirement  planning, and that is absolutely free with no obligation.  No, there's no pressure, nothing like that.  And if you decide later, you can invest with Personal  Capital, but we don't even have to talk about that.  Do the free stuff now.  personalcapital.com personalcapital.com slash  tweet you owe it to yourself to do this.  It does not take a lot of work.  I did it two years ago.  I couldn't be happier.  It really made a big difference for me.  And if you would put more than $100,000 of assets on the dashboard,  you can get that free, no obligation, no cost portfolio  consultation as well.  personalcapital.com slash tweet.  It's been a great way to keep track of what's going on with my money.  And I'm very grateful to Bill Harris for telling me all about it.  Moving on Twitter, new CEO.  Well, Jack Dorsey is in right now and his beard in charge of Twitter  at the moment.  Dick Costello will actually not at the moment.  Dick Costello will be stepping down at the end of the month.  He will still be on the board with Jack Dorsey and Evan Williams.  Those will be fun meetings.  It's the CEO Club.  It's the club.  All the guys.

Transcript:  They have a whiskey drink.  They're going to...  You know, some of this comes from Chris Saka, right?  And he's an investor in Twitter and he wrote a kindly but strongly  worded memorandum about what should happen.  Twitter is responding to market pressures because the markets  have been slowly beheading people at the sea level in the Twitter  boardrooms and finally got to Dick Costello.  Everybody likes...  Do you know Dick?  You must know him, Barrett Sunday.

Start time: 5434.57
End time: 5459.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have...  I don't know him.  I know of him.  Yeah, everybody loves him.  He's funny.  I'm excited to have a comedian as the CEO of a major Silicon Valley company.  It's about time.  But I guess no more clowns in charge now.  But I think he did good.  And I like this tone.  I think when he came out publicly and said, we're doing a bad job  as Twitter at dealing with...  And it's my fault.  And it's my fault.

Start time: 5459.80

Transcript:  I don't see that.  I mean, again, from whether it's business or political leaders,  people usually try to dodge.  They have scapegoats, they have excuses, they blame the machines.  And I just think he owned it.  And that was really great.  But in his Q&A and the articles that you're starting to talk about,  he also...  I tend to believe him.  He's like, look, I've been here six years.  We want to keep this thing going.  I'm not dead yet.  He had a little kind of a Monty Python moment in the interview saying  I'll still be very much involved, still on the board.  And let's see what comes next.  I like the hints of what's coming next.  And I got to share a very strange personal connection to this story.  I know I'm not the new CEO.

Start time: 5501.00
End time: 5510.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know where you're going with this because even Jason loved this.  Jason Calacanis wrote an article on what he would do.  Yeah.  And for reasons I don't understand, you decided to record it.

Start time: 5511.04
End time: 5590.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So he wrote this essay.  Jason said what I would do if I were CEO of Twitter, a seven-part plan.  Yeah.  I got an email.  He sends this out in his email newsletter.  I happen to open it.  I rarely open email newsletters, but it was like one in the morning.  I thought why not?  And I saw I shared it.  I liked it so much that I shared it out on Twitter.  And someone responded to me and Jason saying basically it's too long.  Jason, you need to make an audiobook version.  And so now it's maybe 1 20 a.m.  And I decided what better to do with my time than to record aloud this article  offering audio commentary along the way, basically an audio annotated version of  me dramatically reenacting this essay on the hypothetical CEO of Twitter.  Then that hit another chain in the link, another link in the chain, a man named  Mark Eglin created an app on Product Hunt to support the idea of getting audio  versions of tech essays you want to read.  So if you visit Baratunde, but it's dot D E.  So B A R A T U N dot D E.  You can sign up to kind of be a lot of this future readings that I might do of  other articles out there and not just me.  This is not just a certain.  Can I do one?  Of course you can.  I think we can turn this into a thing though.  And I know so many people.  Did you do some comedy?

Start time: 5590.06

End time: 5610.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like I said, I gave I didn't do his voice, but I did mock him a bit for  some of the commentary that he had in there.  He's you know, he just drops first names of CEOs like, oh yeah, like one club.  I don't know who you're talking about, buddy.  Right.  So I would think of them as audio annotations.  It was like a MST 3000.

Transcript:  So yeah, big, big love to Mark Egglund.  I love this.  He actually launched all this and without talking to me initially.  And then he emailed me like, dude, are we cool?  Like, are you okay with this?  And I just kind of think about it.  I think, you know, the service's name will in likely change, but I'm happy to  co-incubate the concept and, uh, and I like reading.  I have a Frederick Douglass talk.  I did my fast company, plugging all in my sound cloud to help again, see the  service and see where this goes.  I know so many people who insta paper long reads and never get to them.  Right.  And so it'd be nice to be able to kind of take it and speech to text.  I'm sorry.  Text to speech isn't sexy.  Like I use it a lot because my eyes were all messed up from the surgery and those  voices, even the ones that you download that are like a gig on your phone.  They're nothing like what you can get from an impassioned actual human voice.

Oh, when bit.ly started offering custom short URLs, I created baritone.de  as my short URL for anything.  I lapsed and let the domain expire.  Some German spam harassing a horrible company got it.  And I was like, well, I don't care about it.  Once you lose something, you just justify it.  Like I didn't care about that anyway.  And then he basically brought it back into orbit.  So it's like in the family again.  And again, he's, he's Mark with a C Eglen.  He's been great.  And I think people should, should check it out.  I hope he continues to run with it.

Transcript:  So anyway, back to Twitter though.  I mean, the, what, the substance of what they're starting to talk about with this  idea of, what are they calling it?  Enlightening?  Lightning.  The idea of packaging up live events.  I mean, Twitter is where so many of us go.  I mean, the whole idea of tweeting about your sandwich really is not what it's  been about for a very long time though.  It's still easily mocked for all that.  But when the NBA finals are happening, when there's a shooting, that's when you  go to Twitter, when the, when the world cup is up or the Superbowl, you want to  go to that water cooler and the, they're basically saying that they're going to  take an editorial role in packaging up that event from Vine, Periscope and Twitter.  And creating a stream almost like a Snapchat story.  I, this is my first thought when I started reading about it, that will be viable  whether you're logged in or not.  I work in a Twitter app or the website and can be embedded  ultimately in other people's sites.  And then they'll let that publishing tool open so that folks can make their own.  I love this.  It's basically takes Storify, turns it up 5,000 notches and, and you have a  different window into, into an experience that only a tool like Twitter could be  mining and the way that Google mind its videos on YouTube to create this, this  game streaming service, Twitter's kind of.

Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, the, the, the big problem for Twitter though, I mean, not, not to  say that's not a problem.  But the big problem for Twitter and for Dick Costello specifically, and I actually  wrote, I don't, I don't like doing this, but I wrote a piece at the, at the  beginning of May saying that Twitter needed to change its, its leadership.  And the reason I said they needed to do that was because Dick Costello lost  credibility and he lost credibility long since with third party developers.  That's well documented.

Start time: 5903.18
End time: 5915.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's not Dick's fault.  They lost them before Dick came along, didn't he?  No.  Dick's been charged in 2010.  So he's the guy who stripped away the third party.  Yes.  Yes.  It seems like that was Twitter's strategy for some time though.

Transcript:  It changed under him.  Okay.  To, you say that Wall Street's been chasing after executives.  Wall Street hasn't been causing the, the carousel of executives that has  happened under Costello most damagingly when it comes to the head of product,  which has been cycled through regularly.  They hired someone last year who had tweeted 70, 72 times ever,  the format of Google maps.  And finally, I think they, they found someone good with Kevin wheel, who  I think has been doing a good job.  But the reality is, is there'd been a loss of credibility when it comes  to just the, the, the day-to-day management of the company.  And I think you saw that reflected in Twitter, all this turmoil.  I mean, Twitter has had a history of turmoil and to some degree, you  know, Costello settled that down.  But the fact of the matter is, is there was wholesale changes in  the executive suite every year still.  And the third thing though, the most damaging one at least for him  specifically was with the last earnings report, they lost credibility  with Wall Street and they, they had sold this story that our slow user  numbers are okay because we're growing revenue at crazy, but then the  revenue slowed and, and once, and the problem is you can do a  pivot and a turnaround as a, as a public company.  Sorry.  That's the most recent analysis as the item block.  I get the new link.

Transcript:  The, the, the problem though is right now, as long as Costello was in  charge, they weren't going to have the room and freedom to do the sort  of innovations and product changes that, that they need to do.  And so my problem with, so, so the weird thing though is this is all  a timing thing when it comes to building technology, we all know it  takes years before you actually see the finished product and it come out.  And so the stuff that's happening.  So the problem though is that that works for the other side, the problems  that Costello had with the last earnings report and over the last several  months, those seeds were sown a couple of years ago and he's just reaping them now.  Now it, it may be the case that Twitter's already turned the corner and  that they turn the corner under Dick Costello.  And in that respect, it's not fair that he has to go now when Twitter is now  making the source of changes and releasing products they need to do.  Unfortunately, life isn't fair.  He's reaping kind of the, the, you know, perception matters and the  perception is that Twitter is struggling now again, even if the struggles  now are manifestations of struggles from two years ago internally.  And so I think it was right for him to go.  And my problem with this lightning release now is it's not even going  to be ready for a few months.  So why not hold off on it?  What the new CEO come in, whoever it may be, and then release all these  new products like, wow, it's fantastic.  And of course we all know all those products were started before the new  CEO came on board, but like the story you tell matters, perception matters.  And I would love to have seen them usher in the new CEO with the, the  sense of momentum and things are going forward and extend the grace period  that any new CEO gets by a few months, by a few quarters.  And so I'm a little like, I think in general, there's lots of stuff going in  the right direction for Twitter, but as usual, it's just kind of a jumbled mess.  I now have the entire, no, that's good.

Transcript:  So it's entirely his doing to abandon the third party developers, the  developers that made Twitter the success they were and pull it back in.  I understand why they did it.  They wanted to monetize the website and monetize their own apps.

Start time: 6157.74
End time: 6191.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you see a lot of other companies doing the same thing.  So there's no guarantee other executives wouldn't have done the same thing.  But yeah, that's really interesting insights Ben, because from the outside  it always looks like Twitter's fairly stable.  It's not burning up the charts, but it's got, you know, some monthly active users.  It seems to be finding interesting ways to make revenue.  And then you hear about all of these things going on inside, which are just  utter turmoil.  I think if you get the right person in charge that can actually stabilize that  personality aspect of running the business.  Twitter is in really good health otherwise, no?

Start time: 6191.92
End time: 6265.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean to a degree they are.  I mean, again, their revenue continues to grow even with the shortfall last  quarter. It continues to grow very, very well.  And they're a $2 billion company.  The struggle, the challenge for Twitter is there's a question as to what's the  ceiling on that in particular because their user growth numbers have stalled  and or slowed down significantly.  And the concern for that is there are close to, at least according to  Christaka's post, last we know publicly is 700 million.  Christaka said close to a billion abandoned accounts.  And the reason why that's so challenging is usually the struggle for a company  is to make themselves, make users aware of their product and get them to try it.  Twitter doesn't have that problem.  Everyone knows about Twitter.  And by the numbers, everyone has tried Twitter and the vast majority of people  decided it's not for me.  And the challenge is it's much harder to get someone to give you a second chance  than it is to get them to give you a first chance.  And that's why Twitter spends a lot of time talking about logged out users and  all the other users we reach because there is real concern they may have missed  the boat when it comes to getting everyone on the service regularly.

Start time: 6265.68
End time: 6319.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they, I mean if Twitter is becoming more of the direction that they're going  with with the lightning thing and with actually honestly with what Jason  proposed they focus on in his piece that I've most identified with, which was  video and more of a broadcast service.  Twitter is full of lurkers and there's a basically a read-only mode that the  majority of people engage with.  And so they don't need people to come back as users in the same way that a  the TV network just they need viewers more.  So if they're really becoming your window on what's happening right now or your  window in the key events and trends of the world.  So that relationship is not the Facebook user uploading all of their baby photos  and personal information to be shared with a close network.  It is the television viewer.  It's the film go where it's the music listener.  That's an excellent point.  Those billion people might come back as viewers, as consumers not as creators and

Start time: 6319.24
End time: 6320.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you don't care if they're creators.

Start time: 6320.84
End time: 6366.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but the problem is those viewers not logged in are worth a fraction of what  they are if they're logged in because they can't be they can't be tracked and  they can't be served.  Well they're seeing the ads.  They're seeing the ads.  No, it's fine.  It's a perfectly fine business.  The problem is it's a business that doesn't justify their current valuation.  Their current valuation is based on the idea.  They will have a large base of of users that they know that they are logged in  that they understand Twitter has a very fascinating insight onto its logged in  users because it understands your interests, which is even more compelling  than the people I know or the number of babies I have.  The problem is is that's what their valuation is primarily been based on.  And the reality is they may be more of a broadcast network, which is a fine  business, but that's the business Yahoo is in.  And last I checked Yahoo isn't worth $25 billion.

Start time: 6368.36
End time: 6376.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Although it's also the business YouTube is in.  So it sounds to me like Twitter just needs to get on figuring out how to get  people to log in for reasons other than posting.

Start time: 6376.92
End time: 6399.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And maybe maybe the answer is that Google absorbs its users and now you're  already you're always logged in because we're always logged into Google.  And so they Google now actually becomes Google now.  Which is Twitter and whatever they're calling Google now is it becomes some  other smart recommendation thing.  But this is happening right now.  Check it out.  You know that if Google bought Twitter, it would be gone in five months.

Transcript:  Well, first off, first off, Yahoo is worth $25 billion, but that's because of  Alibaba, the core Yahoo business.  But to yeah, you guys just said the point YouTube, Google, the whole point  of Google Plus and why Google Plus was much more of a success than people  realize is the big the big overarching thing was the architectural changes  to Google sites to make them all have a shared common login and to make  sure we're all logged in all the time.  And and share data.  Actually, it turns out five years ago, most people weren't logged in most  the time.  Now they all are.  And so Google is building that that that profile of you that is super  duper valuable.  And so it's not like YouTube for that reason, for that reason alone.  Very interesting.

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by Harry's the best shave experience you'll ever have guys.  I know no one really enjoys shaving.  Certainly not Jack Dorsey.  But maybe if Jack Dorsey had found Harry's,  well, it'd be a whole different world today, huh?  Harry's is amazing.  These guys actually one of them was a co-founder of Warby Parker.  And there's a great article about Harry's.  Where was it?  Business Insider?  I'll have to see if I can find it.  Where they talk about so they wanted to do, you know, razor blades direct,  but they wanted to do it right.  They did some investigation.  They found out that there really only two factories in the whole world  that make the best razor blades and they bought one of them.  That's what venture money will help you do.  They bought the factory and now  because they're selling direct to you from the factory,  you get a great blade designed for performance,  for sharpness, for durability,  and you get it at a great price.  About $4 a blade for the Jet Gillette Fusion.  Half that for a Harry's blade and it's better.  Plus Harry's will give you a great,  it's too late for Father's Day,  but if you forgot Father's Day, man,  quickly go to harrys.com, get that Winston set.  We can get a monogram with Dad's initials or the Truman.  $15 for the Truman and you get three blades, a razor handle,  the incredible Harry's, either the shave cream or the foam gel.  You get the travel holder for the Harry's which don't undersell that.  That's really valuable.  And you can take $5 off when you use the offer code TWIT5.  So now we're talking 10 bucks.  You don't have to tell Dad that you only paid $10.  You get a great razor, great handle.  And then every month or every other month you get blades from Harry's.  It's just a more efficient company,  which means you get a better price and a better blade.  And of course Harry's guarantees your satisfaction.  I shave every morning with my Harry's.  I love them.  In fact, we, I think we had to have three or four Harry's in the house  because you know what?  She likes them too.  Harry's.com.  Use the offer code TWIT5 to get $5 off your first purchase.  TWIT5 at Harry's.com.  Everybody sent me the Harry's article.  And I'm trying to remember where I saw that.  Sent me links and stuff.  Oh, well.  It's a great story.  They spent a hundred million dollars on the razor blade factory.

Transcript:  All right.  I do think though, I mean you made the, you made the kind of VC off-handed remark.  It's interesting because I know you know this Leo,  but I think in general there tends to be this perception that,  oh, it's not fair.  They have VC money, blah, blah, blah.  Or, you know, oh, like there's this idea that it's this candy jar  that you get to just dip into and there's no consequences for it.  I mean the VC money like has to be, has to be earned back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you're seeing it in Twitter right now.  People are like, why doesn't Twitter do this or why do they go public  or investors are so mean?  And the reason why Twitter is a public company is because they had a ton of venture money  that paid for Twitter to dink around for years.  We'll figure out what they wanted to do with this great product they had.  And that venture company needs an exit.  And so they went public and now they have to deal with Wall Street.  And like all this is interconnected.  And so it's just, I just find it funny on one hand people will say,  oh, they have venture money.  It's so easy for them.  I'm saying again, I'm not saying you were saying that,  but people do have that sort of attitude.  And then the flip side, they'll be like, oh, why are investors so mean to Twitter?  Like just let them be a little business.  And like all this stuff is interconnected.  You don't get one without the other.

Start time: 6984.06
End time: 7024.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and there's reasons why you might want to go out and raise $125 million.  One of them would be that you see the best way to make your business work  is to buy the factory.  And then there's reasons why you don't.  I don't want anybody to tell me what to do.  And so we're very content to grow Twitter at a slow pace  and spend only the money we have.  Yeah, sure, we could grow at a much faster pace.  We could be like Revision 3, which had an exit and everything,  and the investors got paid back.  But I kind of prefer this model.  And Tom, you've got a great model.  We should mention DTNS at Patreon.  It's patreon.com slash ace D-Tech.

Transcript:  Right, exactly.  And so that's the trade-off, right?  And Patreon and Kickstarter and all of these companies  are providing a really interesting experiment in,  you know, how far can we go down the idea of cutting out business models?  I think it's very similar to branded content as well,  where people are trying to figure out,  well, can we actually pay to make credible content directly on the advertisers?  It's similar to ad reads like you've done for years in Twitter.  These are all just different ways of figuring out how can we fund what we're doing.  And so, yeah, I'm lucky enough that it's worked out well for me on Patreon.

So Pebble went to Kickstarter the first time  and they had one of the most successful Kickstarters of all time,  created the company really.  But then after the companies of, you know, going concerned,  they went back to Twitter to raise money again,  this time 20 million dollars to create Pebble Time.  Is that kosher?

Start time: 7112.32
End time: 7120.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Start time: 7124.98
End time: 7157.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I know. And Pebble had to be very careful about how they worded that.  But I think Pebble honestly was trying to honor their roots.  And you see a lot of there was a video game announced at E3 in the Sony Press Conference,  Shenmue 3, where they're using Kickstarter as sort of the launchpad for it  to kind of collect some money at the beginning.  But they certainly aren't getting all the money they would need to make it.  And they wouldn't need to have to do it that way.  It's just another way to get the word out and build a list of the most passionate fans.

Transcript:  I had actually a good conversation with Chris Hardwick.  I was on The Nerdist on Thursday.  I think that show comes out in a few weeks.  We talked about Veronica Mars.  And that's an example of really the production company that made the original Veronica Mars  said nobody wants this.  We're not going to make it.  And then the guy behind it said, well, what if I went to Kickstarter and demonstrated  look, it's not going to be raising enough money to make it.  But if I demonstrated a real interest people showing out actual money, would you make it then?  And he did.  Well, I don't remember what he raised for Veronica Mars.  A lot of money.  Yeah, wasn't enough.  So Fox or whoever made made more put more in and it was a flop.  So I don't know what to do.  What do you get out of that?  It was the people's flop, Leo.

Transcript:  Well, I mean, I think I think it's fine.  I mean, it's you when you ask if it's not kosher, it's not kosher according to Kickstarter's  own definition of what their site is about to take this full circle Kickstarter as 10  million dollars in venture capital.  So if it turns out this is the best way to to build a business around it, I'm sure they'll  be happy to do it to make it kosher.

Transcript:  I think I'm interested in that point because I have it and like it and I have worn it every  day since I have.  I have.  But I'm I was a watch wearer before.  So to me, it's a watch that does more.  It shows the time and it also shows for me.  My favorite is the temperature.  And and I like the notifications.  Again, I had already taken a step to kind of curb my notifications on my phone long before  then.  So it was never I didn't get the overwhelming notification issue that some people complained  about.  But I mean, I frankly think that's how Apple should have marketed it.  It's like it's a watch that does more.  And then over time, what the additional functionality revealed itself, which I mean, I think the  most compelling functionality anyway is the way in which it might let you interact with  your world.  Right.  You can kind of see with Apple Pay, but imagine if your car started with your watch or your  your house unlocked with your watch.  And I think that's a realistic long term vision.  But there's no need to sell it that way.  Now it's like with the iPhone, the iPhone was a phone that did more and Apple didn't  need to sell it in 2007 as the most important computer in life.  And you will actually have people in the Wall Street Journal writing articles that Apple  should discontinue the Mac.  Like they didn't need to say that in 2007, even if that was the future.  And it just feels like the company got a little ahead of itself.  And the apps are all are terrible because of the hybrid app thing.  Like, why be a little patient and wait for the apps to be ready?  You know, like watch without apps.  I think they should have done.  I think it would have it would have really crystallized what the watch is and what it's  not in a way that would have been beneficial to to the product.

Transcript:  2007, Ben, I don't know if you remember it was a it was a simpler time.  It was a more innocent time for our industry, for our nation.  And so we got to keep keep that in mind.  The idea that they would launch without apps the way they did the phone.  I don't know if they could afford that again.  I mean, they they'd launched that phone without basic phone stuff, too.  And they launched it without basic computer stuff like cut and paste.  And they were cut a lot of slack for that.  But seeing how much they learned and earned from having an app marketplace, it feels like  they wouldn't want to repeat that probation period of just native apps.

Start time: 7474.01
End time: 7566.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But credible in what respect?  Credible as in they exist, but no one actually is wearing any of this stuff.  I mean, the reality is, let's play it out.  They launched without an app store.  And every review is like, oh, it like instead of saying it's slow and and frustrating,  because all the built in apps are speedy and snappy.  Like there's and like, oh, it's great.  I mean, you don't you need it. Of course you don't need it.  You don't need to watch. But boy, it's really handy to have this this extra stuff on your wrist.  When you need to see it, look down to the temperature, see my next appointment, you know,  and then the apps are banned. Won't it be great once they have apps?  It's a it gets a ding because they aren't there.  But it's a it's a optimistic thing.  It's like imagine how great it's going to be when they arrive.  Instead, they watch these hybrid half ass apps.  So I don't know if you'd say on the show. No, it's true.  You can say it if it's true.  But that the net result is to make it a worse experience.  And to make the perception of the watch worse than it ought to be.  And frankly, I think it's troubling.  Like what we what makes Apple great is its ability to focus on delivering the best possible experience at the expense of features.  And then what they do is they iterate, they iterate, they iterate.  Like this is what Apple does.  Every product they want launches with missing something important.  But what is there works perfectly.  That's not what happened with the watch.  What is there does not work perfectly because the apps stink and they think they were afraid.

Start time: 7566.44
End time: 7570.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 7571.27
End time: 7595.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's like since when is Apple afraid?  Yeah. Like that's that's what worries me.  Sure. Let people say that and deliver something that is great, that works great, which again, I think the watch works great except for the apps.  Right. Like all the other stuff works very works very well.  And deliver that and let people be frustrated that it's not good enough.  I'd argue they have it.

Start time: 7607.67
End time: 7638.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Once the whole app part is gone, though, the UI simplifies considerably because you don't have because a big problem is almost these two modes.  Right. There's the app mode and then there's the watch face mode.  Like once there's only one mode, all that stuff gets a lot simpler.  And so that actually solves multiple problems with it.  I agree with you that especially at the beginning, it's confusing, which again, I think begs the question, why make it confusing so we can deliver half as apps when we know we can deliver full apps in six months?

Transcript:  Well, and also there's a consideration.  I don't think they're going to update these the hardware yearly as they have with the phone and the pad.  I feel like there's a risk to coming out with another one in the spring and they're probably much more likely to go a two year cycle or a three year cycle.  Right.

Transcript:  Well, I mean, Mark Gurman released a report this week giving details of the next one that's supposed to come next year.  I mean, I would expect them.  I see your point, but I think it will be risky, especially if you sold $17,000 ones.  People, if you if you if you bought a $17,000 watch, you can afford to buy another one next year.  I mean, the reality is is $70,000 watch tuition.

Transcript:  Who is buying who is buying a $70,000 Apple watch with their kids' college tuition?  I'm not sure that that's Apple's problem.  The reality is, is the I calculated this up for but I can't remember what it was.  So 17,000, sorry, divided by 350 equals 40.  So the $70,000 watch is 48 times the the entry level watch.  Last I checked, there are a lot of people in the world making more than 48 times the amount of money I make.  Right. So on a relative basis, the people buying the $70,000 watch are actually spending less than I am.  Right. I actually have a stainless steel one.  Well, OK, that's interesting.

Transcript:  I mean, one of the things they said in one of the earnings calls, I think last year about the iPad is we just didn't know what the update cycle would be for people.  We were guessing because it was a new product.  I think they're doing the same thing with the watch.  They don't know when the markets.  You know, am I willing to buy a new watch every year?  We don't know that.

Start time: 7741.83
End time: 7775.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I know.  That's a very fair question.  It's a reason why, you know, I think particularly in the short term, the impact of the watch on their financial results will be will be modest.  And I think that's a great point.  I mean, and I would expect their veils.  I mean, they are supporting the iPad all the way back, multiple generations.  I would expect to do the same for the watch.  Then again, you'd expect the watch any product in its first few years that's winning to get better.  Yeah. Yeah. So it'll be it'll be interesting.  I mean, FC, we're going to move on because we're almost out of time.

One hundred million dollars for misleading people saying you have an unlimited data plan when in fact it was going to be throttled.

Start time: 7803.50
End time: 7813.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And the FCC is proposing the fine.  AT&T's got 30 days to respond to it.  And what they're saying is you weren't clear enough about the implications of the throttle.

My iPhone is powered by AT&T.  The iPad is on Verizon.  So I get a little backup thing.  But this is a text message came in on June 14th, 1146 a.m.  AT&T free message that didn't charge me for this rebuke.  Your data has reached 75 percent. Yeah.  Five gig by network management threshold. Yeah.  The network management, which is nothing I've ever heard of before.  If you exceed five gigabytes this month, you may experience reduced data speeds at times.  And in areas that are experiencing networks congestion, Wi-Fi helps you avoid reduced speeds, a.k.a.  get off, get off our network, get off our network.

Transcript:  How many Apple Watches is that?  Huge loss for free speech in Europe.  Mike Masnick at Techdirt writing about the European Court of Human Rights.  Delphi versus Estonia.  Delphi is a news site in Estonia, Russian and Estonian, a news site in which commenters were saying bad things.  The court said that even if a website took down comments after people complained, it could still be held liable.  It should have anticipated bad comments.

Start time: 7941.48
End time: 7988.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, T2T2 runs our chat room as Estonian.  And he made a point of emailing us at Daily Tech News Show and saying this is only the European Court  determining whether the Estonian Court applied its own rules properly.  This only applies to Estonia.  So it has a more limited impact than you might think.  And Estonian laws are different than the rest of Europe on this sort of thing.  The comments were deemed by the courts in Estonia to be unlawful because they were vicious.  They were hate speech, basically.  Yeah, and because of the way in which the comments section was set up, essentially.  There's still some troubling things in how the Estonian courts determined this,  saying that Delphi should have known ahead of time that people might post these types of comments.

Start time: 7988.92
End time: 8044.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that's good to know that it really only applies to Estonia.  It's the European Court ruling on Estonian law, essentially.  Yeah.  Okay, that's good to know.  Here's another one that's not clear.  Windows 10 will be free not only to Windows 7 and 8 users, but to anybody who signed up for the beta program,  which, by the way, is still open if you go to insider.window.com or microsoft.com.  This is so confusing.  Gabe all saying, you know, I'm going to have to ask Paul Thurotte and Mary Jo Foley what the hell this means.  Because we've seen this before with Microsoft implying that pirates, for instance,  would get to upgrade to Windows 10 and no longer be pirates.  They clarified later, no, that's not the case.  So I don't know.  But if this is true, it's basically saying anybody who wants to can get Windows 10 for free and a real Windows 10.  You know, like you install it, you get updates, you're licensed.

Start time: 8048.57
End time: 8104.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The reality is it doesn't really matter.  Something like 90% or 85% of Windows revenue comes from Windows that's installed on new PCs.  So the upgrade revenue stream has always been a relatively meaningless one.  And over the last few releases, they've been moving in this general direction.  It's just it's just another sign of how the world has has shifted previously under Microsoft's feet.  And now they're a little more much more aware that it's happening and moving forward.  I think the other thing that's interesting is I mean, Microsoft another rework this this week,  which really undid Balmer's rework at the end of his at the end of his time there, which was I wrote the time was disastrous even then.  And it's a very smart one.  I think what I think is most interesting is Windows is is in its own kind of corner and all the hardware stuck there, including Xbox.

Start time: 8111.16
End time: 8137.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. But I think the way to think about it is Microsoft has placed their bets on the cloud.  That's one division and cloud enterprise and kind of apps and productivity.  That's not the name of it, but is the other division.  And those are the ones that matter.  And everything else is in this Windows division.  And I don't think that that I think that's there's a clear delineation between future and past in this reorganization.  And I think that's interesting.

Mark Penn, the pollster who was fired from Hillary Clinton's campaign last time around.  And it was the guy who created the Scroogled campaign for Microsoft out.  He was in charge of vision, I think, in Microsoft, which sounds like they just kind of put him in a room and said, go think about things.  Chilu ascending.  He was the search genius who came from Yahoo to Microsoft.  He now is in charge of apps.  So it's a yeah, it is a shakeup, but it's it's such an Adela finishing kind of is the transition.  Right.

Transcript:  You're absolutely right. What the hell does that mean?  Yeah, we might even have to talk to Gabe.  Hey, we launched our new website this week.  I hope you are enjoying the new tweet.  I think we'll probably have to do a special where we describe some of the features and so forth.  One of the first things people told us is we don't like the way your download button works.  So we worked very quickly.  The new screensavers.  I don't know what's going on there.  We worked very quickly to make the download button work more like you'd expect it.  It comes from the fact that the mime type coming from Cashfly, our provider,  tells your browser stream it as you download it.  And most people did not want that.  There is a new download.  HTML5 has a new download attribute which we're using.  So if you're using Chrome and you click one of the buttons, it will just start downloading as you'd expect.  If you're using Safari or maybe Firefox, one of the browsers that doesn't support that new HTML5 command,  just right click and download as you used to do on the old site.  And we're working with Cashfly on a new way of doing this.  And I think we'll be able to make this work for everybody.  But we do appreciate hearing from you about the new site.  We're getting a lot of comments.  If you want to understand what we were trying to accomplish,  click the yellow button at the top where it says learn more.  And there's kind of a description of the planning and what went into this.  It's really much more than you see.  It's an API driven by Drupal that will be.  We are already 30 people have asked to get a key to the developer's API, which excites me.  It means that people are going to be start looking at making apps.  You can make your own website.  Everything you need is there.  We also know that the Kodi and Plex apps have stopped working.  They were relying on a feed that was never an official feed that came from our old Drupal site.  When we took the Drupal site offline, that stopped working.  If you are one of the developers of the Kodi or XBMC or Plex app, contact me.  There's a much better way to do it.  We got an API now.  You can actually do a really nice app a lot more easily than using the old RSS feeds.  We'd like to help you and make that work again.  But please let us know.
