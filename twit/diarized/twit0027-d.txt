Transcript:  This is TWIT, This Week in Tech, Episode 27 for the week of October 23rd, 2005.  I keep waiting for the applause. No applause! This shows you how much money we're spending on crew.  Too much, apparently. Let me introduce the TWITs going around the table. Alex Lindsay from Pixel  Core. Without him we wouldn't have this fabulous Big Head video that we're doing here. Speaking of  Big Heads, it's Patrick Norton of Digital Life TV. Why do I have a Big Head? Because you couldn't be on  the screen with me. It would look like Tweedledee and Tweedledum. Patrick's going great guns on DLTV.  You're like number six on iTunes. I hope so. Actually, we're doing a name shift and going to two  episodes a week in November. I don't know if there's gonna be some angry people in the TWIT world

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  about that. You're not using three cameras, are you? Yes, I am. Actually, we're using four. But you don't have XL2s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We can't afford XL2s. We can't either. John, but we got them. John C. Dvorak, of course, from  Dvorak.org slash blog. And a nice shirt today. And look who John drug in with him. Lawrence Lessig is here,  professor of law at Stanford Law School, founder for the Center for Internet and Society. It's great  to have you. Great to be here. Founder and president or chairman or what do you call yourself, the Creative  Commons? Just TWIT. The king. The king TWIT at Creative Commons. Without him we wouldn't have a  license. Thank you for that, Lawrence. It's great to have you here. And we missed an episode last week, so I  thought we'd just briefly mention this. It's old news now, but the video iPod is out and I've got one here.  Should I open this up? You had it for a while. You've been banging it up. I've had it for about three days. What do you think? Well, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  there's a lot of scratches on the stainless steel on the back. Oh my goodness, there's scratches on our iPod. How do you feel about class action lawsuits, Larry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is a class action lawsuit for scratches on the Nano. What's funny? Please. What is funny about this? Hey, it's plastic, it's scratches, it's metal, it's scratches, things scratch. Is it supposed to be scratch proof? Are they selling it as thus? I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The black ones are supposed to be worse than the... The fit and finish doesn't look to be as good on this as in previous iPods. Oh, it's scratched. Oh my god. Had it got spelled wrong. Let's see, I have to say it's a beautiful device, isn't it? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I couldn't believe how much thinner it was. It's nice. It's a pretty device. It's very big. And one of the things that we're doing, and we've already started with the last episode, but we're going to do it full bore with this episode, is producing the video of TWIT for this device. I mean, that's not the only device it'll play on, right? Right. No, no, it'll play on a lot of things, but I'm pretty excited about this one. You know, I think that I have a PSP that I've been wanting. So this is a regular iPod, right? Yeah. Now compare the two. You'll see that... Yeah, actually it's a little thinner. That's the 30. Now the 60's...  That's the 30. Now the 60's fatter, right? Yeah, that is a 60. Well, that's a 60. Essentially it looks the same with the bigger screen. And what are we going to encode in MPEG-4? We can look at the size. It's going to be encoded in MPEG-4. Not H.264. Evidently there is some rumors that the H.264 is still a little quirky on it, so we're going to stick with the MPEG-4. Yeah, can I have this? Yeah, sure. There you go. Everybody who joins us from now on gets a free video. Why not? We just spent $14,000 on cameras. You know what? I got a bad little...  kind of a surprise. It makes noise. Yeah, but you know, that's not real. Is it? It's a little piezoelectric... We can turn on the clicker if you want. I like the clicker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There is something about all of that. You know, the cameras that make the little... they have the digital... Fake. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's something about... one of the reasons for the success for this product, and I think the same reason that the internet was successful and the Macintosh has done so well and introduced the mouse is that there is this... any of this motion, there's an addictive mechanism involved here.  Twilling your thumb. Exactly. In fact, the same thing with the mouse. You can talk to psychiatrists about or psychologists about this, and there's an addictive mechanism here. It's compulsive.  And you're going to see this, by the way, this is... you heard this here first, on a phone coming out of Sweden called the NeoNode. Does it have a click wheel? It's totally thumb.  There's no dials or anything. The whole thing is a thumb motion, and it's one of the most popular phones right now in parts of like Russia or any place.  It's kind of a high-end phone that costs $450, but it has that same addictive quality, and it's going to be huge in this country when it comes out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is not a bad form factor for a phone, actually, the new iPod for video. I mean, that would be an okay phone.  That would be like Steve Martin's... Yeah, the trio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  ...you know, a bullfinger, you know, just with the phony phone. You can fake it. Hello?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, this is the same form factor. Yeah, I guess so. It's thinner. It's lighter. It doesn't have a keyboard, but it is similar to the 650.  So, this week's big story, or actually last week's big story was the iPod video, and I think that, boy, it didn't take very long.  You could get it in stores on Thursday. There was porn available Thursday. Yeah, Wednesday. Wednesday, probably, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I think that what's interesting is how little the Hollywood has jumped in.  You know, Lost, by the way, looks awesome. I couldn't believe how well it looked just going full screen on my laptop.  You know, downloading it, it zooms up really, really well. Did they pay you to watch it? They didn't pay me. I bought all of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You paid a buck-money on it? I'd have to be paid to watch Lost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me see if I have a buck-money on it. I have to admit, I've been a little out of the loop, so I haven't seen...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I haven't seen it, or Desperate Housewives, or I haven't watched any of those. Oh, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can I have a watch of these? I've watched television, but, you know, you can only put up with so much of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Interesting fact out of DC, the FBI crime report just came out, and juvenile violent crimes down, not only from last year and the year before, but overall, the last 10 years, down 30%.  Video games. How can it be? Yeah, exactly. Video games.  So that gives the light to all the people who say that video games are teaching kids to be violent. Juvenile crime is down 30%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sublimation. But they're much more violent to their computers than they were before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're going through mice one after another.  I mean, I think there is... I have to say, if kids play Grand Theft Auto a lot, they get desensitized to violence.  Do they really? I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because Henry's been running around with a Glock up in Petaluma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, but I'll give you an example. I was just up in Toronto, and some guys ran over...  Those are Canadians. That's different, isn't it?  Absolutely. A.  I was in Toronto, some guys ran over a guy because he didn't give him directions. And they got in their car, and they drove over the guy.  And I think that if you play a lot of Grand Theft Auto, you think, oh yeah, you hit people, it's normal, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is thin, Leo. I'm not buying it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, it's just logic. But of course, the facts are that it does... something's reduced to juvenile violence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the people were shooting each other in LA in traffic, you know, a decade ago. This is not new behavior. This is nonsense.  There's a lot less freeway shootings than there used to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's also less juveniles.  I mean, you know, that big glut of the babies of the Baby Boomers is now moving into an older crowd.  And there's not as...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's static in our systems.  I think this has got to be normalized.  Yeah, well, otherwise it's meaningless. I don't know. I think that's very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I always say my kids play Grand Theft Auto. And I let them play the whole thing.  And my comment is, you know, I think you have to be a violent person to go out and be violent in the real world.  But, you know, they say, well, this is like a simulation.  And the only thing I have to say, if all hell breaks loose and my children have to become auto thieves, they will be very good at it.  So this will have protected them from getting in trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you play any video games, Larry?  I don't, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's too busy, probably, to play video games.  He's traveling all the time. He's never around. I'm surprised he's here.  He's not here.  Where are you going to be next week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Slovenia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really?  Have you been to Slovenia before?  No.  Oh, you'll love it.  It's what I hear. It's supposed to be amazing.  Oh, man, it's terrific.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Welcome back to Travel Talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Slovenia is terrific. Believe me, Ljubljana is unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But, Larry, you have kind of a passion for, I know, the Eastern Europe.  I spent a lot of time there, but I never was in Slovenia.  I'm surprised you've never gotten there. Are they working on a constitution or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, but they're launching Creative Commons licenses next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to talk about Creative Commons. You're doing, I have to say, I put people to the Creative Commons site  because you're doing what, I'm thrilled to see kind of a history of Creative Commons  and really talking about how it happened. What is Creative Commons?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it's a really simple, basic idea.  Give artists and authors a simple way to say the freedoms that they want to run with their content  so that there's no ambiguity, there's no need to call a lawyer, you know what you can do,  and you make it easy for other people to do stuff with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's wrong with the current copyright law? Why don't they just use that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the problem is that the current copyright law, by default, says all rights are reserved.  And whenever you use any creative copyrighted material, automatically the law says you've got a clear permission first.  Now, of course, most people don't worry about that, and most people do whatever the hell they want.  Illegally.  Illegally, could be. But the problem is that we're moving into a world five years from now  where technology will lock down the content, so you can only do precisely what you've gotten permission to do.  So the thing that we're really afraid of is that when that world happens,  we will have destroyed the potential of this technology to be used for all sorts of other fantastic creative stuff.  So what we want to do is to build a kind of buttress of support for the expression of freedom running with content,  and that's what the licenses do. They basically say, use it in this way,  and if you use it in that way consistent with the license, then you're guaranteed to continue to make the stuff available.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John, you wrote in an article in July that Creative Commons was humbug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did I use that word?  Yeah, that's right here.  It's a title.  Oh, well, you know, the copy-iters picked those titles.  What's your complaint?  There's something, well, I thought that, you know, I'm well protected now, what do I need all this other stuff for?  Larry pointed something out to me recently, which I have to say is kind of distressing, which is that,  and you might want to explain this, which is why I can't go on my website and declare something to be in the public domain,  which I always wanted to, was that?  You could.  Now, tell us why this isn't, and this is like really changes my attitude about things,  because if you can't, if I can't say, hey, look, you guys can,  I give you all rights.  I give you all rights, go steal it. Take it. It's yours, free, you know, because I do, you know,  Photoshop things or I write stuff that I don't care about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I've written software and done that. I've done that for years.  Right, well, what's the problem?  It's not true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the point is, before 1976, there was essentially a thousand ways you could do that,  but after 1976, the law changed and said copyright was automatic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then give us the history about the 1976 legislation.  Does it have anything to do with Disney?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Doesn't everything have something to do with Disney?  There's 76, not so much about Disney, but the fact is, before 76,  copyright was what you could think of as an opt-in system.  You had to raise your hand and say, I want protection.  And a very small proportion of creative work had that kind of protection.  The protection was all rights reserved to make total sense.  After 76, they changed the law.  So by default, everything is automatically protected, right?  So you don't have to really do anything.  You don't have to do anything.  You don't have to put a C in.  No.  Copyright, you don't have to do anything.  You don't have to put a date or anything.  And then it's automatically protected now for a term of life of the author plus 70  or for corporate works, 95 years.  That has everything to do with Disney.  That's a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if I lived to 80, it's 150 years of copyright.  That's exactly right.  Automatically.  Automatically.  Hey, it's a bonanza for the copyright owners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But wait a minute.  I own the copyright.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why can't I say I assert no rights?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the problem is that when you give a gift, like that would be a gift.  Dvorak's work wouldn't be a gift, but yours would be a gift.  Hey.  And when you give a gift like that, you've got to tangibly deliver it.  That's what the law says.  Well, how do you tangibly deliver a copyright?  It's just an intangible thing.  I couldn't write a letter and say here's the letter.  So we have a routine at Creative Commons where you can put stuff in the public domain.  Basically, take a rubber chicken, shake it over your head, spin around six times,  scream public domain, and that's enough to signal maybe.  We're not sure whether that actually works.  But the point is there's no easy way to do it.  But the other thing is...  It's kind of weird if you ask me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So nobody's said that the Creative Commons is legal and effective then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, Creative Commons licenses don't put things in the public domain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that's how they're different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So what you're basically doing is you're saying you have to do a couple things.  The minimum is give me attribution.  And the maximum is, for example, can't use it for commercial work,  have to release it in a share-alike kind of copy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's our license on this.  It's non-commercial, share-alike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What if you want to release it without...  Like, say, I don't care.  You can say you wrote it.  You can sell it commercially.  I don't care.  Is that part of the Creative Commons?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's public domain.  And we have a routine to try to put something into the public domain.  And it takes a couple formal steps, and you have to go through a document-like process.  So it's painful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a painful process.  Because they made it so in 1976.  Well, the idea was to protect the copyright.  I almost made the mistake of saying that's to protect authors and creative types.  But in fact, we all know this was done to protect the copyright owners.  And many times, and most writers know this, is that most publications now try to steal all your rights.  They own it.  They won't even buy...  We won't give you anything.  It's almost impossible for writers to get all their rights and just sell the first North American.  They sell...  Well, we buy everything.  But with magazines, actually books, it's pretty easy to keep your...  Fiction you can hold onto.  Now, with most books you can.  But with magazines, newspapers...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've been offered my rights twice in 10 years of magazines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I always insist on mine.  And most people read my stuff like you say.  And they say, what's it worth?  So they give it to me.  But I also have a long history of demanding at least shared copyright.  So it's like copyright by both.  So at least I can give permissions that nobody cares about it.  Because a lot of people will say, hey, can I reprint this or that?  And I'll say, yeah, but you have to reprint it by permission of author and then copyright, whatever.  Even though apparently you don't even do that.  But generally speaking, the copyright...  These big corporations that just bought up all these copyrights and they're just a scam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, when I was young and ignorant, I thought, oh, that's cool.  I just have to publish something and it's automatically copyrighted.  I'm protected.  And I mean, that's not a bad thing.  And you were.  I was.  I guess what's bad is I thought I was giving other stuff away and I wasn't.  You weren't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I don't think it was bad.  I don't think the system in 1976 was bad before the Internet.  The problem is you come to the world of the Internet and everybody has these assumptions about how they intend people to be able to use their work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And now they can insist on it.  Now they can enforce it.  Now they can insist on it, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the law says that those assumptions don't mean anything until they're expressed in some formal way.  So what we're trying to do is to make it easy for people to express the kind of freedoms they think ought to run with their content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, I know if we ever take this video or the audio, we won't ever do it with the audio.  We're never going to.  It's always going to be licensed that way and we'll always have it unprotected.  But a video might well, for instance, if we were able to sell it on the Apple Store, they might say you got to use our DRM or audible might say you got to use our DRM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why would Apple care whether we use their DRM to protect our content?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.  Audible would.  I already, you know, I know for a fact.  But why?  I don't get it.  I guess that's just how their system works.  It's probably tied into their mechanism.  That's their payment mechanism.  That's probably right.  And I'll tell you why Apple would because they get a percentage, a large percentage.  So they now suddenly are rights holders.  They want, they have an interest in it.  So that kind of screws everything up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I think that one of the things that I like about some of the newer stuff with Creative Commons is also the time thing.  Because, you know, what, shortening the time frame to 14 years or you can extend it to, because even that's longer than with a lot of the stuff that I create.  You know, I'm really interested in having a lot of rights for the first five years, you know, maybe 10 years.  14 years is, you know, most of the stuff that we're doing now.  But how about 150 years?  But I don't need it.  You know, the thing is, I'd be happy to like, you know, I'd love to have a cascade where I go, you know, I want all the rights for the first two years.  I want some of these rights for the next five years and I want no rights after that.  You know, those are the kind of things that I, you know, because you want to be able to extend it.  And I think that most of us, I know for, you know, I have a company that makes products, you know, and 90% of our revenue comes in the first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but there could always be the cash cow that just, you know, is one of like the Mickey Mouse character that, you know, you're going to, it's an annuity you're going to be making money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but I'm not sure, I guess I'm not sure if it's even, if that's even reasonable.  For you, maybe.  But Disney used...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's not reasonable. It's a complete ridiculous situation.  I get that it makes a lot of money, but...  You know, a lot of things, the thing that's been ignored here is the cultural implications.  Right.  The reason that copyright is, you know, was set up in a certain way to allow stuff to drop into the public domain after just a very few years, 26 and whatever, and with a renewal maybe, is that it had cultural implications.  And one of the things that people aren't noticing is that because, you know, works of art, oil paintings for example, we are still stuck essentially in the impressionist era.  Because all like...  Nothing since has been in the public domain.  You can't get Picasso in the public domain, it has to be licensed.  So essentially the entire mechanism for improving our condition based on art is frozen in time, about 1910.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and this is again much worse because of the implication with digital technology.  So take music, right, remix of music, the kind of extension of hip hop.  Mashups.  Mashups, right.  Courts have held that there is no fair use right at all to sample music.  You can sample compositions the way jazz musicians do, but you can't take one second out of a recording without clearing the rights up front.  So we've got a billion machines out there for making music, but the only way to do it legally through this mashup or remixing type technology is to hire a lawyer who is going to clear all the rights for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or use legal samples.  I mean there have been cases where artists have released samples on CDs that you could buy and as long as you attributed them, I mean the guys from P-Punk did this.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So there is a beginning of that in a commercial context and Creative Commons is pushing it in this more general non-commercial context.  Creative Commons music now.  Yeah, that's right.  But the point is the idea that just as the technology makes it so anybody can be a composer in a certain sense, the law comes in and pulls this away is crazy.  And especially because of this, I think John's point is exactly right.  The way it implicates culture.  I mean the only people who can legally produce are people who can afford lawyers that stand next to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's exactly what you don't want in an era where digital technology lets everybody be a creator.  That's exactly right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why should we tie their hands?  Let's take a step back.  I mean the idea of creation is noble, but how much of this is about creation is how much of this is about an entire generation of people who basically between, you know,  Bittorrent and going back to Napster have decided they really don't ever have to pay for any content again.  I mean is that a legitimate choice?  I mean I realize that we're watching the dinosauring of an entire publishing system.  No, it's a great point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't support the idea of people taking other people's content without permission.  I don't, you know, if I thought this battle was about whether you could listen to Britney Spears for free, I'd be on the other side because I don't think you should listen to Britney Spears at any cost.  Ever.  So it's not about getting content for free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They also tried to rip the impressionist paintings off the walls because they were so disturbing.  I mean not that I think in 50 years we're going to look back and think that this was a life changing point in music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But there's that happening with kids and technology, but in addition to that, there's extraordinary creativity.  Do you know about the AMV culture?  This is fascinating.  There's this thing called anime music video culture.  Oh yeah.  100,000 kids, mainly Americans, who record all of the anime series that they can and then they re-edit it, setting it to music or setting it to video trailers.  And so they have these extraordinary productions all made on their old IMAX up in their bedrooms that are extraordinarily creative, but it's all taken and found work.  They can't do it.  And it's legal. It's not legal at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look at the great halo, what is it called, red, what is it?  Red versus blue.  Yeah, love that.  They take halo footage from the game and they put dialogue behind it.  That's a wonderful creative thing.  And I think mashups too are great.  It's like What's Up Tiger Lily.  Exactly, which was pre-1976.  So the real issue is, I think Patrick, is that you're in a way undermining an artist's right to make money.  You're undermining copyright because if you prevent any kind of fair use, you're just creating a whole generation of people who says, well screw it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think that that's the thing.  I mean, a lot of times when you make more laws, you make more criminals out of nothing.  And the issue is that there's a lot of statistics that will say someone who smokes marijuana will then move on to harder drugs.  And a lot of people argue that the reason they'll move on to harder drugs is because they've been pushed into an illicit area, not because marijuana itself is the leader to that.  And in the same way, we're going, everything is illegal no matter how you touch it.  So from the time I was 10 years old, we were recording our friends' albums and making mixes.  We'd all get together and make mix tapes and stuff like that.  All of that was illegal.  Well, no, actually that was clear by the American home record.  But now it's not.  I mean, now they're talking about if I want to move an iPod.  Can't do it in a digital context.  Only in analog, not in digital.  And so the thing is that what we're doing is creating a lot of people.  If we made it easy, if we bring the, even like the 99 cents, there's a mechanism issue with making it any less than that.  It's mostly related to Visa.  And to the, so it can't get much lower than that.  It's a micro payment issue.  But if you made it 25 cents or 40 cents per song, it would just be too much trouble to go get it somewhere else.  Right, I agree.  People would make a lot of money.  I've always believed this, too.  And I think that-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the rest of what you're saying is you're talking about the Sovietization of the American culture.  That's exactly right.  Where essentially, like my first time I went to Russia, I always got the biggest kick out of this.  They told you you couldn't carry Russian, this is during when they were still communists.  You couldn't have Russian currency outside the Russian border.  And outside the Russian border included-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can't live on less than 25, whatever they were.  Well, the joke of it was you can't have the currency outside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the border actually began when you entered the airport.  There's actually a line where you were out-  Give us your money.  No, you were at a point, but the thing is to get inside to the terminal, which was essentially where you were, was essentially outside the country.  You couldn't legally have Russian currency.  All the carts that you pushed around that cost like a couple of rubles were outside.  So you had to have currency outside to use a cart.  And it was like, so you had to break the law immediately.  And the Russian system, which I think is what was happening here, is making everybody a criminal so you can just, at any given point, just pick up anybody.  You pick up you, you got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I debated Hillary Rosen down at USC.  And I was laying this out.  I was saying basically anything you do, you're a criminal.  Former head of the RIA.  And she said, that's right.  Basically everybody's always violating the law, but you should trust us to be suing the people who ought to be sued.  When they say trust us-  And then it's exactly, when I had exactly a sense of it, what John said, this is the Sovietization of American culture.  We have this extraordinarily creative class that lives in the black market, right?  They're black market creators.  And it's happening.  That's the point.  You haven't shut this down.  And you've met those kids.  They were incredibly intelligent.  They were really entrepreneurs, but they all lived in the black market.  And I say, you know, why the hell in a democracy should we have something like the black market living like that?  Like if the system is bad, we should be changing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's of course not happening in the US.  And the funny thing is it would probably make it better.  I mean, I have kind of an opinion now that like if I see it on iTunes, people should be buying it.  If I don't see it on iTunes, people should be stealing it.  Taking it for whatever they can find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This brings us back to the Napster thing, which people just want to deny.  I mean, this is why I think the Sovietization thing is so important to understand, because it's all these people.  All the evidence is against this working to the benefit of the capitalists, for example.  And I'm not saying in terms like I'm a Marxist or anything.  But for example, when Napster was at its...  Watch out, because Larry was a conservative too at one time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're sitting next to him. It could be a problem.  I don't admit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So anyway, when Napster was at its most popular, CD sales were on the rise.  And when Napster was cut off, those sales dropped like a rock.  And they do not want to face this fact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And part of it was because when you were on Napster, you would go to somebody else's library and see a whole bunch of other cool stuff.  And you could find stuff that wasn't...  And all that kind of that discovery that created more sales.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was one of the greatest mechanisms ever.  That part of it, it was the main thing, which is that I could see...  This guy has my taste, I could tell, because he's got this...  But then he's got this unusual tune on here, and I'm thinking, I never heard of these guys.  You click on it, boom. It was like, wow, these guys are great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So in the long run, who cares? I mean, eventually this whole edifice is going to crumble and fall, yes?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Why do you think that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because you have a massive underground growing all the time of people who are ignoring copyright law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, something's going to grow. And I train lawyers for a living, right?  And so you stand in front of a class, and you try to tell them why they're supposed to follow legal ethics.  And they think about the last 10 years of their life, where they've done nothing but break the law every single day of their life.  We pay a price for that, for sure.  Yeah, of course. It's a corrosive effect on society.  This is the one thing that Jack Valenti, former head of the MPAA, and I agree about this.  It's awful that you raise a generation of kids breaking the law.  But his response is, let's find a more effective way to wage war against the enemy.  And my response is, let's find a better law so that normal behavior isn't criminal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and I think that when they create these rules, and if they were...  I mean, I personally sometimes think that I hope that they are able to fully enforce the law,  fully enforce everything that they're talking about, because it will create a gap that a lot of other people can move in on.  Because if it becomes so hard to use that music, if it becomes so hard because of all the DRM,  other people that are using, for instance, stuff like MySpace, and these bands are selling half a million albums with no record company.  And as Apple gets bigger and bigger with iTunes, and as, for instance, this video iPod,  it's going to take a couple years probably to figure out the SAG versus the Directors Guild versus all these...  Oh, they're already...  No, that's the whole issue. They're already going, hey, hey, hey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We want a piece of this. You guys are going to start throwing this...  0.2 cents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and the thing is that's going to lock them up, and it's going to open the opportunity for a lot of us doing shows like this  to go on that small screen and fill that void that they're creating by stopping all of this stuff.  And they're leaving money on the table because everyone's just bit-torning it.  And so, you know, okay, I can't get it on iTunes. I'm going to go find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, the one thing, though, that happened, which I think the Directors Guild and all these people in SAG are worried about  getting ripped off on this is because for so many years they got ripped off on the DVD after they did a movie.  DVDs were considered like toys. I mean, they weren't given their full percentages off of those sales of DVDs.  And as Hollywood shifted toward the DVD as its really primary source of income, these guys were screwed out of all the money.  And now, of course, they're changing those contracts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They were screwed. They only got paid $20 million for the film, and they didn't get another penny after that.  There's plenty of people that don't make the 20 mil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, there are, but they're still doing okay.  Yeah, no, I'm so, I feel so, so bad for these people.  You know, so they made $200,000. They were only in the top one percentile.  Yeah, I know, but they just saw this money going down the drain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can we compare this to software? Is there an analogy in free software?  I know you're a big proponent of free software and always have been, Larry.  Is there an analogy here? I mean, is proprietary software?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We created Creative Commons stealing the idea of the free software movement, right?  So free software gave away copyright licenses to make it clear that software would remain in a space where people could build on it without fearing it, the prioritization.  What we've done is different from free software because free software has basically, the free software movement has basically one core license, the GPL, which is copy lefted.  And Creative Commons has six licenses a range. But it's the same intuition.  It's a little bit different, though, because, you know, when they started free software, they started it because the culture was increasingly producing proprietary software, and that was something new.  But there's always been a proprietary culture. It's not like, you know, we began having record companies five years ago.  There's always been a proprietary culture. But the difference is, before the internet, I think it was more balanced, right?  There's lots of ways to use culture that wasn't regulated by copyright law.  You read a book, that's not a fair use of the book. It's a free use of the book. There's no copyright implication there at all.  But you do the same thing on a digital network. It necessarily produces a copy. It necessarily triggers copyright law.  So there's nothing you can do in the digital world that doesn't trigger copyright law in some sense.  So the proprietary nature of culture in the digital world is more controlling than it was in the analog world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do we do? Should we, I mean, is there an action that we as citizens need to take? Should we write our members of Congress?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, first you should write John and tell him his article about Creative Commons was wrong.  I think he retracted that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I never said that, you know, my column was never wrong. My column was questioning, like, I want to be...  That's right. The value of it.  No, no, that wasn't it either. I was saying I don't get it when somebody explains...  Why do we need it?  No. I was saying I don't get it. Will somebody explain it to me, please? And yeah, he explained it. I finally got my explanation.  Sometimes you've got to go public.  I'll write another one.  It's doing fine. I don't need my help. But the point is that sometimes you've got to go public with bafflement, which I do.  Which is appropriate.  Yeah, I'm saying, hey, I don't get it.  If you don't, many others don't.  And meanwhile, I noticed that a lot of people that responded to that column, some PCMag.com, by the way, that column, they didn't get it either, but they were just giving me crap because, you know, I said something bad about Larry, who's like some hero amongst a bunch of nerds and geeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was my reaction, frankly. I couldn't believe you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I think that one of the things that I think is most important, because we do a lot of work in Africa, you know, doing design. We have a lot of members in Africa, and we're designing it. So the developing nations license, I think, is important.  We sell, I know we sell our software that we create at 10% of what we sell in the rest of the world, you know, because that is something that I feel is important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Talk a little bit about that, Larry, because I think that Cory Doctor was also using that for his latest book, the Third World License.  Developing nations license, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, the basic idea here was that if you could put something on a developing nations license, that means in a developing nation, you can do whatever you want with this. Outside of the developing nations, ordinary rules apply.  And we started this because we were asked by Jamie Love, who's a big activist in this area, to build this license, so we did.  But the thing that was coolest that surprised me about it was there's a bunch of architects who are designing low-cost housing, right, and they've stamped all of their designs with Creative Commons developing nations licenses, meaning people in developing nations can take these designs, do whatever the hell they want with them.  But outside of the developing world, you've got to deal with them in the ordinary copyright way.  So it's just trying to facilitate spread into markets where, you know, it wouldn't spread otherwise, and you don't want to call somebody a pirate because they're building on your ideas in those markets.  And so you're doing that with your software, or he's doing that with his book?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, with the Pixelcore, we have a membership that people pay for, and if you're from Africa specifically, you don't pay, there's no membership fee.  So that's exactly the same license of that process because it doesn't make any sense.  I mean, our membership per year costs $420 a year.  That represents four months of work for the average person that's in Zimbabwe, which is where we have a lot of members.  It just doesn't make any sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If they have a job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If they have a job, I mean, you know, it doesn't make any sense in a whole lot of ways.  If I want to expand, if I want to create opportunity there, you know, for good business opportunity, I mean, we do it primarily because I think it's good business.  I think it makes a difference, but I also think it's good business.  And what I want is as many people able to do that as possible.  That's a great point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I, in the context of the arts, never go around telling artists what they ought to do to give away their work, right?  I'm not trying to guilt anybody into giving away their rights.  What we think is this might be a more effective way to make your work succeed.  Right. That's the message there.  Context of science.  We have a related project, the Science Commons.  It's very different.  I mean, I think scientists have an ethic.  It's an obligation not just to produce knowledge, but to produce knowledge that's universally accessible, because, you know, if you're in Africa, you can't pay a penny for the cost of access to, you know, a journal that might cost $10,000 a year to be distributed in Africa.  So I think scientists have a moral obligation in some sense to make their work available in a way that artists don't.  So Creative Commons is just about, here's a bunch of tools.  You figure out what works best for you.  If you want to go the Hollywood route, more power to you.  But if you want to have a more flexible system that might give you wider access, then we're just going to make it easy for you.  Well, you're not losing anything either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, when you're a software developer, giving away software in Africa...  You wouldn't be selling it there anyway.  They steal it anyway.  I mean, I was in Zimbabwe for a month, and a bunch of movies came out.  I had them two days after they were released to the theaters here.  In China, you did them two weeks earlier.  Yeah, I mean, so it was...  You know, and so the thing is, is that it is...  You're not losing anything.  You're just getting to know who they are.  You are, you know, expanding into that market.  And when it builds up, you can change how that looks.  You know, when people have the money to do it.  Well, I mean, the thing...  It may never happen.  But it will definitely never happen if it's a culture of people doing it illegally, and they have no intention of ever going back.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wonder about that, because China has both...  You know, you have mixed messages.  Because if you take a look at the amount of money people make on a monthly basis in China,  and the fact that they're very heavily in the piracy,  and that you can get these DVDs, very high quality ones, and crappy ones,  but mostly you can get the good ones.  They're called DVD nines, if you're over there looking around.  Not that I've ever seen them.  I'm an expert.  And they tend to be...  There's something kind of fishy about it, because when you see these things,  you can tell that they're from the master tapes.  I mean, this is the day that this is the real deal.  It's not like...  You know, except they leave out some of the special features and stuff.  They've got other stuff, because the thing hasn't been quite finished.  So there's a leak in the lab somewhere.  It's so deep there that...  Or it could be Hollywood looking for some extra income back door, as far as I'm concerned.  It's pretty suspicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, you walk into the airport in Harare,  and they have DVDs where they have three movies on the same DVD.  They've squished all three movies.  Yeah, you can do 4X compression.  And that's just a regular store.  It's a big, shiny store.  It's not like everyone back alley.  Hey, you know, if you go to Malaysia,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  then the big malls, they've got big stores that sell DVDs in good quality.  You can look at them.  They'll let you watch them.  And it's a regular mall store.  And then you can go down the hall, and they have a software store.  And they have everything available for a dollar a disc.  Sorry for Hollywood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, don't they have some right to protect themselves against them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like you said earlier, because the 20 million bucks isn't enough for these guys.  I mean, where do you draw the line?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but you're talking about way different things.  I mean, like, there's something funny.  No, I agree.  You know, pirating movies on BitTorrent is keeping Bob from having a job.  No, I'm not arguing at all about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the fact of the matter is the real problem for Hollywood are these massive production factories.  Not you and me making a copy.  Not some guy downloading something from BitTorrent after eight hours.  I mean, what kind of loss of money is that compared to some guys cranking these things?  These are pressed.  These are not like burned discs.  They're pressed.  They're pressed on a shoe.  And they go after those guys.  I mean, they're bussed all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, they don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think it's a bunch of BS, personally.  They plow over a bunch of discs they can't sell, and they make a big deal out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're going to be a lot less successful, if you can imagine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Was it you, Alex, who were telling me there are places, somewhere in Africa, there's a very vital film community,  but they have to crank out a lot of movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, in Nigeria, I was talking to a friend of mine who's a Nigerian filmmaker.  I got a letter from him.  Yeah, exactly.  He has some money in the bank.  But in Nigeria, Nigeria makes more films than anywhere else in the world.  More than India?  More than India.  India makes more than Hollywood.  Nigeria makes more, but they're all about $15,000 films, and a lot of them are these kind of soap opera-y type of things.  But I was talking to him about the business model, and he said, the deal is we shoot the film,  we get it to the theaters, and we get the DVD out as fast as we can.  We've got about a week to make all of our money back.  And then after that, the piracy takes over, and I'll never see another penny.  But what they did is instead of trying to enforce it, which in Nigeria would be impossible,  they built a business model around what worked.  And these guys, some of them are doing pretty well.  It's just a whole different business model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This was directly driven by piracy because originally it was Hollywood videos, which they were pirating.  And that built an infrastructure of VCRs in people's houses, right?  Because people wanted to have the...  So then you had this infrastructure of VCRs, and then they could start doing their own Nigerian movies  and take advantage of this infrastructure of VCRs and have this model that was very profitable,  but very different from the model of Hollywood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they make...  That's actually an interesting progression, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hollywood would say that's where we're headed, right?  If we don't do something about this, this is what's going to happen.  You're not going to get Sylvester Stallone movies anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you watch some of the trade stuff going on, they're already talking about moving that DVD release date closer  and closer and closer.  And I don't understand personally, because I think that people who really like a movie will go to the movie  and buy the DVD or buy the DVD and go to the movie both.  But I think that if you went to a first-run movie, and they were selling the DVD of that film at the theater,  only at the theater, by the way, for the first run, I think they would get huge sales off of that,  and people would have a good time.  And the other thing, the other thing's really cool is if you go...  Well, yeah, no, but with...  What's his name?  What's a movie that came out with the spaceship guys?  Serenity.  Serenity.  Rock stars have been doing that for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They sell a CD as you walk out the door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But if you go to Singapore, which of course has been suffering because of this piracy for a long time,  and you go to a movie theater, it's an extraordinary experience.  It's a first-class experience, because they realize the only way to get you to come to the movie theater  is if they make it really great.  So you can get great food served to you, drinks served to you as you're watching the movie.  And it's all a sort of competitive way to try to beat the piracy.  I think we're moving that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In Europe, they've had that kind of thing.  They've got great taquitos now in my theater.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What theater is this?  Are you living in Mexico City?  No, they really do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They put them on the same rollers as the hot dogs.  Oh, jeez, you're making me sick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that we're really looking at where content starts to split into screens like this.  So you have these little screens.  Disposable content and premium content.  Premium content that's big screens.  And it's not just big screens at the theater.  It's big screens on your projection.  When I look at what I want to have at home, I want to have a big projection.  And when I want to watch big things like big films or whatever, I want to watch it.  But watching shows like this, watching the news, a lot of the other things,  I can happily watch on a little screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Patrick, you're producing now twice a week a TV show for Ziff Davis.  What is their hope for this?  Is this a loss leader?  Is this going to be a business?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  My fundamental assumption going into this in terms of the business model  was that there was no point in trying to sell the content.  Because you can't hold onto it.  You can't hold onto it.  Especially with our target audiences.  Like 60% of our audiences is accessing either directly through like VLC.  We're in a worse position than anybody because we have the most sophisticated audience.  You know what I mean?  So there's like, our whole audience is pretty advanced technically.  So the idea of selling the episodes on the front side, there's just no margin in it.  Especially when you sit down and listen.  The funniest thing at the Web 2.0 conference, the most useful thing at the Web 2.0 conference.  Are you still looking for something?  No.  I had some.  You just shot me down so hard it all went away.  But basically one of the venture capital guys came up and he's like,  look, I have a table of teenagers I use for polling information.  He plays 20 questions with them.  And the question keeps coming back is,  yeah, I get my music from online.  I get my movies from Napster.  Yeah, we don't watch television through cable.  We don't watch television shows through.  And it keeps coming back to that.  So for us, it's all advertising based and distribution.  Which is huge and growing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And there's no reason to think it'll stop growing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I think that there's also, there are people who like,  there's exposure that you can get as well.  I mean, like the Pixel Core is working on shows that we're going to put out  that are around visual effects and creating media and so on and so forth.  We may have some sponsors, but we don't need a ton of sponsors  because the show itself is increasing what people know about us.  And that, we've talked about this in previous Twits,  where if BMW did great shows about how they design cars,  there'd be lots of people going to it.  What does Twit do? We're not selling anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But we do have a plan.  We have a plan. Dvorak hasn't revealed it to anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Twit relies upon the largest and generosity of its viewers.  That's actually really it. It's the goodwill of the viewers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If they don't want to pay for it, they don't pay for it.  And I guess we'll go away.  If they do pay for it, then we continue to do it.  And that's it. That's a model, I guess.  And you can decide, even if you're going to sell it on iTunes.  But I'll tell you, only 1% of the people who listen to Twit pay for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's about right.  But the other thing is we're not begging enough for money.  The PBS model is the one you want.  I don't want to do that.  No, of course you don't. And who wants to?  But I'm just saying you could crank that up to maybe 5%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The show stops after 30 minutes, and you've got to donate to get the other 30 minutes of the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm just saying, you could start begging for money,  and I think you could push it up to maybe 5% of the audience.  Maybe.  Or if you want to be like Gene Scott, the late Gene Scott,  you could just basically put a show on that.  The whole show is asking for money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'd like to ask for money right now,  because we just spent a lot of money on cameras and equipment.  We're on our third mixing board.  Of course, people don't want to pay for my stupidity,  so I don't know if that's the best pitch.  We'll sell the old mixing boards on eBay.  John's going to take the old mixing board.  But there are expenses to making this a better production,  and it's kind of an investment, I guess, in just...  Hey, these cameras could be handy.  I mean, I think nano porn is the future.  Nano porn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, you laugh, right? But there's nothing better than the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have to compete with the experts. That's the problem with the porn thing.  Yeah, I'm no expert. I can tell you that right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't want to know. I don't want to know.  This is John. But seriously, the whole point is like...  This is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sorry. Can you cut that part out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry, Patrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a visual we'd like not to go any farther.  This is the porn. I'm so sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But no, if you think about the...  Part of the issue with Hollywood, right, is Hollywood isn't about producing movies.  Hollywood is a very complicated scheme to make money for...  It's a marketing machine.  No, it's not even a marketing machine. It's an investment.  It's a really peculiar style of investment and long-term investment in making money.  It is. It's bankers. We think of them as artists, but it's bankers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it has been since Louis B. Mayer.  Yeah, there's nothing new about it, and I think that that's the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like the whole point of their production model is...  I mean, it's even... It's more organized than the record industry.  I mean, the record industry is like, let's put out a whole bunch of shit and see what...  Oop, I can't curse. I haven't done that in a while.  Sorry about that.  But it's like, you look at the record industry and you look at the amount of garbage that's cranked out versus what actually sells.  You know what I mean? It's like the... It just costs too much to make movies to be that haphazard in your production model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Larry, have any mainstream artists or labels or movie companies looked at Creative Commons as a way of distributing them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, the answer is yes. And they're basically next-generation people who are looking at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you're already Metallica, you don't need to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Although, when Wired released the Wired CD that had people like David Byrne and the Beastie Boys and Chuck D and Jebette O'Gil releasing tracks under the license that allowed people to remix it, that was the first time we kind of cracked into that space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The one thing I want to say about Metallica, by the way, is that I worked in the radio industry when they switched, when Billboard had to switch...  Out of the blue. You had some Metallica thing, which is...  No, no, no, no. I think...  This is an interesting story. Have you told this on the show before?  I don't think I've shown this before. When I was... So, I used to work for Sony Music. So, I promoted...  Thanks to Pixelcore, you're sort of paying penance.  Yeah, exactly. Exactly. No, I worked for... And this is when I came out, CDs were just coming out when I was working there.  And I was saying, these should be cheap, because I knew they cost 44 cents out of the factory, and we should be charging $4.  But they were like, well, they're perceived as higher than albums, so we'll charge more than albums because we can get it.  And they still do.  And they still do. That's ridiculous.  That's insane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Remember those early years they were expecting the price to drop, to drop, to drop, and then every day...  And it went up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it was all internally, it was all discussed as something that was, you know, why bother? People are buying them.  And so the thing is, but the interesting thing was, is for a long time, when I was a music rep, you'd call guys.  It was all this... Not Paola. We didn't do Paola, but we'd take guys out for dinner all the time.  Backscratching.  I'd take guys out for dinner all the time. I'd make sure they got to go behind the scenes and go hang out.  I was a music director this time. I know.  And we took guys like that. And we took them into Alice in Chains tour bus or whatever it was.  And I'd love you, and I'd say, sure, whatever you want now.  And then I'd call. What I'd do is we have lists that we have to manage.  And I'm trying to get up the list, and I get my bonuses are all connected to that.  I'll put you in hot rotation.  Yeah, and so can you bump that from light to medium? That's all I need you to do.  But the main thing is that people would have the raw, how many they sold at the record store, but I would get them to bump...  I know that it was number 20th, but can you bump it to 15? Can you do that?  And they'd be like, oh, sure, no problem.  And it was all this stuff that... it was just favors.  It wasn't like we were paying them or I was giving them Coke or something like that.  It was just that I'd ask you to just bump it up a little bit, and they would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Who'd you reserve the Coke for?  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I kept finding it's white powder and olives. I didn't know it was Coke.  I thought I would put it on my feed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's for the deal memos.  When you lock in a bunch of 20-year-olds that are terribly infused, running their asses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the important thing was is that Billboard decided there were enough of the shenanigans.  They said it has to be electronically, so they switched, and I think I want to say 1991 or whatever, they switched to electronic reporting.  One week it just went from you handwrite it to it's keeping track of who you're scanning in and who you're selling,  and it has to be that way or you wouldn't be able to do the sales.  And suddenly, in one week, Metallica goes top 10, Garth Brooks runs to number one.  These guys were selling, but they were never given credit for it.  They were never given credit for it, and suddenly that's what brought on a lot of stuff, because suddenly they all jumped to the front.  And the thing is, when you look at this illegal thing, there's a lot of bands that are moving around all through the BitTorrent ether,  and they don't get the proper recognition because no one can say that they're listening to them.  And if you were able to report it, it would be a much different thing, and I think that that's something that...  So what's the point of this story?  The point is that...  It's a great story.  It's a great story.  The point of the story is that...  The point is that we have more people watching the Twitch broadcasts and we're getting credit, right?  The point is that when you make things illegal, people aren't getting...  It's not just that they're not getting money for it.  They're also not getting recognition that people are listening to it, which creates the buzz that sells albums.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You've got to twist this around a bit and show you a really strong point.  Wow, you know.  Good work on it.  Next twist.  It's a 20 story, but it just dies in the vine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's why when you look... I mean, for podcasts, you look at the...  There's a point in this. I'm going to use that story in one of my columns.  The top 20 lists on podcasts. There's a real debate over what Yahoo's doing, which is whatever is the most subscribed versus...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who gets the most clicks this week?  Websites that have the top 10.  It's made up.  There's a three minute up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's votes.  And I think it would be very valuable for us to know, and maybe we wouldn't be number one.  That's not the point.  We would be. I'm not concerned about it.  But for two, who really is most listened to, that's valuable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think that one of the biggest problems right now with the iTunes music store is that you only know what the top 20 are.  And everything disappears.  What you don't know is what's the top 10 of tech?  What is the top 10 of religion?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Especially because if you think about Chris Anderson's long tail here...  They could, and they don't.  So if you think of Chris Anderson's long tail story, right?  So the whole future is about not what the top 50 is. It's the next 300.  And so finding some way to give recognition even to the next 300 is to figure out what's going to be...  Why does he say that?  Well, so Chris's point is that in the digital world, it's not the top 50 that matters.  It's everything after the top 50.  I'm not a subscriber to this model, by the way.  Yeah, but you weren't a subscriber to blogs. You weren't a subscriber to...  Podcasts.  No, I mean, the idea is a small amount of traffic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you, Larry.  No, no, no, but a small amount of traffic over an extended period of time adds up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, it reminds me of the old thing. The guys who are on network television still get the attention.  I don't care. You know, people are always thinking that all this little stuff is going to mount to a hill of beans.  No, but when there was just network television...  Get on ABC, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know. It's not saying you shouldn't be on ABC. If you can be on ABC, that's great.  But the point is, in the digital world, the person who's number 1,500 can actually start having a market.  And in the analog world, they couldn't have a market because you couldn't produce and sell at 1,500.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And in the real world, we're number 1,500. We're maybe number 15,000.  I mean, we may be successful as a podcast, but that's nothing.  Although I have to say, I will be on ABC in December doing Regis and Kelly, and I don't get anywhere near the attention that I get for doing that every three months.  But do a number 1 podcast, and the Wall Street Journal calls you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  CNBC has less numbers than we have.  Absolutely.  But they make more money.  Right, and the people on the shows can get paid up to a million dollars a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  CNBC makes more money than NBC because it's 50,000 people, but it's the right 50,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or at least it was during the dot com era when they were throwing money into advertising.  It'll be back. I think CNBC's got potential.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, look at the Jim Cramer's mad money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to get that boarding as he presses the button and goes, honk, bing, bing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know how many times you can watch that show, but it's entertainment once in a while.  Should we pause for a moment?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, we're still recording. These are just backup tapes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  But whoever's in bonus ring is fired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What it keeps coming back to is who's making money and how do you make it pay for itself?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like for instance, we have 200, 250,000 people listening to this podcast.  Or a half a million, we don't know.  We don't know. It could be half a million.  It's at least 200,000.  Let's say we have that number.  Very conservative.  Let's say 1% or 2% are willing to buy the show for $1.99, and let's say we get a dollar out of it.  That starts to get pretty close to...  Let me do the math.  Let's say we have a half a million, and 2% is 10,000, and we get a dollar out of it.  It's like $10,000 per show.  That's not bad.  Considering the cost of making it.  Right.  The point is that...  It's a cheap...  But if you can get to a point, there's a huge future, I think, and in the emerging world,  there's an incredible future for shows that make $3,000 to $5,000 a show.  Absolutely.  And the thing is...  Call for Help cost me $2,700 to produce Call for Help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If we could make $5,000, we would have a profit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you have a whole lot of them.  And the problem is that...  That's the key. You have to have a lot of them, because making the three grand here and there...  And you could.  Well, and this is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look, there is an interest...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait, what's the last time anybody at this table had a real job making three grand here  and there?  I know people kill for a lot less than three grand.  I have a real job.  Well, I know. You have a real job.  That's what we're saying.  What I'm saying is like...  It's chicken feed.  I spent last year pre-experimenting.  Come on.  It's chicken feed for you, but if you leave the...  It's chicken feed for you, too.  Give me a break.  Yeah, but for most of the people out there, three grand is still a lot of money.  Not most of the people out there.  No, three grand is still a lot for me.  No, you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't make...  There's a lot of rich guys watching this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Back in the tech TV days, they always said Patrick was the guy for the lunchbox crowd,  and now you're saying that.  Well, he still is, apparently.  I'm seeing that, but it's like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I also was...  I was never on contract.  He's working stiff out there.  He's not listening to this show, believe me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, a lot of them are listening to this show.  Oh, yeah, I want to have one working stiff send me a note.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you need to spread the word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What constitutes a working stiff by your definition?  I'm talking about a guy who works like you're one of the big steel mills.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right, enough of that.  So what I would like to see is a model that would make it possible...  I don't think we're going to get rich on this.  I don't care if we get rich on this, but a model that would make it possible for us to build a tech TV,  a network of 10 shows that are good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you need a network?  Well...  Yes.  Why?  Because then you have an entity that you can sell to some venture capitalist,  and then you can walk into a ton of money.  And make a billion dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Come on.  No, I tell you, there is strength in numbers.  You don't need a network.  Actually, you don't need a network because that's what's great about this model,  is anybody can go in a world...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And in fact, the actual model itself probably doesn't even benefit from having a network.  The only reason for the network is because the last throws of the next bubble,  they're going to be buying up these networks,  even though these networks are probably going to fail in the long haul.  They just remind them of the good old days, and they want to get into it.  They're going to get in there because it's going to look good on paper.  There is an advantage to a network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll tell you the advantage, because I've thought about this a little bit,  like why do we even want another show?  Let's just do one good show.  The advantage is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And we haven't gotten to that yet.  Well, as soon as we get to one good show, I'm doing two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're absolutely right.  The advantage is that you can have some sort of affinity group.  You can have some...  You say, well, I like that show, I might look at this show.  It's like being a publisher.  It's being a publisher.  And so I think there is an advantage to that.  Good brand name.  If you were going to sell ads, there's a real advantage to it.  Now, I don't think we're going to sell ads.  I think what we're going to do is monetize it by selling shows or by asking for donations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think one of the competitive advantages we have is to avoid the advertising model within the show itself,  unless we want to do product placement, which we do free with the Apple.  They sure get a lot of publicity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All they have to do is keep announcing a new iPod every few weeks.  Maybe that's their strategy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I think a lot of these guys, because there's these podcasts coming out from everywhere,  all the networks, CNBC has them.  And they're the top ball.  Look at the top 20.  It's mostly mainstream podcasts.  Right, but they're all loaded with ads.  Are they?  I don't know.  I haven't listened to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think anybody listens to them.  And then Tiki Bar TV, Peyton's podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, that's because it's video.  It changed very much when the video came out.  Tiki Bar is actually hysterical.  What's Tiki?  No.  They unfortunately only do about one a month.  It's weird.  It's the number one podcast right now because it's video.  And it's basically a drink recipe with a kind of bad skit around it.  But they have a beautiful woman on it.  It has the explicit label.  They need a beautiful woman.  They need a beautiful woman.  They're all tuning in for Patrick.  They like that lunchbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the numbers went down.  But I mean, if you look at it, it's like, what are the, I mean, if you start going into  the top, okay, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's changed though.  It's changed when the video came out.  Before video came out, because it's now polluted with things like your show.  Yeah, I know.  Thank you.  No, no, I'm just saying there's a lot of video on there because everybody's downloading  video.  But before then it was NPR was dominant, Hardball, CNBC.  Mainstream broadcasters were starting to take over the list.  And I think that's what it'll happen inevitably.  I mean, look, tech podcasts are big now only because it's techno files that are listening  to podcasts.  We're right in the middle of the early adopter curve.  It's going to be over for us in a month.  So that's why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Geez, what an attitude.  Please give us money.  Please.  It'll be over in a month.  They can't compete with us.  We have more talented, smart guys that come on the show.  There's an example right there on the table.  They don't work with us.  They always use Lala.  It's just a bunch of boneheads.  Have you listened to these guys on these shows?  I'm sure you watch these guys.  They don't know anything.  It's like they're clueless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I thought that for a long time in the computer talk radio because most computer  talk radio is pretty bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's because most of the time you're answering questions.  It hasn't helped me at all.  No, it's because computer talk radio is mostly answering the same questions about problems  with Windows.  I know.  It's so boring.  I know.  It's so boring.  Who wants to listen to this?  That's boring.  He's like, had somebody on and it was like they're talking about how their hard disk  crapped out and he's going on and on.  I try to hang up on those guys.  I know.  Oh, you're better off just ranting.  I do rant quite a bit.  Yeah, you do.  But increasing the rantage.  the work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We couldn't do this without Pixelcore because it gives us the backbone for it.  Pixelcore was designed to do this.  I mean, that's why it was built.  I mean, look at how many volunteers there are here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I'm not going to lie.  I'm not going to lie.  I'm not going to lie.  I mean, you couldn't do that without Pixelcore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the idea is that you want, you know, you're going to need a massive number of people who  are, you know, at the beginning willing to do it because it is something that's exciting  to do.  And the business model, it doesn't have to be, it doesn't have to be $100,000 a show.  It really could be $5,000 a show.  And the problem is, is that over time that becomes a real issue because it's fine when  there's 10 of us, but if there's 10,000 shows getting, you know, 100,000 viewers, there  are not a lot of eyeballs left for the mat.  You know, it is the tower of babble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Alex's theorem of why the entire television industry is about to collapse.  It's about to just go boom because nobody will be watching because they're all busy  watching their podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Everything about broadcast TV is all about how do we get the most people to watch our  show?  And it's all lukewarm.  How do we put out something that's medium, that's it's not really good, but it's not  really bad.  But they know how to do that.  But we know how to do that really well.  But the thing is, is that like when we walk into when we walk into Blockbuster, we see  90% fiction.  When we walk into Borders, a much more mature media market, it's 90% nonfiction.  What people want to watch is stuff that they care about.  I mean Discovery Channel is very popular.  Is that why reality shows are big now?  Well, I think that there's something more visceral about that.  You know, I think that there's something that is cheap to make is another big piece of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, it's-  That whole Jerry Springer wow, I feel so-  I should leap over the table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'd like to sit down and do a whole show about this topic.  We're going to bring in IPTV and some of these other issues which are going to make a huge  difference.  All right.  Because there's something here.  I mean, there's a kernel, especially after I give you crap about that non-ending story.  But there's a kernel of something here that's important.  And it needs to be explored because I agree with you 100% on this.  And there's something screwy going on.  There's something wrong with the old models.  The old model guys don't know what to do about their declining audience either.  They're completely freaked about that.  And I hope they stay there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, the thing is, I'm not trying to change their minds.  Like people ask me, what do you want me to do when I'm in Hollywood?  And I'm like, just keep on doing the same thing.  I will fill the rest of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm concerned about the fact that it's going to be so balkanized in terms of the millions  of shows available on IPTV that there would be no connection where I can see Pat in the  morning at the steel mill and say, hey, did you watch such and such?  That's old fashioned.  That's bull.  They talk about football.  They talk about the Cal game.  They won this game finally yesterday.  Well, there'll always be events that people will join up around.  Well, I mean, there always has to be something.  You think that people aren't talking about television anymore?  Who lives for a change?  Oh, please.  Who needs that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Things that are happening to them for a change instead of what happened in a little box in  their house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have you talked to people about their lives are mostly watching television?  Well, that's maybe also bad change.  Because they're not watching the same show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the other thing that's possible is what I would call a six degrees of separation kind  of effect, which is that we talk about some podcasts.  You know, like a lot of people that watch this also watch Patrick's show.  A lot of people that watch, you know, and so the thing is that there is this, you know,  as we trade different hosts from different shows, you end up with a group of people that  watch these eight or nine different shows.  Well, there is definitely that going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's what's happened with it's the old tech TV folks.  And there's just been this kind of little galaxy of stuff.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they help spin each other.  And so that we do end up with a common experience among like minded people.  There's a small group.  I think John's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's going to be radically different.  And it's not going to be a world where everybody's watching.  I'm not sure it's bad.  But it's going to be.  I think it is.  And there's a difference that I think we've not focused on, which is that it's not going  to be just that people are consuming a hundred thousand different things.  There are going to be more people actually producing things that other people are consuming.  So it's the blog.  More voices.  Right.  So more people are writing.  Most of it's crap.  I agree.  That's the problem.  So what?  But that's the opportunity.  The point is most of it's crap.  But when you sit down and you have to write your arguments out, it changes how you think.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You.  I've seen no evidence of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, on some of the blogs that you associate with.  And the cream rods.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you discover new stuff.  There is a lot of new, good stuff that we wouldn't have otherwise.  I agree with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is some stuff that has shown up that is really cool.  Well, that's the point.  That's really good.  But there's so much.  So what?  Just ignore the bad stuff.  But look at the numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Very few people see that stuff.  But that's what happened when Photoshop came out.  There were a thousand interns that suddenly took over what the ad agencies were doing.  I was one of them.  And making horrible ads.  And making horrible newsletters.  But they were cheap.  Oh, I got a bump that's $7.50 an hour to do that stuff.  Yeah, but over time.  There's your work at stiff.  Yeah, but over time, you know, it congealed into something that has a lot more magazines,  has a lot more fanzines, has a lot more stuff that we had before.  Because it will take time.  But the other thing is.  Humans have no perspective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Our lives are so short.  We don't really understand what's going on.  There is something happening here, but we don't know what it is.  Do we, Mr. Jones?  Oh, man.  I'm just saying that we can't really.  I think these are natural processes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is this the way you end the argument?  This is like you go into some philosophical crap?  Yeah.  What's wrong with that?  I think he's making some points here.  I'm trying to get to the bottom of it.  We should do a show on this.  You're probably right.  We should cut this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, here's a question.  Do you know the names?  Does everybody at the table know the names of their next door neighbors?  Yes.  Yeah, I do.  As of last night, yeah.  I still haven't.  What, did they rob you?  No, we just ran into them.  They had been there for two months and we just finally ran into them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My wife is a very social person, and so I do know.  I probably wouldn't otherwise.  I know names of all people in my clan in World of Warcraft, though.  Yeah.  Well, I don't know their name names.  I know their handles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have already embarrassed yourself a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We've got to wrap this thing up.  Larry, is there anything else you want to bring up that is a hot button topic for you?  I encourage people to go to Creative Commons and read that series.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, go there now, because right now we're in the process of running a campaign to build  our own support, so we could really use it.  Do you need donations?  Yeah.  Because the IRS makes us show that we have public support, otherwise we lose our non-profit  status.  So it's important right now to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What is public support?  How is that defined?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just a large number of people.  Is there a certain number or just a small...  Each of us give a dollar.  A dollar, five bucks, that's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just go to our page, you'll see the support button.  Hits on the website don't count?  No, not yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  IRS doesn't have web...  It's all about the money, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would think that they've caught up to that.  No, no, no.  All right, well, it's been great having you, Mary.  Thanks for having me.  I'd love to come back, yeah.  As you can see, it's kind of an interesting group.  Kevin Rose couldn't be here, he was in Los Angeles, but he'll be back, and Robert.  What we're trying to do though, and I don't know if this succeeded, is cut the number  of participants down so they don't all talk over each other.  That really worked.  That was kind of lively.  It's a better group when it's five or six people.  So I think we're trying to keep it to this number, but rotate people in and out.  Patrick Norton is doing great stuff at Digital Life TV, bigger and better than ever, and  now that you're on the top ten on iTunes, I think a lot of people are going to discover  it.  Your intern never called to book me, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm waiting for my call.  It's happening next week.  Okay.  Do you want to do a Mac segment for us?  What do you want to do?  I want to do a Windows segment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  Everybody thinks I'm a Mac guy.  I should show them I'm fast in Windows chops.  You are a Mac guy.  You are a Mac guy.  Who wants Windows chops?  All right, I'll do a Mac segment.  Alex Lindsay from Pixelcore, without your great team of people and my money, I don't think  we'd be able to do this podcast.  Three of them we bought, huh?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We also get the hard drives on there?  They're coming next.  What are we getting for hard drives?  What are we getting?  We're getting the Anovia Firewire drives.  I'm just trying to get Patrick jealous.  So quick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Transcript:  I'm just loving the fact that you guys have, like, basically my entire, all the physical  hardware we've built and half the studio costs I have, you guys have spent on cameras  and hard drives.  I just think that's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We've spent because it's our money.  It's TWIT money.  TWIT money.  And we thank the TWIT donors.  It's being put to good use.  Well, I hope so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, at least it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  These are nice gear.  We spent on fish cheeks early on and I think it's probably that was a mistake.  And the doughnuts didn't help.  I wish I had that money back.  I wish I had the fish cheeks.  Next time, fish cheeks for everybody.  If you go to the website, thisweekintech.com, there are donation buttons there and your donations  help.  But like Larry, we're not asking for much.  Two dollars a month.  That's all we ask.  And we do appreciate it.  Or $20 a year or whatever you see fit.  But it is helping us make this a better podcast.  And I hope at some time that we probably will have a financial structure that doesn't require  donations that maybe we'll be able to charge for the video, give away the audio, something  like that.  We have a plan.  John keeps telling us we've got a plan.  John C. Dvorak is available online at dvorak.org slash blog and of course PC Magazine.  I'm expecting now a follow up to the Creative Commons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm working on it now.  Yeah, you'll get that right out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Larry Lessig is at CreativeCommons.org and of course his blog, which is a great reading.  What's the URL for that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's lessig.org slash blog.  Okay, so just give me a chance to throw a little plug in.

Transcript:  I want to thank the folks at AOL Radio for providing the bandwidth for this.  I just got my bandwidth bill for not for the podcast, but for the RSS.  Two thousand dollars last month.  RSS is expensive when you've got hundreds of thousands of people hitting it every few  minutes.  Can you believe that?  No.  I had no idea.  I wasn't paying for it before.  Now I will have to find another way to get it cheaper.  One thing we're going to do is probably, I was putting the show notes in the RSS feed.  That makes it a bigger file.  It's a 50 or 60K file.  I'm going to get it down to just the titles in there.  So just a little hint for people who are designing their own RSS.  Just make sure you keep the links in there so I care about that.  I think we'll put that on a webpage.  I don't think we will put it in the feed.  Yeah, that's a good idea.  Because it was costing us money.  We had no idea.  Anyway, thanks to the folks at AOL Radio who are saving us a lot of money.  We're up to I think over 40 terabytes of download now from AOLMusic.com.  Thank you AOL.
