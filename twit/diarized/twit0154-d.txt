We had so much fun last week with Kevin Rose and Patrick Norton, kind of the old guard on the show.  John C. Dvorak.  He's back.  Dvorak.org slash blog.  Hey, John, how are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I got some complaints about last week's show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, because we picked on Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, because it was said to be boring or it went off topic.  I can't win.  It's too businessy.  Well, that's an interesting question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's too businessy.  We talked a little bit about this.  A new word, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Businessy.  It was too businessy.  I got that from a couple of people.  Other people say it was just, you know, it wasn't interesting.  I don't know.  I thought it was fun.  I had fun. I liked it, too.  I thought it was great.  If people don't like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll tell you what happens with Twitter.  We just put together a different panel every week trying to mix it up.  You're one of the few consistent parts of it.  And then and it's different because of that.  It's a different character every time.  And last week, I knew it would be a lot of, you know, inside baseball because it's old buddies talking together.  But people were asking for that.  They they said, oh, it's gotten too newsy.  We want more camaraderie.  So that was the camaraderie episode.  We'll do this.  It'll be the news episode.  I do think, though, that and Scobel blogged this, that a lot of tech guys have focused more and more on business and less and less on kind of enthusiast topics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, he's one of the guys who said this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, so inside baseball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Business is or most most.  Say again.  Oh, I didn't introduce you yet.  You can't talk until you're introduced.  He's not allowed to talk.  You knew neither.  Oh, sorry.  Oops.  Also, your will Harris from Channel Flip is Channel Flip dot com, Mr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Harris. It is indeed wonderful, but only the wonderful, the the expending spectacular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that voice, my friends, is done rising or late addition to the panel board.  Don, we call them like two minutes ago.  So can you be on Twitter?  That's right. Hey, thanks for having me, Leo.  It just means you're not you're not doing nothing.  It's a Saturday. It's a Saturday night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a Saturday night here.  You think I'd be out.  You know, I'm a young guy.  You think I'd be out, you know, at a bar or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, no. Hold on a second.  It's Saturday night. What time is it?  Six, six, 15.  He's six, 15. So you're at dinner time.  What are you like living in Florida and you're 70 years old?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's I wish I was.  He's been to the early bird special at Denny's.  He's fed his had his fill of mashed potatoes and oatmeal.  And now he's ready to podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm ready to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  According to a bottle of wine at a pair of pajamas.  So I'm right here. I'm ready in your new apartment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sorry. Flat.  Very exciting. Are you still in Oxford?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, we moved just outside of Oxford.  OK, so just out of the city.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's beginning. He's gone to the suburbs.  Next stop, Babyville.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you have to go through  Department of Homeland Security to get to Babyville?  Because if you do, don't bring your laptop.  Man, what a story that was.  What is that all about?  Federal agents may take a traveler's laptop  or other electronic device to an offsite location  for an unspecified period of time without.  And this is the part that is so unconstitutional  without any suspicion of wrongdoing.  This is from the US Department of Homeland Security.  They may also share copies of the laptops contents  with other agencies and private entities  for language translation, data decryption, or other reasons.  These policies dated July 16th were issued by the US Customs  and Border Protection Agency  and the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.  Isn't it illegal to without...  This is the part that bugs me.  This is without any cause, without just cause,  to seize and inspect a laptop?  Or is there something about crossing the border  that you have to abrogate your rights?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's something about crazy fundamentalist politicians  that are doing this crap and they don't really care.  And they're making all these crazy laws  and they're trying to make it...  I think it is illegal, but they don't care.  That's something that we don't have to care about anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Isn't it on the case if you want to weigh in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sorry. Go on, John.  Let me chime in here.  Until we actually get somebody to call in or let us know.  I mean, they throw these things out there,  I think, as a cover your ass situation for the one time,  they may confiscate somebody's laptop.  But until I see laptops actually being confiscated  or iPods actually being confiscated,  like they will do if you're bringing in some good salami  from France, I might add, until I actually see that...  That's because they don't pasteurize their salami in France.  Yeah. Until I actually hear stories  or I have somebody complaining.  I mean, although I have heard this in the past,  they used to always have the ability to detain you  and go over the laptop because they were doing their...  Commonly, the Americans and the Canadians go back and forth  on this kind of thing.  Until I actually hear some stories...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're saying they're not doing it.  They're just...  Here's what Michael Chertoff,  Secretary of Homeland Security, wrote in USA Today.  He said, the most dangerous contraband is often contained  in laptop computers or other...  I'm sorry, I can't even say it with a straight face.  He should know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you know who we need for the definitive answer?  Where is Blogger Bob when you need...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Blogger Bob of the TSA.  Why should Michael Chertoff know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm just kidding.  But if you look at him, he's kind of creepy.  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, he does point out, he does point out, and this is true,  and somebody in the chat room is saying this,  look, they can go through your bags without...  Everybody's bags.  They don't have any...  Need to have any level of suspicion.  He says, this isn't gonna happen  until you get to a secondary check,  which means there was something,  we suspect you for some reason,  whether that's just cause or probable cause  is another matter.  I imagine the test for probable cause is much lower  in cases like this, right?  Because you're trying to enter the country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you walk across the border going,  that to America, that to America.  And the next thing you know,  secondary screening...  That to America?  What are you talking about, tattooing?  That to America.  That to America.  So you say that to these guys,  and they gotta look at your laptop, I mean, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Depends on whether they define contraband  as like drugs and weapons, or like MP3s and ripped DVDs,  doesn't it?  I mean, is there a ripped DVD?  Well, that's by the way,  that's what I can imagine,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  there's a lot of contraband, right?  That's the fear, it seems to me,  that most of this complaining has come about,  is based upon,  is the fear that, oh God,  I've got a couple of MP3s that I illegally copied,  and they're gonna take my laptop,  and they're gonna, you know, this is nonsense.  It's not gonna happen.  Nobody has time for this crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's fair to say that,  if you're a foreigner coming into America,  you pretty much expect to get screwed over anyway.  They take your thumbprint, they question you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do they take your thumbprint?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What I find really dis...  I mean, I don't wanna get into the like anti-American.  What's the process of coming into the country?  I'm not a tall anti-American,  but as a business person or a leisure traveler from the UK,  you're allowed to come and stay for like 60 days in America  with no visa.  Right.  For any kind of business purposes,  any kind of leisure travel.  The only type of business you can't come into America  with no visa for is journalism.  You've gotta go through a really, really elaborate process  to get an American visa if you're a journalist.  That's hilarious.  Because they sure as hell wanna know every journalist  coming into this country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that because journalists are often crypto-fascists  and terrorists or?  Crypto-fascists.  I know, I just love that.  I think they just, you know, I don't know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  but it's just the case that as a journalist,  you've gotta go through a lot of extra hoops  as opposed to any other type of business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do they fingerprint you when you come in the country?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Fingerprint, photos, passport scan, everything.  Well, let's go over the process, Will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're coming into the country.  Let's say you're on the, probably the  British Overseas Airlines Corporation, BOAC, Comet,  coming in, landing at JFK.  First of all, there's a guy, blogger Bob says,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  he don't sound American to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So number one, you've got the little forms  on the plane to fill out.  We've got the back of the form like, are you a terrorist?  Have you ever been affiliated with a terrorist group?  Have you ever been convicted of murder?  Oh, yes I am.  Have you ever been bringing any illegal drugs  into the country?  And it's like, nah, you know what I'm not.  I am a terrorist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who answers yes to that?  What kind of nutball?  That must be the nutball screening.  That's not the terrorist screening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You've got to write down where it is you're staying.  So how long you're staying and what hotel  or what residence you're staying at the time you're there.  You've then got to go into the like, the visa clearance hall,  which is like a line that takes about two hours to clear.  You're not allowed to use your cell phone  in the entry hall because that's a security risk.  I saw a guard pull a gun on a guy who was talking  on his cell phone in the security hall,  which I thought was crazy.  You've then got to give your visa.  If you're a journalist, it's got to be valid.  You've got to have a photo taken, both your thumbs scanned.  You've got to give a plausible reason for being  in the country to the person, give the date of your exit.  And then assuming you can do all that,  then you can go on your way.  The process from getting off the plane to getting through  probably takes about two hours, two and a half hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's because you're a foreigner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think you left something out.  What about that whole money laundering career  you used to have before you were a journalist?  I think that might be a tip off for these people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I've heard a lot of people.  Although I have a genuine problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I do actually have a genuine problem.  There must be some terrorist called Willam Hazira  or something somewhere, because I cannot get on a plane  without having a passport check.  And I can't use those auto check-in things online.  I can't use the self-check kiosks.  They all say you've got a problem.  And every time I go to check in,  someone has to mysteriously go and make a phone call  to check my passport every single time.  I think you're on the list.  Yeah, I asked Willam once.  Adam Curry is on this.  Every time I check in, I have to have this.  And she was like, yeah, you're on the list.  Adam Curry is on this list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How did Adam get on the list?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, how did he get on that?  Adam gets it.  It's at least a two hour thing.  He comes in.  We talk about this on the No Agenda Show.  Not a lot, but every time he comes into the country,  we go over it again.  And they all know him, which is really weird.  Oh, yeah, hey, Adam.  Yeah, well, you're on the list.  So we've got to put you through this and that.  So he finally found some guy that would tell him.  There's apparently a guy with the same name, Adam Curry,  who is out of North Dakota.  They found that much out, who is some sort  of a person of interest that they would like to grab,  I suppose.  And just for the process, just because it's  a bureaucratic joke, they have to make  him go through this whole process of questions  and answers and what are you doing here  and all the rest of it.  But I wanted to ask Will, are you coming in as a journalist?  You're saying, I'm a journalist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's not that I come in and shout, I'm a journalist.  But if they ask you, what are you doing here,  and you're reporting on something, and you say,  I'm just here for leisure purposes,  if they later find out that you're reporting on something,  like you file a story, and they happen to notice it,  then you can just be chucked out summarily.  How are they going to happen to notice it?  I don't like to take the chance.  If it's Guantanamo visa, then frankly, I'm  going to go get the visa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The thing is, when you go to China,  they always advise you, whatever you do, you put down manager.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Never ever declare that you're a journalist going to China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You never declare you're a journalist, even if you are.  And if you're doing whatever it is, the thing that they want  to see is under that line, and it's just the way it works  in some of these bureaucracies, when  you get a visa for China, your job is manager.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good.  How about businessman?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, manager.  Salary man?  I'm just telling you, manager.  You take it or leave it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I'll take it.  I'll take it.  I'll be a manager from now.  I'm a manager.  I manage.  You're totally a manager.  I am, too.  We're all managers.  The very liberal Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in the US  in April said, the government does, in fact,  have the power to conduct searches  of an international traveler's laptop  without suspicion of wrongdoing.  So you don't have a protection, US citizen or not,  if you're crossing the border, they  have the right to inspect without suspicion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I will let you know how it goes in a week or so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I feel so crazy about this, because these pro-privacy  initiatives, some of them are getting out of hand.  I was talking this week on the Digital Home  about the Google Street View, and this guy says,  Google for 30 grand or whatever it is,  because it's devaluing my property,  and you took pictures of me and all this other stuff.  Oh, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a van driving down a public street with a camera in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly.  And you can see it walking right down the street.  But then I look at this, and I say,  well, maybe those people need to focus their attention  on this sort of thing.  This is crazy.  It never ends.  And not to mention, we're being inundated with these issues.  I agree with Will.  I have to drive to Canada and have  to face all these issues with customs.  And now, it's enough is enough.  Enough is enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, I'm going to play the devil's advocate, Don Risinger,  because somebody has to.  If you're, you know, it's the same thing  on driving down the street.  You don't have the same privileges.  Driving is a privilege.  Crossing into the US is a privilege.  It is not a right.  And so you don't have the same protections as you would just  standing there.  So as a US citizen, the police don't  have the right to search you without probable cause.  They just can't.  It's illegal.  It's unconstitutional.  It's Fourth Amendment.  But it's a different thing.  You kind of abrogate some rights when you say,  I'm going to cross the border, or I'm going to drive a car.  I mean, they're actually still very insular way

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  of looking at things.  It's like, you're fine as long as you never, ever leave  America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you don't do nothing wrong, what  do you got to worry about?  What is the, you know, and now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What have you got to hide, Risinger?  What have you got to hide?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I got lots to hide.  Don't worry about that.  I'm not going to say it here.  I'll go to jail, Guantanamo, like you said.  But no, there is a limit.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hold on there, boy.  What you talking about?  What have you got to hide there?  Slow down, cowboy.  Slow down, cowboy.  What have you hide, Don Risinger?  Holy cow.  That was quite an admission, Don.  You sure you want to leave that?  Should I edit that out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Please do.  You never know.  I'll lose every job I ever had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, he's a drunk.  We all know that.  That's OK.  I'll just be on the list.  So let me, you know, this is, by the way,  just so we don't make it sound like we're  the only country with these crazy things going on.  Let me read.  I happen to have the passenger customs declaration  that you use when you're going into Korea.  And they also do the same thing, where  they ask you a bunch of questions to see how.  I think it's just a stupid question.  How dumb are you?  So it goes like this.  Customs declaration by traveler.  Are you bringing into Korea, one, firearms, knives,  crossbows or other weapons, explosives, bullets,  poisonous radioactive substance and monitoring facilities?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you have a trebuchet in your packet?  Yes.  Nunchucks.  That's all I have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Crossbows.  Yes or no?  No.  Wait a minute.  That's number one.  Number two, illicit drugs such as opium, heroin, cocaine,  methamphetamine, MDMA, cannabis, or any medicine  such as diet pills that may be prohibited  or subject to restrictions by law.  Yes or no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Prednisone.  Is that OK?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't think so.  Maybe crack.  It goes on with these kinds of things,  like get down to number seven.  Are you bringing in counterfeit currency?  Yes or no?  Eight.  Eight.  Are you bringing in pornographic materials, books, CDs, photos?  Yes.  Hold on.  Hold on a minute.  I can't lie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why is it so bad?  Why can't I bring in a copy of Hustler?  What's the big deal with that?  No, no, no.  You can't.  It's a different kind of country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You'll go down.  Yeah, no, you can't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you even had down.  No Hustler on you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What would you want to?  What were you traveling with a copy of Hustler  for, read something piece by piece?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I often wonder.  They have the airport magazines stores,  and they sell stuff like that there.  And I wonder, are you going to read that on the plane?  Like you're going to sit next to somebody,  and you're going to go, woo, on the plane?  I mean, what are you going to do?  You're going to go in the men's room?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm going to reach for the obstacle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In the men's room.  That's right.  I love the interview.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why would you buy a girly magazine in the airport  and then read it in the plane?  I mean, you can't.  Sometimes I'm watching movies on my computer,  and I go, whoa, because there's a little nudity or something  in a normal movie.  And I'm thinking, I don't want to.  I don't know.  I don't understand.  Who do they think is going to answer yes on these?  By the way, at the end, does it say, did you tell the truth?  It should.  That would be the last question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, at the bottom.  It says, I have made a correct and truthful declaration.  And you sign your name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there you go.  So really, maybe what this is all about  is then now, you've perjured yourself.  And so if they do catch you with that stuff,  they've got you on record in writing with a signature saying,  I don't have it.  So they got you extra.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, bull.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, have you guys seen this show?  It's like locked up overseas or something like that.  I think it's on the national.  You probably don't have it in the OK wheel.  What an awesome show that is.  You've seen it?  Oh, you have seen it.  Yeah, it's unbelievable.  These guys, I mean, they get locked up,  and they're in these crazy.  I was watching one where the prisoners were running  to prison, and the guards were just totally scared.  I'm thinking to myself, no, that's a place I don't want to be.  So maybe I would be honest if I was bringing,  I don't know, cocaine to Korea or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why would you be bringing any of these things anyway?  You should go.  By the way, you should travel light.  I tell everyone to do this.  Cocaine doesn't weigh much.  So your counterfeit money still weighs.  Leave the nunchucks, the crossbows at home.  Buy stuff overseas and bring it back there or ship it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So out of curiosity, are crossbows still  in widespread use and circulation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apparently in Korea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what?  I'm going to tell you one thing you  don't want to do at the airport, and that's get any apps  on the iPhone store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because you will crash it.  You will crash your iPhone as you get on the airplane.  I love the apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is this now established fact that if you update an iPhone  app over the air, you're going to break it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm the only one who's saying it.  It's my assertion that the iPhone, all  of the unreliability I'd had with the iPhone,  and I've had to restore it to a hard restore three times,  four times, all of it has gone away  when I stopped downloading applications on the iPhone  and only downloaded them on iTunes and Sync.  Same thing with updates.  And it's my contention that there is some.  And by the way, I have to say that I mentioned this  to Nicholas Jitkoff, who is the guy who wrote Quicksilver  for the Mac and he works on Google.  Yeah, we talked about it on MacBreak Weekly.  He co-wrote the Google iPhone app.  So he's an iPhone developer.  He said, I think it's true too.  I think a partial download, that if you get a broken download,  it will just smash your iPhone and you're stuck.  But anyway, it's purely empirical.  It's circumstantial evidence.  But I have to say, in three days, no problems at all.  None.  And I've got 40 apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've been pretty lucky with my iPhone 3G.  My old iPhone, it crashed all the time.  I had to restore it, I think, like five, six times.  This one, not one problem yet.  And I have actually downloaded some, not through iTunes.  I've done it right on the iPhone.  I've had pretty good luck, so I'm surprised.  Maybe I'm just in the minority, but I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, here's my thinking is that most of the time,  these downloads are fine.  So a lot of people, I have said, oh, Leo, that's not true.  I downloaded a lot of time.  Most of the time, they're fine.  The thing is, that's the thing that once in a while  goes wrong and can really screw you up.  So it's fine unless you get a bad download or a part.  I think what it is is partial downloads.  Right, so I probably should stop then.  I would recommend it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have you tried the NetShare iPhone app yet?  Now, that's an interesting story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, let's talk about this.  This is from Null River.  They do some great iPhone apps.  For about five minutes, you could buy this application  on the App Store that allows you to use your iPhone  as a tethered modem or untethered modem.  So you could use the 3G network to surf on your laptop.  It was there briefly and Apple immediately pulled it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why? And it's back again.  Is it back?  Back again, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the question is, yeah, I'm gonna download it  and immediately, it's 10 bucks.  Well, the thinking is, here's the question.  First of all, how do they...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, there's an app on the Nokia phones  that does the same thing,  only it's actually a little more interesting  because you have to hook the laptop to the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why on the run does it use Bluetooth?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it uses, so what it does is it uses  the wireless, the WiFi connection.  Yeah, actually the Nokia one uses WiFi.  And then uses 3G back out your,  3G out to your cell phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The point is a lot of cell phones allow this,  but the cell carriers hate it  because you're not paying for their extra price USB dongle.  So they've increasingly on phones disabled this in the US.  I don't know what it's like in the rest of the world.  And the thinking is that AT&T said,  ah, wait a minute, Apple approved it  and AT&T said, wait a minute.  So what's it called?  It's Net Modem?  Net Share.  Net Share, I'm gonna see if it's on there right now.  Yeah, it says, let me see.  I'm downloading it.  Yeah.  Direct link.  No, it's not.  I found a program called Net Shaker.  Oh, no.  That's an album by Nocturnal Emissions.  That's not, that's not it, is it?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Pfft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you're right, it's off, yeah.  It's not there.  It was there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's back again.  It's a scandal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It came, it went, it came, it went.  It was there, back again.  All right, you have to,  then there was a link for a while.  I think Wired had it, and then now it's gone again.  I don't know what's going on.  So what's interesting.  This is all AT&T.  I think it's, it must be,  because Apple must, has to approve these things.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, that'd be an awesome bitch to have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And, you know, it's just one of those things where,  you know, you just notice the cell phone carriers  that hate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They hate it, hate it, hate it.  Are you getting 3G on your,  because I don't get 3G anywhere.  I was in San Francisco, I didn't get 3G.  I was so annoyed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think we should sue them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, sue the bastards.  Let's make them cross into the United States  and we can confiscate everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Say, go trick us all.  You know, I don't get 3G everywhere around London,  everywhere around Oxford is 3G central.  It's fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm very disappointed by the,  there's no 3G anywhere I go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, Leo, did you see the USA Today report?  I think it was up yesterday where they said that Apple,  in exchange for that $300 subsidy from AT&T,  extended the exclusivity contract another year with AT&T.  They did.  Yeah, according to,  it's on the digital home right now.  It's the second one down.  Basically what USA Today said was that Apple had an agreement  with AT&T that said it would be over in 2008.  So next year they could start selling with Verizon  and the rest.  Then by getting the subsidy, they said,  we'll extend it one more year  and we will make it exclusive on AT&T.  Now I think it's a dumb move.  I think it's a stupid move.  Yeah, get out of the contract.  Get out of the deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is that?  I mean, Apple's a publicly held company.  I think they have a fiduciary responsibility  to shareholders to make the most amount of money they can.  But do you think this is the most they could make?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's my assumption.  I mean, obviously we don't really know  the whole situation behind the deal.  But my assumption is that,  Apple said, well, we're gonna crunch the numbers  and put $300 a pop.  We figured we can make this much.  And so I think in the short term,  it makes sense from a shareholder perspective  and a stock price perspective.  But over time, I mean, you're leaving the vast majority  of cell phone users in the United States out in the cold.  And for what?  And for nothing.  And you have T-Mobile.  And I'm a firm believer that Apple should and could  and probably will create a CDMA iPhone.  There's no reason not to, after it's all said and done.  So, I mean, you have what?  Three, four services here in the United States alone  where you can capitalize on those users.  And if they're selling this well, just on AT&T,  at that price, can you imagine how many iPhones  Apple could sell with everyone else in the fold?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'd far prefer to have a T-Mobile version.  I'm not crazy about AT&T in any respect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can't ever see them doing CDMA.  I mean, the rest of the world is GSM.  There's just like one network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The CDMA is like, I can't see them  trying to scale out a CDMA iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, my thought on it is because RIM does it, right?  I mean, they're competing big time with BlackBerry.  You can get a BlackBerry and Verizon right now.  Is that going to be the differentiating factor  if they weren't to go to CDMA?  Is that what RIM's gonna talk about  and just shove it down our throat, saying,  no, look, listen, we have our BlackBerrys going on Verizon.  The iPhone is not available there.  And so we can give you the best service,  but whatever, they're gonna BS you.  But is that the differentiating factor  that Apple doesn't want?  And I think, I don't know how you can do that  without competing with RIM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway, I wanna thank Delicious  right in the middle of our show.  They just changed to Delicious 2.0.  Oh yeah, did you see that?  I was not, I was not seeing that. Just now.  In the middle of the show.  No, it was yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Was it?  Yesterday they switched over.  Maybe you were just cashed.  Delicious.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a whole new look and I can't log in anymore.  They changed my account.  Oh, is it the Yahoo?  I might have to use the Yahoo thing.  Yeah.  Ay, yai, yai.  So speaking of unhappy internet service providers,  I guess they're kind of related to the,  I think if there's anybody more hated these days  than the cell phone companies, it's the cable companies.  Comcast.  As a segue for you.  Comcast, what is going on here?  So the FCC says on Friday,  Comcast broke the law by slowing internet traffic  for subscribers using BitTorrent.  They would break these BitTorrent connections  unilaterally, illegally, according to federal regulators.  And the FCC releases a press release saying,  victory of the rule of law.  Now let's move on.  By the way, no fine.  No penalty.  Not even a slap on the wrist.  Just don't do it.  And Comcast says, well, we're not doing it anyway.  We believe our network management choices were reasonable,  wholly consistent with industry practices.  We've never done that.  Comcast doesn't have to change a thing.  Got no penalty.  Talk about toothless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I don't understand Comcast.  Comcast may be the dumbest company  in the history of technology, or at least in that business.  I mean, in what, 2002, I think it was 2000,  I wrote this about this in Ars Technica,  2002 and 2007, the company was voted  the worst company in the world by a customer,  worst customer dissatisfaction.  It has a website dedicated to its suckiness.  It's that bad.  Well, everybody does.  I'm sure there's a twitsucks.com somewhere for sure.  Yeah, but Comcast sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I remember seeing a survey once where people said,  which is, what's the worst thing that could happen,  the worst thing in the world?  Comcast was actually higher than a heart attack.  It was worse than a heart attack.  That's how much people, I'm not kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, but the here-  For a company that's hated so much, as you all allege.  You love them?  I don't dislike them.  I get good service on my cable modem.  I get good speeds.  I actually do too.  It never goes down.  Ah, you're right.  I mean, my outages, I have had maybe one or two  that required a reboot of the,  I'm not sure if it was me or them,  but it goes away so fast you can't tell what the problem was.  I just can't complain about the,  and it's not expensive considering-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you won't be running Switzerland.  Switzerland is a tool from the Electronic Frontier Foundation.  It's an ISP testing tool, a way to see if you're in an,  in fact, I wish you would run it.  We should all run it.  A way to see if your ISP is doing any of these things  that Comcast said it's not doing.  It's an open source command line program  designed to detect the modification  or injection of packets of data  by internet service providers.  And they're particular.  I'll run it.  Yeah, I'm downloading it right now.  It's eff.org slash test your ISP slash Switzerland.  And I think this is very interesting.  The more people who run this  and come up with results, the better.  It's unfortunately, it's command line.  It means nobody's gonna run it.  I'll run it.  Good.  I'm gonna run it too.  Is your ISP interfering with your BitTorrent connections,  cutting off your VoIP calls,  undermining the principles of network neutrality?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're on a VoIP call now.  And when's the last time it's been cut off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm on DSL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, John, you like Comcast and all,  but I mean, are you getting what you pay for?  I mean, what do you get, like 20 megabits or something?  Are you getting 20?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  30 down and three up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you're actually getting it too?  Yeah.  I know the up is a lot better than it was.  And can I just point out,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  just to make this even more politically relevant,  someone in the chat room just suggested,  finding out the CEO of Comcast  and finding out who he just made campaign contributions to,  paid $1,000 to the Congressman Markey committee  to get Congressman Markey re-elected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ed Markey's good, isn't he?  I think Ed Markey is in fact,  one of the guys who's fighting for net neutrality,  oddly enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not getting this EFF thing, it's Switzerland,  I get a page not found.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, so Switzerland is spelled with a W,  you know that, right?  Uh-huh.  EFF, it's a SourceForge project,  actually you could probably go to,  let me see, I'll try this here, hold on a second.  Probably Switzerland.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Slash test your IP slash Switzerland, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh, slash test your IP.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know why they made it so long.  Or you can go to SourceForge and search for Switzerland.  I've just downloaded it, it's a, I don't know,  this is a tar file.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I got another test your, oh, I'm sorry,  that was a mistake, that wasn't.  Oh my goodness, I gotta build it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  This is not gonna happen.  It's not gonna happen.  You're gonna build it?  You gotta build it, you gotta run a make file, oh forget it.  What is wrong with these people?  You know what, you need a little gooey  that you put on your Windows machine with a big red button,  test your IP and then that's all they do.  EFF.org slash test your ISP slash Switzerland.  Folks, if you've got the know-how,  and you know what, everybody listening to Twitter  knows how to do this, build it and try it.  I'd be very curious what happens.  Have you been following the Scrabulous Scrapple?  Scrabulous, which I think is fantastic,  and it was basically Scrabble for Facebook.  In January, Hasbro rattled some swords,  they have the worldwide rights to the game Scrabble,  and they said, guys, you gotta shut this down.  It's two brothers, gotta shut this down.  Nothing happened, they sold the rights to Electronic Arts,  which immediately started developing  its own Facebook application.  Now we've got some trouble because you've got a big company  who says we're gonna do it, and so finally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why didn't Electronic Arts give these Scrabulous guys  a pot full of cash and go that way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My question, I think we talked about this last week,  my question exactly, it seems like the best thing to do  would say, here guys, here's a million bucks.  Maybe the Scrabulous guys wanted more, I don't know.  Maybe they were intractable, maybe they said no.  We're not gonna sell, I don't know.  But that seems like the obvious thing.  Just Hasbro, they did a beautiful implementation.  It was one of the most popular applications on Facebook.  Facebook finally shut it down last week.  The Scrabulous guys come back, one day later,  they redesign the whole thing, they call it Word Scraper.  And it's a little bit different looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My guess from reading a bit about these guys  is they wanted more.  They thought they had the best app on Facebook,  and they wanted a few, at least a few million,  and a one million, you know, as you say,  you'd offer them a million dollars and say thanks,  let's take it and work on it.  They wanted more than that, and the fact they obviously  had this new version ready just kind of says  they knew that they were playing hardball.  They weren't prepared to take a million and walk away.  They're playing hardball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It took them 48 hours to get this other thing up.  Now here's the question, is Word Scraper different enough?  And it's not clear.  In fact, the San Jose Mercury News interviewed  Ethan Horowitz, an IP lawyer at Kirk and Spalding,  King and Spalding in New York.  He said it's gonna come down to little things  like squares and circles and double, triple and so on.  He says what they've done is taking a step  in the right direction, but I don't think  it's a big enough step.  In other words, it's still too close to Scrabble.  You can even change the rules on this thing.  I mean, it's not, you know, custom boards.  You could make the board look like Scrabble,  but you don't have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you know, who cares?  It's Scrabble for God's sake.  Now let me ask you something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, wouldn't it, maybe I'm totally off here,  but I think it'd be cheaper to sue than to buy it.  I mean, if they want $10 million, $5 million,  why wouldn't you say, listen, you know,  we own the IP, we own the IP,  so we're gonna take you to court.  We're a huge corporation.  That's the big stick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I'm not arguing about that.  Yeah, it's true.  It might be cheaper if you bought it  and it didn't do you any good,  but if you wanted an online version that actually worked  and people were already using it.  Well, here's the irony, Electronic Arts.  That would be worth the money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Electronic Arts put up their version of Scrabble.  It doesn't work.  So it's been all janky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, the whole thing, you know, this whole story,  I realized, because I was doing this  on the TechFive news thing I do every day.  I was doing a daily story about Scrabbulous.  And I realized that the only reason this thing  is even remotely interesting as a news item  is because we like saying Scrabbulous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No. It's just an interesting name.  It's a great app and many, many people play.  How many do you play?  I had like eight boards going at once.  I bet you play at will.  You're British, you're literate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm American, I'm not, so I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You people like words.  No, I'm so British and I'm so literate.  I don't even need to play Scrabbulous.  No, you're way above that.  No, I don't do that.  Yeah, I've.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don, did you ever play Scrabbulous on Facebook?  No, I don't play, you know what?  I hate board games and why should I play  an electronic version?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why am I not surprised?  But you're literate.  You're right.  You know, in a world of ideocracies,  nobody will play Scrabbulous.  Just remember that.  So let's move on to another story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Please.  The less Scrabbulous story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In NVIDIA, which is not nearly as much fun to say.  NVIDIA is doing something very weird  and it's upsetting to me and you just raised this issue  before we started, Will, and I am a little perturbed.  So we here at TwitLive are building  the ultimate gaming machine.  I'm very proud of it.  It's a beautiful machine, about so far six or $7,000.  It's gonna be a killer.  Based, not by, not because we decided on it ahead of time,  because the listeners and the viewers wanted it.  We've based it on NVIDIA video cards,  the BFG 280 GTX, three of them in SLI, which is beautiful.  And it looked like the best motherboard to put this on  was based on an NVIDIA chipset, the 790i.  Well, now they're pulling them.  Apparently there's problems with the chipset  and NVIDIA, according to Slashdot,  is about to exit the chipset business.  Oh, that's not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I hear that they're not.  What a crock.  There's no chance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, I think, well, what's today?  I don't know what today's date is,  but on August 1st, was it yesterday?  Yesterday.  Yeah, it was.  NVIDIA came out and said, that's nonsense.  We're not doing that at all.  We're staying in and we still have a big horse in the race.  We're not doing that.  It's on DigiTimes.  Yeah, DigiTimes said that NVIDIA's denied it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  NVIDIA's had some major problems in the last couple of months.  They had first the announcement  that a lot of their mobile GPUs were faulty  and had been shipping faulty for the last six to 12 months.  And they're gonna have to take a massive charge  to possibly to fix them all.  Their basic solution for the fact  that all their chips are overheating  was to update the BIOS so that the fans ran all the time.  So if you've got like an NVIDIA based graphics card laptop,  now your fan runs like twice as often.  So that was problem number one.  Problem number two is they discovered  that there was some major issues with the 790i chipset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The one we're using on Uggum, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, and a whole bunch of the sort of Taiwanese  motherboard makers like Foxconn and Azusa and Gigabyte  have all dropped their latest 790 products  and are saying they're not gonna be making any more  motherboards using that chipset.  I think we bought the EVGA one.  Yeah, well that's probably gonna be one of them, I think.  And then at the end of this week,  NVIDIA's CFO mysteriously just resigned  for no reason whatsoever with no warning.  And we're just like, it was like, you know,  spending more time with the family kind of thing.  So it's all looking a bit iffy for those guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's terrible.  And I'm a little bummed because frankly,  I've already purchased all the parts.  They're in the mail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I think the most expensive parts,  the desktop graphics boards, those appear to all be fine.  So the 280s, the 260s, whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I got three of those, the three 280s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, those are all fine.  It's just your motherboard has a decent chance  of being flaky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, let me, this is the case,  the power supply for this thing.  It's a 1200 watts power supply  because it's got three video cards in it.  That's huge and it's water cooled.  The power supply costs more than most PCs,  700 bucks for the power supply.  The case is 400 bucks,  a thousand bucks for a case in power supply.  And I haven't even got anything in it.  Who did you go with for the power supply?  PC power and cooling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You guys. You don't agree?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, they're owned by, I believe they're now owned by OCZ.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they are.  In fact, we're using OCZ RAM, DDR3 RAM,  because it becomes pre-configured for water cooling.  It's got little block on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's always a toss up between OCZ and Corsair,  pretty much whatever you buy  on the power supply or memory front.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, as we're all talking about these,  these are these big time computers.  I just bought the EPC 1000H, it was running XP.  Fantastic, I love it.  XP?  You bought XP?  Is it the little portable HP thing?  Well, here's the thing, it comes.  Yeah, yeah, the little one, yeah.  And I install Linux too, so it's beautiful.  I'm running both and it's just absolutely,  I highly recommend it.  Oh, I love it.  I love it, it's fantastic.  That's the, you know what's funny?  I bought it for $649,  but you can get on Newegg for $549 right now.  I think it's, I don't know if it's available,  it's probably not anymore.  I should buy that, I should buy that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That sounds great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, talking about XP,  I saw the most amazing thing this week.  I went to a Sony event in London.  The video is up on Channel Flip  and they were showing off their latest Sony VIO notebooks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So these are top of the range.  Was it running the Mojave operating system?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's another topic,  but it's top of the range, amazing VIO notebooks.  And they've all got these massive  Design for Windows Vista stickers all over them.  I'm like, so this is your latest thing?  Yeah, yeah, we love these,  we're shipping millions and they look fantastic.  And I was like, oh yeah, so are they designed for business?  They were like, yeah, they're designed for business  and we also ship Windows XP in the box.  I'm like, what?  In the box?  Yeah, we ship Windows Vista pre-installed,  but we also give a couple of Windows XP disks  because we know a lot of our business customers  don't want to use Vista.  Wow.  So they're shipping the XP disks in the box  along with Vista disks.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How crazy is that?  Isn't that interesting?  I guess that's what business users want.  What do you think?  Now, I'd like to ask you guys,  because we do a Windows podcast, Windows Weekly,  Paul Therod is really up in arms  and this Mojave experiment kind of, you know,  backs him up on this saying,  Vista's getting a bad rap.  Here it is, it's been a year and a half.  People should be buying Vista.  What are they crazy?  They're buying XP.  This Mojave experiment was kind of an interesting idea.  It was like the Folgers Crystal ad.  We secretly substituted Folgers Crystal  for this fine coffee.  And oh, it's Folgers Crystal, this tastes great.  So they took, I think 150 people  and they said, what do you think of Vista?  And the people said, you know,  the average rating was 3.4, something out of 10,  just, nobody wants Vista.  They said, well, we'd like to show you  the new Microsoft Windows.  This is Mojave.  And they showed them Vista.  They didn't tell them it was Vista  and did a bunch of things and then say,  what do you think of Mojave?  Oh, love Mojave.  Love it, it's wonderful.  Well, guess what?  We've put, this is really Vista.  Ha ha!  Now, of course, they're only showing,  out of the 100 some people that they interviewed,  they're only showing about 30, 40 videos.  So I don't know what the other people said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, here, I wrote,  actually anyone out there listening to this podcast  should go to MarketWatch.com and read the column  in my analysis of this specific situation,  which to boil it down is the following.  Microsoft has got their heads up their ass  to even be doing this because all it does  is indicate that they allowed a public perception of Vista  to go so astray that they had to find some trick  to get people to realize that Vista's not that bad.  But in so doing, they just proved  that they don't know what they're doing  because they have to, the question is,  why did they have to do this trick?  Because they're so boneheaded,  they screwed up so badly with the marketing of Vista.  Absolutely.  It's unbelievable to me that they would do this  and you can go to them mojaveproject.org or com or net  or whatever they have to do.  And you watch this thing and say,  what is wrong with you people?  You're just admitting that you're idiots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ha ha ha!  I find it really interesting.  There was a really interesting British comparison,  which is the Conservative Party over here,  which is sort of like, I guess,  the equivalent of your Republicans,  added a survey a couple of years ago  when they were sort of down and out  in terms of British politics.  And they discovered that, it was something ridiculous,  like 70% of British people agreed with their policies  until they were told they were the policies  of the Conservative Party.  And then they go, oh wow, that case.  And then they go, oh my God, no.  Yeah.  And it seems like the same as Vista.  You show anybody Vista without telling them  it's Microsoft Vista, and they think, oh yeah, it's okay.  And as soon as you tell them it's Vista,  it's like, oh, no way, no way, I've heard.  Even my, we have an accountant that comes in,  is a really nice woman that comes into our books  and stuff at Channel Flip.  And I mean, she's the most middle of the road,  non-techie woman whatsoever.  It's purely like she has this laptop  and she carries it around in her big laptop bag  and she plonks it out and she fires up the computer  and opens up the accounts thing.  And she was like, oh, I wanted to buy a new computer,  but is there a way to get one without Vista?  I heard this Vista thing.  I get that question all the time.  And I'm like, how do you even know?  How do you even care?  But it's gone so mainstream now, this perception.  Well, here's the question.  Is it legitimate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it a legitimate perception?  Is Vista that bad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think it is anymore.  I mean, number one, the company sold  170 million licenses as it is.  I mean, it's not like it's not doing well, number one.  Number two, I don't think it's that bad.  The driver support is back up to where it should be.  I've talked to Microsoft a few times  and they've assured me that things are going to get better  and whether or not that's true is another story.  But I think it's just this perception.  And going back to what John said,  that perception got this bad because of Google.  I mean, this company is so focused on Google,  it's almost forgotten that it's a software business  until about a month ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me interrupt you on that one  because I agree that you're right.  They're too focused on Google.  But in that regard, in this column that I wrote,  I blame the whole thing on Apple  because Apple, since 2006, over two years now,  they've been doing those PC versus Mac ads,  which are nothing more than attack ads.  And especially the more recent ones,  attack ads against Vista and Microsoft has sat there  and watched these ads go by for years and years  and did nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They had their head up there wherever you said it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think it's that they had their head up there behind.  I think it's that they were really going  with that school of marketing  where you don't pay any attention to your competitors' claims  because if you pay attention to them,  you draw attention to the claims,  you draw attention to your competitors,  and you validate it.  And so they tried to basically ignore it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But unfortunately, Apple puts those ads everywhere.  Yeah, they put those ads everywhere.  You couldn't draw more attention to it by countering it.  And I love Microsoft's response to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, I love Microsoft's response to this Apple thing.  Brad Brooks came out a couple months ago  and before they started this whole thing,  and that's a VP at Microsoft,  and he says, you thought the sleeping giant was sleeping?  We've woken up and it's time to take our message forward.  I mean, shut up.  I mean, please.  I mean, just shut up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just hit him.  Microsoft, you know, the thing,  there's a real weird irony I, which I didn't discuss,  which I've always gotten a kick out of.  You know, people, you know, I've been writing for PC  or computer magazines for a long time.  And all along you hear, well, you know,  the only reason everybody's writing all this positive stuff  about Microsoft is because they're a big advertiser  and you just do what advertisers say,  which is common thing you run into in the magazine thing.  The joke of it is Microsoft's never been a big advertiser.  They've been a cheapskate.  They don't know anything about marketing  and their advertising budget,  I don't know what it is or where it goes,  but I'm telling you, it never showed up in PC magazine.  You can pick up a copy right now  and take a look in the advertising index in the back  and see who's advertising.  I would venture to guess that out of, you know,  any 10 issues, you'd find no Microsoft ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But nobody wants to hammer on Microsoft, do they?  Well, that's what we're doing now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, but Microsoft's spending $300 million  on its latest PR campaign with this whole new-  This whole new campaign is huge, yeah.  And it's like, what, double or three times as much?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they haven't done anything yet.  They're still doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, what was that interactive site?  There's an ad there you click on  and it brings you to the truth about Vista  or whatever, a couple weeks ago.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that one, that Mojave experiment website  must have cost them 100 grand.  You know what's funny?  I mean, that's the fanciest thing I've seen  and it's like pointless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you know what's funny?  It's in Flash, not Silverlight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that is funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't even trust their own damn technology.  Here, let's just see what somebody said about-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's just an informal discussion.  I'll be asking some questions  and just answer them as honestly as you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This was San Francisco, by the way they did this.  If people could see Windows Vista firsthand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just the bad things I've heard about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just heard negative things.  I never tried it myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wouldn't touch the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Horrible, we have so many problems.  So this is the first thing you see.  Now, all right, I've been 30 seconds on this site.  I'm done.  So what is the takeaway?  Vista sucks.  They launch with the negatives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I didn't think of that.  The organizational structure of that pitch is pretty bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the thing, when you went,  we just went to the site.  Now, most people do not spend more than 20, 30 seconds  on a site.  At no point did you get to a point  where anything good was said about Vista.  It was only, oh, it's terrible.  I hate it.  This is, even this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you walk away from that site board  within the normal 15, 20 seconds,  you're walking away with more bad perceptions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you're a shareholder, what is your mindset here?  My company failed me.  My management failed me.  How the hell are we gonna let this happen?  And watch and have this management team  preside over this degradation in our brand.  And it's just kind of like, oh, we'll fix it.  But is it too late?  You figure Windows 7's coming down the pike soon enough.  By the end of next year or the beginning of 2010.  So is there enough time here for Vista  to get into the business realm?  Intel and GM have both said  they don't want anything to do with Vista.  So how do you play that game?  How do you get Vista into the enterprise before Windows 7?  Even when Bill Gates said, oh, it'll be better for business.  Windows 7 will be better for business and everything else.  So how do you play?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a screwed up company.  They're just screwed up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's just AR.  They're screwed up.  It's Google.  I really think it's Google.  They're focusing on Google and okay, fine.  They're chasing their tail as a result.  They're chasing, yeah.  I mean, you can't be both.  You have to do both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not gonna argue against it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think they just need to push out a new version  as soon as possible.  They don't even need to admit they're wrong  because I don't think they were that wrong,  but they just need to create the perception  that they're admitting that they're wrong.  They obviously can't do that.  Push out a new version and just pretend  like everything's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They obviously can't do.  They can't do anything.  Their ability to control perception of the company  has been somewhere along the line lost.  When what you described, they can't do.  They can't do it.  They can't do anything that has to do with perception.  It's completely out of control.  It's out of their hands.  They used to really do a good job  of controlling perception about the company,  but now it's outside influence that's doing it  and they don't seem to have a clue about it  and it just goes crazy and Apple versus PC ads  will keep coming and they're gonna make it worse  and I don't see any saving grace here anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's talk about Yahoo yesterday.  The Yahoo board met.  This was the showdown, the deadline, August 1st.  Carl Icahn managed to, before the board met,  score three seats so he's kind of withdrawn  his hostile proxy fight.  On the other hand, it seemed like everybody loved Yahoo  at the board meeting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  T-Boon Pickens didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  T-Boon, now is he involved in this too?  Seems like he's running.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well he was for a while.  He sold all his shares.  He said he was fed up with this company and boom, he's out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He wants to, he's like he's running for president now.  I see him on every news channel.  I got a plan, I have a plan.  He's running, he's like Ross Perot.  He's running for president.  I have a plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have a plan.  I'm just gonna be tricking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Yahoo shareholder meeting was that apparently AOL  is objecting to Jonathan Miller being nominated to the board.  Like formally objecting.  Miller is?  Miller is one of the former head honchos at AOL.  He was one of Carl Icahn's picks  to go onto the Yahoo board.  And AOL is objecting on the basis that he's got  insider knowledge basically of a competitor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh that's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That he left AOL, he was tied into not working  for a competitor for a certain number of years  and he's off to the Yahoo board and now they're complaining.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Shareholders, I heard, I don't know,  voted overwhelmingly in favor of the current board.  They gave him a strong thumbs up.  Which is surprising.  Well then they deserve what they get, don't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They deserve what they get.  Their $10 stock price is imminent.  Well that's the weird thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is what everybody thought is that the Yahoo shareholders  who were offered, what is it, $31 for their $23 shares  of Yahoo stock would rebel at the shareholders meeting.  They voted 79.5% in favor of the chairman Roy Bostock.  Up from two thirds last year, he got more votes.  85% in favor of Jerry Yang.  This is a strong endorsement.  Apparently they're not upset about the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean they should be.  I mean they're looking at about $20 stock price right now.  They could have had $33 on that price.  They could have walked away with a good amount of money.  Number one.  Number two, it's like, maybe, you know,  obviously I don't want to put words in his mouth  and whatever else, but Jerry Yang has, in my opinion at least,  presided over, well basically screwing over his shareholders  in a lot of ways.  He's made all the wrong decisions.  He's pushed Microsoft away and to be honest,  Microsoft was the only way that Yahoo shareholders  could walk away with a pretty good premium  on their investment and how can they do that now?  How can they do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean it's.  Oh, you're full of crap on this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now you tell me, why is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well for one thing, the stock's been as high as 80.  And the other thing is you're not necessarily  buying a company just so you can dump it on Microsoft.  This is not like some sort of a two bit startup  that begins life so they can sucker some big company  to buy in them.  These guys are, you know, a pretty big operation.  I mean, they got a 20, you know, yeah,  right now the market cap's down to 27.7,  which is nothing to sneeze at.  I mean, they're the number one website more often than not  on the internet.  They have a lot of potential.  Jerry Yang just got in after Terry Semel really didn't  do much in the company.  How long has Yang been in?  Yet less than a couple years trying to, you know,  reclaim the early momentum that they had.  I don't think it's a big deal.  I don't, I'm not.  I'm not in the camp.  They're, oh God, let's dump the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I want to save Microsoft, Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're saying like, you know, they're not a startup.  They shouldn't be judged like a startup.  Because, you know, they're not just trying  to get bored or something.  But on the other hand, you know,  I've seen startups with more direction and more purpose.  Okay, so they're, you know, I don't think we should be.  But they have some good problems.  You can't say they don't have some.  They've been around for so long, you know,  they should not be in this position.  They're basically, they are like a startup  because they don't know what they're doing  and they haven't got anything apart from this one thing,  which is, you know, their popular Yahoo.com homepage.  If you took away the Yahoo.com homepage,  what has Yahoo got?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Frankly, you're still making them sound like Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, well, you know, on the other hand,  to take the other side of the story,  I would have liked to have seen Microsoft gobble  these guys up because I think it would have been  the end of both companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what I think.  I think from a consumer point of view,  it's really, really good that this didn't happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, like John, you talked about market cap.  And the revenue at Yahoo is fine  and they're making a profit, but as a shareholder,  as you know, as Joe Q Public Shareholder,  who just invested a thousand shares in Yahoo, right?  And when I look, all I really care about at that point,  in all sense, I mean, is the price of the shares.  And if it's 1980 today, and if I can make whatever,  what, $15 extra on my investment per share of 15 grand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what's wrong with this country, Don Risinger,  is people are saying, let's just make money.  They're not thinking long-term.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, if you look long-term at Yahoo,  what does it really have going for it?  I mean, it's being boxed up by Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's got great properties.  It's, there's admittedly some problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What are its great properties, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, search may not be very strong.  I think they're going to get  the online advertising thing up and going.  I think that's going to work very well.  They've got a good deal with Google.  It's worth $800 million a year.  They have some very-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's not a Yahoo property.  That's a Google property.  But it doesn't matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a business.  It's part of their business.  They've got some great properties, I think.  They're not really using them very well yet,  but there's TV.com could be really strong.  I think Yahoo Groups.  I mean, there's a lot-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think Yahoo Finance is the best to bring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yahoo Finance is fantastic.  Everybody still uses it.  What's wrong with Yahoo Mail?  It may not be number one.  It's probably number two after Hotmail.  I mean, I think Yahoo's number two search,  number two search in this business is pretty darn good.  I don't think they're foundering.  They are profitable.  If they were losing money, I think you could say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, I mean, if you-  I mean, number one, Yahoo search in the US, at least,  is like 21%, something a little bit higher, obviously,  worldwide, but-  But Google's because it's Google's 80%.  I mean, it's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're 60, 70%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, exactly.  But search has always kind of been the key  to the advertising platform for Google.  And then we moved to advertising,  which is where Microsoft really wants to go.  It's where Yahoo should be wanting to go  and where Google really commands the industry.  It's in charge.  And if Yahoo isn't even in that space,  which it barely is right now,  how can it really look to the future and say,  we have a lot of opportunities for growth,  we're gonna make a ton of money in advertising,  and we're going to supplant Google as a leader in that space?  I don't see that happening.  I mean, basically, you're looking at-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  TV.com has seen it, by the way.  I'm sorry, that was the wrong property.  I apologize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're thinking of broadcast.com,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  which is pretty much-  Broadcast.com, and there's nothing there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, no, all the logic that you have, Don,  is correct from kind of a cold-blooded perspective.  But the fact of the matter is,  I mean, there's potential here.  Now, that said, I will agree with everyone  who ever says the company's disorganized.  And that is what the-  And you come talk to people that are working there  or people that were gonna work there  or people that are in and out of there,  they'll tell you the same thing,  that they don't, nobody,  there's no structure, it's like a glob.  There's no, they don't have an organization type  of person in there.  They don't have a Alfred Sloan is what they need.  Some guy who can come in there  and instead of just trying to buy more crap,  it's almost like a junk collector, this site.  But they have some, but these things are of some value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think it's possible they could cobble this together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nobody knows who reports to who.  I mean, it's just a complete mess, that company.  I mean, it's very poorly structured.  It's a disorganized thing.  Some things work, some things don't.  And they buy dumb things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, essentially though, selling it at this point  would be saying, okay, we give up.  It's more valuable.  And I don't think it's more, I don't think it's,  I think it's worth, I think it's reasonable to say  it's worth more than 33 bucks a share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, not only that,  but there's apparently a number of patents.  If you really start looking into this,  and I've written about this too,  and I think it was in MarketWatch last week,  there's a number of very obscure patents that these guys,  these guys every so often get into patent mode.  And they've filed lots of interesting patents  that don't seem to have anything to do with their business.  And it's believed by some people  that one or two of these patents  is really what Microsoft's after.  So then you put the screws to Google perhaps,  and they're not after anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The funniest thing that Google did this week was,  not Google, sorry, best thing that Yahoo did this week  was their takeoff of the search engine, the Yule.  Yeah, I was thinking.  That they built, which is now the takeoff of Cool.  What the heck was that?  Cool was pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just to show that Cool was junk.  Oh, it is, awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do we think the Cool is junk?  They claim, first of all, they've indexed more pages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're not gonna use page rank.  They're gonna use what they say is a better way  to rank stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's terrible.  It's a terrible site.  I mean, I did a bunch.  I mean, I did a column.  I hate to keep plugging myself,  but what else have I got to do in my spare time?  This week in PCmagazine.com, go check it out.  I did a search on, you know, Sergey Brin.  They got nothing on him,  but they got a bunch of stuff on their own people.  And I did a vanity search.  They can't even find Dvorak.org slash blog,  let alone, I mean, Dvorak, they can't even find my,  it seems to me that if you look somebody up  on a search engine, the first thing it would do is say,  well, I wonder if there's a, perhaps a domain name,  you know, that that guy,  which has got the guy's name in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It did really well on my vanity search.  Did it find you, Bill?  Oh yeah, first thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think these index sites, index pages, I should say,  I guess there's a difference,  but I think it's a bunch of hogwash.  I just did a quick little thing on Ql here,  Twit, right?  We did Twit, 127,440 results.  I do it on Google for over 4 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But are they 4 million, are those better, all better?  I mean, how many do you need?  Did you need the extra 800, whatever, million?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, but the ones on,  I guarantee the ones on Google are better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They are, I mean, I go on to, on Google,  it's twit.tv, first one.  I go on to Ql, whatever, thisweekintech.com.  Same site, that's the same site.  Same site, great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have to say, my new favorite search engine of all,  is the Pragerpedia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love the Pragerpedia.  We talked about this last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The first thing I did, I logged onto Pragerpedia.  I typed in Will Harris, and it came up with a real answer,  and I thought, well, that's it.  Pragerpedia is it for now.  Pragerpedia.  Well, anything- Pragerpedia.net.  It's absolute genius.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the one thing I found out about the Ql search thing,  which I got a kick out of, which I'm gonna have to blog.  I took a screenshot.  It seems to match photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If I were you, I'd be mad about the photo part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A random photo, and then they got one with me,  and my picture was showing I'm John Stossel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I agree.  The photo algorithm is not working too well.  It's kind of strange.  But I do like the magazine layout.  I like the categories.  Here's the real problem Ql has, and it's inexplicable.  With all the money they spent on PR,  they got the biggest launch I've ever seen a site have.  In fact, such a big launch that they were down  most of Monday.  What the hell's with the name?  You can't spell it, you can't pronounce it,  it makes no sense, and by the way,  they claim it's Gaelic, it's Irish for knowledge.  It's not!  It's not even a real word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have to say, the best thing,  I had to do the vanity search on Ql,  and I Googled, and I Ql'd, it doesn't even work, does it?  I Ql'd Will Harris.  You can't even do that.  And the discussion page for Wikipedia articles  for deletion, Will Harris, comes before the Wikipedia page.  I saw that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they got that one right.  By the way, the funny thing about the Wikipedia,  which is the only time I got close to the dvorak.org  attribution, is that it was a Wikipedia  that came up on page three.  It says my Wikipedia entry,  but in all the press material, they went on and on  about how it's all too much Wikipedia crap  shows up in Google, we're trying to avoid that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, PowerSet made some money, they sold to Microsoft  because they were a good Wikipedia search.  Maybe they should have taken that point of view.  I think the interesting thing about Ql  is that they clearly knew what they were doing purely in PR.  They do very well in all, like the A-list blogger searches,  like Scobel, you know, those pages are great.  They're well done.  Obviously, a human hand involved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's my complaint.  It was obviously hand tweaked.  And not for you, not for you, though, ironically.  I was cut out.  But they had everybody, a bunch of people were hand tweaked  knowing that they do it, because everybody does.  If you have enough web presence,  you always do a vanity search  because you know what to expect.  And so it seems to me that if I'm gonna do  a vanity search on myself, I'm expecting to see  something from either the blog or PC Magazine  or Market Watch or even this show.  I got none of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's better if you search for John Dvorak,  not John C. Dvorak, by the way.  You get a great picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I did both.  I did both.  Actually, it's failed on John C. Dvorak more often than not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, John Dvorak actually did better.  Although the number two result is master 500 hats.  An article that says John Dvorak is a big fat idiot.  He didn't hear that because he's answering the phone.  Let's move on.  Before we, no, no, no, no, nothing.  Nothing happened.  Nothing happened while you were gone.  It's all fine.  Let me take a break.  We wanna thank our folks at Zviza  and then we'll come back with more news stories.  This is a tweet you're listening to with Don Risinger  from digitalhome.cnet.com and many other places now.  Ours, Technica, where else do you write for, Don?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mashable, we do Computer World, Information Week,  IT World, and also check out the Digital Home Podcast.  We do that too every week.  And now we're starting video,  a daily video thing too on CNET.  Is it gonna be streaming live?  Oh no, no, I'm not gonna compete with you, Leo.  That's a career suicide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I'm the only one  that's crazy enough to do this, fortunately.  Also, Will Harris from the UK and the Channel Flip  and of course, John C. Dvorak.  This show brought to you by the good folks at Zviza.  We all have better things to think about  when it comes to shopping online.  You wanna think about what you're gonna buy.  Am I gonna go to Zappos to get those fine Adidas?  You don't wanna have to be thinking about online fraud.  That's why you use your Zviza card.  I can't tell you how much I wish  I'd been using my Zviza card  the last time I shopped online.  All the purchases you make are safe and secure with Zviza.  And I wish I'd had this ad in front of me then.  Zviza has many ways to prevent, detect, resolve online fraud.  Very sophisticated real-time fraud detection software.  Here's the key.  All you gotta really remember is zero liability.  You are not liable for unauthorized purchases.  It's just that simple.  That's peace of mind.  That's how they do it, baby.  Safe, secure, Zviza.  Zviza, back there.  We thank them so much for their support  for however much longer it lasts of this week in tech.  All right, let's move on.  Do we have other stories in the hopper today?  Well, actually, before I finish,  let's finish Yahoo real quickly.  Carl Icahn does not show up.  They haven't decided who the other  board members are gonna be.  But it seems like business as usual,  except that I don't know how they're gonna incorporate  Carl Icahn into these board meetings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He won't show up ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He didn't even come to the meeting.  He didn't come to the meeting.  He's just like, it's a token?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  That's the guy's kind of a character.  Let's see what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The next two months are gonna be really crucial,  I think, for Yahoo.  Are they gonna pull anything out  that's even remotely interesting, you know, or better off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm rooting for them.  I don't know about you guys,  but they're an internet pioneer,  and I'm just rooting for them.  I want them to survive.  I think it's better to have an independent Yahoo  that's part of Microsoft, of all things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I hope they do well.  And it's not that I think that Yahoo  should just be sold and cut up and done away with.  It's just that, in my mind at least,  and maybe this is me being like,  as John said, the cold-blooded accountant that I used to be,  but I have to look out for the shareholders in my mind,  at least, and the shareholders I think would benefit best  if they had sold it to get Microsoft.  But if they're not going to do it,  which it doesn't look like it's going to happen now,  I'm hoping it all turns out well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you guys read the New York Times Sunday magazine last week?  Big article about internet trolls, of all things.  It says, trolls are a growing internet subculture  with a fluid morality and a disdain  for pretty much everyone else online.  We are, it kind of stuns me that the New York Times,  the August Grey Lady, would devote  an entire long feature article on internet trolls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is, how do they define it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, let's see if I can find a good definition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because I mean, you know, the typical slash dot,  you know, according to one of those guys,  everyone's a troll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In the late 1980s, internet users adopted the word troll  to denote someone who intentionally disrupts  online communities.  I think that's a very general definition,  but I think it's true.  Today, the internet is much more  than an esoteric discussion forum.  It's a mass medium for defining who we are to ourselves  and others, and trolling has evolved from ironic solo skit  to vicious group hunt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think, I think they're mixing up definitions  with flamers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, aren't flamers a subset of trolls?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think so.  I think trolls are people who, I mean, I don't think so.  No, my definition of troll isn't this at all.  It's not a troublemaker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's interesting is they claim that trolls  keep score using something called lulz,  a corruption of LOL or laugh out loud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are they making this up as they go along?  Have they been reading too much of the Lord of the Rings?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've never heard of this, but lulz, but okay.  I mean, I presume that somebody did some research.  Correct me, have you ever heard of this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they got suckered.  I think somebody told them this crab made it up  and these guys roll really low.  Okay, let me put that in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Lulz means the joy of disrupting  another's emotional equilibrium.  So a troll says, here's the idea.  You look for someone who's full of it, a real blowhard.  Not like anybody here.  Yeah.  Not like any of us.  Then you exploit their insecurities  to get an insane amount of drama, laugh and lulz.  The rules would be simple.  One, do whatever it takes to get lulz.  Two, make sure the lulz is widely distributed.  This will allow for more lulz to be made.  The game is never over until all the lulz have been had.  Am I saying it right?  Is it LOLs, lulz?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I never heard of this.  How are you spelling it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  L-U-L-Z.  That's not true.  Okay, wait a minute, let's do a poll of everybody.  Wait.  Chat room, chat room, we need your help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait, and also let's do a poll.  You haven't heard of it, I haven't heard of it.  Have you other two guys heard of it?  No. No.  Oh, this is the New York Times.  All right, anybody?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe it could be that the New York Times  is so ahead of the curve,  none of us have actually heard of it yet.  That'll be the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, so I'm asking, I mean, look,  if anybody would know, it's our very literate,  we've got 300 people in one chat room,  about 500 people in another chat room,  thousands of people watching.  Guys, gals, what's lulz?  Anybody heard of it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm looking at Encyclopedia Dramatica,  and they have a definition in there,  which I think that somebody obviously,  I don't know where this came from.  I've never heard of this before.  There's not much on, if you Google lulz,  lulz or whatever the heck it is, you don't find much.  Encyclopedia Dramatica is a catchphrase  which serves as a catch-all explanation  for any trolling you do,  or any internet drama you cause to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's trying to create drama.  Yeah.  Now I'm in the Urban Dictionary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, Urban Dictionary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right, well, it just,  beginning as a plural variant of lol,  lulz was originally an exclamation,  but is now often used as a noun,  meaning interesting or funny internet content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It comes from, I'm sorry, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good.  Now it says, now here's what I don't understand.  Figure this one out.  It says, lulz is the one good reason to do anything,  from trolling to rape.  After every action taken,  you must take the epilogic, dubious disclaimer.  I did it for the lulz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What?  And here's another one, here's another one.  This one is from a Critical Mass blog archive.  Lulz comes from the acronym LOL,  meaning laughing out loud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because it's for the,  you're saying basically I did it for the lols.  I did it for the laughs.  The kicks.  Yeah.  I've heard lolz.  Yeah.  You know what?  I think the Times got burned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they got burned.  I think they got rickrolled.  Exactly, they got rickrolled with a crock.  This is like not a main thing at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was in the Sunday Times Magazine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, who's the writer?  Let's call out the writer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mathias Schwartz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you think somebody told him  this completely dubious definition?  They just told it to him for the lolz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  M-A-T-T-A-T-H-I-A-S-S-C-H-W-A-R-T-Z.  It looks like they got interviewed.  I think they got lolz.  That's what I think happened.  They did an interview,  it looks like they did interviews with a number of  slash B slash guys who clearly  took the reporter for a ride  and are laughing all the way to the bank.  Now there is actually a very interesting  real news story tied to this,  which is that two women at Yale Law School  sued posters who posted violent fantasies about them  on a college admissions message board.  They've won the lawsuit, I understand,  but the lawyers are in hiding  because they're getting countersued.  They're getting lulled back themselves.  So there is it, there is it.  There is certainly a,  I think there is a culture on the internet  of this kind of vandalism, this gaming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well yeah, if you'll read the caption,  this guy, Weave, is that his name?  What kind of name is Weave?  Anyway, this is, well it's not his real name.  It's part of a growing internet subculture  with fluid morality and disdain for pretty much  everyone else online.  Look at him, look at him.  He's fantastic.  Look at him.  He's fantastic, he's beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He looks like a troll.  He looks like he belongs under a bridge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A real troll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's an actual troll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love the caption, it's just the trolls among us  and just this picture of this guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't have a link to that, send me a link to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I will, it's the Sunday Times Magazine.  If you just go to NewYorkTime and whitetimes.com,  I'll tell you what, I'll put it in our,  well I can't put it in Twitter  cause I no longer have a Twitter account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Send it on a comment thing on Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's comment on Skype, okay, well I can't.  Can you do that for him guys?  Cause I don't have access to a Skype from this computer.  Skype's on its own special band.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh that's right, you got some weird lash up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a weird, that's a good, I like that word, lash up.  Yeah it's an old.  It's like a Britishism.  It's like when you're driving at a triumph down the highway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In Britain getting lashed means getting completely drunk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh there you go.  Never heard that but okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You go out with a lash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do the Brits think about lulls?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ah, I think the New York Times just got Rick rolled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you're right.  The more I think about this,  when I first saw the article I thought,  oh that's good they're covering,  but then as I read it I'm glad you actually pushed that John  because as you read it it actually has nothing to do  with the trolls we know,  which are jerks in message boards and comments.  Nothing to do with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No this is like something, I don't know where they get,  I mean this is, I mean it's kind of interesting but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well I'm sure the people reading it are like,  darling did you hear what's happening  on the internet these days?  Exactly.  They've got these things called trolls.  Oh dear what is that darling?  And they keep score.  They keep score with something called lulls.  Is it like croquet darling?  I don't know.  Have another martini, think I will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Without buying into the New York Times stereotype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well they're just country club liberals  drinking their chardonnay.  Let's see any other big stories?  Man arrested for YouTube baby food threat.  My daughter's all excited about that.  Abby's kind of giddy in here.  Do you know about lulls?  Do you know any trolls?  My daughter's in here and she's just going crazy.  There, a New York man named Anton Dunn  has been posting offensive videos on YouTube  in which he claims to have killed people  and infected more than 1500 women with AIDS.  His name is Trash Man.  His videos are picked up by the tabloid press.  Now he's under arrest for putting videos up  about poisoning Gerber products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well that guy's a total creep.  Not a zoid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank goodness for that.  That's a troll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wonder if he collected any lulls for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's my, your honor I did it for the lulls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I saw that apparently MobileMe is back up again now.  Yeah.  Allegedly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  General Osomo Francisco Franco's still dead.  MobileMe is back up, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I feel like the, you know back in the Iraq war  where they had that guy, the general  who was just the most improbable guy,  we are slaughtering them in the streets.  That picture of him just with the caption  like there is nothing wrong with MobileMe.  MobileMe is fine, we are all fine here.  We are slaughtering the invidels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fine, it's fine, it's all fine.  So they confirmed there's water on Mars, that's good news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm moving there.  I thought we already knew that.  I thought they kept on talking.  Every year they have another thing on Mars  and every year I think they talk about this water.  You know, every year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In fact, two or three years ago  when I was up at Telluride at the tech fest up there,  there was this one of our, the NASA guys,  it was a Mars expert, or I guess he was from JPL,  was talking about that underneath the surface  there's tons of water and they all know it.  And you know, now every time it comes around  they're finding water again.  We got more water here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So here's the deal.  We've seen evidence for this water ice before  in observations by the Odyssey, which is the Mars orbiter,  and in disappearing chunks.  Remember the Phoenix saw those white chunks.  It scraped some soil and then saw what chunks  and then they ablated, they disappeared.  But this is the first time according to William Boynton  of the University of Arizona,  Martian water has been touched and tasted.  Who tasted it?  I don't know.  That's what he said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to talk to this guy.  He used it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When they find oil on Mars,  when they find oil on Mars, then we know we've got something.  Yeah, then there'll be an attack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If we find oil on Mars, we're all, believe me,  there'll be lots of Mars exploration going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think now that they found water,  the next thing that goes up that they should plant shrubs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Bring me a shrubbery.  A shrubbery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, let's pause for a moment.  I don't think it'd get any sillier.  A mention from audible, audible.com slash twit.  They are the folks who do those great audio books.  We all love so well.  50,000 titles.  If you are in the car and you're listening to podcasts,  if you listen at the gym, if you listen to audio content,  you really ought to try audio books.  What a great way to expand your horizons,  to learn, to enjoy, to entertain yourself.  I mean, 50,000 books, you'll never run out.  We do a podcast with Roz Savage.  She's rowing across the Pacific Ocean,  and I gave her an iPod full of books.  She listens to more than a book a day  because she listens 11 hours a day.  So that's averaging more than one book a day.  And thank goodness, I gave her 300 books  because she's been going powering through them.  But she says, I don't know what I'd be doing  without those books to listen to,  I'd be going out of my nut.  Audible, podcasts, I mean audible.com slash twit.  Audible, and I thought this would be a good one for you.  Let me see.  Oh no, I can't find it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can I give you a recommendation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, okay, yeah.  I never let you guys, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sorry, I didn't mean to jump in.  No, please do.  I've been listening to Dreams From My Father.  This is Barack Obama's, yeah.  Very topical, he reads it, he reads it very well.  So regardless of your politics on the issue,  it's actually a very interesting lesson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dreams From My Father, a story of race and inheritance.  Yeah, let's make that our topic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like to listen to audible books  where they're actually read by the author  rather than by somebody else,  because I always think that brings  just a little something extra to it.  Well, if they can read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are some, there are some where I think,  boy, they really should have got a pro on this one.  They really could have,  they could have done a good job with a pro on this one.  But no, Obama does read very well.  I think he's quite polished in this,  and says it is the story of his father.  This was a Grammy Award winner, by the way,  for best spoken word album of 2005  before he was even a twinkle in John McCain's eye.  And-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I'm also gonna recommend, if I can,  can I go for a double header,  because I'm reading two books in the morning.  Yeah.  I told you-  Star Wars, The Thrawn Trilogy by Timothy Zahn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, you may not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Best post, post Return of the Jedi Star Wars books  in the entire Star Wars universe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You may not, you may not rec, you know, there's actually,  there are so many Star Wars books on Audible,  well, there's so many Star Wars books in general,  but almost all of them are on Audible.  There's so many Star Wars books on Audible  that they actually have their own section.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  The Thrawn books are the best.  Are they?  Are those the ones to read?  The best books.  Definitely the three Thrawn Trilogy books  are the best you'll ever read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  THR, AWN?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  AWN.  Yeah.  All right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What a nerd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was, you know, I was so impressed with the Obama,  and then he picks the Star Wars trilogies.  Can I add, by the way,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  when did this new Star Wars movie come out,  or they're coming out, or whatever it is, this cartoon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It just came out, or it's coming,  I saw the poster there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly, it's over here next week.  It's an extended version of the anime series  they did on Cartoon Network.  They did like a few seasons of a Star Wars cartoon  on Cartoon Network, and now they've made a 3D movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That sounds so horrible in so many ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  Apparently it's okay, but not great.  It's worth a trip.  It's not exactly, you know,  it's worth a trip.  It's no Thrawn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You mean you have to take drugs?  It's no Thrawn Trilogy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's no Thrawn Trilogy, put it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anthony Daniels, C-3PO reads the Thrawn.  You want to, you gotta hear it.  Yeah, brilliant.  You actually gotta hear this.  I gotta play a little bit of it for you,  because it's C-3PO, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Your permission, Admiral,  but I doubt Card is foolish enough  to just sit around waiting for us to arrive.  Pellian observed.  An undetectable mid-range scan of the asteroid  that the grand admiral had ordered  had just come up negative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't you feel like it's C-3PO the whole time, though?  I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, brother, now I see why Will likes it.  That's sound awesome.  Come on, that's sound awesome.  That subtle British kind of a foppish sound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can get anything from subtle British foppish sounds  to some of the best literature the world has ever known.  It's all, or Barack Obama.  It's all on audible.com slash twit.  We thank them so much for their support.  Go there right now and get your free book, audible.com slash twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The first book.  But if you're not signed up,  if you already signed up, you don't get it for free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right.  Tis.  You know they have a drinking game,  when I bounce on my ball, they drink?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't see. I'm sorry, what?  If you're a twit, I don't know why you keep drinking

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  like that.  You might as well just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like John's reaction.  I'm sorry, what?  It was a little out of context, wasn't it?  Um.  What other stories?  I'm gonna throw it to you, Will Harris.  You seem to have a, be a font of knowledge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sorry, I am a font of knowledge this week,  because I do know real work.  How about this, Weblogs Inc. refusing or not paying  its bloggers?  Loads of Weblogs Inc. sites practically shuttering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We should get Calacanis on.  This was his old company, sold it to America Online.  America Online is struggling right now, I gotta say.  And I, you know, they provide the bandwidth for this show.  I certainly, hello guys at AOL.  I do hope that as you shut down parts of your empire,  you leave us up and running if you don't mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, the free podcast hosting is the last to go.  Well, they claim that they were,  although the Weblogs Inc. sites were mostly ahead of targets  in terms of traffic and revenue,  that they nonetheless were over budget.  And so basically put an embargo, like no new posts  for the next month.  Oh brother.  And so some sites like the unofficial Apple Weblog  had to resort to just not running,  like shuttering to one post a day.  That's the greatest site in the world.  That's very frustrating.  Yeah, absolutely crazy.  And they put out the guy that's in charge  of the Weblogs division at AOL,  put out sort of like an all hands memo,  like nothing to see here, everything's fine, don't worry.  You don't need to be paid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, didn't they say that all be fixed by August 1st?  And then of course it never really happened.  Right, and they never realized.  What's going on over there?  It's like teams easily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Gadget is the biggest of these, right?  Oh yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now what is this?  And Gadget Mobile, and Gadget HD,  then they have Download Squad for the software.  So that's like their tech division, right?  And so, and now Gadget's the only one  that's not affected by this?  They're profitable, they're ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They pretty much left and Gadget as it was,  but it was a lot of the other blogs,  like the unofficial Apple one,  and some of the maybe the TV ones,  and the sort of slightly more niche ones.  But of course, I mean, they said,  we're not gonna pay bloggers for another month  to post anything.  But of course the next month they still get paid  based on like the sort of popularity of the blogs.  If they don't post for a month,  obviously the blog's popularity goes down,  so they get paid less the next month.  So they're sort of in their interest to post for nothing,  which a lot of them did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Clever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So maybe that's the master plan,  is that AOL just wants to get all its blogs to post.  Free posts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, and then they say next month,  hey, you did it for free last month,  why not do it for free this month?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now Nick Denton's been doing this lately too.  I mean, I don't know if you guys been watching that,  he only talked about it in the alleyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But he still pays, he does at least pay.  Right, he still pays, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But he keeps on dropping that.  And I don't know, is this like a new trend  developing in these blog networks?  I don't know, there's other ones out there.  What's the other one I'm thinking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you would think that the banner ad sales  seem to be very strong.  This seems to be a good, despite this failing economy,  it seems to be still an upbeat part of the economy.  You would think these sites would be doing very well  right now, what are they having trouble for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, there's the banner ad things  are getting really low CPMs now.  And everybody in the advertising business is shifting over.  To podcasts.  No, to video podcasts.  That's what I meant.  Yeah, to video podcasts.  And they all wanna do pre-roll and, you know,  there's all this new stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We know you're not gonna watch the rest of us,  so let's get our ad in real quick.  Yeah, all right.  I mean, I think.  We're sold out, I wanna say something.  The Twitter audio podcasts are sold out.  We're very close to it.  In fact, we've had to add inventory.  So I think the economy is not so bad for some.  I don't know.  You're taking all the money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I think what's gonna happen is that  as the economy tightens,  advertising spend moves to more measurable media  of which, you know, internet is one of the big ones.  Although it's still experimental.  In terms of sort of like the web blogs and the gawkers,  they're still doing pretty well,  but they're still a relatively, relatively small segment  of the market, the advertising market  that's kind of insulated.  There, you know, when your TV advertising,  I think we're seeing is going massively down  and newspaper advertising is going massively down  because blogs are such a relatively small part of it.  It's hard, you know, you're not gonna notice  much of a downsizing on that.  There we go talking about business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I was just wondering if AOL is paying  for other areas that it's doing poorly in,  you know what I mean?  from the Web Blogs Inc. area and we'll just pay for other,  you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can't imagine that it's one of the most expensive  AOL divisions to run, can you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ryan Block left, of course, in Gadget  and maybe picked a perfect time to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where'd he go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, he's starting his own, he and...  Peter Rojas.  Peter Rojas, who started in Gadget,  are starting some sort of tech blog, right?  Some sort of tech thing?  I don't think it's gonna be a tech blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's kinda gonna be like a social  network-y kind of thing.  With a sort of, probably almost certainly  with a video element.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the elevator pitch.  Well, it's a social network-y thing with a video element.  You can't go wrong with that nowadays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, it worked for YouTube.  That's your capitalistic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but I think you also have to add green to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Green, there you go.  It's a green social network with video elements,  user-generated content.  What other buzzword can we throw in?  Oh, and lots of lulls.  Yeah.  Lots.  The lulls in the action.  It's lulls.com.  You know, only check.  L-U-L-Z dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe, maybe...  That needs to be the title of this show, actually.  Should be In It For The Lulls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're only in it for the lulls.  God knows we're not in it for the money.  All right, well, I am gonna wrap this up  because I think we've got all the great news stories  and I think you guys are the greatest.  Thanks for showing up on a Saturday.  It's not our usual record day,  but I'm gonna take a little time off  on the Twitter network next week.  Hey, I wanna mention something,  and I meant to mention it last week,  but our good friends at Scott Evest  are having a big, big sale.  You know we love Scott Evest.  They do our twit hat.  In fact, Scott's having a contest on our forums  to design more twit stuff.  They've got a hoodie that they're working on right now.
