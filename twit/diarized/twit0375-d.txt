Transcript:  Little Brothers Young Adult Novel.  I actually had an adult novel come out about a month ago that I wrote with Charles Strauss called Rapture of the Nerds.  But this is a young adult novel and it's about kids in the UK who live in a regime where if you are accused of infringing copyright three times they take away your internet access.

Transcript:  Seriously.  Yeah.  Given given that AT&T leaked plans to do basically that today it's coming.  And so after destroying their families lives they run away in shame to London and they form a kind of joke semi joke anarchist friggin filmmaker youth gang and devote themselves to destroying the entertainment industry using the only weapon they've ever really mastered which is piracy.  So they make their own movies and they show them in cemeteries and in old sewers they break into and turn into movie theaters.  But they also pirate in a way calculated to cost as much money as possible to the entertainment industry and you know, jularity ensues.

That they start thinking about the internet as you know the lifeline to free speech, free press, freedom of assembly, access to health and employment and all the rest of it.  And just like reject the idea that you know it's somehow proportionate that if you're accused of watching TV the wrong way we take away all of that.  Yeah.

So I don't know if you did you guys watch this morning when Felix Baumgartner jumped out of a weather balloon and set a new record for the highest freefall 24 miles high.  We tried to get Felix but he was napping.  He said he was drained.  He was drained after his adventure.  No Felix is of course long gone but doing I'm sure interviews with larger networks but we were able to talk to Scott Gillies who actually is from a technical point of view maybe as interesting.  He's the guy who brought us those amazing pictures.  Eight million people watched live on YouTube setting easily a new record for a number of concurrent views.  The previous record was set during the Olympics in London of half a million.  So so that's a big jump.

You know what's interesting to me and I don't know if you guys want to comment on this but it seems that got much more a guy jumping out of a balloon got more attention than discovery landing on Mars.  And which disheartened me a little bit but then I realized why because it's a human being and unmanned space exploration just doesn't galvanize the imagination in the same way.  And yet I'd love to see the I'd love to see Red Bull sponsor the next discovery.  Curiosity I should say.

End time: 952.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah I don't know I mean I it's true that this guy certainly got a lot of press but I think it depends on kind of which bubble you're inhabiting like it didn't really make a ripple here.  I was at Comic Con and you know it wasn't on the giant Jumbotron in the big hall.  Yeah I know I mean it you know people were watching the people dancing that hip hop rhythm game more than whereas you know I saw the curiosity landing at NASA Ames where they invited in the general public and it was you know rammed all their big lawns just filled with people and these huge Jumbotrons and scientists and their neighbors all just sitting there just just screaming their heads off when the seven minutes of hell finally concluded.  So I think it might I mean clearly the numbers on YouTube were very big.  Well I wonder to what extent this is a global phenomenon the way curiosity was.  I think what the two events had in common of course is the fact that finally some good news some exciting and what what the jump pad was we were all wondering whether he'd make it.

Start time: 955.50
End time: 991.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean let's face it this was a dangerous mission and until he landed on his feet we weren't sure that it was going to be successful and mission.  Mission is a very charitable name for it stunt.  Well it wasn't exactly evil to evil jumping over a bunch of a bunch of buses I mean this was a pretty sophisticated technological accomplishment as well as a very gutsy guy you have to give him credit a lot.  He wasn't bringing like vaccine to a you know a distant colony.  I think that's the right word for it but nonetheless you can marvel at it and as as you know was true and if you were watching the video of it I mean it was quite remarkable the quality of the video.

Yeah, they do degrade. They do last about 18 months but you know when I when I one of the ways that I was able to quit smoking was by the realization that I was spending a laptop a year on cigarettes and so now I buy myself a laptop every year and I don't smoke.  You put Linux on it. Nice. Nice. They put Linux on it. Yeah. Ubuntu. What's your what's your laptop currently? What are you still using Lenovo's? X220 yeah the ThinkPad's it's it's for the warranty because they'll do the on-site next day hardware replacement anywhere that IBM Global Services has an office so it's like it costs as much as AppleCare except a highly skilled technician will come to your hotel room and fix it the day after it breaks. Wow. Yeah it's pretty awesome. That's amazing. And they don't look at it and say oh I'm sorry you've put a  Ubuntu on this. No totally not and in fact because the hard drive comes out with one screw I'm like well you know if it's well assuming I'm back at my office I'm like I had the original drive here because I always I always throw the hard drive out and put a big SSD in I've got I've got you know I've got the original hard drive here I can stick it in and boot it up I'm not going to click through the EULA's that can be your job but you can see that it still doesn't work. Awesome. Yeah that's a that's a good idea. Never clicked a Microsoft EULA. Really? Since when? Since ever? Well.

I'm never rebooting this server and from then on it's like you know is there any way I can patch the kernel without rebooting it.  Yeah so so at a certain point you're like you know what I've never clicked a EULA on this when we got a we when my wife was pregnant and in the last couple of weeks when we were just sort of she was a little overdue we were kind of hanging around the house and I went out and got a we.  And we didn't actually unwrap it until after my daughter was born and then the EULA comes up and I'm like you know I've got someone around the house who's not legally competent to form a contract I should get her to click the link.  So I got my newborn daughter and I clicked the link.  I've got a photo of it it's pretty good it's in my Flickr stream.

Transcript:  Well it's such a part of our culture right.  I mean you know electronics tech is it's what this says is something that you know we've seen over the past couple of years is really that mainstream media has embraced technology and realizes that it is it has become such a part of everyday life.  It's become such a part of consumers buying habits of course but also just the usage habits of everyone and especially smartphones and tablets have taken that I think deeper and you know to younger ages and older ages to the point where you know they're addicted to technology and it's such a part of everything they do.  And so obviously our our industry in terms of technology journalism has has grown and adapted and you know raised the tenor of the conversation or I should say raise the maybe not the level of it but the the noise level.  And so this is I think this is just representative of that of the fact that that this stuff is just absolutely everywhere now.

You know we'll cover it obviously there's interest in it but it's not going to get the kind of coverage that any Apple event would get by an order of magnitude.  I mean I I don't think that's necessarily the right way to go but I know the interest level on the stations and it just isn't there.  Frankly it's there a little bit but not to the extent of Apple.

Transcript:  There's a reason why Microsoft has been so coy about you know they haven't even said when it's officially released.  They haven't done a big push and said this is when it's released.  They still haven't told us how much it is.  All of that is Apple envy and Apple you know emulation right.  I mean they're they're trying to create that same kind of buzz.  They're not they're not doing it particularly well but but by withholding the price you know they're still keeping us talking about it.  And so that is working for them to a degree.  And I do think there is a certain level of excitement and interest there for the Microsoft surface.  And I think there will be a lot of hype about it the week that it comes out.  Now it looks like it is coming out midnight.  The day of 25th 26th.  Yeah 25th 26th right.  So I think there will be a lot written about it.  There probably will be people in line.

Transcript:  Amazing that such a thing even needs to exist in this day and age.  Oh well.  And from CBS radio Mr.  Larry Magid.  Our show today brought to you by our friends at Citrix the makers of a great program if you have to do meetings.  Meeting is believing with Go To Meeting for a long time.  Go to Meeting.  I've talked about it as the best screen sharing app out there.  Mac or PC.  But now they've added a new feature that makes it really more like a real meeting.  Not only are you seeing their screen but you're meeting face to face with your team anywhere in the world with the new HD faces.  I have to say this.  The quality of the video on the HD faces is spectacular.  And you can of course start a meeting on a Mac or PC but you can attend a meeting on a Mac a PC an iPad an iPhone an Android tablet.  In fact if you're using an iPad you can actually use the camera the headphones.  This is the microphone on the iPad and be at a meeting anywhere in the backyard at a coffee shop at a hotel at an airport.  Just really works well fast easy easy to schedule a meeting.  Easy to join a meeting which is important because after all if you're you know you're meeting with a client you're doing a sales pitch you don't want to make it hard for them to meet with them.  You want to make it fun engaging interesting.  And I have to say if you are in sales the ability of your to see your client for your client to see you to kind of build that rapport with the video is very important.  It really makes a big difference.  I want you to try it free for 30 days.  You be the judge.  Visit GoToMeeting.com.  Click the Try It Free button on the website and use the promo code TWIT.  Easy enough.  30 days free.  If you decide you like it after a month.  Forty nine dollars a month flat fee for as many meetings as you want as long as you want.  Includes free teleconferencing for conference bridge and everything.  It's just great.  GoToMeeting.com.  Click the Try It Free button and use the offer code TWIT.  Start meeting today.  Meeting is believing with GoToMeeting.  You have something else to do with GoToMeeting.  Oh I'm glad you mentioned that.  We're giving away an iPad.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Thank you Chad Johnson producer.  Now he's earned you've earned your keys.  Thank you.  We're giving away GoToMeeting is giving away an iPad.  That's to kind of remind you you can use an iPad for GoToMeeting.  So we want you to share your story.  Tell us where in the world you would meet and with whom you would meet and why you would meet with somebody.  Do this on Twitter though so you don't make it a long story.  You know just like I would meet with Corey to talk about little brother in London and then you could use the hashtag  TWIT free iPad.  That's important so that we could see all the entries.  We'll pick it random from those entries for next week.  So we're extending it another week giving you one more week to perform.  This contest is for legal U.S.  residents only.  I'm sorry to say lawyers made us do it.  Rules and regulations are online at inside.twit.tv.  So again who you'd like to meet with where in the world.  Why use the hashtag TWIT free iPad.  That's very important.  You put that on there so we could find all the entries.  That's how we're going to collate them all.  Then we'll pick it random from an entry to award you an iPad.  We're going to autograph it put stuff on it.  This is going to be a nice iPad.  Winner of the contest will be announced on or about.  That lawyer must have written that on or about October 21st 2012.  That means it could be anytime on or about.  I think it'll be on this show on October 21st 2012 is what I think.  TWIT free iPad is the hashtag but I've been wrong before.  You know if you see Mike says I don't want my iPad autographed.  If you don't want an autograph no problem.  Just tell us and we won't.  Or we could write to eBay buyer.  If you prefer and just sign it that way.  Gazelle owner.  Windows 8 kicks off with its first official television commercial.

And there's cinnamon buns.  And then the rocket is launched.  The girl draws on the tablet which is on an easel and somehow she gets a credit picture.  And now what made that possible.  Windows 8.  That is an iPad ad.  In fact I bet you if you show that to 20 consumers without warning them ahead of time  and you took that Windows 8 out at the end they'd say oh yeah that's the iPad ad.  Right.

That is absolutely unique.  That's unique.  But their go to market strategy as we call it in business.  Right.  I mean their stores look just like the Apple stores.  Their commercials look just they don't have a whole lot of originality and I don't think they really try to.  You know the whole reason they're getting into devices is because Apple is now making you know the iPhone is worth more than all of Microsoft generates more revenue than all of Microsoft.  The iPad now generates more revenue than the whole Windows division at Microsoft.  So you know they're following they're not leading and they'll probably do OK at it.  I don't think they'll do as well as they did in the past when they've done this.  But you know they'll they'll remain big enough to be sort of top five tech company.

Interestingly Paul Therotte pointed this out to me for the last couple of months if you went to Microsoft dot com and you looked at the title of the window it would say Microsoft homepage devices and services.  This is this is the new mantra at Microsoft Steve Ballmer in a letter to shareholders which is shared with everybody else including the press and the and.  Let's see stores and retailers and OEMs.  Yeah said basically.  We've we're changing the business last year in this letter he wrote I said that over time the full value of our software will be seen and felt in how we're doing.  We've seen and felt in how people use devices and services at work and in their personal lives.  This is a significant shift both in what we at Microsoft do and how we see ourselves as a devices and services company.  It impacts how we run the company develop new experiences how we take products to market.  What is what is Microsoft saying Jason when they say we're a devices and services company.

So that way anything that gets to the spam filter you can just ship ship select like a whole block because it'll all have the same subject nuke that and what's left you know you go through really quickly my mailing list rule is to if there's a mailing list that I need to be on is I.  Drop that into another folder unless my name is mentioned in the body of the email and then it goes into a piece of software Corey you need to write that just just call it Corey's inbox or something right.

It doesn't matter.  It's you know being you know it's it's so far into the background that they realized what are we what are we left with.  You know Microsoft Office trying to peddle that on as many different devices as we can.  Not a great business model.  So that's what devices and services is about.  It's realized like OK the world's changed.  You know we're not going to call ourselves a software company anymore.  We're going to call ourselves a devices and services company.

Everything is made out of the same primitives both in hardware and software.  Right.  And that's not a bad thing.  No although you know it's the problem is and I've given a couple of talks about this that we don't really have a model for a computer that can run all the programs except for the one that might get you into trouble or pisses someone off or break someone's business model.  And yet the more computers we have the more problems there are that arise that have a computer somewhere in them.  And the more people there are saying can't you just build me a phone that runs all the programs except for the one that interferes with my SMS revenue stream or can't you just build me a 3D printer that can print a solid state math lab or an AR 15 or can't you just put me a self driving car run you know make me a self driving car that can run all the programs except for the drag racing program.  And the closest approximation we have is not the appliance that only runs one program actually appliances run all the programs and have spyware on them that kind of swims up out of their depths and says I can't let you do that Dave when you try to run the program that the manufacturer didn't expect you to run.

Transcript:  Well look at you Effie on arm right.  I mean there's there's there's platforms where now if you're not signed you can't run.  And so you're you're essentially having to delegate all of your trust to the vendor with no ability to override the vendors decisions.  That's that's pretty intense.  I mean I kind of feel like our destiny you know as members of the Walkman generation the iPod generation is we're all going to end up with hearing aids and I really feel like it's important when I put a computer in my body that can like.  Omit certain things that I hear or transmit things that I hear to other people that that computer be designed such that I can see what it's doing.  It's not designed to hide any secrets from me the way that you'd have to if you wanted to lock it to a single platform and that you know I can choose who I delegate my trust to.  I know pretending that I'm going to audit all that code but if someone comes out and says hey it looks like there's something bad or wrongly implemented or vulnerable or or deliberately messed up about this I want to be able to change vendors.

Transcript:  Yeah sure I mean you know I think that we've seen in the last couple of years a growing market for lawful interception devices where you know the the the Kaliya standard that says that in the US all switches have to have backdoors for law enforcement.  Has meant that all over the world anyone wants to sell a switch in the US makes it so that it's got a backdoor for law enforcement that backdoor is frequently compromised by other entities sometimes state actors and sometimes crooks and then and then you know the.  That gets good to law enforcement the wiretappers ball and in DC every year features more and more ways that state actors and police agencies can interfere with your devices to wiretap you and it kind of culminated last year when Jacob Applebaum went to the wiretappers ball.  And outed vendor that was selling a network appliance you put in the data center for your national carrier and then you gave it the the email address of someone in your country who's using iTunes and it waited for them to try and phone home to Apple to get an iTunes update and then it's shipped them a malware button.  But remotely operate the camera the microphone any kind of location sensors read the read this you know the hard drive the screen the keyboard and so on so you know when you've got when you've got state actors actually creating markets for zero days instead of creating markets and instead of creating incentives for people who find vulnerable vulnerabilities to disclose them so they can be patched now there's a market to sell those vulnerabilities to governments and also to introduce those vulnerabilities so you've got something to sell because obviously.  Those things are worth a lot of money companies like VU pen in France are are making big coin you know selling to spooks.

Yeah and I give that that speech at DEF CON and at Google and at long now this summer it was the follow up to a talk I gave at chaos computer Congress called our communications Congress called the coming war over general purpose computing and two of them kind of go together as a kind of both a warning and a manifesto about how our devices should be designed.

Start time: 2845.40

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah basically that since we don't know how to design devices that can only run the programs that don't upset people and because lawmakers increasingly are seeing computers as the place where they can insert control we've got this ongoing motif in our in our fights where people are saying I'm York you need to accept that your computer won't run the software you choose that we're going to be able to keep secrets from you so that we can lock your platform so that it will only run the programs that you want to run.  Yeah and I think that's a really good point because you know the fact that you can't just run the software and you can't just run the programs that are approved and that when you do that you create these vulnerabilities in the computers that let bad guys do really bad things to them whether those bad guys are you know the Iranian government if you live in Iran or you know the rent to own companies you know like the rent on companies that just settled with the FTC because they had low jacked the laptops they're renting people.  You're kidding.  Yes seven seven rents own companies and a software company in Pennsylvania just settled with the FTC because they low jacked the rental laptops and they were secretly recording the renters of these laptops having sex and they were recording their children and they were intercepting their medical records their their communications with their lawyers and their banking records and the FTC said to them as you'd imagine and they said you must stop doing this you're not allowed to do this anymore unless you put it in the fine print.  I didn't inform people that you were planning on doing it then it's okay to the fine print from now on and then it'll be okay.

Transcript:  This is where.  Go ahead. Sorry go ahead Leah. I was just saying this is actually I really do feel like over the next decade, probably decades.  One of the primary tensions in the digital world right is what we it the one on the one hand we need as Corey was mentioning earlier this sort of greater regulation around the Internet.  We need to realize that the Internet is in many ways a lifeline and will continue to be and will be even in a greater to a greater extent for you know economic well-being for you know health care for for lots of different things.  And so we need a certain level of regulation and government involvement to to make sure the playing field remains level make sure that costs stay down and all that.  But on the on the other hand you know too much government involvement in the Internet you know leads to trouble as well to where you know a single point of failure as well as you know government takeover and all of that to the point that you know you need sort of the commercial free enterprise system to provide redundancy and choices and these are the things that we need to do.  These types of things in order to keep it more free and more able to not be you know taken over by a government or governments and shut down right.  So that's one of the key tensions that we've got to to figure out.

Start time: 3016.50
End time: 3087.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The problem is that we it's not so much that we whether government gets involved.  It's a government has a way of getting involved in ways that are just not smart.  I mean going back in this country the Communications Decency Act the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act the Delete Online Predators Act there's act after act after act that are purportedly to protect people.  They all have very high minded goals they all get overwhelming support at least initially from Congress.  And then when you look at them carefully when you actually sort of dissect them you find that they have huge flaws in them and it strikes me we have two parties when it comes to technology we have the the clued in party and we have the much larger clueless party and the Republicans and Democrats in both of them.  And you know as somebody who spends a lot of time in Washington mostly on the Internet safety side I see an enormous amount of lack of understanding not only about how the Internet works but how it should work and how does government inter interrelate with companies and with the larger community that's using this technology and total cluelessness when it comes to the fact that this is an international media you cannot control it from any given country whether you're ran or for that matter the United States.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah and I think some of that some of that cluelessness is going to age out right. I mean over the next decade some of these people some of I believe and maybe I'm being overly optimistic right. But some of that is going to age out the people who understand because they've been users of this for from the earliest points they can remember right.  Will will will be clued in to a degree not not you know to the full degree maybe as you know all of us because we live and breathe it every day. But you know I do think some of that's going to age out some of it's going to and not all of it's an age thing more of it's an experience thing right.  So but the thing is is we have this this issue that that I think is also at the fundamental part of this which is the economics of the digital age and that's a lot of this sort of free enterprise versus government control of the Web.

I'm talking about this thing I'm reading my own piece here the this thing that took the place of the UDI ID it's another kind of Apple ad tracking so called non permanent non personal device identifier.  I'm quoting now that advertising networks we use to give you more control over advertise these ability to use tracking methods in other words by default Iowa 6 is trackable the apps you use the websites you go to it is by default trackable you can turn it off if you have an engineering degree from MIT.

There you go you got advertising that's limit ad tracking there it is yeah now is that a do not track cookie what is that well say limit ad not a do not limit yeah what does that only track us a little bit and is it only with Apple's own I ads or is it with other services it's not very it's.

Transcript:  Oh my my my my we're brought to you today I'm going to do an ad.  It's not a Microsoft ad I'll do an ad we're brought to you today by carbonite.com backup done right what if I were going to design backup.  The the ideal backup scenario what I would do is I'd make it automatic so you don't have to remember because I'm not going to remember and even if you know all what Sunday it's time to bet no no that's not going to work.  It should be continuous because you you you create new content all the time you write a paragraph in your in your you know your great American novel or in Corey's case the great British novel and it you your hard drive crashes you lost that paragraph unless it's continually backing up.  That's the idea.  It also doesn't just back up locally it backs it up to the cloud.  So if there's a real disaster fire or flood or somebody steals your stuff or you leave your laptop on the on the conveyor belt at the airport and it's gone poof.  You got it backed up you got it backed up on carbonite the better backup plan secure automatic online backup $59 a year for everything on a computer that's less than five bucks a month now they do have plans for business flat rates for multiple computers.  External drives and so forth but the the basic plan great for a laptop or an individual $59 a year I want you to try it free for two weeks it does use your internet access it doesn't slow you down or the internet but you should try it to make sure you're comfortable with it.  Just go to carbonite.com user offer code tweet now do use that on the trial even though you don't need to or need a credit card or anything because if you do decide to buy two weeks down the line you'll get 14 months for the price of 12 or two months free from carbonite.  Carbonite online backup it's also cloud storage you can access your data anytime from any computer using your carbonite account or their free smartphone or tablet apps really is a nice way to kind of give yourself a piece of mind carbonite.com.  Oh and in terms of privacy it's using a hundred twenty eight bit SSL of course so that you don't have to worry about using it in an open access spot or anywhere you're online but you also can use trust no one local encryption only you have the key if you choose as well.  Carbonite.com user offer code tweet thank you Larry this was useful I have now turned that off although I don't know what I turned off or whether it makes any difference and frankly there probably is a similar setting in Android or maybe not I don't even know.

Transcript:  Yeah I know that would that would suck and I travel a lot so I archived my papers with a library in Toronto called the Merrill collection which is the largest public science fiction reference collection in the world and one day the head librarian said to me you know it's such a pity because in the old days when we archived manuscripts we get like a first draft a second draft a third draft and they'd be distinct and we could study them and see the differences now it's just like a continuous document that's edited until it's until it's submitted and done if only there was a way to keep track of changes to text.  Oh no you're not using git.  Yeah.  So my friend Thomas Gideon my friend Thomas Gideon from the command line podcast wrote me a set of git scripts that are on GitHub. It's called flash bake and every 15 minutes or however long you however often you run the cron it grabs all my working files it grabs the difference and then it commits them along with it figures out where I am from the IP address gets the weather the last three headlines I put on Boi Moi and the last three songs I've played in my player.  So it's kind of I have a like on a paragraph by paragraph basis all of this and then I can mirror that up to another git server.  So I've got it I've got it locally and I've got it mirrored up every couple of 10 minutes so it's it's super secure and kind of right up to the minute.

From the camera because a good camera can now estimate pulse if it can see your neck and so on.  So you could get a whole lot of biometrics and you could kind of go like you know sort of endocrinologically.  How does that what how does how does my endocrine system relate to my pros output and the twinkie to fix right.  I twinkie that's right. That's why my pros.  But then the key to it is I think it's kind of like a very interesting thing.  But then the key is to you know you've got all this data what do you do with it and I guess that's where we're kind of getting better at big data and analyzing it.

I had a weird thing last summer that I think is kind of a harbinger of a bunch of stuff that's going to happen which is an old friend of mine who is a coder who had known since we were both coders when we were young teenagers died unexpectedly in his sleep with his computer on in his room.  And his parents didn't know what to do and you know he didn't live with his parents but his roommates didn't know what to do his parents didn't know what to do.  And I said look let me just back this up and put it somewhere for you until you figure out what to do with it.  So I went and grabbed a terabyte of data off of his hard drives which I've stuck in S3 and prepaid 10 years for and in a big password protected zip archive that they have the password to and I figure in 10 years they'll figure out what to do with it.  This is his whole life right and it's stuff that's compromising that you never see the light of day and it's stuff that should never ever be thrown away that's you know precious and irreplaceable has you know some of his correspondence his photos.  His writing his code and I think we as a society have totally not figured this out.  And no kidding.  We're about to run up against this.  I think there's a huge business there.

Ford died in test date and his common law wife wasn't legally entitled to run his estate and his estranged parents who are very religious and didn't approve of his work were and they wanted to suppress his work.  And a lot of his writer friends particularly Neil Gaiman rallied around and sort of through argument and money and lots of other things at them until they agreed to let his work go on to be in print.  And after that Neil Gaiman went on a tear and made all of his writer friends create living wills or wills where they had literary estate so I've nominated a literary executors John Scalzi and then I've taken my my hard drive password and I split that into two and half of it's with a lawyer in the UK and half with a lawyer in the US and there's instructions for what to do.  When you get them back to decrypt my hard drive which has all my other passwords on it and so I've actually gotten that far but I haven't gotten as far as figuring out how to tell people what I want done with the data apart from my writing you know and I've got logo programs I wrote on an Apple II plus in 1979 on my hard drive and everything since.

Now external drives and so you know that stuff other people can get at right if something happened so that's the extent to the way that what I've done so far but this is definitely a topic that I've thought a lot about because there's some stuff that it's kind of like.  It's kind of like it I'm a big history buff and if you look at the past you know you look at even like founding fathers in the US you have the two models you have the Thomas Jefferson George Washington model and you have the John Adams model John Adams saved every fricking thing that he had right.  Right organized it codified it when he died you had everything so now we go back and we see his shopping lists we see you know all of his letters to his wife they saved everything whereas you look at Jefferson in Washington they torched about half their stuff right and the other stuff that is kept as the stuff they wanted history to be able to look at.  Probably the most interesting stuff is the stuff they got rid of right and so you know we don't really know them to a certain degree so but it's all it's like that for all of us individually to lesser degrees for our families right what's the stuff we want to keep that we want them to see and what's the stuff that we don't and you know even deciding between that stuff is there's some hypocrisy in that as well but yeah it's just a really interesting question.

I mean what about what are the privacy rights people who get her dead.  Well you can't libel a dead person which I find pretty interesting I think people dead people do have privacy rights but I think that most of us who've died and haven't thought about it probably would like that some of that stuff would be preserved right I mean in the absence of any explicit wishes I don't know what courts do.

There were rumors that this was happening remember Deutsche Telekom tried to sell T-Mobile to AT&T that was turned back by regulators and it made everybody wonder well what happens to sprint.  Of course the great fear was if T-Mobile gets sold and and or merged with AT&T and then sprint goes away we'll have two carriers is bad enough with four carriers.  Well we'll have the details on that and your thoughts too I know that's a very US centric story but something we're interested in in just a second.  But first let's talk about you know I'm just thinking maybe you could make a Squarespace site.  Pre-pay you know like a hundred years and then you would have your the site that where you know your your your memorial how long do you want to last Squarespace should start us to start some sort of infinite deal like like forever.

Transcript:  We'll talk about that too I want to I do want to it's a great book I want to talk more about that but first let's do the Squarespace.com the secret behind exceptional websites the new Squarespace is here their version six of their software completely rewritten from the ground up 50 new features.  One of the key features is Squarespace this was something that Squarespace really knew they had to do used to be in days gone by last year when you made a site you'd make it the desktop site and the mobile site but now more than half of your visitors to almost any site are mobile.  Does it make even it make sense to have a separate mobile site anymore Squarespace says no Squarespace and most modern web designers say one size fits all what we're going to do is make a site using something called responsive design.  That will be appropriate no matter what size screen whether you're using an iPhone or a Galaxy Note 2 or something even bigger like a 27 inch iMac.  So go to Squarespace.com I'm not gonna tell you I don't and I'll do this I should be more clear about this this is two things hosting the best hosting ever it never goes down.  And software combined and the advantage of doing that is the software is always up to date you don't have to worry about patches security flaws they always keep it up to date.  They really do have the best hosting and I think it has something to do with the tight coupling between the content management system and the server software.  We have tried and have failed time and time again to bring Squarespace site down you just can't do it beautiful templates you're choosing from designer templates.  You can customize as to your heart's content and again you don't have to worry about the responsive design because for instance when you put an image in there creates seven different sizes so that it always looks great on any screen.  Even when you change the column widths and so forth all of that is automatically handled in the new templates for Squarespace six so that everything looks great on all the different sizes.  You get of course the ability to use HTML 5 CSS 3 JavaScript and JSON because it's state of the art but you don't have to even know what those terms mean to use a Squarespace site.  They've got by the way a great syntax colored editor that pops out if you're a big CSS or a JavaScript user.  You can import from the existing almost all the existing API's so that your data goes right in including all of the links all the images all the comments even export to you're never trapped in a Squarespace site.  And the ability to include things like Google Maps and Flickr and Twitter and Facebook and all that stuff with just little widgets means that your site will be a rich vibrant place to visit.  I think Squarespace is a great site great place to host your site whether it's a one off for a wedding or an anniversary or a birthday or your e-commerce site.  I want you to visit squarespace.com and as with all of our sponsors we really encourage this and I think it's a testimony to how confident they are in their product.  They offer you a free two week trial you don't need to use a credit card or anything you just go to squarespace.com click the get started button.  You can try it for two weeks if you decide you like it or you want to keep that site that's where we come in.  They've got two plans now they've really simplified this the basic plan and the unlimited plan.  Standard plan starts at eight dollars a month when purchased annually you can also get it ten dollars month to month.  But the unlimited plan is the one you should look at sixteen dollars a month sixteen bucks a month for hosting and software with unlimited pages galleries blogs unlimited bandwidth.  They're not metering the bandwidth at all unlimited storage unlimited contributors and when you buy an annual plan you'll they'll register the domain for you for free and they'll hook it up to your Squarespace site for free.  All of that for sixteen bucks a month and now here's the good stuff when you put in the offer code twit ten you could take ten percent off that.  So if you get the annual plan you get the biggest savings.  Squarespace.com use the offer code twit ten you only need that when you buy it's free to try.  You'll save ten percent twit ten and if you're listening to this in November December it's the number it's twit and then the number of the month so twit eleven will work next month twit twelve the month after like that.  Then we start all over again Squarespace the secret behind truly exceptional websites.

Transcript:  Well it's a little tricky moving to six because you can't just take your template and move it over your content will move over but you really want to start with a new template so you get the responsive design.

Transcript:  Yeah that's what I need to start with the new template and do that and tweak it a little bit but it's a great service.  Every time I've had a problem or you know wanted to tweak something they've been the responsiveness has been terrific and so yeah I have no problem recommending them.  And the fact that you can bring any of your data in and you can get it out at any time is very customer centric like that a lot too.

Has agreed to buy 70% of Sprint in the United States that's a 20 billion dollar purchase the deal is expected to be announced tomorrow morning.  The boards of both companies have agreed a principle of course there'll be some regulatory hurdles that they have to jump.  The current price per share of Sprint is $5.73 the tender is $7.30 so that's a good premium for Sprint shareholders.  So given the structure it says it will not require a shareholder vote.

Transcript:  It's not a fire sale I mean that's sort of a good money.  It's not a fire sale which is kind of surprising you know Sprint really they really failed they really tripped over Wimax.  They could have done something so cool and they set out to do something so cool and they kind of ran out of money and they also sort of ran out of.  They ran out of regulatory leverage into a certain degree because they were they were trying to get Wimax out and the thing that they were doing with Wimax was.  Wimax was trying to unlock the sort of stranglehold that the carriers have over mobile broadband in many ways.  But they at the same time they were doing that they had to buy bandwidth you know all these towers you still have to buy backhaul to the towers right.  And they had to buy this stuff from a lot of their competitors the ones who had the most to lose from what the way Sprint was going to roll out Wimax.  So ultimately it failed they ran out of money they ran out of time and they had to sell.  I don't know that SoftBank you know Sprint now has essentially an ancient network they have the CDMA network.  You know that they don't really have a they do have a decent data network but it's aging it's kind of like what do they really buy.  Well the main thing that Sprint has is a massive amount of other airwaves right of the spectrum in the U.S.  And so that's what I think SoftBank is interesting.  The spectrum and not the assets of Sprint itself which are you know of dubious value the Wimax has pretty much failed.  It's sort of a declining asset Sprint CDMA network also declining asset.  But all of the spectrum that they own in the U.S. is more than most of the other carriers.  I believe it's even more than Verizon if you go and you look at all of their spectrum assets.  So it is still a viable asset but you're talking about a longer term build out if they're going to you know essentially you know shelve all the stuff that Sprint has already done and replace it with some kind of GSM LTE network based on SoftBank.  Which is certainly a possibility.

Transcript:  Sprint is already replacing its Wimax 4G network.  So Sprint was the first national carrier in the U.S. to have so-called 4G with Wimax.  I actually am a Sprint customer and I largely have it because of the unlimited data.  I really like not having to look at a meter every time I download data.  But the problem is living in the Bay Area where we don't have LTE that data that I do get unlimited amounts of comes very slowly.  So I'm still on 3G.  But they are rolling out LTE nationally.  They're taking their time.  I think they're in about 20 markets right now.

Start time: 4950.00
End time: 4968.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're in almost 100 new markets this week including and the reason I know that is because Petaluma where we are is one of them.  Well, you know the press release was interesting.  It didn't specify a date and they said but you may notice LTE soon and you can use it.  But the official launch is in the future.  So I don't have a Sprint LTE Sprint phone.

Transcript:  Well, I have to turn mine back on.  Although I'm going to Argentina tomorrow where Sprint doesn't work.  I have to carry a GSM phone when I'm down there.  But up here I have to turn it on because sometimes it will work and sometimes it will not.  They're moving over to LTE.  So they're going to have the same type of network as AT&T and Verizon.  And this is also interesting in light of the fact that T-Mobile is trying to acquire MetroPCS.  So does that mean we're now going to have what four viable mobile phone companies?  That would be a good thing.

The problem is a lot of these carriers, including AT&T, label HSPA Plus and other phony things  as 4G.  ClearWire, which is the WiMAX that Sprint was using, was terrible.  By the way, according to the CNBC report, Sprint's got 48% of ClearWire and needs to  complete the purchase of ClearWire before this can go through.  So it's expected that Sprint will soon announce the full acquisition of ClearWire.  I don't know why they want it.  It's all spectrum.  It's spectrum.  It's not the technologies, it's the frequencies.

Some of them.  Samsung did unveil a mini Galaxy S3 now.  Speaking of bigger and smaller, there's a four inch Galaxy S3.  So now they have a 4, 4.3, 4.8 and 5.5.  This is basically a Galaxy S3 with a giant screen in the Galaxy Note.  Yeah, yeah.  Any size.  But I think that that's their strategy, right?  Is that it's basically the same phone across the board.  But, and Jelly Bean, which I have to say is a lot better Android operating system than  in fact, at this point, it's every bit as good as anything, anybody, including  Apple's ever produced and every bit as fast.  It's very, very fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, Hadoop hasn't been overturned, but the new government is talking about doing something  with it.  But it's it's they've sent out like a Haptilian notice as threatening disconnection.  The only person that's been overturned is the Hadoop.  Wan.  Hadoop has no wire.  He's the only one interested in what was holding on to his original telephone or he's commerce.  Now, how do you take against the recent development?  I'm not sure if Hadoop can do it.  I I have heard that a good enough Internet connection is lost right now.  It's just segunda he's not going to take it here.  After a couple of them, they take away your YouTube and your Facebook until you go to  copyright reeducation school.  And then if you get six of them, they just disconnect you.  And of course, AT&T is successfully lobbied in lots of places to prevent any kind of  municipal Wi-Fi or anything that might compete with them.  And, you know, it looks like Sprint's 4G is not going anywhere.  So, you know, it's like Lily Tomlin, you know, what are you going to do without us?  We're the phone company.  You're going to use two tin cans and a string for your broadband.  So, yeah, it's pretty bad.  I mean, it's pretty depraved.

It's so screwed up, you know, but and so I tweeted about it and that boy, I tell you,  they pay for some reason you could talk about it like crazy on the radio, on the TV, but  you tweet about it.  They get they so I've been getting calls from the Comcast executive.  The worst is this morning, 8 a.m. Sunday morning, 8 a.m.  They wake me up.  And I'm thinking this is not what I call customer service.  This is not what I'm looking for.  Go away.  Yeah.  These guys are out of control.  They're monopolists.  They don't none of them understand customer service because they never had to.

Start time: 5896.96
End time: 5933.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The thing about AT&T is really what they're saying, because in that briefing to their  own customers, it says, what if someone says they didn't download anything?  What should I tell them?  And the answer is you're responsible for anything anyone does.  So what they're really saying is, although that's not a principle in law or anything,  right, that the copy, there's no contributory liability for leaving your Wi-Fi over.  You're not leaving your Wi-Fi open.  But what they're saying is, if you live in the same house as someone who's got a router  that is implicated in an unsubstantiated accusation of copyright infringement without the chance  to examine the evidence against you or rebut it or face your accuser, you lose your internet access.

Start time: 5934.50

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which means that you could have a child or a roommate who does something and you could  lose your job.  You could lose your ability to go to school because having internet access is not just  for playing games.  It's how I earn my livelihood.  If they took away my internet access, they would be taking away my livelihood.  And it's one thing to do it, you know, if I did something illegal, but it could be a  roommate doing it.

Start time: 5991.76
End time: 6008.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  AT&T said they would embrace a regime of six strikes and you're disconnected this year.  If this isn't the training document, then there's some other training document that  it must be substantively similar about disconnection because they've agreed that  they will disconnect along with all the other major carriers.

Start time: 6011.13
End time: 6019.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now, that's the issue is disconnect.  And my sense of the original proposal was it didn't involve disconnection, it involved  re-education.

End time: 6032.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it was graduated, they call it graduated response where it starts with, you know, a  stiff letter and then you have to go to re-education school and then, I don't know,  they come over and they punch your grandmother and then, you know, and then once you get  to SAC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, but AT&T is not.  AT&T makes all of their money by selling you, you know, more broadband than you need and  overcharging you for as much as they can.  And they're in the business of keeping customers.  And so, I don't know, like I said, I just I don't think this would hold up in court.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just don't know what court case anyone would bring.  I mean, it's just it's a contract thing, right?  This is what your contract says.  It's your terms of use.  The problem is that if everybody else is doing it, AT&T is, I think, is going to look at that  and if we're the only ones who defect from this, lawmakers are going to come and clobber us.

They're running a Get Out the Vote campaign that involves contacting your lawmaker  and talking to them about how you feel or contacting the candidates  and telling them how you feel about these issues.  And I think, you know, in the wake of SOPA, there's some residual terror there in the halls of power  that there is some kind of sleeping giant that's at least rolled over in its sleep  if not actually waking up last year and that more might happen.  I mean, it was pretty seismic last year.  You know, I was in D.C. a week before the SOPA hearing started.  Every hill rat, every congressional aide I talked to was like, just give it up.  They've got the signatures. It's done. You lost. Forget about it.

And especially if they're up for election, you might ask them that question.  I mean, I think that's the six strikes.  All House members are up for reelection. They serve for three years.  All the House members and many senators.  Yeah.  This is an opportunity to do that right now.  Let's take advantage of it.

But they would gang up six games or eight games and say, name your price, give some of it to charity.  We'll give you all these games.  And the first one did over a million dollars.  The most recent one did $4.7 million in the first week.  It's a little two-week promotion.  So we're doing this with a bunch of books.  We got Neil Gaiman, John Scalzi, Palo Bacigalupi, Mercedes Lackey, Kelly Link.  My new novel, Lauren Buks.  And you name your price.  You get to decide how much.  The charities are EFF Child's Play, which gives games and toys to children's hospitals.  And the science fiction writers America Emergency Medical Fund,  which basically bails out writers who are going to lose everything because they got sick because they're freelancers.  And it's a good cause.  You get books. There's no DRM.  It's going good.  You get e-books.  Yeah. So we don't need six strikes.  We don't need three strikes.  We don't need surveillance.  We don't need DRM.

I mean, you even threw it out there.  If I remember right, correct me if I'm wrong, but you threw it out there for free  and even said if there are other formats, you guys submit your formats  and we'll add them to the list of download.  And it obviously didn't work as...  It didn't hurt your revenue.  It actually helped spread the word about your product further and wider  and get it in the hands of more people, created more fans  and then created more of a viable product and a viable brand for you.  It's not like I can stop you from copying if you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that provides free reading material to blind and physically disabled people  who have trouble with regular books.  And the biggest problem that they have is digital rights management  because once you have a DRM-free book, you can make it big screen,  you can make an audio version, you can actually make it useful  to a person who has a physical disability.  But with DRM, it's actually making their work harder.  So ironically, even though they have a license to get free books,  they're pushing for a DRM-free version going forward  in the hopes that it will no longer be necessary  to have to carve out exceptions to the copyright law  for people with disabilities.

Transcript:  I dream of a day where a sling box won't be needed.  Right.  Someday the children can play in green fields and there will be no need for a sling box.  And Big Bird will be roaming free.  That's right. But until that day, we still need a sling box.  You know what? Let me do a last commercial here and we can wrap it up pretty quick.  There's a few more stories.  But I want to ask you about your singularity novel too, Corey.  I don't want to forget that.  But first, a quick word from a nice Canadian company just like you.  It's from up Ontario way, up your way.  It's called FreshBooks.  This is one of the first Web 2.0 services I ever used.  Amber MacArthur introduced me to this in 2004 because I was moaning and groaning about the fact that I had invoice clients.  I hated the end of the month.  I never wanted to do invoices, but you know what?  I found out an interesting lesson.  You don't invoice, you don't get paid.  In fact, I think the day that she told me about FreshBooks was the day I said I forgot to invoice Rogers,  and they said, well, that's six months ago.  You want us to pay you now?  So I realized, you know, I really should probably get these out in a more pronto fashion.  FreshBooks was the solution.  It's awesome. Cloud accounting.  Five million people use FreshBooks to make billing completely painless.  It's so much easier to get paid with FreshBooks.com.  They have a new iPhone app that will track expenses, turn hours into invoices.  On the go, you can actually do almost anything you can do on FreshBooks on the new iPhone app.  Create invoices easily.  Email the clients.  they can pay you on the spot with a credit card, PayPal, one of the online authorization systems.  Time sheets automatically become invoices,  and your accountant will love you around tax time because you get all the important stuff to them  in a form and fashion they can use.  Even automated late payment reminders for those few clients who just don't pay right away.  And of course, as with all Canadian companies,  you can call or email FreshBooks and get a live person and they will respond instantly.  I don't know what it is about Canada, but customer service spot on.  I think it's because...  Oh yeah, eh?  They're nice. They're nice people.  And they just want to help you.  If you want to send physical invoices, they can do that too.  They'll print them for an additional fee.  Print them, stamp them, and mail them.  FreshBooks.com. You sign up right now.  You get 30 days of unlimited use, all the features, clients, staff, everything.  No limits at FreshBooks.com.  Free for 30 days.  Just make sure you say, I heard it on Twitter when they ask you during sign up.  Sign up today.  30 days of unlimited use.  FreshBooks.com.  It's a really, I can vouch for it, a great service.  Started using it eight years ago.

Start time: 6962.54

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we'd written a couple of novellas over the years that have been very widely read and reprinted  called Jury Service and Appeals Court.  And our publisher asked us to write a third one that was as long as the first two put together  and then some called Parole Board.  And they were published with a complete rewrite as one volume called Rapture of the Nerds.  And it's basically a kind of madcap rush through a world where the singularity has already happened.  And the only people left behind on the planet are people who didn't want to upload their minds  for one reason or another.  Either they have deeply held religious beliefs or they're technophobes or deep greens  or they're skeptical about this whole thing about having the top of their head sliced off  and their brain destructively scanned and uploaded to the cloud.  So periodically the cloud of post-humanity sends sort of get-evolved quick schemes to Earth  via the RF spectrum and various people who should know better download them  and try to instantiate them on Earth.  And when they do and they get caught, there's a tech jury that meets in Libya  to evaluate their technology.  And so Hugh is a kind of deep green Welsh potter who hates the singularity.  His parents have both ascended and he resents them.  And he's called to a tech jury in Libya where he's infected with alien technology.  And sort of the rest unfolds from there through the next two volumes.  And there's surprise appearances by various famous philosophers and so on and so forth.  There's a great scene where he's sitting in his pottery and working on a pot  and there's a thump at the door and he says,  he says, who is it? And this booming voice says, it's the singularity.  And he says, what do you want? He says, everything is different now.  And he says, I don't want any.  I love it.  That sounds great.

So I think because you're in Britain, you're probably more aware of this Gary McKinnon story  than we are here in the States.  Gary McKinnon, a British computer hacker, on Tuesday will learn his fate.  He's been fighting for 10 years against US extradition for hacking the Pentagon.  On Tuesday, the Home Secretary will announce her decision to Parliament  on whether McKinnon will be extradited.  Why is there controversy on this?

Start time: 7107.08

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, he's this autistic spectrum guy who has trouble functioning in outside society.  He basically probed an American military server, reported a security vulnerability,  didn't do anything bad, is basically being extradited as a kind of terrorist.  And there's, you know, I think legitimate fear that he's going to end up in kind of Bradley Manningville  in a kind of, you know, solitary confinement, naked and freaked out kind of indefinitely.  And so, yeah, Brits are pretty worried about it.  It seems pretty clear that what he did was not the kind of thing that actually was done with any sort of malice  and presented any kind of risk.  It was just against the rules.  And I think it's pretty, I would bet that he's going to end up being extradited.  I don't think the Tories are likely to keep him in Britain.  That's kind of sad.  They're going to send him off.

Transcript:  What is the view in the UK of the US, our kind of attitude towards homeland security?  It sounds like the Brits are somewhat afraid of it.  Well, it's not unitary, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it's spread across the side.  We are the country with more TPCs per red blood cell.  So it's, on the one hand, I think there's the sense, oh, you know, the Americans are mad.  And on the other hand, you know, when we kind of lead America in things like network surveillance and CCTVs,  and we actually rescinded habeas corpus, right?  It's in the Magna Carta.  Hey, so do we.  You know, but they can actually like hold you, I think it was for 14 days.  Eventually, they kind of, I think they backed off on it, but they could hold you for 14 days without trial.  You know, we don't have a First Amendment.  So there's lots of people who get busted for very weird things like making jokes on Twitter about, you know,  Yes, we talked about that last week.  blowing up airplanes and stuff.  So, you know, I think that Britons who are moderately self-aware understand that they are living in a very glassy house  and that they have no business telling Americans that they've gone security mad when Britain's gone just as security mad.  And I think that there's a sizable portion of Britons who seem to vote for this stuff  and who, for whom, you know, a security puppet show is just as good as security.  And, you know, bulk surveillance just keeps the bastards from misbehaving.  And, you know, it's rather a pity, I think, to use a British phrase.

Transcript:  I think when it comes to a head is when, you remember the people who tweeted that they were coming to New York to  Dig up Marilyn Monroe.  They're going to dig up Marilyn Monroe's grave.  It was clearly just hyperbole.  I mean, it was tasteless, but it was like no more.  Yeah, it was, you know, I mean, they say sillier things in American pie movies, right?  And yet they were turned back.  And I think at that point, you know, notwithstanding the Nottingham Airport incident,  a lot of people were like, seriously, really?  Like, you can't tell the difference between an actual terrorist and someone who says  I'm coming to get so loaded in LA that I'm going to end up digging up Marilyn's grave.  Like, because if you can't tell the difference between those things, I think you're doomed.  Yeah.  Because, you know, you're going to spend a lot of time chasing drunk people and you're going to be so busy,  you're going to miss the guy planning to blow up something for real.  So, but again, we are the ones who chase this guy, you know, who said, oh, if my girlfriend's late coming into  Nottingham Airport again next week, I'm going to blow the place up.  And a tweet that nobody saw until weeks later.  And then, you know, nobody took seriously, but some prosecutor decided they should do something about it.  He won his case, though, just recently.  He did, eventually. Years.  I mean, he lost his job, his life was destroyed.  He didn't win his case because the government were like, you know, you're right.  That was just dumb of us.  He won the case because eventually it got to a judge who said, really?  Really? No.  No.

Transcript:  You're going to love this.  Nathan Mirvold, former Microsoft CTO and world-renowned patent troll,  has just patented DRM for 3D objects.  Oh, no.  He's very worried, as I think all right-minded people are,  that people with a MakerBot might just, I don't know, make something that's patented.  So he's got a patent, Tuesday, from the USPTO.  Manufacturing Control System describes methods for managing object production rights,  DRM for 3D printers.
