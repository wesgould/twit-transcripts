Transcript:  I think right it could be for anything like if I watched a couple times where I didn't want to learn how to get past  A level and you can watch somebody beat the game that you're trying to beat or you're just sitting there like you're bored  And you're hanging out you got it all in the background like today a guy was watching me my daughter play battlefront  We're not good or anything. Yeah, but he was watching and when he got done  He's like I think I'm gonna go buy that game because it looks like you get yeah  It looks like you guys are having fun and he gets to see somebody play  You know as opposed to watch somebody do a review where they tell you something's perfect and it's paid for  Advertisement basically you can actually watch people play and you can see if they're enjoying it or not  I think I mean like I'm playing with a kid and she's hyped on it. That means it's alright, right?

Start time: 666.80
End time: 694.94

They will say here's what you do. You do this this this and this  Twitch is more it's really much more social although some of it is this idea of  Gaming as a as a  Spectator sport, you know like football and I think some of it is also that League of Legends is huge on Twitch  And people are really you sometimes have thousands of people watching a game between well-known players on Twitch and that's a big part of it as well

Transcript:  Well, we live in very interesting times you can make a living  So, what is this this is a guy  Getting swatted. Oh, yeah, very it's a well-known twitcher and this is the danger of it. I mean, you know  guns drawn the police are acting responsibly because what they've heard is a  Call saying I'm being held hostage or I'm gonna shoot people  The guy who swatted us said I've placed bombs all around twit. I'm going in there. I have a bunch of weapons  I'm gonna shoot everybody execution style and then blowing the place up  and so now the good news is our local police department knew about swatting and

Start time: 744.88
End time: 750.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Start time: 750.76
End time: 831.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think they're learning  Here's an example this is  Obnoxious at work in Ontario, California  Which is in the LA area police got a call a local man was doing dope had shot and killed his father with an AR-15  Was thinking about killing his mother. They sent this is the Ontario Police Force 32 units to the address  that's 90% of the available law enforcement resources including three supervisors throngs of squad cars and armored bearcat  that's an armored vehicle a  Helicopter a canine unit only to find three people a mother her boyfriend and her son inside and perfectly safe  The son was a League of Legends gamer who had angered obnoxious  Merely by defending one of his female victims online the ordeal cost Ontario sixty five hundred dollars  But the detective assigned to the case said hey, I've got felony cases sitting my lap  Why would I take this cyber case?  Tracking down all these records trying to find a guy who's in another country and that's the problem and even if they catch him  Most of the time it's a misdemeanor now. There are moves to make these more  Seriously illegal this is the you know I have to say we're really exposed to the dark side of the internet the New York Times  You know published in the magazine today, so I think a lot of other people are going to know about it

Start time: 831.62
End time: 836.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What happens if there's a real problem during the time that 90% of the resources are being wasted?

Start time: 837.80
End time: 848.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know in the New York Times being the liberal rag that it is I say that with jest  But of course focused on the over militarized police as the problem, and I you know I don't think that's exactly

Start time: 849.66
End time: 854.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Fair again the one time they don't show up, and it's a real situation  Yeah, now they've got a problem on her hand

Start time: 854.78
End time: 871.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So no they have to do and I think they are doing exactly what they need to do and one hopes  They're well trained so they don't shoot unless there's cause to shoot, but you can't I mean to be in that position of being  faced with  armed heavily armed people

Start time: 871.82
End time: 902.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's why I don't play on Xbox like I know you love your Xbox, but what the rhetoric I hear from my Xbox versus my PlayStation  My ps4 is like full of adults and yeah, you get some banter. That's annoying sometimes the Xbox is worse Xbox. Oh, it's in  Exponentially worse like it's over-the-top  worse than people on PlayStation  Dramatically like just go play Call of Duty for an hour on each system  And you'll see it just hop in and out of lobbies, and you'll it's insane the difference now this kid was 16

Start time: 903.52
End time: 958.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The kid who's doing this?  He was abused by his father beaten by his father his mother was mentally ill and hospitalized  They did interview him and psych you know I guess psychologists interviewed him and said you know  He's he's well on his way to being psych. You know a psychopath that is somebody who apparently has no moral  Compass doesn't enjoys the pain of others, but doesn't really have any empathy  For others and the problem is it doesn't take many of those people with technical skills to have a make this cause a problem  You know there's ten of them. I mean he he was he was swatted hundreds and hundreds of times  and it was very difficult if it weren't for a kind of a  fairly  obsessed detective named  Finley  pursuing this  From I think was alpharetta, Georgia BA Finley John's Creek outside Atlanta

Start time: 959.00
End time: 971.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He probably never would have been caught so why is it that it's so easy to spoof caller ID  You had trivial soup yeah, but could we create spoof proof caller ID and do a lot to ameliorate this

Start time: 975.04
End time: 1019.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, well this comes down to really the fundamental issue on the internet in general of bad behavior, which is anonymity  There's a real nexus between  Me getting me if you don't know who I am I can do anything I want it's a problem in forums is in in in  social media in  Check in our chat room in we allow anonymity in our chat room because I think anonymity is important  I think people ought to be able to you know kind of have handles and and express themselves  We've talked from time to time about  Not you know having a verified chat room making sure that we know who people are would certainly eliminate a lot of problems  You know there's I think there's a good case to be made that people should be able to participate anonymously  Except that some people very few take advantage of that and that's really what it comes down to right is it

Transcript:  I  Love this  Apple watch owners glance at their wrists 60 to 80 times a day Philip you had this story at fortune.com  They're actually two different studies you quote

Start time: 1080.40
End time: 1106.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  yeah, the best one was the  Not the risk Lee one risk risk Lee every week asked a question of a group of a twenty five hundred  Watch owners, which is not representative, but it gives you a  Large sample size but it's self-supporting right right and it's and you know people who hate the watch probably aren't gonna answer questions  About what they do with it, but the second study remind me who did it? I don't have this in front of me

Start time: 1106.80

Transcript:  It was a university study University of Stockholm's mobile life center, right?

Start time: 1111.38
End time: 1153.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  so they strapped cameras on to a dozen people and  Followed them for a month and and recorded whenever they could they recorded the interactions  So they got actual this is this is real data  And you know not surprisingly they look at their watch most often  Like 50% of the things and then what time it is  Yeah, what a lot go figure and actually it drops off dramatically after watch face and notifications  You know suddenly we're down to six percent workout time or  Six percent notifications and you get onto checking mail

Start time: 1155.40
End time: 1200.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  0.1 percent I think the notifications is interesting because any any watch will give you the  50% case which is what time is it like most watches do it better than the Apple watch does because it doesn't show the time unless  You do it. Just right, you know flick your wrist just right  But notifications are really a small, you know, no more than 23 percent of use if you include the two there  And activity is maybe 10 percent of the use, you know  That's what people say they get the watch for they say they get the watch  They don't have to get the phone out of the pocket to see who's calling or just you know  They let they say they get it because it monitors their activity and they can become more healthy  Truth is they don't they use it mostly to see what time it is

Start time: 1201.18
End time: 1302.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but but I think for me the  Original pitch for the watch was that you know  If you're if you're like me and you're pulling the watch your phone out of your pocket a hundred times a day  each phone interaction by the time you unlock it and see what it is and think about whether it's about a minute and  the the average interaction in that they found in this we just study was something like it was less than seven seconds and  For looking at the watch for looking at what time it is and we're looking at notifications  We're talking about you know at three point eight nine point two seconds  anyway, you replace if you the the the idea of replacing a one-minute interaction with a three or four or five second interaction  There's a business to be made there. I guess it's not huge. Yeah, and it's a subset of  The the iPhone market which is really what Apple cares about  you know the watch is that the  The Apple's business  revolves around the Sun that is the iPhone and every other that the watch the TV the the iPad  the Mac now are all  Peripheral to the to the phone and to the extent to which  You know you buy into any of those peripheral products. You're more likely to buy a phone and stick with a phone  so I you know anyway, but the  Sound a little defensive because I think there's a lot of people that the conventional wisdom is that the that the watch is a bust  and  You know we don't have the the Black Friday numbers yet  But my guess is that they're gonna come out better than Wall Street thinks and certainly better than the naysayers thing analysts

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  as far as the the  Activity part you're talking about you also have to remember that unless you have like one of the newer fit bits  90% of those pedometers don't show you your steps like I see people like I friends are where the jawbone that I used to  Have and you just see girls like just doing high steps. So what are you doing? I'm getting my steps in  They can't see how many steps they're doing, but they're doing them. So same thing with your watch  I don't check my steps until the end of the day or like when I'm right  I think about my bike I set it up  But you think about it, you know that you're doing it. You don't have to check and say oh I took five steps today  So no, you're not doing that because that's not even a natural thing to do  Most of those devices sink to your phone and you look at it at the end of the day or if you think you've been too lazy  You know, they give this gives you the nudge you've been sitting for an hour makes you think about it  So no, they're not going in and checking activity like oh I burn 300 calories sitting on your twit for the last two hours  No, not something that you normally do but most of those devices don't do that per se

Transcript:  Now there is an Apple watch. Will there be a new one? Oh, yeah. No, that's what I  Yeah, yeah, I wouldn't it doesn't doesn't feel right to me  I mean that Apple has is learning that these products have  natural cycles  The the phone used to be two years  They're trying to push it up to one year  The the max, you know, what do they have four or five six year lifespan the iPad they guessed wrong  They thought people were gonna upgrade more frequently and they don't yeah, you know  So  This the watch doesn't feel like an every year product to me  What I could see is this sort of month vacation of Apple where you start buying stuff  Like like you you know with the automatic upgrade thing you do with the watch  With the with the phone I could see people doing that with the watch and if you've if you bought it that way and you  Can get a new watch when the next one comes out?  I could see that happening.

And you can't apparently can't put a cell phone in this particular watch and still have a one-day  Recharge so, you know, it'll be a while, you know battery technology improves at a glacial pace and  Probably, you know when the when the phone when the energy requirements of cell phone chips and battery  Meat, that's when they'll that's when they'll put out the the watch that I really want  Yeah

Start time: 2473.98

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The reason the simple reason why there's not gonna be another watch right now  Probably is gonna be at least every two-year cycles because it doesn't do anything  I mean other than the fact of me liking this watch  There's no real reason for me to want this watch like I have people ask me all the time  Should I get one or I was gonna come out with a new one?  I'm like, I just get one because there's not gonna be a new one coming out anytime soon because there's no  Killer new thing to tell me and thinner lighter faster is all cookies and whatever  But the watch doesn't have a killer app yet or anything driving it besides the fact of them possibly making the thinner  I mean you put in the camera and it's not gonna do it for me  It's it's it feels fine wearing it so until they have something like  Dramatic that would make them want to buy it like what I can imagine  They can't come out another one right away.

That's the world chess champion  They decided to stick it, you know to apply it to the market and then you look that go back a little bit  That Watson has really come down in the world  Yeah, look at that see that the Apple watch is pinned at 100% can't get higher than that, right?  Yeah, so it just finally fell the last one is down to seven or something. Yeah, but  Wait a minute.

Well, that's a good question according to the law  The NSA ended its bulk surveillance of phone records at 1159 p.m  Eastern time Saturday and  They have some sort of scaled back system that involves maybe perhaps I don't know a warrant  According under the Freedom Act  The NSA and law enforcement agencies can no longer collect telephone calling records in bulk in  An effort to sniff out suspicious activities. No more can they record metadata?  Information about who it mentioned about who you called and what time you called  They have to get a court order  Go to somebody and

They use the internet  In the clear they didn't use encryption  They used cell phones. They had GPS  Didn't stop them  They weren't even hiding

You need to share common experiences  They said diversity is a bad thing in the workplace because if people think they're different  They're not gonna work together in the hive mind. So you have to you know  Celebrate your similarities and then I think it's it's also said you should get them to to march around  To march around if in lockstep because that triggers something in the mind  This is why soldiers in boot camp you do a lot of marching you think that's wasted time  No, because it unifies you as a force and they always said in fact that soldiers aren't aren't dying for their country  They're dying for the other guys in their unit  Because we're all a unit so we're going to that's why I'm not I don't care about Star Wars, but I'm pretending to I  Also love dr.

Transcript:  East Coast and it's dinnertime here. I know I'm sorry. We're keeping you from your dinner. We're gonna hurry up here  We'll wrap this up here. All right, let's take a break when we come back how Facebook this is a challenge Facebook  12,000 employees, how do you how do you preserve?  Google faces the same challenge  How do you preserve the magic spark that got the whole thing started and just don't just turn into a faceless company like HP or IBM?  It's not an easy thing to do  We'll talk about in just a second because you did some some good work on this one  But first a little bit of a word from our friends at fresh books  Which is a lifesaver if you're freelancer if you make if you have to send invoices  If you don't get paid until you mail an invoice  This is for you because that's the thing you don't really enjoy doing right?  It's never was the part the part I liked about the job rummaging through receipts keeping track of expenses  creating invoices sending them off to the client  Tracking down clients who don't pay on time all of that stuff. That's just not the stuff you that's not why you got in business  But if you use fresh books, it's a lot easier fresh books is a super simple cloud accounting software  That's giving thousands of freelancers just like you just like me  I used it for a long time the tools to save time billing and get paid faster  I was I was billing Rogers in Canada every month because I was doing call for help up there  It was such a pain. I complained to amber actually the and I mentioned this before the biggest problem was I just would never bill  Them which means I'd never get paid  I had six at one point six months worth of invoices and I sold them all at the same time. They were not happy  Amber said there's this new company just started up. This is in 2004. They're called fresh books there in Toronto  You're gonna love them and I and she was right  You'll be creating and sending invoices in minutes. You'll get paid up front  Yes, you can get paid up front. They have this thing called a deposit now in fresh books  So you don't have to cover costs out of pocket or wait till the end of a project to get paid a lot of clients  Like that it makes their accounting easier  You can organize expenses very easily the the fresh books app take pictures of receipts get them right into the  Invoice same thing with if you track hours you build  Time you it does it almost?  Automatically right from the app and fresh books has added this automated customer reviews report  You can see all your reviews in one place. So if you have customer reviews, this is neat post them on your website as references  They're adding features all the time for the freelancers kind of a haven for freelancers  If you have a question help is free forever and you can always count on their award-winning support rock stars to go above and beyond  Fresh books dot there. They are. Oh they had it. You know what? This is a new picture  They had it they get more support rock stars. They had to get a new picture  bigger group  It's easy to get started totally free for 30 days. Go to fresh books  Dot-com slash twit make sure when they ask you how'd you hear about us you mentioned this week in tech  Start your 30-day free trial today and we do thank fresh books so much. I thank them for making my life a lot easier and  And for supporting this week in tech, it's kind of been nice come full circle  So what inspired you to write the article Harry about Facebook?

Transcript:  Well, if I can give a small plug I wrote the cover story for our current issue of fast company, which is the 20th  Anniversary issue nice and that is on the future of Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg's  Plans for VR and AI and drones they call it the only true  Unicorn. So over the course of several months  I spent a bunch of time at fast company and one of the things I talked about is essentially how  Now that they have more than 12,000 people they don't become kind of huge and bureaucratic and slow-moving  And and and incumbent and I think right now they're doing a really good job of still being Facebook  but at a larger scale and  So the story you're talking about is essentially on how they do that and I think a lot of it is they have this really distributed  Culture where they do their best to make every single employee feel like they personally are responsible for the culture  There is no single person who's responsible for doing it  They try to make everybody into an advocate for the sort of culture that that Zuckerberg created originally

It's hard. It's hard to do that when you're as big as we are  but according to  Facebook's head of HR Laurie Guller  There's no like department that makes these signs that the signs actually are created by sort of on their own by Facebook really

Transcript:  Hey, Harry, can I ask you a question?  Is the it's it always seemed to me that that Facebook?  the the main Facebook business creating the Facebook page and getting people to sign up and  Share with each other was was was the equivalent of the Google search  It's the main business of it and that and just like Google has had trouble finding something else that makes money for them  Has Facebook you know the the oculus rift the the other things they've gotten into feel like sidelines to me  And and not big enough to replace their original idea. Well, they totally

Start time: 6311.70
End time: 6392.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  May certainly wrong. They certainly have the luxury of  Doing things like acquiring whatsapp for 19 billion dollars and acquiring oculus for 2 billion because the core business is doing so well  I actually think they're doing a pretty good job of positioning themselves to do well in the future  Because Instagram is one of the largest social networks in the world  And I think they have a really good opportunity to make quite a bit of money off of Instagram over time  Oculus obviously it's really early to say whether oculus will be a large business  But Mark Zuckerberg's theory at least is that VR is essentially the next  User interface and so all the stuff we do today in something like Facebook  Book we will eventually do in VR and if so there might be the opportunity to monetize it  There are a lot more focused than Google  Google is doing smart contact lenses and self-driving cars and all kinds of stuff a lot of which  It's not clear what the business model is  Mark Zuckerberg sees AI  VR and internet drones is really core to the mission of connecting the world  So they're not going to do anything and everything  they're gonna do things which they see as being kind of the next step in the original mission of helping people share stuff and  Everything they are doing it does relate to sharing stuff. They're not doing VR because they care that much about gaming  They're doing VR because it might be the next interface

Transcript:  Difficult though, especially when you're a successful company to acquire employees will buy into that  Versus employees who buy into the stock options, you know, and I'm sure that's a challenge because you get you get people  As you point out they have 500 openings right now. They have to hire a lot of people  They're hiring at huge scale and inevitably I would guess the vast majority of them are there because they think hey  I'm gonna get rich at Facebook as opposed to I share Mark Zuckerberg's vision  You can see Elon's vision is so grandiose and wild that you can see space scientists would say yeah  But saying I want you know, we want to help people share it doesn't quite grab the

Obviously people promote ads and things on there but Instagram I  See more people using the side hustle of Instagram again paid endorsements and things like that as opposed to sponsorship that really doesn't  Invite me to do anything  I mean like Ruby Tuesdays comes on and says buy some Ruby Tuesdays  I can get a coupon or do anything from it and who like I don't know  It just feels like a lot of shady business at least the VR them getting into that  That's something that could be physical they could sell they can make a profit they could maybe dominate a market in you know  That's why Google's  Transforming into things like the car and things like that where they can actually have something physical to make some money off of  Instead of all this digital make-believe fake money that you know tricks stock market people into doing stuff and stock options  You know Mark Zuckerberg runs around throwing away stock options like it's his job  Oh, we're gonna give this school up to a million dollars of stock options keyword now sentence up to a million dollars  You know, I mean like this. I don't know but just anyone I'm sorry options do not hurt for sure  Well, it helps acquire talent, right? I'm sure I'm just saying versus the Elon Musk thing of telling a little boy  We're going to Mars and the guys like man  I've been wanting to do something like that my whole life or I've been it's a little hard  That's what I'm saying to it's like a like button

They're firing all cylinders as a business  It's doing fantastically  I think compared to other tech companies that have gotten as large as they are and they've been around as long as they have  they generally speaking are doing a good job of  Keeping ahead of the market  You know I think contrast them with Yahoo for instance Yahoo  Yahoo 11 years into its existence at all kinds of problems, which Facebook does not have yet, right?

Yeah, that's smart and it has that scale  And it has that scale one of the big challenges Facebook does have is it's really hard for them to create anything new  That doesn't look incredibly tiny and puny right compared to Facebook which has 1.5 billion users  Messenger had 200 million users when they started treating it like a standalone business and a year later had about 700 million users so  Like Instagram and WhatsApp  It's one of the few social networks that has the scale that it doesn't look tiny compared to Facebook itself

Transcript:  Platform for a lot of different things and there are a number of messaging apps that are like that  We chat we China is like that line from Japan is like that and if messenger was just a feature within Facebook  You would be really hard to do that.

We don't see the long view of anything  So it's really easy to assume that the dominant industries today will be dominant forever  You know we just think I don't always be Facebook and Google and Twitter  And it's clear that from the history of technology which you and I have both covered for decades  You know Microsoft isn't the Microsoft of yesteryear IBM's not the my  IBM of yesteryear that there's a natural cycle to these businesses and really after 10 20 years  Somebody else comes along, but it's starting to look like there are some incumbents like Facebook particularly Google perhaps  That might break this mold that might in fact is  That we're done that like these guys are gonna be here for 400 years is that crazy talk.

It's it's you know where its  Main business comes from in order to to go in a completely different direction  There's an old saying that that if you know famously Microsoft missed the ball  the internet and and mobility and  But if Steve Ballmer had gone to the board of directors and said, you know  Mobility is the next thing we got a chuck windows and throw everything into mobility  He would have been fired because you'd kill your cash cow.

He is going out there and he is building the internet and he is bringing them Facebook because that's how you bring more people  So, I mean when you sit there and you think about Facebook and his global reach  I mean, it's a very traditional marketing plan to bring people into the fold and he is doing it quote-unquote the right way

They're not chucking everything for mobile  They're like look, let's go get ahead of the curve on this if it flops out  It's not a big deal. We're already there. But when we're still building the main concept of bringing people in to love us because guess what?  I don't really like Facebook and all the stuff you guys are talking about  I don't care because I am cynical horrible person  But when I see him going out and building this little spaceship plane is gonna be bringing internet to people who've never even had anything  I say hey good for you mark. You're a good dude. Normally. I don't think that about the guy  But when he's doing things like that, it's indoctrinating is bringing in new people and you look like a nice guy all the same time  So I'm just saying they might be around for another we might be buying Google Sox and Facebook cookies.
