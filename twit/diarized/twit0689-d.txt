Proposition seven says California will stay on daylight saving time. But that requires two-thirds vote of the state legislature and federal approval.  Like, that's going to happen. So, why even bother? Why even bother?

Transcript:  Speaking of elections, we're thrilled to have Dan Patterson here. Dan is doing, how many pieces? A 10-piece series on voter fraud. On what? On election technology.

Start time: 249.22
End time: 286.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, election hacking. So, this is a 10-episode series we started. We are on week eight, I think, of election hacking.  So, we are examining, when I say we, this is for CBS News at cbsnews.com slash election hacking.  So, this is 10 stories as well as 10 produced segments. And then another 10 stories over on CNET about the mechanics of election hacking.  And one thing we've learned is that 10 is certainly not enough. We will inevitably miss something that people, especially people in IT, look at us and go, well, what about this?

Start time: 287.42
End time: 313.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, we have in the US, we have what they call the midterms elections. They're coming up two weeks from Tuesday. So, we're just about two weeks out.  And a lot of alarm bells about election security. I will be listening to all of this at cbsnews.com. But what's just the top level take on this? Is the election going to be hacked?

Start time: 315.84
End time: 398.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is quite likely that various actors will engage in different methods, different tactics of election hacking. But that is not to discourage you from voting. You should go and vote.  So, when I say tactics, we look at everything from voting machine hacking. Because, you know, if you go to Black Hat or DEF CON every year, there is a voter village.  And we look at how vulnerable voting machines are. And they're incredibly vulnerable. As we know, they are simply computers and all computers can be hacked.  However, I had a great talk with IBM's space rogue, Chris Thomas, who is part of a loft heavy industries, a hacking collective.  And he had a great thought, which was, look, yes, computers can be hacked. But one of the wonderful things about the American bureaucracy is that we are decentralized. It is not a federal system.  It's a statewide system. And every state does things a little differently. And that kind of security baked into the democratic process means that we have diversity in how we vote, or at least the mechanics of the technology involved in how we vote.  And that's protected us from various forms of nefarious actors meddling with the election. Right now, it seems as though the biggest threat to election security is and will remain social media. It is influence campaigns that run.

Start time: 398.42
End time: 440.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's not hacking per se. That's attempting to influence voters attempting to suppress voting, a variety of things like that. And yeah, that seems to work a lot better because you can be target you can target a lot more people than trying to figure out which, you know,  D bold machine is used in, you know, Monroe County, Louisiana, so we can hack that one and change the vote there. But does that going to change anything in the state? It's a much more cognitive hacking. Yeah, cognitive hacking is a lot easier. Who are if people are trying to hack voting machines? Are these are these nation state? Are these governmental hackers?

Start time: 441.00
End time: 467.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, so attribution, the number one thing if you talk to and we spend a lot of time talking to Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter, the large technology firms, as well as experts in cybersecurity, as well as people who actually run elections in various states, including Colorado, Georgia, Florida. And they will tell us that first of all attribution is incredibly difficult because the forensics take a long time to figure out and

Start time: 481.24
End time: 495.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, he's going on and on and on. Thank you, Skype. That's, that's honestly Greg Farrow. The real threat here is not nation state actors, but just the crap level of technology being used by everybody, including companies like T.V.

Start time: 496.84
End time: 538.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's complicated. I think that I think what he was trying to get to is that there's more than one way an attack can happen. You can have an attack on the actual infrastructure itself. So the voting machines. But the point would be is that to actually do it to all voting machines across the US much more difficult would be.  Yeah, would it just scale that attack is incredibly difficult and improbable.  And to really impact the US elections, you would need to be impacting a substantial number of people. Now, that's true. But the thing that strikes me about that particular discussion is in the current electoral environment, the left and the right is evenly balanced. Right.

Start time: 538.94
End time: 561.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if you can swing five to 10 percent of the vote, you can actually get the outcome that you want by targeting certain areas. So that's in fact, you might say that's what we saw in the presidential election two years ago, because it was a swing of seventy seven thousand votes that turned the election.  Exactly. So if you could talk, that's a national election. This is not a national election. This is at best statewide in 2018.

Start time: 563.00
End time: 636.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I think that I think the election hacking per se that's been happening in the US has much more been systemic. So we've seen, you know, various left and right wing parties gerrymandering the vote.  That kind of thing makes it very difficult.  That kind of thing or stacking the rolls with people from, you know, this area gets zoned and there's like and that's all white people.  Or voter suppression, making it harder for minorities to vote.  Cleaning the rolls, which just happens to clean out all of the people who come from left leaning districts and so forth.  So I think and now that's all that seems to be happening at very much more scale.  So the articles that I've been reading about the US election system is the actual system inside the US is actually being compromised by the people inside the system.  But they're using the threat of social media and the threat of election hacking to hide what they're doing.  So if you can actually say, you know, it's not our fault. It's not our fault. It's all those trolls on the troll farm on Twitter.  Yes, indeed. And so why wouldn't you blame them and point the finger at somebody else?  But in fact, it was you that cleansed the rolls, which got rid of a lot of people in poorer counties who move a lot.  And therefore they're suddenly not eligible to vote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, in Dan, we're going to get Dan back. Something's gone wrong with this guy.  But in Dan's report on CBSN, CBS News dot com, there's an article that he's involved in called These Are the Hackers Targeting the Midterm Election.  He points out it's not just nation states, but multinational corporations like Cambridge Analytica.  Are we seeing evidence that Brexit might have also been influenced?  The Brexit vote in the UK might have been influenced because that's where you are.

Start time: 664.26
End time: 674.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we certainly are. In fact, all across Europe, seeing the same thing happen in Italy, Spain, the German elections that came out, people aren't entirely sure even what happened there.

Start time: 674.28
End time: 683.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He points out Cambridge Analytica was involved in the 2013 Kenya elections. I mean, this has been going on for five years at least.

Start time: 684.00
End time: 754.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. I would think by this point that any data that Facebook has got has been stolen or taken unauthorized theft.  We know that.  We know that.  Yeah. And I don't think it was done by companies like Cambridge Analytica. It would be much more easily be done by employees, quite honestly.  So one of the reasons that, you know, the tech companies are very reluctant to say, oh, we'll control. We don't want to restrict data. We don't want to share it.  One of the reasons that I'm coming to realize is companies like Google and Facebook, for them to put controls around the data is incredibly difficult.  More importantly, it actually prevents them from functioning correctly.  So they have things like a developer starts working on Project A. They'll work it for two or three months until the project's finished.  Then they go to Project B. Well, Project B might be on a completely different data system.  But if you have controls on what data they can access, it might take them three months to get permissions and approvals and reviews.  And so a lot of the reasons that they won't put controls on the data and enact privacy controls is because it would actually slow them down internally.  And then the pace of innovation, if you want to call it innovation, you know, most of what Facebook and Google these days is copying each other or copying Instagram or Snapchat or, you know, whatever somebody else is doing.

Transcript:  We have innovative ways of stealing the other guy's ideas. Some of the best.  That's right.  Yes. We spent a lot of time thinking about that.

Start time: 770.00
End time: 774.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Transcript:  Actually, I thought this was interesting.  Facebook has actually hired the former Deputy Prime Minister of England, Sir Nick Clegg, as their head of global affairs and communications.

Start time: 789.76
End time: 797.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, this is a rather unusual. Now, Nick Clegg is something of a butt of many jokes here in the UK.

Start time: 797.36
End time: 799.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's the Liberal Democrats Party.

Start time: 800.50
End time: 847.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. So which is now defunct, by the way, after his tenure as the leader.  So they'll tell you something.  Yeah. So about five, two or three elections ago, the Liberal Democrats came out of nowhere to be a centrist party.  So there was a right wing, a left wing, and then this the Liberal Democrats emerged to occupy the center.  And then either and they sort of took a few votes and then all of a sudden they got enough momentum.  They had a really charismatic leader and they were able to form an alliance with the right wing party, the Tories.  And then they were, you know, were given the vote, the deputy prime ministership and so forth and a number of, you know, various positions of power.  And then they died. They weren't able to act. They didn't make any innovation. They didn't make anything change.

Start time: 847.92
End time: 860.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So he was kind of the prototypical reformer who's beloved by the young people, is that they were going to make things better and then did nothing and lost the confidence of the voters.

Start time: 860.42
End time: 897.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. And then after I lost the confidence of the voters, the voters abandoned them at the at the at the next general election.  And the Liberal Democrats basically disbanded a couple of years later.  So not exactly covered himself in glory here.  This is not, you know, your typical burning sprite arc of career glory.  This is a man who was given the party after the head of the party stood down and then proceeded to run it into the ground.  So I actually think this is great for me because I hate Facebook with a passion and having somebody like this in charge of global policy should just be fantastic.  I'm expecting it to blow up. I'm expecting Facebook to give about 10 years to bring it down.

Start time: 897.64
End time: 901.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It took him 10 years to kill the Liberal Democrats. I think it'll take him about that long to defeat Facebook.

Start time: 902.12
End time: 904.90

End time: 918.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hugo Rifkin, who calls himself the funniest journalist in Britain, tweeted, My timeline is intriguingly divided between people disappointed with Nick Clegg for going to work for Facebook and people disappointed with Facebook for hiring Nick Clegg.

End time: 940.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's great. Quite honestly seeing Facebook.  Because you hate Facebook.  Yeah, I mean, last week we saw the whole tech, the beginning of a tech clash.  Two hundred billion dollars was wiped off the Nasdaq as the Google, Facebook, et al.  All dropped sort of five to ten percent as the investors go for the door because they definitely see that these those companies are now under fire.

Start time: 940.06
End time: 945.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you think that's lasting? That's not profit taking. That's not just a blip.  That's actually going to be a lasting abandoning of tech.

Start time: 946.26
End time: 999.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, I do. I think there's far too much stacking up against them.  I mean, the European governments are now talking about mandatory taxation for companies like Facebook and Google.  Like Facebook paid 10 million in tax on one point five billion dollars worth of revenue taken out of the country in the UK.  Right. Right. So all all the infrastructure consumed, all the infrastructure, all the employees, they don't even pay indirect taxation because they don't.  The Internet is on tax.  So there's going to be there's no reason for the governments not to attack Facebook and Google and Apple.  And they're basically going to say we're going to have to put a consumption tax on companies like yours.  And it's going to take a few years because governments move slowly.  And this sort of taxation can have unexpected impacts.  So if you start to move to that, I mean, many governments move to services tax or goods taxes and you know, where you pay like in the US.

Start time: 1000.73
End time: 1002.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You guys call it a value added tax.

Start time: 1002.48
End time: 1008.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We call it a value added tax, but you call it state tax.  All right. So if you do, we have sales tax, but that's a taxation on consumption.

Start time: 1009.48
End time: 1025.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When you buy something, you pay five to eight percent on consumption.  But a VAT is a completely different idea.  No, it's a consumption. It's consumption.  But no, but there is the idea of taxing production, taxing it all along the way.  That is not what your guys are doing.

Start time: 1025.06
End time: 1053.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's only taxed at point of sale.  OK, so it's a sales tax. It's a ridiculously high sales tax.  Yeah, those sales taxes work. What they do is they capture the black economy.  Someone has to pay the sales tax at the final point of sale.  So even if you're doing, you know, under the table cash deals, you're still buying the goods.  So if you're let's say you're a carpenter and you're putting an extension on a house, but you're getting paid cash, then when you buy the wood, you're paying sales tax.

Start time: 1053.34
End time: 1080.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Bill Gates said a weird thing a few months ago where he said, well, you know, if robots take all our jobs, we should really tax robots.  But in fact, what he was saying, I think was smarter than that was the notion that you should tax companies on production all along the line instead of which is a much easier, simpler thing to do instead of taxing consumption at the end.  Well, it's not it's not I don't think it's as regressive either.

Start time: 1081.98
End time: 1114.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the challenge here is that today we tax traditional companies on profit.  So if the company doesn't make a profit, the company doesn't pay tax.  And that's that helps to protect jobs and helps to protect the people employed there.  Because if you ask the company to pay tax and it's not making a profit, then people start to get unemployed.  And that's bad for government and bad for society. General.  Now, keep in mind here, my thesis would be is that a good capitalist, a good capitalist should always remember that the job of capitalism is to keep people employed and fed and clothed.  And that's why we have a capitalist society.

Start time: 1115.38
End time: 1119.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What are you nuts? The job of capitalism is to make as much money as you possibly can.

Start time: 1120.10
End time: 1142.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. No, the job of capitalism was to make sure that people aren't on the street shooting each other and stealing food from those stores and so that we can make as much money as we possibly can.  That's right. And part of the part of the value of capitalism is it has to be a redistribution from the top to the bottom.  That's what taxation does. You are a communist. That is not capitalism.  Actually, I'm a centrist. So don't don't curse me with the communist.

Transcript:  I want to work. I really want to get Dan back in the conversation.  We're having a little trouble with him technically.  You know what I'm going to do is take a break and do an ad and then we will come back because I do.  There's much more to say about this.  In fact, Google has decided that in the face of regulation from the EU, they're going to hit back and hit back in the consumer's pockets, which I think is very interesting.  That's one way to fight back on this.  I'd like to talk more about the tech lash. Greg Farrow is here.  He is somebody saying in the chair, I'm a centrist only by the definition of the EU.  Here in the United States, you'd be considered a leftist, lefty commie.  That's that's probably he is at the Packet Pushers Network and an expert in all things technology, especially networking.  We're thrilled to have you. We will get Dan Patterson back.  He's with the Tech Republic where he's a senior writer there and is in the midst of a 10 piece series on CBS News on election hacking, specifically what's going to be happening in a couple of weeks here in the United States.  We'll get back to that in just a second.  Right now, I want to talk about our sponsor, Rocket Mortgage.  If you are buying a house, you know there's some anxiety associated with writing that big check, the biggest check you'll ever write.  And that's just the down payment. You're actually borrowing even more, you know, 70 percent more, 80 percent more.  And that's, you know, plus you're buying something that you and your family are going to live in.  It's going to be your home for some time.  Rocket Mortgage comes from Quicken Loans, the largest lender in the country.  They're the experts in mortgages, number one in customer satisfaction, eight years in a row.  This is all according to JD Power.  So this is independently rated that way.  And one of the reasons they're so good, one of the reasons people like them so much is because they're very customer focused.  That's why they created something called Rocket Mortgage, which really speaks to people like me, people like us.  It's an entirely online mortgage approval process.  I love that.  That means you don't have to go to a bank.  You don't have to fill out a lot of paperwork.  You don't have to go to the attic and find pay stubs.  You can do it all on your phone or on your computer.  They call it the power buying process at rocketmortgage.com slash twit two.  There's three steps, actually.  First step, answer a few simple questions.  They'll check your credit and you get pre-qualified approval.  And all of that's just in a few minutes.  Then the next step kicks in.  They'll verify income, assets and credit and they'll do it within about 24 hours to give you verified approval.  That's when you get that button that says print the letter.  You can show it to your realtor.  You can show it to the seller when you're making an offer on a home.  You are basically a cash buyer.  You're approved, baby.  And that is important.  I don't know what it's like in the rest of the world, but in the United States, it's really a seller's market.  And when you come in as a buyer and you've already got the loan, that makes a huge difference, moves you right to the front of the line.  But that's not all.  That's one way to take out the anxiety.  But the third step, once you're verified, you qualify for their all new exclusive rate shield approval.  This really helps.  Nowadays, interest rates are going up.  And that means there is some anxiety, there's some pressure.  Buy that house fast before they go up again.  But you don't have to worry.  With rate shield approval, Quicken Loans and Rocket Mortgage lock your rate for up to 90 days while you shop.  It cannot go up for up to three months.  If rates go up, doesn't matter.  Your rate stays the same.  If rates go down, your rate will drop.  But either way, it's a victory for you.  And it's the kind of thing you'd expect from America's best mortgage lender.  Take the anxiety out of buying a new home.  Go to rocketmortgage.com slash twit to get your ducks in a row, as it were.  Rate shield approval is only valid on certain 30-year purchase transactions.  Additional conditions or exclusions may apply based on Quicken Loans data in comparison to public data records.  Equal Housing Lender, licensed in all 50 states, and MLSconsumeraccess.org, number 3030.  But all you have to remember is rocketmortgage.com slash twit and the number 2, twit2.  Dan Patterson is back. We've rebooted him.

Transcript:  That's a technical term, ladies and gentlemen.  We were talking about election hacking before we lost Dan.  We ended up talking about Nick Clegg running the global, whatever it is, global policy at Facebook,  which I thought was kind of interesting.  But I do want to, now that we got you back, I do want to get back to the election hacking.  There's some really interesting pieces here on this CBS News site.  How AI is creating new threats to election security. Whoa.  Artificial intelligence to target campaigns. How does that work?

Start time: 1489.12
End time: 1625.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So with every conversation in tech and IT, when we talk about AI, we go into the futuristic,  very interesting Elon Musk world or the Nick Bostrom world.  This is about automation and stuff that we think of as pretty, almost rote or mundane.  So automation is taking many of the phishing tactics that we saw in 2016.  Of course, if you remember, John Podesta, the chairperson of the Clinton campaign, was phished.  And many other members, I think there are almost 100, about 96 members of the Clinton campaign were phished in 2016.  Automation is scaling that and creating.  Look, if we think about a general election campaign, these are well-funded organizations that have the time,  money and really the human capital to spend defending the campaigns.  But down ticket, and particularly during midterm elections here in the United States, these campaigns often lack those resources.  So they are the targets of phishing, of email scams and of other ways to infiltrate your accounts.  Automation is creating exponentially larger threats because every campaign has valuable secrets and important information,  and they just don't have the resources to defend themselves.  So before Windows died on me, one thing I'd like to point out is that with every story that we do in this series,  we discover more and more interesting little crevices that we could poke our head into.  And there simply is so many vulnerabilities, as everyone who works in IT or security knows.  Every digital device and especially with the growth of the Internet of Things, everything is vulnerable.  So it's impossible to cover everything.  And what we wanted to do is cover the biggest threats to election security.  And I think once again, right before Windows died there, we were talking about influence campaigns and the role of the social web and cognitive hacking.  We see state-sponsored cognitive hacking pop up in almost every country or at least every powerful country.

Start time: 1626.06
End time: 1671.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So for years, we've had advertising, which is a form of cognitive hacking.  In fact, right now we're in the middle of the hottest season for TV ads for the election in California.  And when you watch these ads, it almost feels like they're blatantly misrepresenting the subject.  They're full of scare tactics.  They're full of statements that aren't technically wrong but are absolutely misstating the subject.  And I'm sure this happens in every state. It's kind of mind boggling.  How is that different? This legal advertising, how is that different from the cognitive hacking you're talking about?  It seems like it's just another blade of the same tool.

Start time: 1684.96
End time: 1699.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Transcript:  I mean, if you buy an ad on a football game on a Sunday afternoon, you're getting a vast audience.  But with Facebook, you can buy, I want to buy 35-year-old men in Mendocino County because I know that I can either convince them not to vote,  which I think is really sleazy, or I can convince them to vote in another way.  Or you can repress votes.

Start time: 1719.74
End time: 1737.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, vote suppression really is very effective, isn't it?  Yeah, Saudi Arabia has been running influence campaigns against, and we're running influence campaigns against Khashoggi.  And we now see the data that has popped up proving this.  So when you think about it...

Start time: 1738.00
End time: 1751.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they would just call that, that's not, he's not running for office, obviously, he was a Washington Post columnist.  They would just call that counter programming, right?  Yeah.  Khashoggi's saying one thing, we don't think that's true.  So we're going to state our point of view and use social media to do so.

Start time: 1752.12
End time: 1771.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, according to the Times story, the Saudis hired individuals, humans, because on the flip side of automation, look, all of these companies,  Facebook most notoriously repeats the line, we are going to hire 20,000 employees plus artificial intelligence to tamp down on these influence campaigns.

Start time: 1772.72
End time: 1804.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On Saturday, yesterday, the New York Times published this story, Troll Army and a Twitter insider,  in which they talk about the fact that the Saudis hired...  Hired humans.  Humans.  A human, an employee of Twitter, basically, just like you would hire a mole, a spy, a counter intelligence agent.  They suborned an employee.  They suborned an employee.  Twitter eventually fired him when they were told by American intelligence agencies what the Saudis were up to.  But that is, that's fascinating.

Start time: 1804.48
End time: 1879.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, they also hired humans, people inside Saudi Arabia.  They paid them the equivalent of $3,000 American dollars because they found that automation was tamping down on their attempts to run bots and trolls.  So they hired humans to write Twitter content that was designed to repress or attack Khashoggi.  Now, if we look at the indictment that came out on Friday from the DOJ, this was very explicit about not just the money and the humans who are involved.  This involved oligarchs funneling money designed to repress groups here in the United States and inflame groups.  This is directly from the indictment.  But they pushed, they tried to repress African-American voters.  They tried to inflame voters around topics like the Colin Kaepernick issue around Black Lives Matters,  around the burning of the American flag, around the issues of removing Confederate statues.  You can take all of these issues.  This is the Saudis doing that?  No, this was Russia.  Russia in 2016.  And what was their goal in that?  I mean, I don't think...  Their goal was to repress voters or repress particular groups.

Start time: 1879.28
End time: 1883.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Especially African-Americans who say, well, don't even bother to vote because it's hopeless.  Precisely.

Start time: 1884.50
End time: 1952.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you can scale this to or apply this to countries.  We also see this happening in Myanmar.  We see this happening in Eastern Europe.  We see this happening with powerful nations like China.  China is incredibly good at running influence campaigns.  They find this to be almost as effective as we were saying earlier, targeting or hacking voting machines.  The goal is to undermine faith and confidence in institutions and our American faith and confidence in each other.  So if we wonder, why are we so inflamed?  Why did social media all of a sudden become such a dumpster fire?  Well, one big reason is us.  We respond to these signals.  And when you see that this is propaganda is a time tested tactic.  And when you see images over and over and over again, you are more inclined to be sympathetic or to have an emotional reaction as opposed to an intellectual or slower reaction.

Start time: 1952.28
End time: 1987.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is the defense against something like that, though?  I mean, it seems like we're primed for this kind of influence.  Priming is the right word.  You know, one of the things we take a great pride in in the United States is freedom of the press, freedom of speech, the right of everybody to talk.  And that seems to open us up to any bad actor who wants to take advantage of that.  Now we have social networks which amplify it dramatically in ways that we didn't really anticipate.  But what do you do? Shut down Facebook?

Start time: 1988.00
End time: 2022.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The downside here is the algorithms in the networks have been polarizing.  So a lot of the algorithms that we have in YouTube and Twitter and Facebook are driven by engagement.  So if you click on something, then it they optimize.  It uses very simple, very dumb things.  Works. Yeah.  And that which is provocative, that which provokes outrage gets clicked on.  Even if it's idle curiosity or that bystander, I want to see the right as you drive past a road accident, kind of.  But look at it. And these algorithms don't have any human so vulnerable to this stuff.

Start time: 2023.78
End time: 2032.00

End time: 2042.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So no. And if it bleeds, it leads.  You know, like if I can tell you a horrible story about election hacking in, you know, Missouri, I'm going to click on that and then be outraged.

Start time: 2042.16
End time: 2053.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This has been coming for a long time that, you know, we've watched this happen on TV in the 60s that this has been coming for a long time.  And I feel like it's an oncoming freight train that nobody has any ability to stop.

Start time: 2054.68
End time: 2067.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And really has very little to do with any one particular election.  Certainly has nothing to do with a partisan side.  We saw evidence of bots propping up Bernie Sanders as much as Donald Trump during the 2016 election.

Start time: 2072.24
End time: 2087.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's exactly right. So no matter what side you may be on in whatever country you may be listening or watching this, this isn't about politics.  This is about the use a novel, a new use of the social web to spread misinformation.

Start time: 2087.98
End time: 2096.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that somebody who wants to be a bad actor and has enough money to do so, like Russia or Saudi Arabia, really can act in an almost unfettered way.

Start time: 2097.92
End time: 2150.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, and we're seeing this. The Democrats, both the Democrats and the Republicans in the US and increasingly governments around the world are hiring and building specialist IT teams to produce those bots and to publish those articles, to blog and to cover them.  And what we didn't see up until now is the mainstream politics taking action in its own right to own the ground that it covers.  So, you know, they were out there using the press and doing face to face and walking down the streets.  And other actors moved faster into new technologies and were hacking up Facebook, Twitter and Google to get the results that they wanted.  Right. So now politics is catching up because it now knows that it has to react to that.  And we saw the I've seen various interviews with the Democrat IT and the Republican IT teams and just how effective they were.

Start time: 2151.90
End time: 2219.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, Greg, you're exactly right. And this really, again, has very little to do with politics.  This is we say cognitive hacking, but it could easily be called algorithmic hacking.  And the issues are more important or at least more more diverse than simply a partisan issue on the right or the left or even one particular election.  If you think about the interests of not just state groups, but almost any group, information campaigns are a valuable asset in your arsenal.  And technology now has I mean, when we all started and certainly Leo and Greg, when you started, technology was far more of a vertical.  Now it's a horizontal and impacts every component of life and culture.  So it is not just about politics. It is about the power of technology and the influence and role of technology in life.  And we really have to think about how we use technology and the the leaders of technology companies have to think of themselves as cultural arbiters as much as they are technological arbiters.

Start time: 2219.70
End time: 2237.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But if you go back in history and you look at when newspapers started in the early 1900s and when television started in the 1950s and 60s, exactly the same things happened.  Everybody was hysterical about the fact that politicians were using the TV to reach out and publish ads.  And that's why you have the disclaimers at the bottom of every political ad.

Start time: 2238.34
End time: 2244.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but it was primitive. I mean, yes, at the time it was disruptive, but it was primitive compared to what people can do today.

Start time: 2245.30
End time: 2250.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And no, but it's still primitive. What we're seeing with Facebook and Twitter is relatively primitive.

Start time: 2250.46
End time: 2260.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, if you're I think what you're arguing for is is laws, is government restrictions, is regulations on this kind of stuff.

Start time: 2261.94
End time: 2287.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My point would be is that what we've seen is some fairly blunt and rather brutal sort of attempts to manipulate a population using a new tool before the before the system catches up.  OK, that has happened. And now you think the system will catch up, though?  I think we're seeing signs of it. So there I don't have any hope for that.  We've got articles in the show running list today about Facebook setting up literally war rooms with people to try and get this under control.

Start time: 2287.62
End time: 2304.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But blaming Facebook or Twitter is not at all addressing the problem. Those are just tools.  But we have an actor who's willing to use.  Before that we blamed radio.  So that's the point is that the tools change constantly and technology is giving them more and more impact.  But that's that's going to never go away.

Start time: 2305.32
End time: 2317.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not denigrating the effect, Leo. What I'm saying is that the system takes some time to catch up.  It takes time for people to adapt to the new situation and be able to decipher what is false information and what is genuine information.

Start time: 2318.56

Transcript:  No, I think people are dumb and it's going to take a good five to ten years.  I mean, look at some of those political ads coming out of the deep south in the US.

Transcript:  I'm optimistic about the fundamental tenets of democracy, and I'm optimistic about humans as optimists as well.  We want the best.  Yes, I agree.  And we see this as an anecdote you probably have heard or experienced a million times, but you can flame online pretty easily.  If we look at Reddit or YouTube comments, it's pretty easy to see the flames.  But when we talk to each other in person, it's a lot harder because we empathize with each other.  And so my optimism comes from our humanity.  I'm not particularly optimistic about our algorithmic future, at least in the short term.  I think it will take more than policy.  Look, I empathize. I'm on every single one of these calls with Zuckerberg and Glauser, and I empathize with them.  Social media, many of us advocated in the early days as democratization of the dissemination of information.  But we have reached an inflection point where social media is potentially causing more harm than good.  I think it is cop out to point a finger and say that it is you, Zuckerberg, or Jack, it's your fault.  I do think that technology companies look to the other way.  In fact, we saw Mark Zuckerberg say this in 2016.  It's ridiculous that anyone would use our platform for these types of purposes.  And now, of course, Facebook has done 180 on that.  But I also think that it is pretty easy to say it's their fault, not our fault.  The thing that we need to do is slow down, maybe stop using social media or use it less or react slower and just be cool to each other.

You're tech savvy.  And if you have solutions or if you have thoughts on particular solutions, particularly not just about election hacking, again, this has nothing to do with politics.  It's everything to do with the role of technology in our life.  But if you have thoughts, I'd really like to hear from you.  We will take these seriously.  We will, I guarantee you, we will take this into the newsroom at CBS News and examine particular solutions.  And once again, this audience knows tech better than almost any audience.

So everything that you've talked about here applies equally to Germany, to the UK,  but also to places you probably aren't thinking about like Indonesia and China.  I mean, what is happening with social media in China?  Is it controlled by the government?  And then you've got moral questions about do we have a responsibility to interfere in other countries' operations?  And at the same time, keep in mind that on one hand, Facebook is being slammed by the US government and by US citizens.  But at the same time, the UK government's coming after them, as well as the European government,  as well as the Australian government and so on and so forth.  So it is actually a complicated issue.  But quite honestly, Facebook's going to get everything it deserves.

I know, because I've told our audiences many times and I'm sorry for repeating it, but I don't know I think these guys know.  I am completely off Facebook and Twitter and Instagram and I've never felt better.

Transcript:  It was great.  It's about like 800 tweets.  A guy named Morgan Knutson who was a designer and he's now I think he's done a couple of startups.  He's now an angel investor so he can speak freely.  He says now the Google plus has been shuttered.  That's a little premature.  It actually doesn't go out of business till August, although I feel like it's pretty much done.  I should air my dirty laundry on how awful the project and the executive team was.  I'm still pissed about the bait and switch.  He apparently was hired at Google.  They said you're going to work on Chrome.  And then they said, oh, by the way, no, you're working on Google+.  Putting me on this God forsaken piece of poop on day one.  He's very critical of the organization.  He's you know, he says some good things.  He said Andy Hertzfeld was there.  The guy's a god.  It was amazing.  But he said that the real problem was well, Sundar Pichai, the guy who was in charge of Google+,  he says Google plus was situated in the main building.  Nineteen hundred a floor away from Larry's office.  Larry Page, the CEO.  If you're one of the twelve thousand people at Google in Mountain View who didn't work on plus,  you didn't have access to those floors.  Page didn't just have an office.  The entire floor was his.  We all had access to it, but we're encouraged to use it sparingly.  A war room here and there.  We had access to his cafe to a super fancy vegan cafe called Cloud.  Have you been to Cloud?  No.  Who that wouldn't be sustainable in the real world.  But the reason was he says, why this exclusivity?  What made Google plus so special?  Why was it so held so close to Google's chest?  I'll find out later.  The senior vice president of plus uses cloud to swing all of this.  His name was Vic Gundotra.  He was relatively charismatic.  I remember him frequently flirting with the women on the team.  Gave me a compounded horrible impression of him.  He says, I worked there eight months.  Vic never said one word to me.  No, hello.  No, goodbye.  No, thanks for staying late.  No handshake.  Not even any eye contact.  Vic's product vision was fear based.  Google built the Knowledge Graph and Facebook has swooped in and built the Social Graph.  And if Google doesn't own the Social Graph, then we can't claim to have indexed all the world's data.  It made sense at the time.  So much so that as we know, Google was giving people bonuses based on the success of Google plus.  If your team, say Android or Gmail, was to integrate Google plus features, then you would get a one and a half to three times multiplier on top of your yearly bonus.

And the CEO gets a hard on for a particular project or a senior executive decides that this is going to be his road to the top.  And you know what?  The road to the top might not actually be inside the company he's working for.  It might be a project that he could put on his resume and carry over to the next company and say, look, I did this.  You should hire me for five times what I'm currently earning.  Nothing in this rant strikes me as anything but like, sure, whatever.  Sounds normal.

Transcript:  Business as usual in a big American company.  He does.  Knudsen writes, I had the comment and I want to make sure we say this.  Common thread between ninety nine point eight percent of the people that I interacted with at Google as they were ethical, highly intelligent and hardworking.  I had a lot of admiration and respect for many of them.  But this team that he was on, this Google plus team was horrifically dysfunctional.  Furthermore, there was the kind of dysfunction that we saw at Microsoft that I think has been fixed since where different fiefdoms would basically say our success is is paramount.  Your success just gets in our way.  He talks about designing a way to get chat into Google plus.  And he's he said the whole vision was my vision was to integrate Google's other apps into this sidebar navigation.  He did it.  He approached the guy over at Gmail and the Gmail guy said, are you kidding?  We're trying to put this in Gmail.  If we let you do this from Google plus, it's going to make us look bad.  Google IOs coming up the hell with that.  We're not doing it.  And that's you see that all the time in these kinds of big corporations where different product lines basically.  Basically, I mean, for years, Office and Windows sabotaged each other at Microsoft.  But you make a good point, Greg.  This is this is normal.

I've worked in various dot com companies since 1998 and I've seen people come in and throw around the ego and the big words and spend up big on these projects.  And I've worked with plenty of dysfunctional projects where this is not new to me.  The challenge here is that when companies are just awash with cash like this, this sort of stuff happens and nobody notices or cares.  And this is happening, I think, right the way through Silicon Valley.  These companies have so much money, even like startups who run around complaining how little money they have.  I tell you what, you want to run a small business in the backwoods of Australia or the US.  And I promise you, you'll discover what a lack of cash is.

Transcript:  Yeah, so they think.  But, you know, like that's not the story, but we'll get to that story.  That's just so much amazing money that this sort of dysfunction becomes institutionalized because you can throw away these projects.  And remember how Google used to just let people work on stuff and they'd go off and work.  And then suddenly a group of people would come up with an idea and they'd spend two years working on something that had no purpose and no point.  That's what this is. No big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that was that was reported by the Wall Street Journal, I believe.  And it was kind of kind of quoting some bankers.  So, you know, a little bit of grains of salt with that.  You know, and another thing that kind of interests me about Uber a little bit more is that their CEO, Dana, can't remember his last name, mentioned that you can remember.

Transcript:  The business would be scooters and bikes.  Yeah. Uber owns Lime.  And they also have like this jump electric bike company.  So they're kind of expanding their like breadth a little bit.  One hundred twenty billion seems a little bit crazy to me because there's quite a bit of competition and that that, you know, that Moats and Castles thing isn't really too, too deep.  You know, Lime in particular on that side is very strong.  You know, Lyft and and there's a ton of other like smaller car sharing companies.  So I don't see it a hundred billion valuation for Uber.  It seems a little bit crazy.  They were talking in the 50 to 70 previously.  So I think that's probably a little bit more realistic.  But, you know, I'm not I'm not a banker.

Start time: 3407.52
End time: 3422.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It strikes me that the valuation, certainly the amount of money they've raised and then if this if they have some inflated valuation at an IPO is not for their current business, the ride sharing business, but it is all about the future of Uber with the self-driving car business.  Right.

Start time: 3423.26
End time: 3439.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Absolutely. So think of Uber as Netflix of, you know, way back when we were still sending CDs out.  Uber has no plans in the future to have humans or meat in their vehicles.  They're all about self-driving.

They are a data analysis firm and they work with law enforcement.  So, I mean, we can just say data, right?  And they have some of the smartest people in data.  They're also a very tough egg to crack, but just on the IPO train.  They're very secretive. Extremely secretive.  Yeah. For a company that we have almost no visibility into, a 40 billion dollar IPO seems staggering.  Yeah.

Transcript:  They allocate funds to that because I feel that the return on investment would be there.  This is this is exactly.  And the trick here is that back when Hollywood was making way too much money back in the 50s and 60s,  they basically couldn't stuff enough cash in their shirt to get they were able to do stupid things.  Look at all the different crazy movies that they made in the 50s, 60s and 70s that made no sense.  And that's what Silicon Valley is doing. Same sort of thing.

Transcript:  On the one hand, I love it because you can just get one and scoot somewhere.  Yeah. Yeah. Great city for it except for the problem.  A little dangerous in a city that is built around autos. Right.  But the problem is so San Francisco had this problem that all these companies,  including Uber's Lime, came in and just dump scooters like big trucks pulled up and just  they threw scooters on the streets and it was a mess.  So they banned them all and they said, we're going to pick two.  On Monday, they picked Skip and Scoot, which somebody I think Heather Haman in the radio show said,  sounds like Cavanaugh's drinking buddies, but Skip and Scoot and then Lime got so pissed off,  they went to the court and tried to get an injunction. And then, yeah.  But the court said no. The city has a right to do this.  Are you, is Electric going to cover scooters? Oh, we cover scooters quite a bit.

And the scooters literally, when I was first arrived, there was no scooters.  And then all of a sudden there was this litter in the shape of a scooter all over the streets.  And they were literally just being abandoned in the most interesting places.  Lisbon does have a bit of a problem with youth and graffiti and stuff.  And so there's quite a few of them sitting in that water where people are just tossed about.  Same thing happened in San Francisco. And I think it's happened in LA.

I don't know if sharing is going to eventually end up being the way to go.  These scooters are getting so light and foldable that you can almost carry it with you, plug it in at your desk.

It goes from Santa Rosa to San Rafael.  And it was a huge expense. But it's fabulous.  This is a nice light rail. You get on this smart train.  So he scooters to the smart train.  Gets in the smart train. You can put your bike or scooter there.  Gets off. Scooters another, I think it's about a mile to school.  It's the greatest thing ever. But he has his own scooter. He's not running.  So at one point, Lime scooters, actually this became a big issue, screened, unlock me or I'll call the police when they're touched.  And this was a big problem in San Francisco.  A female voice from within Lime's e-scooters shout the threat to anyone who tries to fiddle with them without downloading the app and paying.  The companies also set their rights to blast cartoonish robot noises so loud that heads turn on busy streets.

Transcript:  I won't drive a nice car anymore.  That's it's out right out for me.  I'm trying to get my wife out of them.  Anyway, great to have all three of you are show today.  Yes, this is where I monetize.  Actually, we have great sponsors and I love each and every one of them.  This and one of the things we try to do with our sponsors is pick companies we use and work with.  And in this case, ZipRecruiter, man, we had an amazing experience.  So ZipRecruiter is it's not a job site.  Exactly. It's a one place you go to post your job listing and get it on 100 job sites on Twitter, on Facebook.  But it does even more because what ZipRecruiter does is it actually brings you candidates.  That's smart. It's not go to a job site and wait for a candidate to apply to your job.  That's not smart.  Go to ZipRecruiter.com slash twit and the right person will get in touch because ZipRecruiter doesn't depend on the candidates finding you.  It finds them for you. It uses powerful matching technology.  Once you put your listing up there, it scans thousands of resumes, identifies people who have the skills, the education, the experience for your job, and then says to them, hey, I got a great job for you.  Actively invites them to apply. So you get qualified candidates fast.  We know this. About two months ago, our accounting manager, our bookkeeper quit, gave us two weeks notice.  Now, Lisa, my wife, who runs the company, has a lot of experience.  She's been controller of big companies so she can do it.  But she's going, I have a million things to do that are more important. I don't want to have to keep.  But I got to hire somebody. This is the problem is you're down a person and you've got to do the hiring and it's just twice as much work.  She was really kind of in the dumps. This is at breakfast. I'm saying, well, Lisa, ZipRecruiter, she posted on ZipRecruiter before lunch.  She starts getting candidates and she's looking at each one and go, wow, this person's great. This person's even better.  Fabulous. Before lunch, we had three or four applicants. That's how fast it was.  On average, you're going to have at least one highly qualified applicant within the first 24 hours. I'd say it's even faster than that.  That's why ZipRecruiter is number one with employers in the U.S. This is from TrustPilot. Over a thousand reviews.  Number one, it is a fantastic system. All the applicants go into the ZipRecruiter interface.  It's making it very easy to rank them, screen them and hire the right person fast. You can have screening questions.  They reformat all the resumes so it's easy to scan through them. It is a really great applique.  And you see all the companies that use ZipRecruiter, some of the biggest companies in the world, including Twit.  It really, it made Lisa very happy. And we got that person hired fast. You could do the same.  Try it free at ZipRecruiter.com slash Twit. Yeah, free.  ZipRecruiter.com slash Twit. ZipRecruiter.com slash Twit for your free trial.  ZipRecruiter is the smartest way to hire.  Let's see here. So many things to talk about.  Invitations went out to an Apple event in your neck of the woods, Seth. It's going to be in New York this time.

Transcript:  Oh, I didn't get one. We're now on the poopy list. Are you on the poopy list? 9 to 5 Mac?  Are you kidding? You know how we did the we released the Apple Watch 4 and the iPhones.  You told people about you. Yeah, we had this. We had the we had all of it. Yeah.  Our invitations didn't come for that event and then our invitations never again.  So we're kind of on the bad boy list. I'm on that list.

Start time: 4520.29
End time: 4587.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't really care. Although this time they did something really interesting.  They made different Apple logos, like dozens of them, for these invitations.  I mean, I don't know how many, but there are so many of them.  And the event invitations all say the same thing, which is, you know, I don't know, come help us spend customers money.  Well, I like that one. That's iron filings. It looks like that's cool. Look at all of them.  This is from the verge. They collected as many as they could.  It is clearly going to be it's October 30th, which is funny because OnePlus was going to have their event on October 30th,  announcing the new OnePlus 16. Whoops. So they moved it a day earlier.  You don't really want to be at the same time. It's going to be early in the morning.  I'm going to come in here and do it for us on the West Coast. 7 a.m. Pacific. That's 10 a.m. Eastern, October 30th.  It's almost certain it'll be at least new iPads and iPad Pros, probably bezel lists with no home button.  You guys probably have all you probably have seen them. You've held them. You know all about them, right?

Start time: 4588.84
End time: 4599.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We haven't touched them, but we've heard quite a bit about them.  And they're going to have the face ID as well. And what's kind of cool, and I think you'll appreciate this, Leo, is I think they're going to have USB-C.

Start time: 4600.28
End time: 4604.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a real shock. I've seen that rumor. They're going to abandon the lightning port?

Start time: 4605.68
End time: 4614.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know if they're going to abandon it on this particular device. I think they're going to have both.  Both?  Yeah, super interesting for Apple, right? Yeah.

Start time: 4615.80
End time: 4649.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they have to. I think you're right, Seth, because logically everybody's got lightning connectors and lightning accessories,  you know, lightning to SD cards and lightning headphones and all sorts of things.  If they suddenly switched over to USB, and keep in mind that a lot of those USB connectors that you need to plug into all the accessories that you've got is actually a big deal.  I do think that that might be possible. It would be huge. Most phones now are type C, except for Apple.  And there is a European directive to drive them to force them to use USB-C.

Start time: 4651.52
End time: 4700.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What's so interesting is not just the money and time that Apple spent converting their audience from their consumers from the 30 pin to the new connectors,  but by all accounts they were pushing for wireless to be the replacement. We're not going to USB-C. Instead, we're going to wireless.  No connect. That would be courage.  That would be courage.  But to abandon that, and it appears as though the charging pads are nowhere to be seen.  And to abandon that for USB-C is some sort of corporate machination happened behind the scene where they abandoned in one direction and are now pushing in this interesting USB-C direction.

Start time: 4701.94
End time: 4712.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow. So I had heard the rumor they would do USB-C, but I did not know that people were thinking both lightning and USB-C on one device. That's interesting.

Start time: 4713.48
End time: 4743.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And we're hearing for USB-C that they're going to have like an export, or sorry, like a mirrored display out via USB-C.  So you can put up a 4K display, and then theoretically you have a Bluetooth keyboard or whatever kind of keyboard and mouse.  And if there's a mouse, then all of a sudden you have a cursor on the iPad and all these like,  computery things start happening and then all of a sudden Apple's not making Macs anymore. They're making iPads.

Start time: 4744.38
End time: 4748.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and I think that we've been thinking that that was the tenor of the company.

Start time: 4749.46
End time: 4750.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is the next step in that.

Start time: 4751.86
End time: 4779.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is very interesting. Yeah, I mean, after all, we all saw the ad where the girl's running around with her iPad.  And finally her dad says, okay, time to put away the PC. And she says, what's a PC?  And what's a computer?  Maybe what's a computer? Maybe we want to slug her.  Because I like Macs. I don't want to lose Macintosh.  The big stopping point, the one thing that Apple has to solve is you need a Mac to develop apps for the iOS.

Start time: 4781.18
End time: 4798.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and it's also kind of interesting that now you can get Microsoft Office for iPad.  You can get now Adobe Photoshop coming for iPad.  Isn't that interesting?  But you can't get Final Cut Pro, Apple's own, and you can't get Xcode and you can't get any of their Pro apps for iPad,  which is like, what is going on there?

Start time: 4802.30

Start time: 4808.46
End time: 4823.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What about the Mac? Does that mean there's, because one thing that Mac aficionados like me are holding out for is an updated MacBook or MacBook Air or a Mac Mini.  Any chance we'll see those announcements?

Start time: 4823.38
End time: 4844.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think there's going to be a big Mac portion of this event.  I don't know if there's going to be a Mini, like what it's been like five years or something.  That's ridiculous.  You know, it kind of feels like the headless Mac is, you know, long gone, but it would be nice to get a Mac Mini and Apple has promised a Mac Pro next year.  Right.

Start time: 4845.54

Transcript:  But the Mac Mini is very important for the education market.  Apple's losing a lot of share to the Chromebooks in particular.

Start time: 4890.06
End time: 4895.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that because of price or because it's compact, it's headless as Seth said?  Why Mac Mini?

Start time: 4896.36
End time: 4950.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The advantage of the Chromebook in the education.  I spoke to a number of IT CIOs of schools a couple of years ago about it and they said, first of all, Chromebooks are cheap.  They can buy them for two to three hundred pounds.  Apple has nothing in that price range.  But in terms of maintaining them, they blow the pants off iPads because a Chromebook, you just sign it up and then the person logs in and then everything comes from Google.  So if you've got a kid, they file in, they pick a Chromebook up off the thing and then they sit down at the desk and away they go.  If that Chromebook flames out, they just put it on the pile to be repaired and pick up another one and log in and away they go.  So Apple is very much losing ground with its software here compared to Google.  Google's winning the hearts and minds of schools very, very much so because you can get a classroom of laptops for under ten thousand dollars basically.  Right. Here's an interesting piece by Dave Smith in Business Insider.

Start time: 4952.14
End time: 4982.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's time for tech giants to retire the keynote.  Apple, Google and others are all making the same mistake with their product launches.  Dave says they're too long.  They're not very efficient.  It would make so much more sense to do these online.  And because tech companies can't keep a secret.  And we saw this with Google's event.  There was nothing, nothing for Google to say that we didn't already know.  I suspect that may be true for Apple's event on the 30th.  He says keynote should evolve into online debuts.  You agree, Dan Patterson?

Start time: 4983.42
End time: 5061.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that particularly given the challenges experienced by nearly every major tech company,  in the last 18 months or so, look, there was excitement in a more naive era.  But we've obviously transitioned into a different time.  And these big boastful hubristic events communicate a hubris that is hard for many people to relate to.  And we need a dose of technology to do that.  We need a dose of humility right now from technology firms that have invaded our lives with products and data  that has arguably made life less fun and showing off.  Hey, look at our big fancy products, especially when we're long overdue for a recession, is maybe a misstep.  I might be wrong about that.  And I certainly love getting excited about technology products.  And I kind of long for the days where these were few and far between.  But I think these companies run the risk of appearing too big and alienating their consumers or seeming out of touch from their consumers.  What do you think, Seth?

Start time: 5063.02
End time: 5065.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the purpose of a keynote has kind of evolved a little bit.

Start time: 5067.36
End time: 5107.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the Steve Jobs Apple keynote was kind of like the, I guess, the one to model yourself after.  And you would actually learn quite a bit about the product.  Like if you remember the iPhone keynote, he explained how the scrolling worked.  Because this was a new UX language.  Nobody had seen anything like this before.  And show after show, you would kind of learn how the new stuff worked.  And it was kind of like a big, this is it.  This is what you're going to be learning for the next six months.  It was also very valuable because Apple could position stuff.  Right.

Start time: 5108.08
End time: 5128.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So not only would they say this is what it does and how it does it, but it's a very valuable tool.  This is what it does and how it does it.  But they could, you know, it's an iPhone.  It's a phone. It's an internet communicator.  It's an iPod. It's an iPod. It's a communicator phone.  He really set the language for what these new devices were.

Start time: 5129.14
End time: 5154.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And, you know, I don't know if, in particular with Apple, I don't know if it's that their products aren't as, you know, motivational.  Novel?  Novel's a good word, yeah.  Yeah, I mean, you know, the new iPhones, they're just like the iPhone X.  They're kind of like the old iPhones.  Yeah, and the camera's a little better.  And, you know, the watch screen is a little bit bigger and, you know, the keynote's over.  Go home.

Start time: 5155.68
End time: 5182.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do agree with you, Dan, that I don't see, in the tech community, we're all excited about these.  And boy, do these companies get a lot of coverage.  We actually stream them and comment on them.  And it's a great way to get press.  That's why OnePlus is moving its event, right?  There's a lot of attention on these, especially on Apple events, even if there's nothing novel to announce.  But I do think you made an interesting point, Dan, that maybe the general public is going to start looking askance at these.

Start time: 5184.35
End time: 5229.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think the general public has already started doing that.  And it can appear tone deaf to have a bunch of incredibly affluent people stand up on stage and present devices that are well out of your budget and say, look at this fantastic thing.  We might change your life, but it's probably going to be the same as the thing already in your pocket, but cost you more money.  This is not me poo-pooing these events, but I think that we are simply in a different era.  We don't need to have these this new language explained to us anymore.  We all all understand this intuitively how to use our devices and what they do and the benefits that they can bring to our lives.  We understand.

End time: 5307.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I think I think there's a difference here between what Apple does.  And I think Apple gets it for more or less right.  They save for keynotes.  They bring very visual things and they tell stories and they do it reasonably well, but they also don't hold a keynote for everything.  It's not like sometimes they'll introduce minor refreshes of an iPad, but they don't hold a keynote for it and make a big press event out of that.  They generally have something to say.  The challenge here is when Google stands up and announces the Pixel 3, which nobody buys and nobody uses and nobody should reasonably care about.  But somehow the press has gone around it like flies around a can of poop and treated it like it's the next Nirvana and is the alternative to the iPhone.  But the Pixel 3 is literally going to sell as many phones in a year as I as many iPhone.  It'll sell in a year.  The number of phones that Apple sells in five days.  Nobody should be commenting about the Pixel 3.  The challenge here is that the media industry is chasing after the wrong thing.  They see Apple doing a media event.  They give it the coverage.  So when somebody else does a media event, they give it the same level of coverage without qualifying it.  They should be backing off from it and saying Google's going to announce a phone that nobody buys.  I should not be covering that.  It's not a big story.

Transcript:  I have a data point along that line because I used to do every Friday morning.  I would talk to the big morning show in Los Angeles on KFI about stuff.  And I was just told, let's stop talking about product releases.  We want to talk about philosophy.  We want to talk about spigger stories.  And in fact, I remember I never wanted to cover cell phones and gadgets,  but I felt forced into it by the huge interest and demand for that.  Well, I think it's now shifting and it's gone away again.  I think that's very interesting.

Start time: 5345.00
End time: 5355.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think we're seeing the end of the product releases because it's become tedious.  But it's also cheap journalism.  Get a product, hold it up.  What's the color of it?  How good's the camera?  I resent that.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, isn't that funny?  There's still a notch, but there's still a notch.  There's a bigger bezel.  Quite a bit bigger if you look at it.  Oh, that's interesting.  Now, here's the question.  And people care about that?  Well, they might because this isn't that much cheaper.  It's $750 for the 64 gig.  So it's a really expensive phone.  It's pretty expensive.  A couple years ago, that was flagship.  Yeah.  So, I mean, if you're getting it for $500, you might say, well, who cares?  Sure.  Hmm, that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's where it's at.  Scooters and Teslas.  They're the future.  All right.  Let's take a break and then we'll talk about Google's plan to screw the EU.  I got something you'll be interested in.  My friend, David Friend, who was the CEO of Carbonite and his partner at Carbonite, Jeff  Flowers, are very clever guys.  While I'm sure they're still on the board at Carbonite, they realized they had a little  bit of free time and they had also some really amazing technology that had allowed them to,  in the days of Carbonite, store stuff really fast, really efficiently on hard drives.  It was really the core technology, the patented technology that made Carbonite happen.  They said, you know, we shouldn't let this technology just be for Carbonite.  What if we made this hot cloud storage and Wasabi was born?  Wasabi, hot cloud storage.  By the way, this is in business, as you know, is a huge issue right now.  According to, I guess, IDC, one of the analysts, there will be an estimated, I can't believe  this, 163 zettabytes of data storage by 2025.  That's 21 zeros.  That's a crazy amount of data.  We're storing it in the cloud and we're storing it essentially at three big companies.  But there's a better way, Wasabi.  If you're looking at hot cloud storage right now, I want you to add a fourth company to  the list that you're looking at.  Wasabi results in storage thanks to this technology that's 80% cheaper and six times faster than  S3.  Plus, they don't charge for egress, free unlimited egress.  They just have one basic tier of service.  It's completely secure.  In fact, really, I think you can make the case that it's more secure than your on-prem  storage.  It's HIPAA compliant, FINRA compliant, CJIS compliant, 80% less than S3, six times faster  with 11 nines of data durability.  To add to that, they've created a category of immutable storage.  Storage you say, I don't want this ever to change.  It is protected against accidental or malicious deletions or modifications.  It's immutable.  They have something called the Wasabi Ball that allows you to quickly migrate petabytes  of data directly to the Wasabi cloud.  It is hot.  W-A-S-A-B-I, Wasabi, just like Wasabi, but it's cloud storage.  It's not hot radish.  If you go to wasabi.com, you click the free trial link and use the code TWIT, you'll get  a month of unlimited storage for free so you can test it.  When you see the price and when you go to your boss and say, look, we're going to save  80% and it's six times faster and it's 11 nines durable and it's got free egress, no  charge for API calls, immutable storage.  I think I think you're going to see it is a great choice.  Oh, by the way, it's fully S3 API compliant.  So if you've already got S3 stuff that you're using, don't worry, it'll all work.  Wasabi, I really I love these guys.  David and Jeff are brilliant.  And I think they've they've done it again.  And that's why I'm really happy to tell you about Wasabi.  Try it right now.  Put it on your list wasabi.com.  Don't forget the offer code TWIT so they know about where you heard it.

Transcript:  Ah, this is a segment of the market that's absolutely white hot.  There's over 70 storage startups in enterprise IT.  That's just startups.  In addition to the 15 to 20 odd billion dollar plus established players in this  market, it's just a, it's just a vital.  There's so many different ways to store your data these days.  It's amazing.

Start time: 5875.82
End time: 5885.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think you would agree that in most cases, these, these are more secure than  your on prem storage.  And, you know, most of the time people got a couple of drives in the closet.

Start time: 5886.80
End time: 5910.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, it's complicated.  Uh, it can certainly be much better.  The, the actual arrays are much more, the data storage is much more reliable and  stable.  The challenge here is that a lot of people put data in the cloud, but then  forget to back it up.  Right.  It's kind of, you put it in the cloud.  Yes, it's safe, but the challenge is.  You got to have more than one copy.  If somebody corrupts the data.  Yeah.  Somebody corrupts the copy.  How do you get back to with the uncorrupted copy?

Start time: 5912.14
End time: 5977.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I always talk about this when we talk about backup, because what people do is  they label the drive backup.  They copy the data to it.  They say, oh, it's backed up.  And then delete the original.  It's like, no, it's not backed up.  That's not backed up.  Just cause it's on a drive called backup.  Does not make it backed up.  No.  So Google is getting, I think this is one of those screw you moments.  Remember that the EU find Google, what was it?  $5 billion antitrust fine.  And one of the things they said is, you know, one of the things Google did wrong  was they were telling companies that wanted the Google apps on their Android  devices, okay, but you can't make non, you know, you can't make AOSP devices.  You have to make all Google devices.  You have to include Chrome and Google search.  And, and the EU said, no, you can't do that anymore.  So Google said, okay, but that was how we made money.  So now if, if OEMs in Europe want to put Android, what put Google services on  Android, we're going to charge them as much as $40 a phone.  Screw you Europe.

Start time: 5979.46
End time: 5992.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Microsoft did with an internet explorer when they unbundled.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We'll charge you.  I mean, $5 billion is not a bad taxation game.  I want it still cheaper than paying the tax they should have paid for the last 15  years, but it is a significant increase.

Start time: 5992.26
End time: 5995.48

End time: 6010.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think anybody cares because over here, people buy the phones outright.  They don't rent them from their carriers.  It's very getting increasingly uncommon to actually buy them as part of a package  like a pay per month.

Transcript:  The good part about this is though it does give Android users the chance to put  other apps on it.  Microsoft will be pleased because they can now start developing apps for the Android  phone and might be able to get them on there.  The challenge here, of course, is that the Google Play Store is a train spash.  It's insecure.  It's full of rubbish.  It's hard to hate Android.  Don't you?  I really do.  Yeah.  Like I tried.  I did.  I'm with Seth.  I really like my Pixel 3.

Start time: 6074.65
End time: 6099.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah.  So there is actually a little bit of that EU settlement that kind of went under the  radar a little bit, but it's actually a big deal.  And that's that Google used to say to like Samsung or LG or whatever, if you want to  use the Google Play Store, which you have to use for Google Maps and like a lot of  important apps, you can't put anything else on your phones, on any kind of phones  across like your line of stuff.

Start time: 6099.56
End time: 6105.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't wait a minute.  But Samsung does.  They have the Samsung versions of many of the Google apps.  You're not talking about that.

Start time: 6106.52
End time: 6141.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, they I mean, Samsung and LG have their own stores, but there's always the Google  you have to have all the Google stuff on every single Samsung device.  You can't sell a non-Google phone.  Right.  I mean, an Android non-Google phone.  Right.  Yeah.  AOSP.  Yeah.  Open source.  Now part of the, the ruling was that Google can't enforce that.  So if somebody wants to put Play Store on the Galaxy, you know, S10s and they don't  want to put them on the low cost ones or whatever, Samsung can do that now.  So that, that actually kind of.

Start time: 6142.02
End time: 6165.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, think about Amazon.  Amazon sells Android stuff, but it's not Google Android stuff.  It's, it's, it's de-Googled.  They made a phone that was nobody bought because it was de-Googled.  Now Android could Amazon.  Well, actually not now because they're not in the EU, but if in the EU, anyway, a  company could make both, they can make a Fire Phone and a Google phone.  Which was never allowed before.

Start time: 6166.43
End time: 6202.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  And, and, um, you know, in the U S, uh, Amazon was kind of forced, uh, cause they  sell like prime special phones, um, that used to have the Amazon Play Store, um, as  the default, you know, apps, you know, where you get your apps and they actually had to  revert that, um, to, to a different setup because Google was saying, look, if this  manufacturer does this, we're not going to let them do any of any Play Store stuff.  So it had that been the EU in present day, they wouldn't be able to enforce that.  But we're in America and we don't have any kind of rule like that.  Bless it.

Start time: 6203.80
End time: 6218.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  God bless it.  It does feel a little bit like Google saying, oh, well screw you EU.  We're going to just charge you, charge you, but you know, in a way, their  explanation is reasonable.  Yeah.  You took away some of our revenue opportunities.  We got to make it up.  The cost.

Start time: 6219.14
End time: 6227.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, it's not like Google suffering for cash, right?  So it is a desperately greedy move to demand that I want my $40 per phone.  Well, it's as little as two 50.

Start time: 6227.64
End time: 6231.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 6232.22
End time: 6249.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just one of these situations where companies that are like making vast wads  of cash for almost zero effort and they still want their cash.  Um, this is Ebenezer Scrooge right in action.  They could give away that and just go, right, whatever.  Fine.  And there is some effort behind it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, uh, Seth, have you noticed, I won't ask Greg cause he doesn't use a pixel  three, but I noticed this when I was playing Pokemon go in the city, that  every time I launched the camera, cause I was ostensibly in San Francisco to take  pictures to, to test the Google's camera and the pixel three, but, but I happened  to be playing Pokemon go in between.  Every time I launched the camera would kill Pokemon go.  There's something going on with multitasking.

Start time: 6277.01
End time: 6297.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  So there's a couple of things.  Uh, one is the, like for whatever reason, the foreground app is using it.  It it's the only, yeah, the, the only part of the app that's kind of protected.  So if, if it's not in the foreground, uh, kind of all bets are off.  And I think this is a temporary problem.  I think Google is going to go back.

Start time: 6297.22
End time: 6312.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Intentional for battery life.  Cause I mean, we've come and gone on this for a long time.  Um, Apple didn't allow background tasks at all.  You couldn't have a Spotify running in the background because they wanted to  save that because that's a real drain on battery.

Start time: 6312.50
End time: 6320.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Start time: 6321.46
End time: 6356.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It seems unceremoniously closed the background application.  Right.  Yeah.  So maybe it's a bug, something certainly Google could change.  Um, I think people notice it mostly with music apps, cause you're  listening to music in the background.  And you launch the camera and the music stops.  Uh, according, uh, this is from Android police.  They said in our own tests, more than three, if you have more than three to  four apps running, you'll run out of memory and background apps will be closed.  Do you think the problem is that they just didn't, they have, it's a four gig  phone, which seems like four gigs should be plenty, four gigs should be enough

Start time: 6356.24
End time: 6362.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  for at least a few apps open.  And they compared that to the, the one plus and the, um, and something else.  And the one plus is six.

Start time: 6364.18
End time: 6385.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  And there is a, you can get a note if you want to spend a lot of money on the note  nine, you can get an eight gig flavor.  Right.  I don't, I think that that's more up to Google and this may be a, a  bad memory management choice.  I agree.  And that they could fix that.  I don't think four gigs.  That seems like an awful, what does the iPhone have?  No one knows, but I think it's like two gigs.

Start time: 6386.18
End time: 6392.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Transcript:  But they also do a better job of managing memory.  Right.  Uh, they have the dedicated processes in there for memory management.  Uh, they'd have memory expand.  We think there's memory expanders on the onboard socks that they've programmed  into the arm chips to make it more viable.  And they've also done a lot with their own, um, with the X code  stuff to make it efficient.  Their memory handlers are better than, um, Android because Android is written  in Java, you're kind of screwed.

You know, I remember, I remember last time I was on the show is sort of  highlighting the fact that Intel hasn't really advanced following the market.  They've gone down a path and sort of tried to drag the market along with them.  And this is kind of a hint that that's actually something that we're seeing.

And, you know, we could go and look at cars and argue over a V6 versus a  four speed with a turbocharger and, you know, you buy whatever you buy.  But I think the main thing to keep in mind is that you only want to keep it  for, I don't know, two to three years and then just don't waste too much of your  life picking out a phone that's only going to be around for 24 months.

Transcript:  Is the moral of this conversation, or at least the modern era of technology,  that it is the mobile era of technology is mature?  Is IoT the next thing?  I don't know about consumer IoT, but it seems as though there is a theme  running through all of these conversations.  And that is that which was once revolutionary and fantastic and really thrilled us,  maybe 10 years or so ago, is it's not necessarily bad.  It's just reached an apex and the lines no longer do the hockey stick of excitement  or of sales unless you were reaching the right market.  So are we even with processors, are we at a point where until we hit the next thing,  and I won't say quantum with any bit of seriousness, but are we in the next era  of computing or at least at the pinnacle of the mobile era of computing?

Yeah. Well, as wearables as wearables IoT, I don't know.  I don't know. I think it feels like the next.  Now, I played with the Magic Leap last week and I think I fell for it.  No, it's the same stupid.  So at the time, I'm all excited.  The same thing happened to me with the Oculus Rift.  Oh, this is great.  In the HoloLens three years ago.  This is going to change the world.  It's so exciting.  But then as I'm thinking about it, it was a fairly anemic experience.  And I mean that almost literally the images are washed out and watery.  And it didn't.  It wasn't really.  Honestly, I don't.  It's not going to change the world as it stands.

All right, I am going to show you the most exciting, the most exciting technological  revolution that has happened this week in a moment.  But first, I want to tell you what I'm having for dinner.  I actually I don't know.  I know it's in the fridge.  I'm having Blue Apron.  Blue Apron is awesome.  We don't get the end of the day.  This is a hard day for me.  I do the radio show, do Twitter.  I'm working hard.  I get home around six in the evening.  I'm starving.  I don't want to go shopping.  I don't want to do meal planning.  But thank God for Blue Apron.  Once a week, we get our Blue Apron delivery.  You choose three or four meals.  I got three meals in a box.  And I know Sunday night, I'm going to cook and I'm going to cook a Blue Apron meal.  Everything I need is there.  All the ingredients, exactly the right amounts.  If I need three tablespoons of soy sauce, there's a little bottle with three tablespoons of soy sauce.  There's no waste.  The recipes are great and they're easy to follow.  And they're just they're just delicious.  The best thing about Blue Apron for me is I get new ideas for things I'm going to make down the road.  I cook something or I use an ingredient I've never tried before.  Farro, speaking of Greg.  Farro, I'd never had Farro before.  Not Greg Farro, the other kind, the wheat Farro.  I cooked it the other day.  Blue Apron was amazing.  I'm going to buy it from now on.  So it broadens your horizons.  I really love Blue Apron, whether you're looking for quick and easy meals or a full  culinary cooking experience, Blue Apron lets you choose from a range of recipe options.  You go to the website, Blue Apron dot com slash twit.  And you can choose from the menus.  And they have some amazing dishes every week.  At least three recipes are designed with your schedule in mind where they've done the meal prep for you.  They've done the sauces, the spices and the ingredients.  So it's very quick and fast.  That's really that's something new.  And I love that.  Get rid of your grocery list.  Let Blue Apron do the meal prep for you as little as 20 minutes from getting home to sitting down.  And your family will love it.  They have Blue Apron for couples, Blue Aprons for families with kid friendly ingredients.  And the smell and the it's so much better than take out or don't go to the Olive Garden.  Just no one should ever go to the Olive Garden.  Just just make something.  And the house smells amazing.  The kids go, what's for dinner?  That sounds that smells incredible.  Even get them to help.  Get them to help. Learn them. Learn how to cook.  Get out of your cooking rut.  Experience the joy of chef designed recipes.  Restaurant quality meals better than that.  Tomato and basil pesto pizza with roasted cauliflower.  I can't do these ads because my mouth starts watering every single time.  Stir fried.  It sounds so good.  Stir fried sweet chili chicken with broccoli and rice.  You like steak. How about seared steaks and homemade homemade steak sauce with mashed potatoes and sauteed carrots.  Oh, seared beef dumplings and jasmine rice with sesame garlic bok choy salad.  Just so wonderful.  I love Blue Apron.  The other day we cooked.  It was so good.  It was a fettuccine with shrimp spicy shrimp.  It was a one pot meal was easy to cook and it was delicious.  Everybody ate it up.  The other day gnocchi and beef.  I can go on and on.  Skip meal planning. Get straight to cooking with Blue Apron.  I know you're tired at the end of the day.  Please don't go to Olive Garden.

Transcript:  You probably aren't using your real email address.  I would hope not.  What did you think, Leo, about the Bloomberg story this week?  I'm still all fired up about this one.  All right, we could talk about this one.  I think this is still, in fact, I'm sorry Dan's not here,

Start time: 7056.26
End time: 7133.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because I think this is still a hot topic.  And now the latest is that Tim Cook  is demanding a retraction.  So in case you missed it somehow, two weeks ago,  Bloomberg Businessweek, and they put this  on the cover of their print magazine,  declared that Supermicro had been  hacked at the factory.  I mean, they don't assert that Supermicro  knew this was going on, but that small rice-sized chips  have been placed on Supermicro motherboards  intended for companies like Amazon, Elemental, Apple,  the Department of Justice.  These motherboards are used to control drones.  And the Elemental system, which we use,  which is a streaming system, it was discovered apparently  by Amazon, and they were using it to control drones.  And they were using it to control the Amazon  during their security due diligence  before acquiring Elemental, which they have since done.  That this chips was on there,  what it would do when you booted,  the operating system would still secure boot, boot clean,  but after the boot, the chip would get enough  and modify the operating system, phone home.  It's believed it was the Chinese military  that were doing it.  I talked last week to Mark Millian,  who writes for Bloomberg Businessweek,  knows the authors of these articles.  Since the Obama administration for more than two years.

Start time: 7133.42
End time: 7141.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, they're not credible, Leo.  They're actually not.  They actually have a history of blowing up stories  that actually have no foundation in fact.  Well, tell me which stories.

Start time: 7142.42
End time: 7150.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People have been saying this,  but I wanna see those stories  and I wanna see what they got wrong,  because Mark said Jordan Richardson  is very, very technical.  Okay.

Start time: 7151.00
End time: 7174.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So NSA Heartbleed.  So back in 2014, there was a bug in OpenSSL.  OpenSSL, yeah.  And in theory, the NSA knew about that  and they wrote an article claiming that,  but that was complete falsehood.  And they never resolved from that position.  There's another one after that,  the author Jordan, what's his name?  The author of the original article.

Start time: 7174.34
End time: 7175.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's Michael Riley and Jordan Richardson.

Start time: 7176.50
End time: 7225.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and they've done it again in 2016.  They boot up a big one.  I can't think of the exact one right now,  cause it's getting a bit late.  And then they're doing it again in 2018.  And they're beating up a story that actually isn't true  and saying, I don't know,  but we were told by secret magic people  while we were eating mushrooms  down the back of the building,  that this is actually true.  There's no evidence here.  You could certainly make, in my view,  this is a story that I could tell you things  about possible security breaches,  and you could run away and tell a story like this.  But everybody in my community,  like I work in enterprise IT  and we actually look for this sort of stuff.  And yes, it's all theoretically possible,  but it's actually, no one's ever seen it in real life.  No one's ever seen it.  The Heartbleed story is interesting

Start time: 7226.90
End time: 7260.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because it is related in some ways.  Michael Riley, who wrote that,  was one of the authors on the Super Micro story.  He says, or he said in his article,  that the NSA was new about Heartbleed and used it.  But it's very similar because  the reason you're saying it's debunked  is because the NSA denied it and the government denied it.  There's no knowledge of whether they did or did not.  It's the same exact thing,  which is that the intelligence agency said,  no, we didn't do it.  Like, you believe them?

Start time: 7262.14
End time: 7271.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, but more importantly,  if they had have taken advantage of it,  someone somewhere in the world would have seen that.  And there's no signs of it ever being exploited  by the NSA in the world.  I think that's not credible.

Start time: 7272.02
End time: 7278.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that, for instance,  the NSA may have used it once in a targeted attack.  The NSA collects these not to use them in mass.

Start time: 7278.20
End time: 7285.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've never seen you go to the toilet,  therefore you never go to the toilet.  And that would also be true  because I've never seen you go to the toilet.  Well, that's what I'm pointing out

Start time: 7285.62
End time: 7294.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is that the NSA could very well have known about it.  There's no way to know that they know.  And you're saying that,  well, that we don't know that they ever used it.  Is it an approbative?  It's exactly what you just said.

Start time: 7294.54
End time: 7300.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's been comprehensively debunked over the years  by any number of government employees who said,

Start time: 7300.46

Start time: 7317.18
End time: 7321.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Transcript:  First of all, it's not the Daily Mail  we're talking about here.

Start time: 7326.44
End time: 7342.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So one of the sources said that,  hey, I did talk to Bloomberg  and I presented a couple of hypotheticals,  but I know where did I say that this was happening  or whatever.  Well, that was one of them, yeah.  I feel like that may be-  No, all of them, there's five of them.

Start time: 7343.76
End time: 7355.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Risky Business had a podcast  and he interviewed a couple more  and they were asked, would this be possible  and what would be the possible ways?  And they gave them some hypotheticals  and they're now being reported as fact  in the Bloomberg article.

Start time: 7356.84
End time: 7360.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I kind of feel like this is what's happened.  Yeah.  I don't and the only reason is

Start time: 7361.34
End time: 7382.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you've got a very respectable journalistic enterprise.  You've got an editor in chief  who came from The Economist who's highly respected,  who is intimately involved  in this two years worth of reporting and oversaw it.  Now I understand people don't like unknown sources,  but when you're talking about national security stories,  good luck getting somebody to talk  facing a lifetime in jail.  Right.  So-

Start time: 7382.84
End time: 7388.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me talk about it this way.  If I was trying to compromise a server,  I would not use a hardware implant.  The first thing I would do-

Start time: 7389.08
End time: 7394.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I acknowledge that.  And Supermicro especially had tons of firmware flaws.  There were all sorts of ways to do this.

Start time: 7395.42
End time: 7419.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so it's very easy to misinterpret a weakness  in the BMC and call it a hardware implant  because that's, and that would be false, right?  The second thing is,  even if you had an implant on the board,  and which case it would be easily found,  and like you would have to,  if they were manufactured onto the motherboard,  there would be hundreds of thousands  of these so-called implants somewhere in the world,  and no one can find them, not-  Yeah, that's gonna ultimately prove

Start time: 7419.75
End time: 7425.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the truth or the falsehood of this,  because somewhere somebody's gotta have  a Supermicro motherboard with this chip in it.

Start time: 7425.30
End time: 7442.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And people have been actively looking for these implants  for over five years, right?  As actively doing so.  The second question is,  how do you activate the implant?  So once you've got an implant sitting in the BMC,  how do you activate it?  How do you tell it what you wanna capture?  And then how do you exfiltrate it?  You've gotta make use of all these things.

Start time: 7443.56
End time: 7456.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Quite honestly, doing these things-  Wait a minute, now hold on there,  because we know that that is possible.  From the Snowden revelations,  we know the NSA had a modified ethernet port  that was able to do exactly this.

Start time: 7457.88
End time: 7470.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, what they actually did  was modified Cisco routers at the time.  Actually got into them and rehacked them.  Now that was back in an era  when technology was way less sophisticated.  That is in like the mid 2000s or so.

Start time: 7472.38
End time: 7475.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you're saying you couldn't do this today?

Start time: 7475.16
End time: 7515.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's incredibly difficult.  In theory, it's possible to do it, right?  In theory, it's possible to create an implant  that would be very hard to detect.  However, in reality, you've gotta activate the implant,  you've gotta program it in some way to give you data,  and then you've gotta exfiltrate.  So even if you had a motherboard that had an implant,  whether it was in the BMC or in the ethernet chip,  it still doesn't mean that it's actually a weakness  or a vulnerability because we put exfiltration controls.  You can't exfiltrate easily,  and the implants would be connected to a separate network.  That would usually imply that there's an implant  in the server and then you've gotta get somebody  on the inside to activate it.  Not very practical.

Start time: 7515.26
End time: 7521.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're saying that it would have been obvious,  even if this had been there,  that they were exfiltrating data,  they were somehow communicating with trans servers.

Start time: 7521.42
End time: 7538.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly, because if the hardware implant was in the BMC,  then you would be on the out of band network,  and when they tried to,  we go to a lot of trouble when we built these data centers,  so that even if the out of band network woke up  and started doing something, you would see it,  because you watch the out of band,  because that's the control engine.

Start time: 7539.04
End time: 7562.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  However, I gotta point out, there's no question at all  that these kinds of activities,  whether in hardware or software, occur all the time.  They occur in the supply chain,  and everybody's agreeing that,  and they've been going on for at least 10 years  in the supply chain,  and there's not much protection against that.  Well, Bruce Shire, or Brian Krebs said it,  he reported on something similar 10 years ago  on the Washington Post.

Start time: 7563.52
End time: 7571.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we've seen lots and lots of suggestions of it,  but we haven't actually seen too much evidence.  There's only been a few, and the IoT ones are the obvious ones.

Start time: 7571.94
End time: 7576.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm kind of surprised at how credulous you are,  that government agencies would tell the truth on this.

Start time: 7577.88
End time: 7605.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I suspect that the people who are telling the truth  are telling the truth.  I think this is a beat up by Bloomberg.  I do not believe that they actually have anything.  And what they've done is they've taken,  talking to security experts of what might happen  or what could happen,  and I've seen, or somebody got drunk and told them a big story,  and they've turned it into a beat up.  Now, it turns out that Bloomberg journalists  actually get paid when they move the market.  Yeah, that is a little unfortunate.

Start time: 7605.80
End time: 7607.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's a real problem.

Start time: 7607.32
End time: 7614.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's very difficult to believe  that these people have credibility  when you know they're getting boned  by making a beat up out of an ordinary story.

Start time: 7615.10
End time: 7634.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we'll see.  Tim Cook has called for a retraction,  which is something unusual.  Apple has never called for a, publicly anyway,  called for a retraction.  Not publicly, they've called for a retraction.  Have you ever experienced anything?  Well, I won't put you on the spot, Seth.  I find that extraordinary.  They've asked us to take down stories.  They've asked you to take down stories, yeah.  So they do this privately normally.  Of course.

Start time: 7635.14
End time: 7643.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, of course they do.  But they've also published,  comprehensive said they've done comprehensive reviews  internally before the article was published,  and after the article was published.

Start time: 7643.26
End time: 7651.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I think that Apple,  if this were a true story,  that Apple would lie,  because they denied this categorically,  and now they're asking for a retraction.

Start time: 7652.12
End time: 7659.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know, I kind of feel like  they have to tell the truth in this scenario,  because the evidence will eventually come out.

Start time: 7659.94
End time: 7663.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It would be very damaging if they did lie about it.  Yeah, and I think-

Start time: 7664.06
End time: 7666.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But there's no evidence.  I don't think there'll ever be any evidence.

Start time: 7666.90
End time: 7669.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we don't know, but I think you might be right.  Yeah, we don't know.

Start time: 7670.02
End time: 7700.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I think Apple has actually gone through,  and double-checked itself a little bit.  There's been some time since the story came out,  and Tim Cook called for the public,  and I think he probably went down and said,  hey, I'm gonna say I want a retraction,  you better not,  there better not be something here  that's gonna make me a liar.  So he went down and made sure all of his people were right,  and I think the call for a public retraction,  something that they haven't really done before,  would require them to be 100% sure that they're right.

Start time: 7701.46
End time: 7725.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We've also seen, so just to add to that,  AWS has responded saying that this is untrue,  the NSA has responded and said it's untrue,  we've seen various people who used to work for the NSA  at the time that this happened come out and say,  they were responding,  they were covering this area at the time,  and they're saying, if this had happened,  I would have known about it, and it didn't happen.

Start time: 7727.90
End time: 7735.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And to top it off, the Chinese government said it's not true.  All that being said, I don't trust anybody anymore.

Start time: 7735.94
End time: 7747.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The other thing that makes me upset here is attribution.  It doesn't have to be the Chinese government here,  it would be much more plausible  that somebody compromised employees at Supermicro  to put the implant in.  Well, it wasn't Supermicro,

Start time: 7747.26

Transcript:  Well, okay, so just to talk about that,  so this vulnerability happened in 2015.  Since 2015, we have moved into things called  secure enclaves, so in particular,  your iPhone is a key issue here  because it actually was one of the first devices  to come out in the mainstream with secure enclaves.  It's largely linked to the finger ID thing.

Transcript:  And TPM's been around for a while,  that's also a security.  Yeah, so he's had TXT.  But I have to say, I talked,  when this story broke, I talked to somebody in this business.  He actually is a big, big supplier of hardware  to big, big companies, server farms.  And as an expert in this area, he said,  yeah, it's completely possible,  and I believe it happens all the time.  It happens, though, just as often in the mail,  you got a server on its way  to the Department of Defense,  and it gets interdicted on the way,  as it happens anywhere else.  And I don't think he's convinced that any,  and they do, by the way, he did talk a lot  about the things you're talking about,  the methods they use to secure these devices,  like secure boot and stuff.  He said, it's very difficult.

Transcript:  I think the organizations that are being in question here,  they take these very seriously.  All of those organizations test the server motherboards.  They inspect them, and indeed,  they do inspect the supply chain,  and have done since Snowden went public, right?  And there are a range of features  on available to them to use,  and most of these cloud companies do use SGX or TXT,  or ARM crypto island, or AMD secure processing functions.  They do implement them.  Now, in enterprise IT more generally,  now back out here in the real world where I live in,  none of those secure features  are actually used in the real world.  The vendors do talk about them  and promote the fact that they have these features,  but only a very small percentage of their products  actually have this secure boot functionality  through these trust along ways.

Transcript:  You probably missed this,  but the United States GAO,  the Government Accountability Office,  issued a report to the Committee on Armed Services  in the Senate this month.  Weapons Systems Cybersecurity, DOD,  just beginning to grapple with the scale of vulnerabilities,  and if you read it, it's a horrific indictment  of the security on weapons systems in the United States,  which are sitting on public internet in some cases.  I mean, it's-  Yep.  That's horrible.  It's horrific.  And they're team here with their obsolete systems.  Well, the Department of Defense said,  the DOD faces mounting challenges  in protecting its weapons systems  from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats.  This state is due to the computerized nature  of weapons systems.  DOD's late start in prioritizing  weapons systems cybersecurity,  and the Department of Defense's nascent understanding  of how to develop more secure weapons systems.  They are more software dependent,  more networked than ever before,  and according to the GAO, completely vulnerable.  I think your confidence in the security of-  No, my confidence is that hardware security,

Start time: 7973.82

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 7977.70
End time: 7980.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there are many ways to go about it,  but I think counting on-

Start time: 7980.22
End time: 7985.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would do it in the software where-  Counting on defense.  Evidence could be wiped, or you could blame it on malware.  Now you're backing down,

Start time: 7985.68
End time: 7988.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because you implied that the defensive measures  were effective.

Start time: 7989.86
End time: 8041.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  are entirely unfeasible and impractical.  No one would want to do that,  and I believe the whole claims by Business Insider  in that specific.  Now, if you want to talk about the US Navy  running Windows NT4 in the weapons system  for a substantial chunk of their surface ships,  yes, you do have a vulnerability problem, right?  And the networking hardware that's in there  also dates from the early 2000s as well.  And the servers, they actually have 25 year supply agreements  with traditional IT vendors to supply exactly the same kit  for the next 25 years.  Vulnerabilities and all, by the way.  So yes, this is a problem,  and it's not just limited to the Navy.  I mean, all of the military stuff  often runs on tremendously obsolete hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  just to use the specific ones they start the article with,  we used for years, we still do, we use an elemental.  Now it's from AWS and we sent the old one back.  But I know people, including Alex Lindsay,  who has many old pre-Amazon elementals,  but does he have the wherewithal to scan the motherboard  and find these implants?  I mean, I don't know.  I mean, that's the other question.

Start time: 8072.34
End time: 8076.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Transcript:  So email me and I will have Alex  get you one of these motherboards.  If you know how to find this chip,  I don't know what it takes to find it.  It might take some sophisticated tools,  but if you know how to find it.

Transcript:  One of the other things that struck me,  just to take this a step further,  is if hardware is a security risk,  there was an article about two or three months ago  where Apple was having a problem in China  a couple of years ago.  So the article was published a couple of months ago,  and the problem was two or three years ago,  where people would buy iPhones  and then take them outside, disassemble them,  take the genuine components out,  put third-party components in,  and then take them back inside the store.  And it was a way of defrauding the repair process, right?  And so they would have this supply  of genuine Apple components  that they would then sell in the spare parts business.  And apparently they used to stand outside the store  with a bag of it  and have all these people lined up and paid per phone  to take them in to get them repaired.  And that's part of the reason  that Apple doesn't repair phones anymore  is because it needs to have the integrity  of the supply chain.  And in the latest MacBooks,  I believe that Apple is moving  to actually lock down the repair inside of those  so that if you try to use a non-genuine component,  the box will not work.  You actually have to have a special app  to certify that each,  to actually cross-sign all of the components  inside of the boxes.  And that's the reaction to this.  Now, this is not new.  This has been going on for five years or more.  But part of the reason that we are losing our right  to repair is because of the supply chain integrity issue.  And if you say to vendors, you have to prevent this,  then at the same time,  you're also losing your right to repair.  So you need to be careful about what you ask for.

Transcript:  Alex probably doesn't care  whether he can repair his elemental server.  He says he has one made in the spring of 2015.  And he had a little poll.  Should I void the warranty and break it open  and see if we can find some?  Now, I think finding those, by the way, 95% voted yes.  We need to know.  There were some interesting replies in here,  including Father Robert Balisare and so forth  on what you would need to do.  It's not, it's probably non-trivial.  Robert said the best thing to do is just put it online  and see what kind of traffic you get coming out of it.  It'd be a lot easier than finding that chip.

Start time: 8215.50

Transcript:  And it'd be, all he'd have to do is take some high-res photos  and publish them.  That's enough.  People who know what they're looking for  would be able to look at those and start to go,  yeah, I know what that chip is.  I know what that is.  Hang on, what's that?  If it's a chip, if it is indeed a chip,  if it indeed is it not,  somebody's put the code inside of a sock or another chip.

Transcript:  Yeah, who knows?  That's the problem.  Yeah, it could even be nowadays  the way they make motherboards with layers.  It could even be in the motherboard layer.  One of the layers were not even visible at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Perhaps, I'm not so sure.  I'm not an expert in that field.  I would expect just post some high-res photos  and tell people to go nuts on them.  And certain people would look at it and go, there it is.  And they'd nudge the person over there  who'd nudge the person over there to say, look at that.

Transcript:  Well, that would be a fairly dramatic price to pay.  Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen passed away this week,  sadly, at the age of 65, which is awfully young,  says I, now in my 60s.  I think it's his third bout with cancer.  He had left Microsoft in 1982.  He was the guy who woke Bill Gates up  in his Harvard dorm room, slapping him around  with a popular science article  about the MITS Altair computer saying,  Bill, Bill, you gotta drop out of Harvard.  We gotta write some basic for this program.  Bill Gates wrote, I'm heartbroken by the passing  of one of my oldest and dearest friends, Paul Allen.  From our early days together at Lakeside School  through our partnership in the creation of Microsoft  to some of our joint philanthropic projects over the year,  Paul was a true partner and dear friend.  Personal computing would not have existed without him.  And of course, he was a great philanthropist  spending many millions of dollars  and eventually even agreeing to join Bill Gates  and Warren Buffett in their philanthropic pledge in 2010  to give away at least half of his $20 billion fortune.  And I guess that is ongoing.  I worked for Bill, I'm sorry, for Paul briefly.  He owned Tech TV for about four years  and ended up selling it to Comcast.  But I only met him once, I don't have much of an,  to say about him, except that he seemed like a very sweet guy  and kind of shy.  He was kind of kept to himself.
