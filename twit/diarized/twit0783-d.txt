Hi, Father Robert Padre.  Leo, it's good to see you.  My goodness. Is that like the Swiss Guard wear those?  Is that the official Vatican?

Start time: 227.45

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Absolutely. Absolutely.  You have to wear one of those to see the Pope.

Start time: 231.96
End time: 233.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, what do they do to protect the Pope?

Start time: 235.86
End time: 251.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  As long as you're wearing kind of a mask, it's more or less OK.  One of the things that you have to remember is just to get near the Pope.  It means someone's already made sure that you're not ill.  It's it's kind of a thing.  Do they have testing?

Start time: 253.56
End time: 256.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sorry. Do they have testing?  Rapid testing?

Start time: 257.20
End time: 264.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, but they do have, you know, they make sure that when you come near the Pope,  you're wearing a mask.  They make sure that you.  Oh, my God.

Transcript:  Both in and out. It doesn't have an outlet.  Oh, thank God. Absolutely.  Yeah, because how old is Francis?  He's not young.

Start time: 282.06
End time: 296.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't think I'm actually allowed to say.  Really?  That someone someone gave me a list of things I can and cannot say.  And I'm pretty sure age was on that.  What is not that it's a secret, not that this is secret.  It's not like I don't want this to be rumored.

Start time: 296.40
End time: 309.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They allow me to say he's 83 years old, right?  Yes. According to Wikipedia.  OK, so he's absolutely at a high risk category.  I mean, I am too. I'm in my 60s.  So I think it's really important to protect him.  So it is.

Start time: 310.06
End time: 338.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But I will say this, being a member of a security detail must be maddening  because before Covid, he would regularly drink things that the crowd would give him  when he would do his audiences.  No.  Yeah. And you could see the security people going,  oh, no.  And now it's I mean, he tells people to take precautions.  He tells people to be sensible.  But he personally would rather embrace people and shake their hands than keep  distance. You know, it's amazing.

Start time: 339.12
End time: 375.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I remember there was one incident where a woman actually grabbed him  and pulled on him.  And of course, you look at that and you go, oh, my God.  But, you know, he is a man of the people and he's a religious leader.  So it would only make sense that he would reach out and hold and touch people.  That's so important to them.  So I know I'm sure he knows what a risk it is.  But I'm sure he also feels like, hey, it's it's part of the job.  Right. Exactly.  Jesus didn't say I'm not going to wash those feet.  They're disgusting.  It's I'm sure he thought it, but I'm sorry, I don't want to be sacrilegious.

Start time: 375.68
End time: 389.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But that's no, no, no.  That's a man of God.  Absolutely. I mean, when every Easter he is at the prison, he washes his feet,  washing their feet. Yeah.  When he goes out, the Pope Mobile does not have bulletproof glass.  Oh, it doesn't.  It doesn't have any of that.  It used to.

Start time: 390.10
End time: 407.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It used to.  Because there was an assassination attempt.  Correct. Wow.  I love Francis more and more all the time.  Everything I learned about him, I'm just blown away.  He's just an amazing fellow.  And you're doing well.  You're healthy, even though you're you're in the former center and the epicenter of

Transcript:  COVID-19 that that has been the strangest thing because everyone knows that it was  bad here before it was bad anywhere else in the world.  And so we are seeing the same patterns every other place in the world, except  in some countries, there isn't that moment that we had in Italy where everyone  collectively came together and said, we're not going to take it.  You know what? Put aside your personal freedoms.  Let's take care of this.

Start time: 459.96
End time: 468.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, well, I have been here for five years, so technically, I mean,  I'm American and Australian.  Are you ever going to go back?

Start time: 468.46
End time: 470.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, you still have family back there.  You're never going to go back.

Start time: 470.66
End time: 536.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, OK, so here's the funny thing.  If you want to go back to Australia right now, there are very, very few flights from  the US, understandably, but also you have to enter into a mandatory two week  quarantine, which you have to pay for yourself.  And so it's interesting seeing like some of my friends who have gone back and also  a range of celebrities, there have been very variable hotel quality standards.  If you were to put it, I guess nicely,  some people have been put up in the places like the Intercontinental City,  which has a beautiful view of the Opera House and Harbour Bridge.  Two weeks there, not a problem.  Other people have been put out, you know,  like 20 kilometres from the centre of the city, very far away from anything.  And they're staring at a brick wall for two weeks.  So the disparity there is quite interesting.  So, yeah, if you want to go back at the moment, it's you really have to brace  yourselves for, you know, you think it's tough being in your own house for two  weeks, but think about it in a hotel room.  So it doesn't sound that appealing.

Start time: 537.16
End time: 556.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, I actually have a very important question for you, Lexi.  Sure.  Samsung had its event Thursday.  Jason Howell and I got up 7am.  They announced the new AM.  What is Samsung have against the well, it was 11pm in Korea.  So I don't know.  They were staying up late.

Start time: 557.46
End time: 558.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Someone had to lose out.

Start time: 558.88
End time: 596.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it wasn't.  There was no win either way.  They announced the Samsung Galaxy Note.  I've owned every note since the very first note.  I love it. The Note 20 is the newest.  That's funny. They didn't mention specs.  They just didn't say what processor.  They didn't say how much RAM.  They didn't say how much storage.  They didn't say anything, except it comes in Mystic Bronze, the new color,  and it's 120 Hertz refresh rate.  And they just assumed that you will.  And you know the rest.  And then which was weird to me, they did  announce a successor to the Galaxy Fold.  It's now the Z Fold for reasons no one understands because there's no Z involved.

Start time: 596.58
End time: 598.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Z Fold 5G something.  Z Fold 5G2.

Start time: 599.92
End time: 600.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Z Fold 5G.

Start time: 601.29
End time: 612.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, what a number.  And they did talk about specs there because I think they wanted to reassure  people that it really is bendable glass, folks.  They even showed Jerry Riggs everything.

Start time: 613.82
End time: 614.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Trying to break it.

Start time: 614.64
End time: 619.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's like Marquez saying if only they could do it with glass.  And they're like, oh, Marquez, we can.  But not when he said that.

Start time: 620.28
End time: 626.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. When he said that.  Why would you try to explain to Marquez in a chronologically unacceptable way?

Start time: 629.04
End time: 635.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They also announced a new watch for $400.  Earbuds that look surprisingly like bronze beans.

Start time: 636.10
End time: 649.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They do. They are bronze beans.  I've got them here.  Very.  I have these and I actually have the I have the Mystic, the Mystic bronzes of the.  This is why I go to Lexi because she knows.

Start time: 650.28
End time: 653.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look at the camera bump on that.  It looks like a separate unit.

Start time: 654.26
End time: 671.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is incredibly sorry.  I'm so excited.  I'm knocking my microphone over because it's so big.  Look at that.  It's massive.  It's like a domino on top of the phone.  Yeah. Look, it's it's it's a chunky big boy of a phone.  Six point nine inches.

Start time: 671.94
End time: 678.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But something like that is designed to be in a case.  Right. Because if you put that in your case,  that bump is going to be flush against the edge of the case.

Start time: 679.28
End time: 697.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So fortunately enough, I have a case prepared this earlier.  So look, the camera bump is significant.  So when you do have it lying flat on a surface, if you do want to do that,  you get the you get the wibble wobble.  So you put a case on it and then it does mitigate that somewhat.  There is still a little bit coming up.

Start time: 697.40
End time: 699.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not a case. You need a thicker case.

Start time: 699.84
End time: 720.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a very thin case.  Yeah, because I don't like my big chunky cases.  But yeah, if you put a thicker case on it, it should get rid of that issue all  together, but then you cover up the nice looking phone.  You can get a clear case, of course.  But the whole point is that it just it looks and feels  pretty nice, at least from the outside.  You can order the phone now.

Start time: 720.80
End time: 738.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could order the watch and the buds went on order the next day.  And then September 1st, we can order the fold and the flip.  You don't have the fold yet, right?  So when I'm trying to decide, I wish I do.  I would usually buy a note.  I have every note.  I don't want the fold.

Start time: 739.06
End time: 780.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you upgrading? I'm interested.  I see no reason to.  What do you think?  It's interesting because I think if the pandemic didn't happen and obviously  Samsung designed this phone way before we knew anything like this was going to happen.  Thirteen hundred dollars for a phone.  Crazy. It's still a crazy amount of money,  but it was probably more reasonable when there wasn't a pandemic going on.  Now we are in a completely different environment.  So thirteen hundred dollars really has to be a value proposition for something that  is going to last an incredibly long time.  And I think the announcement that we're going to get at least three generations  of Android updates might help somewhat to sort of, you know,  oh, it's thirteen hundred dollars, which is good.

Start time: 780.98
End time: 783.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's got to be a three year phone at that price, at least.

Start time: 784.08
End time: 798.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  At least. Although I don't think we still yet  have clarification on whether that's three versions of Android or three  generations of Note phones.  So I think we need to get a little bit more clarification on what three  generations mean. One would hope it's three generations of Android.

Start time: 799.30
End time: 801.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That'd be three years, right? Because it's a yearly update.

Start time: 801.40
End time: 811.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. At least we should hope that your  thirteen hundred dollar phone is at least good for three years.  I would hope so, too.  But yeah, I'm interested. Like you're a Note user.  What are your thoughts?

Start time: 811.82
End time: 819.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm really happy with the Note 10.  I don't see any reason to upgrade at all.  Is the camera light years better?  No, it's the same sensor.

Start time: 820.30
End time: 853.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's so here's the thing about the camera.  When the S20 Ultra came out earlier in the year, it had, you know, the bells and  whistles, the 100 times space zoom, the 108 megapixel sensor.  And the problem with that camera was it was technically amazing.  But there was so many autofocus issues when it first was shipped to reviewers.  It was just it was terrible.  I was taking photos like portraits,  just a regular shot, not even in portrait mode.  And my subject would be completely out of focus.  And the background was nice and sharp.  And I was like, that's not my artistic intention there.

Start time: 853.56
End time: 854.70
Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Because when you point and shoot,

Start time: 854.76
End time: 888.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the focus was just getting all over the place.  Video in particular was terrible in terms of focusing on the S20 Ultra,  which has now been somewhat resolved.  But Samsung's obviously gone, oh, we have to fix that.  So it's now got a laser autofocus system.  I've been doing a little bit of testing  preliminary stuff, and it seems to be much, much better than the S20 Ultra.  So that's a good thing.  But in terms of like, is it a dramatic enough shift over the Note 10 and Note 10  Plus? Yeah, I'm not sure.  I still need to do lots more side by side tests to really kind of evaluate that.  But at least the autofocus.

Start time: 888.88
End time: 939.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Then there's the fact that we are in a  pandemic and spending a thousand for the regular and thirteen hundred for the ultra  seems like an awful lot of money, especially now that the Pixel 4a came out,  which came out this week and is awesome.  Everybody seems to love it.  It's a dollar fifty.  Yeah, and it's like nothing.  It's like 350 dollars.  But that seems like a very low price for a phone.  I got the just because I wanted to try it.  The Motorola Edge, because I I've been a fan of Motorola since the Moto X is.  And they've always offered kind of a very pure Android experience in a lesser  expensive phone. This edge is a very nice phone.  There's a lot of choices.  There's, of course, the one plus phones that are much less expensive.  There's even the iPhone SE.  And I really wonder if the time is wrong for a thousand plus dollar phone.

Start time: 939.78
End time: 977.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Absolutely. I mean, look, I think the most impressive thing about that phone is  the refresh. That's the refresh.  It does make a difference.  Yeah, I didn't used to think it did, but I saw it at CES.  It is beautiful.  But you've got things like the ASUS ROG phone, too, which will get you up in that  area. And it's a beautiful phone.  It's a it's a ridiculous battery.  It's a 30 day battery life.  That was the review unit that I that I used.  And it's incredibly fast and it's half the price.  Yeah. So thirteen hundred dollars for something that might be might be  incrementally better. I think if you had a note, too, maybe.  But definitely not if you've had a note from the last two years.

Start time: 978.32
End time: 981.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Lexi, did the S20 sell well?  My sense is it was not a big seller.

Start time: 983.26
End time: 1099.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think it did as well as previous generations of Galaxy phones.  That's for sure.  It had so many issues straight off the bat.  And it did take a several months worth of software updates, at least for the camera,  which was arguably the biggest selling point of the S20 Ultra.  So considering that, it also had the 120 Hertz refresh rate.  And it was it was a good phone, but it wasn't great.  And I think that was a real those early reviews and those early issues with the  with the firmware and the software updates that sort of kept trying to address it.  I think really did a lot of damage for  I think users that were coming to like the phone as the annual upgrade that they do,  because I think the thing is with the note is that Samsung, it's interesting that  sort of types of users that go for the note versus the S series.  The note users are so incredibly loyal as Leo, you are.  I know you are. You're so loyal and you're pretty much like,  I'm not going to buy any other phone.  It's note or die sort of thing.  So this it's going to have a lot of fans  built in already that is going to come to this phone and go,  I'm getting it no matter what in terms of attracting new users, though,  that's going to be the interesting thing, because especially with the regular  version of the Note 20 being a thousand dollars and having significantly less  features that are worth a thousand dollars, you know, it's got that plastic back.  The Note 20 Ultra is that new Gorilla Glass that promises like crazy drop  durability. I think it's like six point six feet or two meters.  If you somehow drop your phone from that height or your kid throws it up in the sky  and it shouldn't crack.  So that's sort of you're paying for those kind of cutting edge features.  But the regular Note 20 does miss out on a lot of those things.  And it's just going to be interesting like who is going to buy the regular Note 20.  I can see people buying the 20 Ultra.  I'll get the regular Note 20.  I'll get it. I'll get the Ultra.  Exactly.

Start time: 1099.94
End time: 1106.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Show me that Mystic Bronze again, because that's that really seems to be the number  one selling point. Is it pretty?  It is. Do you have one too, Renee?  It's very pretty.

Start time: 1107.10
End time: 1113.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, but it's like the first color since Rose Gold that I thought, you know,  Christina, Christina Warren and I could get behind.  Kind of Rose Gold. Yeah.

Start time: 1113.94
End time: 1147.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it is kind of Rose Gold.  And the good thing is about it, you know, as I know, I did a first quick first look  video with this, you know, it came out yesterday.  You know, the Note 10 Plus, Leo, as I'm sure you know, it does look like a crime  scene if you don't use it without a case.  Fingerprint magnet, honestly, you dust it and you're getting like years worth of  fingerprints on it.  The finish on this is the matte finish.  So at least it doesn't have that issue so far.  The edge is the same way.  The edge is on the sort of different is on the different side now.  I'm interested to see how you go with that.  It looks the same, though.

Start time: 1147.48
End time: 1152.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'm a lefty. So that's how they do it in England.  Leo, you know who would pay $1,300 for a phone?

Start time: 1153.90
End time: 1172.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Who?  OK, so you've got the tech people, the tech people who absolutely need the tech.  And I get that.  But also the people who know that this would be a status symbol because you've got  the latest, the greatest, the newest.  But you're not going out.  If you're in quarantine, you're not going out.  So why buy it?  Yeah. Plus the stores are closed for most people.

Start time: 1174.24
End time: 1187.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, that's why the sales of the S20 were lower.  So OK, so really, my real question isn't that.  My real question is, what if I got the fold instead?  That's what you should do.  Yes, yes.

Start time: 1188.14
End time: 1201.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You need to wait.  We need to wait another month to find out details.  I still don't understand why it wasn't just like, let's just do a big event  and then just announce it all rather than why tease it now.  Why make us?  Well, it's only a few weeks off.

Can't you see Samsung doing the whole Steve Jobs thing with the fold saying,  you know, you would pay a thousand dollars for a phone like this and you would pay  seven hundred dollars for a tablet like this and we could charge a premium on top  of that, but we're not going to.

We again are going to be really interesting to see if Samsung actually says anything  about durability in terms of fold rating, because that's the big reason why we  tested the first generation of the fold, because there was this big, bold claim.  Two hundred thousand folds.  How can we not test that?

I don't want to have to test its durability.  I want it to be realized to the extent that if I if this phone does end up  costing two thousand US dollars like we're predicting it, well,  it needs to be able to withstand the rough and tumble of everyday life.

Beans is the only acceptable thing to do and watch.  And I have to say, looking at the watch, I'm kind of a fan.  I had the gear frontier.  I think that was the gear to to I like the turning rotating bezel is a very nice affordance.  I like it that it's round and it looks like the new one does almost as much as an Apple watch,  which is, you know, I'm an Apple watch where it almost looks like I could trade in my iPhone,  iPad and Apple watch for a Z Fold Beans and Galaxy watch.  It's certainly be a worthwhile thing to do for six months just to see how they compare.

Start time: 1564.76
End time: 1654.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's that's what they want you to do.  I think the interesting that you bring up the comparison with the Apple watch  because it's very obvious over the past, like watching the iteration of the Galaxy  wearable line, particularly with the Active 2 that came out last year,  that had those flagship features that we first saw on the Apple watch,  talking about ECG in particular, but it was a flagship feature on the watch.  So on the Apple watch that had FDA clearance when it first came out on the Series 4.  But then the Galaxy Watch Active 2 was  released saying, yes, it had ECG, but it didn't get FDA clearance.  And a year later, we have just heard word that it did get FDA clearance on the watch  three, which was just announced this week, but we don't know an actual rollout time  line of when to expect that in the US.  It's got clearance, which is a start.  But the fact that it was like at least the earlier generation was announced.  And then we didn't get any indication on as a consumer, not just as someone who  follows technology day in, day out as my job, but as a consumer.  If I bought that watch and I would go, great, it's got ECG.  But when am I going to get it?  Oh, maybe a couple of months. It's fine.  A year later, certification is, you know, it's a big deal.  And it's a gamble.  That's a big gamble.  It is a big gamble.  And if you get the Apple Watch,  any of you specifically looking for those heart features like ECG, you know,  you're going to get it. It's going to be fully functioning.  On the Samsung watch, it's not guaranteed.  We don't know. We just don't have a timeline.  Blood pressure, too, is the same on the new watch.

Start time: 1654.44
End time: 1688.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We're talking about the promise of an ecosystem like this.  I mean, we like we like the idea of where it might be heading to have the watch,  the phone, the tablet, the laptop all tied together in the same ecosystem,  giving us real time data.  And yes, the FDA is moving on approving some of these these applications,  but we still haven't seen how you're actually going to create that environment,  how you're actually going to create that ecosystem.  Do you actually have a plan for taking all  that data and giving it back to me in some usable form?  Or is it really just going to be you're  counting my steps and you're counting my Samsung health is much better than Google

I  I track my blood pressure, so I having if it were accurate,  a good blood pressure sensor would be great for covid being having an oximeter  would be great.  I care. You know, I have a little oximeter that I bought in case anybody I know gets  sick because that's one way that you know it's time to go to the hospital  because you're not getting the air.  So I thought that was cool.  But that, of course, it won't work.  In fact, the only feature that is FDA approved is the ECG feature, which is  the same thing I already have in the Apple watch.

Yeah, I've used I've been using them all day today.  They're really pretty.  Very pretty. It's interesting.  The design is completely different.

Start time: 1819.70
End time: 1856.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So here's the thing.  It's an open design.  So that means it doesn't actually have the interchangeable tip that sits in your  ear, in your actually ear canal.  So it doesn't create the seal like the AirPods Pro does.  So they just have that open design.  That is why I've just been listening with my noisy fridge on in the background.  Just to sort of see how it works with canceling the noise.  It is not as effective as the active noise cancellation from the AirPods Pro.  Oh, well.  So and it's just because it's just the fact of the design being an open design  like this, you know, unless it's actually in physically inside your ear canal.  It's much more difficult.

And obviously the Powerbeats stayed in better than the regular AirPods.  But I think I'll be doing something similar with these guys.  But yes, to answer your question, they do stay in my ears.  They don't seem to be budging.  I haven't gone on a run with them yet,  because that's my next big test, because the regular AirPods Pro for me,  I just don't stay in my ears when I go on a run.  So I can't use them to work out.  So if I do work out, I usually use like an over ear, hooked design.

I don't know if this was a Black Hat,  but Checkpoint Software revealed Achilles, which is a nasty flaw in the Qualcomm.  Snap, Snapdragon.  I've got snacks on my mind after our  juffle conversation, our Snapdragon chip.  These vulnerabilities affect 40 percent  of the Android market, including funds from Google, Samsung, LG, Xiaomi,  OnePlus and more. There are patches.  Thank God. Was this a Black Hat revelation, Robert?

Transcript:  That was actually a Defcon.  I'm trying to bring up the slide deck.  One of the things that was different about  Defcon this year was the fact that they provided all of the talks ahead of time.  Nice, because they were all pre-recorded.  And so you've got the slide decks.  You've actually got the videos.  You've got the write ups, the white papers.  That one was was particularly interesting.  The talk was hard to follow because the researcher  definitely wasn't English as a first language.  But as you go through, you realize what he's doing.  He was able to take complete control of an Android device.  And you could do it in such a way that the person using the Android device wouldn't  actually know you've got root control of his device.  That's terrible.

Transcript:  He is now it says it's a prone to own  Qualcomm compute DSP for fun and profit.  It's not the current crop of Snapdragon chips.  Right. It's an older chip.  So if you have a phone you bought in the last couple of years, you're OK.  There are patches, but this is the problem.  The older your phone, the less likely you're going to get patches.

Start time: 2509.88
End time: 2522.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And it's not necessarily even the older phones, because you have to remember when  you're talking about a billion plus devices that are sold every year, a lot of those  are low cost devices and the low cost devices will use these older chips.  Yep.

So this is a lot of phones that need the patch that many of which will not get the  patch, there are six flaws and they give you complete and absolute control of those  ones. How do you get it on there?  Is it with malware, with a with a malicious app, for instance?

Transcript:  Yeah, so there were a couple of ways that they were shown that the one that I was  looking at was actually not publicly available.  It was a demonstration that was shown to me.  Actually, part of Def Con is the the Discord.  They started up this Discord that has all of the people that you would normally meet  throughout the conference. And I mean, that's a good idea.  Organized. Yeah.  Yeah. Just like it would be if you were actually walking through.  They have a wall of sheep Discord channel.  Yes. Yes. Although it's harder to do.

Transcript:  That this was this was a I don't want to say a low year.  I think it's people are trying to figure out how best to push the research that  they've been doing because online is it's not it's not.  We haven't figured it out.  I love what they did with Black Hat.  I love what they're doing with Defcon.  But there was a sense of loss because when you're at the conference, you actually  have a group of friends and you kind of help each other point each other in the  right direction. You don't have that with YouTube, Twitch, Discord.  Yeah.  The other thing that I actually kind of  enjoyed, though, was the there was an announcement at Black Hat about satellite  hacking. Now, this sounds strange because we don't use satellite.  But when you think about what satellites are actually used for, cruise ships,  remote deployments for things like oil rigs and devices that are in remote  locations, they were able to show that with less than three hundred dollars worth  of hardware, you could basically intercept any satellite communications.  And the vast majority of satellite communications are not encrypted.  Right.  And I actually I want to pick up some  of this hardware and see what I can get here in the Vatican.  Does it include GPS?  Oh, GPS is easy.  But this this would be something like that.  That's a point of sale. Oh, point of sale terminals.  Yeah, this would be, you know, you can pick up email  conversations because they don't encrypt going up to a satellite.  And think about how the how a satellite works.  When you're going up to a satellite,  you do need to point at a specific direction in order to hit that satellite.  But when it's broadcasting, it's broadcasting and as large a swath  as possible because it wants to hit the receiver as as well as possible.  So your beam, your packets are really  scattered anywhere where anyone with the right piece of equipment.  And that's basically just a digital signal receiver that has a DSP on it that you  can reprogram, can receive it and decode it.

In this talk, we'll walk you through an  incredibly fun bug we've discovered in printer spooler services.  It can be exploded both locally and remotely,  escape sandbox, executes arbitrary code and also elevates the system.

You have to remember that inside your smart bulbs, be it for you or one of the  knockoffs, it's not just something that's connected to the Bluetooth radio on your  phone, it's a mini server.  And so and it's a very poorly protected mini server.  And if someone can get that, it means they now have something in your network that  they can pivot to elsewhere.  And I mean, people don't realize that it's not a light bulb.  It's a server. It's a server that will never be patched.

He's got a bunch of he had.  I don't know if he still does. He's got a bunch of fancy cars.  He's got a family. He loves his sports.  And he's going to keep control of the app store and of events.  Two things that he probably doesn't want to dump on was given on Jaws.  Given how high profile and how contentious they are right now.  And he has a couple of the direct reports he's going to keep and then everything  that has to do with product marketing at Apple, which is very different than other  companies like they're not salespeople.  They're actually helping design, implement and spec out what's going to go in the new  software hardware releases. All of those things.  iPhones, Apple Watches, Macs, all of it.  He's going to take on the senior vice  president responsibilities for worldwide product marketing.  And we saw some of the people who work  for him like Kayan Drantz got promoted to vice president of iPhone marketing.  And she was on stage the last two years for the app for the iPhone event.  So obviously they've been they've been building towards this for a while.

They have a couple of C level executives and they have a bunch of directors,  but they they're not exposed.  There's no Apple hierarchy.  And it's just like we need we need Jaws to be the senior vice president.  We don't have another title for you.  We've got this Apple fellow thing since was that good?  OK, that's good.

He'd been there many, many years to this is kind of some of the leaders  in the Steve Jobs era who are moving on only Eddie has left.  Great piece, though, in the Wall Street  Journal this week about Tim Cook and really celebrating Tim Cook and how,  like me, a lot of people when Jobs passed away in 2011 were concerned about Apple's  future without its visionary leader, and they talk about how Tim Cook  didn't try to duplicate Steve Jobs, instead found his own way, made Apple his  own in in a way that actually worked quite quite well.  Instead of innovating by creating products  that redefined categories like the iPhone and the iPad and the iPod,  he took the existing products and made them sing and refined them and found ways  to make more money with them.  In fact, Apple's close to being a remember when we made a big deal  that Apple was a trillion dollar company.  Yeah, it's now a one point nine trillion dollar company.  Very close. I would say this week probably will hit two trillion dollars.  So I think you'd have to say that Mr.  Cook has done fine.

Start time: 3419.80
End time: 3453.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, he is a good product guy, too.  Like the Cook doctrine, he took what he took a lot of what Steve Jobs just did  by instinct and made it into almost like a strategy.  And the Cook doctrine by itself is that Apple will only enter categories where  they believe they can provide a differentiated experience.  And that's where Apple Watch that's why they shipped Apple Watch and not  the television and why they shipped AirPods and not some of the other things  that they were working on.  So I think he's not the product visionary that Steve Jobs was, but he's very good  at identifying markets where he thinks that Apple can make a huge impact.

Start time: 3453.44

And the journal said that's that's kind of what Tim Cook did.  He did an interview in 2017.  He said, I knew what I needed to do was not to mimic it.  Mimic Steve. I would fail miserably at that.  And I think this is largely the case for  many people who take a baton from someone larger than life.  You have to chart your own course.  You have to be the best version of yourself.

It's like the company is worth four times more than it was when Steve Jobs had it.  They are profitable in every stage.  There are no loss leaders in this company.  They they've taken they've gone through  losing basically the entire channel team that made it profitable under under Steve  Jobs, and yet they've continued their rise in profitability every single quarter.  This company was his five years ago.  Yeah. And and he's I mean, it is Tim.  It is Tim Apples.  It is Tim Apples company.

They will not take an Apple Silicon Mac first generation.  They're going to wait and let people like me and probably you, Leo, probably.  Everybody here will take the bullets, the arrows.  Yes.  And they're going to want like either they run windows in boot camp or via VM or  they have high end Brianna Wu style 3D rendering software that's barely  supported on Intel Macs or for some reason they just need a good Intel Mac to go  the next three, four years.  And this one is great core for core 10th Gen Intel is not much better than 9th Gen.  It's still 14 nanometer.  And we all know Intel's I was going to say  Silicon drama is like beauty drama on YouTube when you dig into it.  There's just so much cross fighting and all this stuff going on.  But the the AMD Radeon graphics chips are really good.  And in my test renders, like I don't really care about synthetic benchmarks.  They're entertaining.  But to me, it's time to finish work.  Like if I start something in Final Cut Pro, when I can export it and upload it,  that's the time that matters to me.  And this was like 30 percent faster than my 16 inch MacBook Pro, which is  significant, especially on larger videos.  And the screen was already ridiculous with 5K and DCI-P3 color.  And now the nano texture where instead of just diffusing glare unilaterally,  it kind of breaks it up.  So you don't you don't see any of the kind of that's a five hundred dollar upsell.

Transcript:  It's yeah, I'm using the Logitech Brio 4K right now, and it is way better than this.  It's only 1080p.  But the T2 chip inside the iMac, it's basically a coprocessor.  I think just their contract with Intel means they can't call it that.  But it's got the image signal processor from the iPhone 7 in it.  So it's doing all the white balance and  tonal mapping and everything that an iPhone 7 camera did.  So I don't look like off color like this.  It looks really, really good, really crisp, really sharp.  It's got facial recognition, facial awareness for the focus.  So it's a really good camera and really good microphones this time, too.

Transcript:  Yeah, I'm no, I'm running my work machine.  This I'm actually streaming talking about.  It's interesting, Renee, talking about webcam quality, because that was the big  thing that I was so interested in about the new iMac.  This webcam on the I'm running a 15 inch MacBook Pro.  What are you using for your camera now? Because it looks great.  It's a 15 inch MacBook Pro from 2016.  It looks great. Really?  Good. I'm glad.  Well, a little bit of lighting does definitely help this.  But, you know, overall, it's it's been it's been an interesting, you know,  watching the transition of MacBook over the past couple of years.  You know, I honestly I just the touch bar  just drives me up the wall.  Yeah, I mean, it's really hard to kind of get past that for many of my use cases.  I just like there's just no one application that it works seamlessly for.  You know, I know there's a bunch of different hacks and ways to get around it.  But I just, you know, the touch bar is still being one of those things.  It just like it.  Oh, I just and the crappy keyboard, please.  Well, the keyboard's now been fixed, but this keyboard, the one I'm using at the  moment. Yeah, I've actually got pretty lucky with the keyboard on this one.  I haven't had too many of the stuck issues with the butterfly mechanism at all.  So I've been very fortunate, but it's gone.  Got lots of other things going on in different ways.

But when she comes into the office once a week, she wants a MacBook.  She's using the MacBook, the 20, I guess, 2019 MacBook Air.  And the nice thing about the MacBook Air, Lexi, is no touch bar.  And the new one has a nice keyboard.  But I'm not. I would say wait for Apple Silicon for that, especially because that's  where that may be one of the first Apple Silicon.  Unless the butterfly comes back, which is one of the rumors, Leo.  No, they're not going to bring the butterfly back.  There's a rumor. What?

All of Tencent. It's huge.  That's a big deal.  Yeah.  Our show today brought to you by Monday.com.  Monday.com is made for what we do.  Anybody who has a team.  Remember in school when you would get you  know, you have to do a science project and you have to create a team.  And there'd always be a couple of people wouldn't do anything.  And you'd call them and say, what are you doing?  Oh, I'm working hard on it.  And you wouldn't really know.  And then it would come and you're great to be lousy because they were lazy.  And the problem with distributed teams,  teams that are working from home is it's hard to keep track of them, what they're up to.  That's why you need Monday.com.  If I had Monday.com in high school, I would have had straight A's.  It's a team management platform.  And let's teams plan, manage and track work in a single centralized place.  So you always know who's doing what, what their progress is.  It's a great way to collaborate without meetings.  Whether you work with a little team,  five people, whether you work with a big team of five thousand Monday.com,  it's the easiest way to keep everybody connected and on track.  So many people working from home now.  This is Monday.com is the project management  platform that makes effective teamwork possible, even as we work from home.  I'll tell you a few things I really like about Monday.com.  One, we didn't have to abandon the tools we already use.  We're big on Slack here.  We use email a lot.  We also zoom a lot.  We use calendars, spreadsheets, most importantly, Google Docs.  I love it because it all goes into Monday.com.  You know, Monday.com doesn't replace it.  It becomes the dashboard.  So, you know, all the work is in one place  and you know what everybody's doing.  It makes it so much easier to track and manage without check in meetings.  You have a single  point of truth, so there's never any question.  And if you use data to make decisions,  every boss does, isn't it nice to have all the data in one place?  So you're not guessing you actually know what's going on.  I love the no code automations, by the way.  Your workflow is on autopilot.  You'll get alerts, automatic status updates,  project flows will keep your team on track, confident that doing the right thing,  track progress, timelines, budgets and look at it the way you want to look at it.  Whatever, whatever it is, you know, you're used to, whether it's a Gantt chart or  Kanban board or table spreadsheet style table, whatever way you want to look at it.  Monday.com is so flexible.  We actually got some help from Eddie on request.  You can get an onboarding specialist who will help you.  Eddie said, oh, yeah, for podcasting, we've got these templates.  It was really simple.  He knew exactly what we needed.  It's just amazing.  It's a whole new way of working.  No wonder over 100000 teams are already getting things done with Monday.com.  They've even they've even, you know, changed how often they have to meet.  They've changed their workflow, their work process.  All without any effort.  That's what I like.  Change the way you work online.  Let Monday.com take care of what slows you down and free up time to focus on the  work that drives you start your 14 day free trial right now.  Go to Monday.

Apparently now we're hearing paid 10 million dollars  to the ransomware authors to get their data back.  Ten.  Maybe you can answer this question.  Steve said, no, if you if you had a good  offline backup, you shouldn't have to pay ransomware authors, right?

Start time: 4392.80
End time: 4411.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, it kind of depends.  If you are patient and you manage to infiltrate a network with ransomware,  you wait, you wait, you wait a month, you wait two months, you wait three months,  you wait until every single backup has their audience.

Start time: 4412.02
End time: 4468.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you could do that.  In fact, I was reading the I mentioned this before.  Bloomberg Business Week had a really good  kind of minute by minute chronology of the Norsk Hydro ransomware attack  of last year, and that's exactly what happened.  The they didn't have they didn't pay a ransom.  But the bad guys got into the network  three months before they actually triggered the attack.  So that's why you do that.  You can see where the backups are stored.  You can make sure that you encrypt stuff  gradually so that the backups become superannuated.  Ten million dollars.  The other reason you might pay that is because everything's down.  And yeah, you might have backups, but the process of getting back up and running  might might be worth ten million dollars to you.  It just seems such a bad policy to pay that because that just tells everybody, yep,  it pays to ransom.

Start time: 4471.62
End time: 4478.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You're also giving them a war chest,  but every time you pay a ransom, you're letting them expand their operations.  Right. Wow.

Start time: 4479.72
End time: 4495.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And as somebody in the CJC in the chat room, you're taking a big chance  that these guys are you're going to pay them ten million dollars  and they're going to give you anything.  They must have had some sort of way of  validating that it must have been cheaper for them to pay as much as that was.

Start time: 4496.30
End time: 4525.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes, it absolutely would be cheaper  because disrupting business operations for a company is worth more than ten million  dollars. Sure. If it's five weeks or four weeks.  Yeah. But I mean, it really is the principle of the thing.  The thing is, you're not alone.  You are setting a precedent for your entire industry.  Yeah. And if everyone starts paying, the tax get more sophisticated.  They get better funded.  They get better equipment. They get more infrastructure.  They get a deeper hold.  So you are funding something that very likely will come around and hit you again.

It's kind of like why Snapchat was so  appealing back in, you know, when it first came out, just like it opened straight  to the camera on Snapchat, it opens straight to like stuff you actually want to watch  on TikTok so you can spend hours.

Transcript:  Well, I've said this before and I think this is a really good example.  Yeah. So and this is why I'm kind of irritated with the White House,  because I think that they're picking the here we are.  We're talking about big tech.  We brought Mark Zuckerberg to testify before Congress about he's too big.  You know, you're too dominant.  Here's this little upstart social media  network that is now the most popular in the world, beating Instagram  with the kids anyway, certainly beating Snapchat.  And now you want to you want to put it out of business because it's Chinese.  It's kind of annoying to me.  I think this is, first of all, a couple of things I really like about it is.  It it's a new medium and the kids who are using it,  you would never see them on Quibi.  The Quibi model is you raise two billion dollars.  You hire Hollywood producers, shooters, you know, camera operators, talent.  You produce very expensive programming in seven minute chunks.  Next step, probably watches and nobody  watched it because the problem with the Hollywood model is all of the expenses  upfront, all the effort is upfront and you hope that something will become a hit.  Most movies are flops.  But if one in ten is a hit, it makes so much money.  It pays for all the rest profit.  That was the Quibi model.  Tick tock models much more like the YouTube model.  You create something attractive that people like to use to create a tool that  people like to make stuff with, you create a platform where they're  reinforced for their work, that they people like them and share it.  And they get they get the feedback they like.  Not money, just the positive strokes.  And people will start creating millions of videos.  And then you use that algorithm to surface the stuff people want.  Yeah. Now, that's the system.

Start time: 4857.66
End time: 4897.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's exact opposite of the Hollywood system.  It's like YouTube and Facebook on Hulks here.  And like their algorithm is so good at showing you exactly what you want to watch  over and over and over again, and it's why like Instagram cloning it into  real stories, but real.  It doesn't work because they're they're just doing the dancing.  They're not showing you the dances you want to see.  They don't have the algorithm that tick tock figured out.  And I think that's I think that's part of it.  That one of the ways that got people scared because we've seen Facebook misuse  algorithms to say we're going to make you sad now or we're going to make you happy  now, and they're terrified that that kind of algorithm will be used to  to further agendas that are that are outside of general interest.

In fact, the biggest spy on of information would be Palantir, which is  paid by the government. Yeah.  So the question is, oh, they're not they're spying on you.  Therefore, they're bad.  That's they're spying on you for somebody else.  And we don't know who they're spying on you for.  Well, the fear is because they're a Chinese owned company that may be.

And I will get deep sea conspiracy theories for a month on YouTube.  And all of the same on Facebook.  Like people start looking for things and they become increasingly radicalized.

And she said they're starting to see that state sponsored actors  are fine tuning the process of driving social media to influence.  It's no longer just, oh, we want to ruin a reputation or we want to sow discord.  That's that's sort of generation one or maybe even generation two of using the  Internet to do this. This is driving particular sentiments.  Yes. And they're getting so good at it.

Transcript:  So so there is a potential threat from Tic-Tac, although I've never seen any  thing on Tic-Tac that has any any social, you know, any any serious.  It's mostly dance moves and jokes.  I suppose Tic-Tac could be used that way.  Is there evidence that it has been used that way by the Chinese government?

And if you can tie into that, I mean, it's not just a matter of knowing where to push.  It's knowing when to push.  Tic-Tac gives you the ability to know when to push.

I don't I don't feel like I have anything to add.  Are you a pop stan?  Are you on there?  I wish I could dance like that.  I wish I could do something, but I don't feel like any Tic-Tac wants to see me.  How about you, Renee? Have you done any Tic-Tac?

No, you know, I found out about it on Mac Break Weekly from Alex Lindsay when he  was explaining why Carly D'Amelio had so much appeal and how he was doing green  screen, like he was bringing ILM to a Tic-Tac fight, which is hilarious to me.  And that's I started looking at it and there are some real it is incredibly  engaging platform and people love it because your acceleration to popularity  on Tic-Tac is way faster than anything we've ever seen before, like way faster  than YouTube. You can go from zero to a million followers if you have the talent  and skill to pull off engaging videos, Tic-Tac will find you an audience fast.

Transcript:  So the president has wanted to ban a Tic-Tac.  He couldn't figure out a way to do it,  but I think he might have found a way with executive order.  He's going to prohibit Americans from having any transactions  with the parent company ByteDance starting September 20th.  That means Tic-Tac can't pay influencers.  Advertisers can't buy ads.  Tic-Tac's response to that is we will help influencers move to another platform.  We will pay.  We'll make sure that everybody we owe money to gets paid before September 20th.  The plan B, and it's very unclear because the president goes back and forth on this,  is to have some American company acquire at least the American operations of Tic-Tac.  Microsoft's been negotiating to buy the Australian, American,  Canadian and I think UK rights to Tic-Tac.  They have until the 15th.

Transcript:  You also have to remember that the way that the executive order was written,  he knows you can't block it and he doesn't even have the knowledge to understand how  that would even be possible. So he's stopping financial transactions.  The problem is the companies that he's trying to stop the financial transactions  with own like 60 percent of the gaming landscape.  Yeah.  Or they have interest in 60 percent of the gaming landscape.

Transcript:  WeChat and Tencent.  And the other problem is he had to declare a national emergency.  So apparently Tic-Tac is now a national emergency.  Not covid-19, not Russian efforts to influence the election.  Sometimes I feel like maybe this is.  I feel like there's a larger agenda from the White House.  It has to do with the trade war.  It has to do with pay no attention to Russia.  I'm not celebrating the Chinese government.  They're repressive.  What they've done to the Uighurs is shocking and disappointing and,  you know, horrible.  And there was some evidence that maybe Tic-Tac was doing something to  keep black creators down or to keep overweight people.  Although I see plenty of overweight people on Tic-Tac now.  So they clearly fixed that algorithm.  I just don't see Tic-Tac as that big of a threat.  And I am a little disappointed for the creators who found this incredible medium  to make something really amazing.  And I often even feel like maybe the president doesn't like the fact that he's  being made fun of on Tic-Tac and that Tic-Tacers registered for his Tulsa  campaign rally didn't show up.  And it seems to be personal.

But how do you, like, separate it out?  Separate it out so that I am I'm on Canadian and American Tic-Tac.  You're on UK Tic-Tac.  Can we not see each other anymore?  Can we? But the data is stored somewhere else.  It's just unclear.  There's so many questions that people who don't have no idea how software and  services work seem to want to manipulate.

Transcript:  People accuse me of saying, oh, you're soft on China, giving a pass.  And apparently there were big fights in the White House over that as well.  But I just don't see Tic-Tac as a threat.  There are some serious threats that are  being completely ignored from Russia on Facebook and Twitter that are just being  downplayed and ignored.  While Tic-Tac seems to be the poster child for problems.  And incidentally, it won't stop with Tic-Tac.  This is really about Chinese products and Chinese apps.  And that is really challenging.

Start time: 5450.92
End time: 5466.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  similarly, if you're worried about how it could be used by foreign actors to  influence us, you're not stopping it on Facebook and Twitter.

Transcript:  But there's that whole data repatriation thing we were talking about a while ago  when countries like China and France started saying they wanted the data for  their citizens stored on servers that were located within those countries.  I think Australia and a couple of other countries, because ironically,  they didn't trust necessarily Chinese or US servers because they didn't feel like  they had their best, you know, FISA warrants and things like that.  They didn't feel like they had the best interest of their citizens in mind.  And I think we're still going to see an upswell of data repatriation laws

Transcript:  Apple is hard because the hardware is such an important part of the economy of  southern China. They couldn't turn that off.  To shut down Apple hardware would devastate Sanjian and all the companies and all the  workers there. But Apple services could be an easy target.  And it is interesting because right now some people see a disparity.  Like China will not accept anyone saying anything about Chinese policy.  Like you saw when the NBA commented about Hong Kong or other people, they were  furious. But it goes one way.  They don't mind commenting on at all on how the US or Canada or other countries.  And the same way they get upset if Chinese services like Huawei or something are not  allowed access into Western markets.  But they have no qualms about banning Twitter and Facebook and all the services in  China. And I think it's I forget to say that it might have been Ben Thompson because  he lives in Taiwan. He's really smart about this.  That we insist on viewing China from an American point of view when we very seldom  take the opportunity to look at America from a Chinese point of view.

And really, it's like half of one percent.  They're just incredibly loud.  And I think that's what's happening here is that there's a sentiment of quid pro quo.  If you hit us, we hit you back.  That's very different than when we're like, oh, we'll just send Beatles tapes and  blue jeans to Russia. It'll be fine.  We don't have to act like Russia.  We have to act like the West and Russia will see it's better to be this way.  And that trend has been curtailed significantly over the last few years.  Yeah.

And then they mentioned China and other  countries who have an interest in Iran, who have an interest in winning, who wins,  but don't necessarily actually aren't necessarily actually doing anything as if  it's related, the same thing. Yeah.  And I will see.  This is the third reward offered by the RFJ for foreign hackers this year.  They had a five million dollar reward in April for information on North Korean  government hackers.

And it feels like when Intel went away from having engineering and technical leads  and started putting marketing people in charge, it was the same thing.  It's like these server chips are bringing in a fortune and that success hid all  of these problems and underneath them, there was just no direction on the  engineering and their process.  No, like their architecture slipped and they said, oh, seven nanometers not going  to be affected by the slowdown in 10 nanometer.  You know, it's a different thing.

Like, why? Why?  There's no reason to do that.  And it's just so interesting as someone who hasn't been following that as closely  to just sort of come back into this fear and go, hang on a minute.  What happened?  AMD is now making these.  Yeah, it's like Ryzen.  What the heck? Where did that come from?  It's just really interesting to see, you know, the battle flipped on its head.  Yeah. So, I mean, I as an interested  observer, rather than someone who is like deep into the weeds with it all the time,  I I just welcome the competition.  And considering that I built my first PC in a very, very long time and I chose to do  it with the new AMD Ryzen, you know, the cheaper one that just came out.  There was a reason why I chose that.

You know, this is high tech with just the right amount of both sink and bounce.  I don't know how they do it, but they've done it.  We love our Casper mattresses.  And I say that in plural.  Casper kind of invented this whole idea of instead of having a store,  a middleman that marks it up 100 percent.  Why don't we sell direct to customers?  But first, they had to engineer an amazing mattress.  And that's what they did.  The original Casper mattress cleverly designed to mimic human curves,  giving supportive comfort for all kinds of bodies.  You spend a third of your life sleeping.  You should be comfortable.  The original Casper combines multiple  supportive memory phones for a quality sleep surface with the right amount of  both just both sink and bounce.  Its breathable design helps you sleep cool on these hot summer nights.  I'm so glad. I'm so glad it regulates your body temperature throughout the night.  Now, this is not the original.  I am now I am now rocking the Casper hybrid.  I love this mattress combines the pressure relief of the award winning foam  with durable yet gentle springs, even even Sammy, our little black and white cat  just loves here she comes, here she comes to spend a little time with me.  On the Casper, she even  he even she loves they come in those little compact,  surprisingly compact boxes, that's a king size mattress.  You open it up and  it's ready to go.

Transcript:  I mix of both just because there is a glut of streaming services and, you know,  with all the time in the world, let's try it all.  There's a lot of TV to watch.  I think the sort of the tipping point for me was when I  I think when I moved to the US and all of the streaming services and YouTube just  opened up for me, so I think it was probably a little later just because in  Australia, you know, Internet connectivity was not particularly good,  at least for much of the country, it is improving, but it's nowhere near the level  of access and, you know, fiber and stuff that is in the US.  So the reach of YouTube and, you know,  other video services like Vimeo, it wasn't as good of an experience as it is here.  And so that, I think, stopped my interest in sort of getting into watching YouTube  primarily for a little while. But yeah, that was probably like six,  seven years ago now. So, you know, I would have been much earlier.  Had the Internet been good enough.

I think my son, same thing, he hasn't watched TV probably ever.  I think we watched The Office when it was on and that was the last thing he watched.  So good question, Robert. Yeah.  But but what really has happened,  I think mostly is not that YouTube has pushed TV out.  Maybe it has for the youngs, but that it's just become a compliment.  So now we just have, like you said,  Lexi, we have an infinite amount of content to watch, although it's a little depressing.  There's no new movies.  I want to watch it even worse next year.

Start time: 6914.44
End time: 6984.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But it's instant gratification.  That's why TV can't compete, like at least traditional TV, because it was fixed  programming, fixed length, willing to sit through commercials.  And they're sure there is ads on YouTube, but you can stop, start, go everywhere.  And we know, like we know this through everything, even video games.  People will not pay for something,  but they'll pay for like instant and equal gratification.  They'll pay unlimited amounts of money for that.  And that's what a lot of social feeds and and YouTube videos and streaming services  capitalize on. And I forget what it was, but someone said they had to change their  entire TV show because, oh, it was there was a video explaining how they changed  that Arlo Finch movie when they realized it was going to go on to Disney+.  They basically re redid the entire beginning of the movie.  And if you watch it, no one talks on camera because they had to change  everything and then do everything through ADR.  Because if someone goes to the movie theater, they watch the whole movie and  there's word of mouth. But on a streaming service, if you don't get what you want  in the first five minutes, you switch to something else.  So they couldn't make him a villain in the movie because they thought it would  turn off people on streaming services who weren't stuck there for the entire movie  to find out that he's redeemed.  They had to change the entire movie to make him redeemed at the beginning, just  not to alienate viewers. And I lost my mind watching this.

Transcript:  You know, that's a really interesting thing, because especially during this time,  the separation between work and recreation, the line is incredibly blurred.  So what I do is create content all the time, and then then I sit down and relax  and watch content.  And it's just like I'm producing it as I'm watching it.  So it's really interesting to sort of have that weird disconnect going on in my brain  because it's no longer relaxation.  It's now just an extension of the day.  But I think to the points that we've just already brought up about, like change  the nature of how content is changing, I don't necessarily know if it's a bad idea.  It's a bad thing because it's giving the opportunity to tell stories  in a completely different way.  And that's kind of what I like about how all of the different streaming services  are kind of experimenting with how they're producing content.  And we talked earlier about Quibi not doing it the way that is sort of, you know,  mobile first, which is what it should have been.  It should have been like the TikTok Instagram model of like creators,  you know, in YouTube, making content that resonates with a specific audience  and doing it really, really well and not necessarily high budget.  But, you know, going the other way, making it super high budget and super produced  and the Hollywood model just doesn't translate.  And so I think all these platforms are suddenly realizing that.  And you see the shows that are being commissioned, you know, on the Hulu's,  on the HBO Max's, they're taking more risks, I think, than if they were being  produced in another environment.  So I kind of like the fact that things are changing and shifting.  Maybe that's just because it's the way I kind of grew up watching all of these  different forms of content in different spaces and how they all adapt.  So I think it's not necessarily a bad thing.  It can be used in a really cool way to tell stories.  I know that I've been watching so much content over this whole past few months.  And I've actually found like a lot of really interesting shows.  The narratives are like a totally different to what I would normally go for.  And it's just like, oh, I never thought of doing it like that.  That's actually really, really smart.  So, you know, some things are going to it's not going to work for everything.  But I think for some reason it's not it's not all doom and gloom for absolutely  every piece of content, because if you're sitting down and watching a movie,  you're setting yourself up for like that experience over two hours and you have  to mentally put yourself in that headspace.  But if it's on a different platform, you have a little bit more flexibility  with the audience or they're just going to be on their phones.  I don't know which one is going to be probably going to be the latter, isn't it?

So if you're in short form, it's very interesting.  So I don't I don't want to be that old guy.  Is there going to be clouds?  Is there going to be room?  Just I'm asking for a friend.

Transcript:  Yeah, I still have to write, but it's actually quite interesting  because the video is more like that.  This is me, my personality, the free form of thoughts and my experiences  using it and how I think it's what's going to be interesting to the audience.  And I kind of try and inject in some of the videos that I do  a little bit of humor and a little bit of, you know, that kind of reason  why you watch YouTube, right? Right.  And then you kind of have to shift your brain into going, all right,  now let's condense all of those kind of a little bit free form,  you know, slightly more unscripted into something that is structured  and, you know, written down on paper.  That's the part I hate.  And yes, because but the thing is, the good thing about it  is it actually really helps crystallize.  It's important. I completely agree.  So important.  But it's hard because you've done all the work like you've made a video  and you've poured your heart and soul into it.  And then you go, all right, I got to write a thousand words on this.  All right, here we go.  Oh, do I have it in me? Writing is thinking.

Now more than ever, we really want to provide the best service to our customers.  And this is the way to do it.  I just want to make one quick note.  I always save the obituaries to the end.  This isn't, this isn't a sad obituary.  Well, it sort of is.  I wanted to mention Frances E.  Allen.  Yeah.  Not well known.  Unless you're a language, you're a coder like Lexi or you're a language fan,  but her story is really remarkable.  She was born on a farm without running water in Peru, New York, 88 days ago.  She died August 4th on her 88th birthday.  So 88 plus a few days ago, years ago, I should say, not days, 88 years ago.  She wanted to be a teacher.  She graduated from the New York State College for teachers.  It's now SUNY Albany.  She was up there in upper New York state.  She got a bachelor's in mathematics.  In 1954 began teaching math in school back in Peru, New York.  Uh, two years later, she decided I like math.  She wanted to get an MS in math.  She went to the university of Michigan, earned her masters in 1957, but was kind  of crippled as many, uh, many of us are with student loans.  So she said, you know, before I go back to teach, cause that was her first love.  I'm going to get a quick job, make some money at IBM research in  Poughkeepsie as a programmer.  This is back in 1957.  She never left 45 years later.  She ended her career at IBM when she retired.  She taught incoming employees for Tran.  Um, she retired in 2002 was still a fellow emeritus.  She became an IBM fellow, which is the highest award, uh, IBM can give you  and won the touring award, the highest award computer science can give you  because she was a pioneer in compilers, compiler organization and optimization  algorithms, she made contributions that have changed the way software is  made even to this day, her work on inter procedural analysis and automatic  parallelization is currently the leading edge of compiler research, even though  she did that work in the sixties and seventies, um, an amazing person.  And I want to acknowledge her because I don't think she's well known in the, to  the general public, even to the technical public, she's probably well known to  anybody who's ever designed a compiler or learned about how compilers work.  She was the first female IBM fellow, the first female winner of the touring award,  a fellow of the trip IEEE and the ACM.  They even created the IEEE Francis E.  Allen medal in her honor passed away of Alzheimer's at the age of 88 this week.  And I, I, I think it's so important.  She was through the rest of her life, an advocate for women in STEM and women  in coding and God knows we desperately need more diversity, um, in the software  and hardware that we use every day.  Because, you know, if it's got only the point of view of a bunch of white guys,  it's just not going to be the software we want, the software we need,  the software we deserve.  So, uh, you should remember Francis E.  Allen.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's something there that I think everyone needs to remember.  And that is today we take it for granted that you can have a compiler.  Yeah.  There's several different types of compilers.  There's ways to organize your code, but there had to be someone who started  with the idea that there's a more efficient way to program a computer  than flipping switches.  There's, there's a, there's a shared language that we can create that will  help us organize our thoughts into something that can actually be run  through a computational machine.  Yeah.  The first person to do that had to be visionary.  I mean, now we know it's possible.  It's like, it's like the first time that you go into space, that's when you  have to be visionary after that, you're duplicating, you're trying to enhance.  But that first effort out the door needs to get so much recognition because it  laid the foundation for everything, everything that came after.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Uh, it's the thing that turns something sort of human readable into something  the machine can act upon.  Lexi, I'm sure knows it.  What languages did you code in?

Start time: 8198.12
End time: 8205.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, lots of things.  See C plus plus, uh, Java.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, wait, wait, but what did you learn on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  No, I loved it.

Start time: 8212.84
End time: 8266.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why I was like this Kernahan and Richie, the C programming  language is this thick.  It was the first language, the first real language I learned.  I learned basic of course, but the first real language I learned was C.  And to this day, I consider it elegant, beautiful, a real masterpiece.  Of course, they started me with Fortran.  Oh, I'm so sorry.  I learned Pascal because I had to in the early days of the Macintosh.  That's how you coded it.  Pascal is kind of a nightmare.  C just feels natural and beautiful.  Of course it has plenty of pitfalls and a lot of the bugs and exploits we get in  code today really goes back to that idea that we're going to make a language so  powerful that the programmer can dig a hole for herself and fall right into it.  Nobody, but Steve, Steve gives us the last guy.  See, he's very close to the metal.

Start time: 8267.68
End time: 8271.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  I have respect for anyone who can write high level in assembly.

Start time: 8271.72
End time: 8298.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, as somebody, I wrote a lot of assembly code early on because I hated  Pascal so much, I ended up writing a 68,000 assembler for the Mac and it was  actually easier than Pascal.  What happens and I guarantee you it's what's happened with Steve is as you do  it, you eventually you start writing macros and in effect you create your  own high level language.  So you're writing in a language that is much more fluent than typing, you know,  move six to four.

Start time: 8299.84
End time: 8305.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If you're proficient in assembly, you've essentially created your own compiler  because you've got a library of you're the compiler.

Start time: 8306.92
End time: 8332.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're the compiler.  Yeah.  I actually loved writing 68,000 assembler because it was, it has a flat memory  model.  It was very straightforward at a very logical instruction set.  And then I took a look at the 8086 and I said, I'm never writing assembly code  for this thing.  It's a nightmare.  It's a nightmare.  You wrote a great piece this week on CNET Lexi on black girls code.  Tell us about that.

Start time: 8334.04
End time: 8470.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I had the great honor of talking to Kimberly Bryant.  She's the CEO and founder of black girls code.  And we had a really wide ranging discussion and something that's personally a  big passion point for me is getting more women in the industry and especially  women of color, because, you know, we all know that women are super under  represented in the tech industry and women of color, especially.  So, you know, Kimberly really brought some great points to our discussion that,  you know, women of color have just been, you know, less and less and less of them  are following through into positions within the tech industry.  So it's, you know, when she was studying engineering back in when she was  studying, I think in the 80s, you know, the representation levels were around 30 percent.  And now if you look at the numbers of women of color in  title positions and STEM careers, it's around three percent.  So it's very clear that there needs to be a lot more representation.  And her organization is doing some great work in making sure that, you know, these  young girls are getting the support, the resources and the education to do things.  It's not just coding.  It's everything from, you know, experimenting with virtual reality,  getting into robotics and even the makers sort of style of things.  It's fantastic what they're doing.  And I just I really wanted to profile her and just, you know, get the opportunity  to talk to her. So you have a chance.  Go check it out. It was a really great discussion.  And we discussed everything from, you know, systemic inequalities,  how companies can better diversify, you know, not only their workforce,  but also their companies from the ground up.  Because a great point was she brought up was that it's no, you know,  it's great to have tech companies thinking about diversity and hiring.  But, you know, if the structures of these companies are not set up to support  those employees, then, you know, it's it's a really uphill battle.  So really just working out actually structurally how to make those changes.  So tech companies are really built from the ground up to support  is the most important thing.  And, yeah, just making sure that there is a, you know, a great pipeline  of young women who are, you know, keen, ready to go and super passionate  because they are and they're there.  It's just about, OK, let's make sure that they actually have  a supportive network and a place where they can continue the great work that they do.

Start time: 8471.86
End time: 8513.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's really true that it's a systemic issue.  Racism is a systemic issue in general.  And because it's in the built into the system, you don't see it.  So you say, well, look, we've got we've got all these black kids  coming in and learning how to code. See, we fixed it.  It's not it at all.  You have to create an environment that that not only brings people in,  but nurtures them and gives them an opportunity and gives them a shot.  And I meant it when I said the last thing you want is a bunch of bros  designing your hardware and software.  That is a recipe for disaster, for failure.  And, you know, we really it's really important.  I don't I don't think it's something we should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a systemic problem, you know.  And and I'm sure Lexi, you felt that as a woman coming in,  you're the one woman on a team of coders.  They may be nice people.  They may not be bad people.  They may not even be sexist people.  But you're not in a positive, healthy environment.

Start time: 8538.06
End time: 8637.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's really interesting because it's not just in the environment  that you might think like, you know, studying and, you know, in colleges  and universities, it actually even has pervaded the workforce  and workplace experiences in, you know, in the reporting on the tech industry.  There has been a number of events that I can, you know,  I can think of for the top of my head, at least four or five where  as a female tech journalist, I was just assumed not to be interested  in the technical side of the briefing.  And then instead, I was sent with a group of lifestyle journalists  to that particular briefing.  And then I'd be like, I think I'm in the wrong room because all my colleagues  and all the people that I'm normally with are in that room over there.  And I don't know. That's the technical briefing.  No, no, that's that's what I'm actually here for.  I'm I'm not writing for a lifestyle publication.  I am writing for a technical audience.  So I need to be in that room.  So it's just interesting, those implicit biases that, you know, have come across.  It's incredible.  Over the course of my career, it has gotten significantly better,  but there's still a lot of work to be done.  And, you know, I think now the focus needs to be on diversity  and getting people from a range of different backgrounds, people of color.  This is very, very important that we don't just have, you know,  a monochrome tech industry, because you think of everybody.  Tech is touched and used by everybody.  So as you say, like having just one group of people creating,  you know, the devices and the software that we use  is not going to solve those bigger problems.  We need to have a variety of voices, because there's problems  that we don't even think about that are not being solved right now.  And to have make sure that those voices are being heard  and those products are being developed can only be a good thing.

Start time: 8640.82

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I see it in OPSEC in the world of OPSEC,  because the best red and blue teams are the most diverse teams.  Oh, interesting.  You don't want a lot of people who are very competent, very good,  because they're all going to think the same thing.

Start time: 8651.44
End time: 8739.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  That makes perfect sense.  This was a complaint people had about TikTok.  I thought it was interesting.  A number of black creators said.  It's not it's not an outright racism,  but there's this co-opting of black culture that happens on TikTok  and the white people doing the black rap is what rises to the top at TikTok.  And it's like that.  It's so hard.  It's so insidious and so hard to see it.  That it's the same with the music industry in general.  Exactly.  And I think of the contribution black people have made to culture.  It's so it really, frankly, outsized that it'd be a shame to just for,  you know, because of laziness or inertia,  not try to get that DNA into everything we do,  including the hardware and software, the technology  and certainly the point of view of women into.  And, you know, it's just it's hard.  I you say it's getting better, Lexi.  I'm not convinced about that.  I feel like people like Brianna Wu, when we talk about Gamergate  and the resistance from gamers to anything that might imply  that maybe gaming could be a little bit more diverse and a little bit more inclusive.  Strikes me as a problem in the long run.  So by the way, you took this would be good.  Next time you go into one of those rooms, bring Spot along with you.

Start time: 8740.98
End time: 8759.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, a spot.  Yes, head spot into into the room for me.  This was fun.  I got the opportunity to remotely drive spot a Boston Dynamics spot robot,  the quadruped robot from my couch, which you can see I'm sitting on right now  and walking around San Francisco.  So it was so much fun.

Start time: 8778.72
End time: 8819.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Skip, skip a bit forward into the video.  So this is what you see.  Yes. So this is the viewpoint of Spot.  So this is technology that's powered by a company called Formant.  They're a San Francisco based startup.  They're essentially connecting robots to the Internet  and giving humans the ability to both monitor and remotely control.  So using Spot as an example, I was actually able to see like the interface  of basically what Spot sees in its camera.  And that was the main thing on my screen.  As you can see, I'm using a PlayStation 3 controller.  A lot of people were like, why are you using a PS3 controller?  Like, this is the only controller I have in quarantine.  It's funny.  I'm sorry to have a PS5.  What's wrong with that?

It's for a range of different robots, you know, underwater drones,  you know, other sort of drones, robotics used in agriculture.  It's a kind of drone.  Yeah, it's anything where a human, it's going to be more difficult to be able to manage a fleet of robots in person.  So any sort of robotic application that you can think of that needs remote management,  not only for someone controlling it, but also for someone to kind of keep monitoring it, say, for example, like,  oh, XYZ robot needs maintenance now or, you know, the motor is acting up a little bit strange.  So this interface gives humans a bunch of different, it gets all the data points from the robot and you can actually remotely manage it.  This was just a fun way to show that I could drive a seventy five thousand dollar robot and I crashed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was really fun because actually, as I was moving the robot, they were kind of mimicking the movement as well.  They were kind of like tilting their head either side.  There were a few people that stopped to take selfies.  You know, some people that there was a kind of a stalemate situation where I was ready to cross a bridge and then the human stopped.  But I couldn't get past because they were just staring, watching, going, I don't know what to do.  It's just really interesting to see like human robot interaction.  It's something that we're going to be we're going to have to get used to.  You went down a street?  That wasn't me. Full disclosure, that is footage from this.  This is terrifying.

She said 8 a.m. I am Pacific.  I'm jumping out of bed to buy the analog pocket.  I would think for you, Robert, it's a Gameboy.  It's a modern Gameboy based on FPGAs.

It's got adapters that will let it work with a game gear, a Neo Geo and an Atari Lynx,  which is actually what I would love to use it with.  Unfortunately, I got up at eight forty five and.  Gone sold out.  Well, I mean, Nick and Nirvana.  Yeah, I was not a Nintendo guy, but Karsten was apparently because he got up  and he got it and he told his son, this is your birthday present, Zach.  You have two choices. You can play with it or you can sell it  unused on eBay for a lot more money than we paid for it.  And you can go into your college fund.  So I told Karsten I would.  Good. You got two bids, Karsten. They're bidding it up.  Holy cow. They're bidding it up.  He started at twelve hundred bucks.  It's now thirteen twenty five. The analog pocket.  But this is the deluxe thing with the dock and the case and the whole chamille  unused two days and twenty three hours left.  It expires Wednesday afternoon at four sixteen.  Are you going to snipe it, Leo?  I'm thinking about it.  Depends where it gets. Is this or a galaxy fold?  I don't know.

Frousey, frousey.  And by the way, since it's Karsten,  you know, you know, you're going to get it.  There's lots of other people selling these.  But this is the guy who's got got one or will have one.  It doesn't actually come out for a while.  So you won't you won't actually get it till  I don't know when next year, I think.

I really appreciate it.  You're very kind. Thank you so much.  My pleasure. Thank you for being here.  And of course, Renee Ritchie, who is the gift that keeps on giving every Tuesday  on MacBreak Weekly and of course, on his YouTube channel, YouTube.com  slash Renee Ritchie.  This was fun to have three of my favorite people on today.  Thank you all for being here.  I'll see you Tuesday, Renee.  And you guys, well, I'll see you next Sunday.  We do it every Sunday afternoon about to two thirty Pacific.  That's five thirty Eastern.  That's twenty one thirty UTC.  There is a live stream.  It's just a making of behind the scenes thing.  That's in fact, you would know about the Jaffal maker if you tuned in early,  because that was all before the show began.  Twitter dot TV slash live, there's live audio and video.  A little programming note, we have moved the audio server.  We're doing a redirect.  Most people should not know, notice the difference.  But if you're having a little trouble  with your VLC or whatever you've streamed the audio with before, that's why.  Go to Twit dot TV slash live to link it up again.  The links are there.  Twitter TV slash live on demand versions of the show at the website.  Twitter TV, of course, takes a couple of hours after the show's done to  whip it into shape.  But we have a Jaffal maker for that now, which will make it a lot easier.  Just turn the edges and everything will be done.  Twitter TV as the website and on demand, of course, on YouTube  from your Amazon Echo or other voice assistant.  You just ask for this week in tech podcast.  It'll play for you.  You know, the easiest thing to do would be find a podcast application,  Pocket Cast or Shoutcast or Spotify or I go on Google or Apple's podcast app  and subscribe. That way you get it automatically.  We like to say you're the what is it?  What is it we say your first show in tech is the first show of the week  is the last word in tech or something like that.  I don't even remember. It's been so long.  Thank you for being here.  We'll see you next time. Another tweet is in the Jaffal maker.
