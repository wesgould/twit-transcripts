Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was so nice to have you. It's nice to me.  Thank you.  For some reason, I just feel like I know you so well. I was stunned to learn you'd actually we'd actually never met.  We've never met.  Still haven't met because I have an invisible barrier between you and me right now.  Yeah, I'm not even here. I'm just broadcasting from home.  Yeah, thank you so much.  It's so nice to meet you finally.  Thank you.  Yep.  We've never met in person.  Yeah, good to be here, man.  All right. You know, there's so many people I haven't met, but here's two guys I have.  I've known for years, many, many years.  Roger Chang.  Hello.  At producer at Tekzilla and the host.  And what else do you do these days?

Start time: 184.04
End time: 185.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I am also a producer for Downloaded.

Start time: 186.04
End time: 197.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a, you know, you've got to put the mic in front of the laptop, not behind it, unless you're speaking into the laptop.  That's the Jim Latterback show.  Yes.  That's basically, you said, a ripoff of Cranky Geeks.  No, it's like Cranky Geeks with a lot of food.

Start time: 197.26
End time: 203.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, so they can't take it. They just, you know, we do these things.  The next thing you know, people are just stealing them left and right.  Copying left and right.

Start time: 203.46
End time: 209.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, this show is a ripoff of Cranky Geeks, except it predates it.  So I guess that Cranky Geeks would be a ripoff of this show.

Start time: 209.02
End time: 212.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, this show and Cranky Geeks was never designed to be similar.

Start time: 212.93
End time: 215.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, they're both ripoffs of Silicon Spin, really.  Right.

Start time: 216.06
End time: 239.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Silicon Spin, there, yeah.  Which is a ripoff of the first pilot I made for CNET, which John was on.  How far is this going to go back?  Which is a ripoff of the Robotlin Group.  Wrong.  Wrong.  So it's all a ripoff of everything else.  You just need the jowls.  John C. Dvorak is here. Channeldvorak.com.  I'm here.  He's a major Bitcoin advocate, and he's here to tell us all about the new currency that's sweeping America.  Yeah, absolutely.

Transcript:  Bitcoin is for you.

Start time: 244.00
End time: 282.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what? We could talk about Bitcoin, because there's still a little energy in the room,  because we were talking before the show about it.  I read a book.  You're a big fan of Bitcoin.  I'm not. I just think it's very interesting.  Why?  Well, of course, the first place that we got interested in was just merely the cryptographic mathematical background of it,  which is kind of interesting.  For those who don't know, Bitcoin is a non-governmental currency that is generated by solving very hard numeric problems.  You assign a computer to do it.  In the early days, it was easy. It gets harder and harder.  And there's a limited number of Bitcoins, I believe 21 million, which they expect will be fully in circulation by 2140.  It's going to take a while.

Start time: 283.44
End time: 289.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How do they know there's that many? A. And B, if they know there's that many?  It's artificially set at that many.

Start time: 289.02
End time: 313.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, then how do they...  And that's to make it deflationary, to not be inflationary, right?  I don't care. It's bullcrap.  So, well, I agree. There's a point to that. It's maybe a deflationary currency.  Now, how do they know you have a legitimate Bitcoin?  Oh, there's a very good system for storing Bitcoins. There's no physical entity, of course. There's no coin in Bitcoins.  No, it's a number.  It's a number.  And you mine.  And you have a wallet.

Start time: 314.02
End time: 325.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But there's no mining involved. There's no hose or shovels.  No, the mining is solving a tough mathematical problem.  What's interesting is that...  Is it the same mathematical problem every time?  No, it's a variety of things.  Then why would it be different? Then why would that make a coin?

Start time: 326.86
End time: 329.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because it's an invention.

Start time: 330.02
End time: 333.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Couldn't this better use of this work and effort be put someplace else?

Start time: 334.00
End time: 369.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's an interesting point because somebody just estimated about $150,000 a year in energy cost to generating the Bitcoin,  because Bitcoin miners...  One Bitcoin?  No, no. The current amount of Bitcoin being generated every year.  So much.  Because in order to generate Bitcoins, it gets harder and harder. It's designed to get harder and harder.  It's an interesting story. It's designed by a guy who is anonymous, maybe a group we don't know.  Does that make you suspicious?  Well, no, because you don't really want to become well-known as a guy developing an extra...  You don't think it's Max Keiser?  ...extra-governmental...  He's got an exchange, maybe?  $150,000 a day.  In power consumption.  A day.

Start time: 370.61
End time: 371.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, so it's for the greenies.

Start time: 372.02
End time: 400.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So, yeah, I'm trying to find the... I mean, the value itself is just set by the market and whatever...  That's right. And there are a number of exchanges, the best known as Mt. Gox.  But the problem is it's an asset, and like any asset, it's going to suffer...  It's not a physical asset, however.  But it doesn't matter. I mean, mentally, when people approach it, I mean, real estate, it might be a physical asset,  but when people deal with it, it's through dollar transactions, typically, through your bank, and all you see is a bunch of numbers.

Start time: 401.00
End time: 402.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So would you rather have a Bitcoin and just some...

Start time: 403.10
End time: 407.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I can't sleep on a Bitcoin, and I can't eat a Bitcoin, and I can't fashion a weapon out of a Bitcoin.

Start time: 408.00
End time: 432.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The thing that I find interesting about Bitcoin is that it's really saying something a little bit about currency in general,  which is it is, you know, our currency, the greenback dollar, which is probably the most trusted currency in the world...  It's the only reserve currency in the world.  It's what they call a fiat currency. Its value exists purely because of the faith of the users, the faith in the US government, of course.

Start time: 433.21
End time: 445.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't see that any different than gold. The value of gold is...  Very similar, because there's some physical value to gold.  Except there's a minimum.  But it's not much. It's certainly not...  But you can't just print gold, but it's still that same kind of thing. It's imaginary.

Start time: 445.70
End time: 452.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But once the dollar was eliminated from gold and silver backing in the days of Nixon, then it really was just a piece of paper, right?

Start time: 452.72
End time: 455.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, actually, let's start with Roosevelt, who confiscated all the gold.

Start time: 456.46
End time: 467.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the thing that I find interesting is that there can A, be an extra governmental currency.  And the notion of Bitcoin is that it protects privacy, just as cash protects privacy.

Start time: 468.00
End time: 472.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Apparently, every Bitcoin transaction is so carefully traced that it doesn't protect privacy at all.

Start time: 473.00
End time: 477.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the only identity you know is... you have a numeric identity. You don't have a real identity.

Start time: 478.52
End time: 489.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But you do have an identity that can be tracked back somehow.  If the NSA wanted to find out who numbers 666668910...  That's interesting. I don't know.  They could do that and then you say, well, that guy's been buying a lot of drugs.

Start time: 489.98
End time: 502.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's actually the main use right now of Bitcoin is the imaginary website Silk Road, where people are buying drugs with Bitcoin.  The imaginary site.  Well, you can't go to silkroad.com. You have to kind of...  You have to know the secret handshake password.

Start time: 502.14
End time: 507.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what I was going to ask. I'm a little ignorant on this subject. What is it mainly used for?  What do you kind of answer that?

Start time: 508.82
End time: 515.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, but it's not designed to be used in any way different from money.  Though I think what it is is kind of an interesting philosophical...

Start time: 517.05
End time: 519.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's a great way to basically launder money.

Start time: 519.16
End time: 534.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But what is money really, right? Money is imaginary. Money is an agreed hallucination.  It's a social contract.  It doesn't have to be backed by a government. In fact, it was only recently in the last 100 or so years that government had anything to do with it.

Start time: 534.10
End time: 541.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But gold isn't backed by government and people were trading those...  You know, go to any kind of...  Your people were trading jade, as you said.  Jade.

Start time: 542.39
End time: 543.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Blue feathers.

Start time: 543.90
End time: 552.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Anything. Yap stones. Giant, oversized, impractical means of trade.  But I mean, people have all agreed, at least up to a point, that...

Start time: 553.24
End time: 564.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's also interesting that Bitcoin arouses such energy in people like John.  I would think you'd be in favor because it's a currency that is private and non-governmental.

Start time: 564.34
End time: 587.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's not private, I just mentioned. Non-governmental doesn't bother me.  I mean, I could go trade euros if I didn't want to be hounded by the US government.  You'd be hounded by the...  Worse. I don't like it because it's suspect. It's got this unknown origin. It's trading at all kinds of different weird prices.  You've got Max Keiser coming out saying it's going to be worth $100,000 a coin, maybe a million.

Start time: 588.02
End time: 614.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a great story which I'm sure is well floated among Bitcoin users of the guy who a couple of years ago bought a pizza with Bitcoin,  which at the time was worth a few bucks, but now would be about $1.6 million, a very expensive pizza.  Yeah, to say the least.  Because there's a lot of speculation in Bitcoin. Bitcoin's been very volatile. It went up a lot.  It was just at a record high and almost immediately plummeted because there was a big sell-off on Mt. Gox.  There's the plummet right there on the graph.

Start time: 615.24
End time: 630.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Actually, there's a conspiracy behind that or conspiracy theory behind that that people are trying to drive up  or a group of people are trying to drive up the price of Bitcoin and they sell causing the value of the Bitcoin to drop.  And then they buy some more.  So they basically...

Start time: 631.00
End time: 639.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's speculation. It's absolutely, I would say, vulnerable to that kind of speculation,  especially as people like us and lots of people in the geek community and lots of...

Start time: 640.00
End time: 662.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, this is one of the things that bothers me is I'll bring up this distrust, let's say, of Bitcoin,  and I'll get a whole bunch of stuff flack from, oh, you're a technologist. I don't understand how you don't subscribe to this.  You're an idiot. You obviously don't understand the mechanism.  And they go on and on and this whole thing just kind of reeks of just some sour weirdness that I really don't trust.

Start time: 663.08
End time: 668.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, that's why you don't trust because you don't fully understand the mechanism  and you're not going to put your money into something that some people do.

Start time: 669.14
End time: 708.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would submit it's even worse than that.  I think that people don't really want to think about the fact that there's nothing at all supporting the value of currency,  that it is merely a consensual hallucination.  We don't really want to delve into the fact that paper money or even US coins have no real value.  It's what we say it is.  And the fact that the government two years ago printed billions of new dollars out of nowhere, it's unsettling to people.  It works. And in fact, that may be one of the flaws of Bitcoin is that you can't make new Bitcoin.  You can only make, by the end of the game, 21 million.  If people hoard it, it's very deflationary because you can't...

Start time: 709.02
End time: 716.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, that was one of the issues with the gold standards.  You cannot get enough gold to actually cover everything unless you decide to make...

Start time: 717.00
End time: 743.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, you could use the same model that the Bitcoins have and you just keep subdividing.  The limited number of gold in the world, although they do find some every once in a while,  which is like printing money the way I see it.  But anyway, well, mainly because in 1949 during the gold rush,  there was something like 30 trillion dollars of new gold and silver injected into the economy by today's numbers.  Anyway, so you could do what Bitcoin does with gold if you wanted to.  But people shave the coins.

Start time: 744.58
End time: 746.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's true. Bitcoin can be infinitely divided.

Start time: 747.12
End time: 748.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Which in a way kind of...

Start time: 750.08
End time: 767.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People give me fractional Bitcoins. We accept Bitcoin donations.  Not because I... It's just because it's fun.  And people want us to do that. And I said, fine.  We've received about one and a half Bitcoins over the last few weeks.  Does Ford pay you in Bitcoins?  No, we better not. We want American dollar.  There it is. There it is.

Start time: 768.10
End time: 771.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  As fiat as that currency is, you'll take it happily.

Start time: 772.22
End time: 790.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Happily. Well, I just I find it fascinating and I don't really have an interest one way or the other in it.  But I do think it's... I'm actually reading a great book called The End of Money that's about this whole notion of what is money.  Why, for instance, do we not move to an electronic currency? Why do we have pennies? Why do we have coins?

Start time: 791.22
End time: 794.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So you'd rather have electronic everything so we can be tracked like dogs.

Start time: 795.18
End time: 802.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's exactly who's against it, which is why I was so surprised that you were so anti Bitcoin, because that's the point.  One of the big points. Is your savings in your mattress?

Start time: 803.28
End time: 804.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes. As opposed to leaving your...

Start time: 805.18
End time: 810.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where's the mattress? Just so I know for future reference, in case anything happens to you.  Yeah, somewhere you won't find it.

Start time: 811.06
End time: 812.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's in a guest mattress. Bitcoin's currently at 96.

Start time: 814.32
End time: 834.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's very low because they were almost... They were well over 200 bucks on Wednesday.  Ludicrous. So there's been a Bitcoin crash.  I think it's fascinating. I frankly, I don't care and I would like everything to be electronic.  Dollars have a huge cost.  Yes.  Pennies do.  But it is the only way we can anonymously transact.

Start time: 834.96
End time: 844.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You can barter stuff. I mean, money is essentially whatever a universal agreement on what medium of exchange you use.  There are Ithaca dollars.

Start time: 844.06
End time: 845.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's take a look at what's going on in the EU.

Start time: 846.04
End time: 847.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The town of Ithaca, you get to this...

Start time: 849.00
End time: 852.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, and they're useless outside of...  But Ithaca, they're worth cash money.

Start time: 852.04
End time: 893.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hey, strip clubs have been doing this for years.  Really?  Yes.  You strip dollars.  Strip clubs, Disney, Microsoft...  Oh, Disney dollars are the worst.  Pinball machine places.  So anyway, so you have this all electronic thing and so what happens is the government decides that they're doing it,  or they did in Cyprus, they're probably going to do in the Netherlands and probably in the EU.  They just say, okay...  Let's take 10%.  Let's take 10% of your money to help support us.  And you can't even get that money out because it's all electronic.  And by the way, the Dutch have long since done everything they can to get actual coinage out of the system.  And...  Everything's about ripping off the public.  What's that book called that you're reading?

Start time: 894.00
End time: 922.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I highly recommend it. It's on Audible. It's called The End of Money.  I will check that because I'm interested in that subject.  And it's easy to understand and it raises some very interesting issues.  They mentioned Bitcoin briefly, but it was written a couple of years ago before Bitcoin really got a lot of attention and notoriety.  But there are many other choices. There's Litecoin. There are other cryptocurrencies out there.  I love when the Kindle is around as well.  There's the End of Money, Counterfeiters, Preachers, Techies, Dreamers, and the Coming Cashless Society by David Wolman.

Start time: 922.00
End time: 948.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So can any of those calculations, those problem solving that the machines do,  can any of those be kind of geared toward, I don't know, solving a particular...  No, they have no value.  You mean like curing cancer? No.  They let me burn up energy so I can make an imaginary currency so I can pay some guy on an illicit, non-existent website.  So you get some pot.  So I can get some pot when I can just drive over the border to like BC and buy like a bottle.

Start time: 949.46
End time: 988.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People are buying special heavy GPU machines because the GPU is better at doing this for Bitcoin mining.  And there may be some reason to do that. You have to do some calculations to the energy cost, the cost of the hardware.  But if you can generate enough Bitcoin fast enough, Steve Gibson, who hosts Security Now...  Has he generated a Bitcoin?  He generated 50 Bitcoins, but it was a couple of years ago when it was easier.  You know, it gets harder and harder. So those 50 Bitcoins at its peak were worth more than $10,000.  I hope he cashed out.  He did not.  So now they're worth $5,000.  Buy low, sell high.  But that's an interesting question. Should you cash out or are they...  Remember, it's a limited supply. They may go up.  They could be worth $100 to $1 million a piece.

Transcript:  I think it's more for me an intellectual exercise, and it's one that geeks are very interested in because of the mathematics involved,  but also because in this notion that... I think what I celebrate among geeks is that they're willing sometimes to tackle stuff that scares people.  And what's scary to people is this notion that there is nothing really backing the value of a dollar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think in general people would prefer not to think about that. They love the idea. That's why they like the idea.  I don't like thinking about dying either. It happens.  And I think that's what I celebrate about geeks is they're willing to think a little bit harder about the notion of fiat currency, what that means, and what Bitcoin means about it.  And I don't know if Bitcoin is going to be big or it's a ripoff or any of that. I don't know. But I think it's intriguing. I think it's an interesting... It makes an interesting point about money.  On to topic two.  Topic two, CISPA. We'll get to that in a moment.  The Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act, which, by the way, Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo all are in favor of, others like privacy advocates a little bit worried about.  We'll talk about CISPA in just a moment.  But meanwhile, let's talk about GoToMeeting with HD Faces from Citrix.  If you meet with staffers on a regular basis, you know how hard it can be nowadays to get people together.  If you pitch to clients, you know how hard sometimes it can be to get an appointment with a client.  But I've got a way you can meet, you can pitch, you can train, you can collaborate.  It's easy. It doesn't require people to be in the same place. And in fact, it's even more effective than if they were.  GoToMeeting allows you to share your screens. And you know, when you're on the same screen, you're on the same page, you can see the PowerPoint presentation, the keynote presentation, what we're working on together.  You can collaborate on documents. But it also now with the new HD Faces feature allows you to see who you're meeting with.  That's very important. If you're pitching a client, you want to know if he's got his arms folded and frowning or if she's smiling and saying, I like that product.  That's really important. GoToMeeting lets you work face to face with anyone, anywhere.  In these in the old days, people would pay literally thousands, maybe tens of thousands of dollars for this kind of HD video conferencing.  You can have it now on your desktop for a lot less than you might think. In fact, it's free for the first 30 days.  So try it out. GoToMeeting.com. Click the Try It Free button. Use the promo code TWIT.  The powerfully simple way to meet and collaborate online.  And now, by the way, you can go to meetings, not just on your Mac or your PC, but on smartphones, on tablets.  They even let you present from an iPad. So you can be sitting in an airport presenting a meeting pitching.  GoToMeeting.com. Click the Try It Free button. Use the offer code TWIT.  We thank them for their support in American government backed currency of this week in tech.  Although I'd take Bitcoin. You know, one of the reasons we take Bitcoin, because maybe somebody give me Bitcoin and now it's worth 100 bucks.  But next year it's worth a million bucks. I could cash out. It's interesting that you see the Bahamas.  You don't think that's going to happen. Johnson's. I'm nuts.

CISPA is designed, its supporters have said, this is Declan McCullough writing, I'm sorry, it's Edward Moyer writing in CNET,  to protect against foreign cyber threats by allowing private companies to, John, you're going to love this, voluntarily share data with government intelligence agencies.

Transcript:  Isn't it interesting? It's bringing strange bedfellows. The edges. The edges are coming in.  Declan McCullough at CNET noted that under existing federal law, any person or company, existing law, they don't need a new one for this, who intercepts any wire, oral, electric communication unless specifically authorized by law could face criminal charges, says no, no, no, no.  It's okay. Go ahead and intercept any wire, oral, or electronic communication as long as you're protecting us against foreign cyber threats and passing it along to government intelligence, it's quite all right.

CISPA recognizes the need for effective cybersecurity legislation that encourages voluntary, bidirectional, real-time sharing of actionable cyber threat information to protect networks.  So in other words, let's open up the communication between private industry and government under the guise of protecting against terrorism.  Terrorism is great for that. Used to be child pornography.

You actually start in your Facebook app.  So if you've got the Facebook app on there  and you have a phone that supports it,  there's a button in the Facebook app that says,  install Facebook Home.  And by doing that, interesting,  if you go to the Facebook Home app on the Play Store,  it says, this app requires no permissions.  It doesn't need to know anything about you.  It lays right over Android.  It doesn't have to.  Because it's living under Facebook, the app,  which has all the permissions to see everything.

Freedom was a basic philosophical tenet of the United States.  Do you think that that's still the case, John?  Do you think that maybe we have started to think freedom's overrated?

I think I still believe that we're not the end of the road and it will be, I honestly  believe it will be segmented at some point where every country will have its own closed  net because a lot of these countries can't put up with any, with all the stuff that comes  in.  So I think the Saudi Arabia is going to have a closed internet.  You're right.  We're going to have a closed internet.  There's going to be some people that have the privilege to cross nets, you know, that  have special licenses or whatever.  A passport?  A similar, but it'd be an electronic passport that allows me to go to the Saudi Arabia net.  If I get a visa from Saudi Arabia and I can go on their net because there's no other way  of stopping what's going on, which is a complete, you know, this is kind of porn crossing lines,  spies, cyber attacks.  All these things can be stopped really easily by just segmenting the net.

I mean, globalization, that was the big one.  Now all our markets are tied in together.  We're competing with people who would gladly make a twelfth of what we make and do the  same amount of work.  And so, you know, outsourcing was kind of the big one.  Every time something comes along and, you know, freedom as the foundation of the country  is a national myth.  It's, you know, you don't believe it ever existed.  It was one of those things that maybe at one time was a really grand notion, but, you know,  when the colonies formed together.  At the time, it was, it wasn't, there was, there was a big push for not having a federalized  country because all these states wanted to be independent.  Right.  I mean, they are independent.

Because the federal government is trying to take over states' rights.  We have our own rights.  We have our own laws in every single state.  And the federal government would love to have no, why would we have to do a constitutional  amendment when you just pass a simple law?  Right.  So, we need no constitutional amendments.

But the problem is I have a drawer full of the old phones, my Galaxy S3, my Galaxy Note.  I have a couple of those.  Yeah, I'm going to have to price those.  Blackberries.  Well, all right.  Tell me a little bit about AT&T.  This is Verizon.  Verizon.  Let's click the Verizon button.  We're at Gazelle.com.  Now, you understand this is going to be good for 30 days, which means you don't have to  act on it.  You've got 30 days.  I do like that.  But you're locking in the price, right?  So, if you look at the Galaxy S4, you say, I don't want it, no problem.  But if you say I want it, I can guarantee you this price is not going up.

Start time: 3074.56

Well, except for the fingerprints, yes.  Yeah, well, you can wipe those off.  All right.  No water damage, right?  Nope.  All right.  Let's see.  Calculate the price on that.  That's pretty good.  Yeah.  226 bucks.  So, what you do is you get the box.  They pay the shipping on anything worth more than a buck, but then go back and do more.  John, you found a box of red vines.

This is effectively recycling.  Somebody's going to buy this phone that wants it.  You're going to get cash back.  Best part of all from Gazelle, besides the 30 days, which I love, 30-day lock, is you  get paid fast by check, PayPal.  Or if you want an Amazon gift card, you get an extra 5%.

So people you follow, they'll say, oh, I like this song, I like this song.  You know, Google+, which nobody uses, unfortunately, does this.  You can actually give people a free song.

So why did, in fact, according to this article in Business Insider, Sumley didn't even build  the app.  They hired a company called SOMO, UK's largest independent mobile marketing agency.  So what did Yahoo get?  An app nobody used that made no money, that wasn't designed by anybody at the company,  and used backbone technology by another company that had nothing to do with it.

Hamilton.  He's one of my favorite sci-fi authors.  Audible's got a great sci-fi collection.  But classics, too.  Here's, you know, William Makepeace Thackeray's Vanity Fair,  for instance, or Black Beauty.  You know, the kids love Audible, too.  They've got young adult children's books.

So I listen to the car at the gym.  It's so boring on the StairMaster.  I can see you do a lot of that.  Every single month.  And Audible is really great for making the time pass.  It's fantastic.  And I'm learning stuff.  This is the end of money.  Say goodbye to your beloved Benjamins,  because the world is going cashless.  David Wolman, the author,  and the author explores the drastic implications.  How's it happening? What's at stake? What does it mean?  I learned a lot about economics, about fiat currency,  about Bitcoin and all of that.  What a great book.  But you don't have to just learn. You can also enjoy.  Frankenstein, The Modern Prometheus, Wuthering Heights.  So many great books.  This is my library going way, way back.  You can read a lot.  Well, this is 11 years worth of Audible.  I've been reading for a long time, or listening, I guess we should say.  I wasn't even born.  This is the book that inspired the Lincoln movie  we were just talking about, Team of Rivals by Doris Kearns Goodwin.  Really a great, great piece of history.  Fascinating.  So you're going to find plenty to listen to.  You know, one of my favorite Audible books,  one that Trey Ratcliffe recommended to me,  The King Krillic Chronicles by Patrick Rothfuss.  Patrick Rothfuss is going to be our guest on Wednesday on Triangulation.  I'm very excited about interviewing him,  because I've listened to the first two books on Audible  and we're waiting for the third.  He's writing it right now.  So we'll get some, maybe get some, have you read The King Krillic Chronicles?  God, you would love those.  I don't believe I have.  They're fantastic. He's just wonderful.  So many choices. Pick one, pick two. Why not? They're free.  There it is, The Name of the Wind,  King Krillic Chronicles Day One by Patrick Rothfuss.  You know, these two would be fantastic.

This is the thing I had with this game.  A lot of those elements were set pieces.  They were window dressing.  They weren't really done in a...  They weren't integral to the game.  They weren't integral to the game.  Honestly, you don't care at the end.  It was another...  This is the thing.  How do you take...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Tell us.  Come on.  Come on.  Tell us what happened.  This is the thing I have with this game.  I guess you want to educate the public, but then you stick on top of a shooter.  You want to make...  That's right.  You've got to kill a lot of people and you want to promote a message of tolerance and  understanding.

Start time: 6203.72
End time: 6208.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 6209.36
End time: 6210.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And it's very ham-fisted.

Start time: 6210.26
End time: 6288.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I say this without being a spoiler because it's so early in the game and others have  talked about it.  Very early on in the game, you're in this city that was built in 1912, a floating city,  and it seems idyllic.  It's Main Street Disney.  I mean, it's incredible, but there's odd little dark bits to it.  You come to a raffle and you get a message that says, whatever you do, don't take number  And you're at the raffle and everybody's there and everybody's excited.  It's very fair-spirited.  And a girl comes to you and you say, well, how much for the base?  She wants to give you a baseball.  How much for the baseball?  She says, oh, no, you must be new here.  It's always free at the raffle.  Here, take a baseball.  Who's sweet?  He does.  And it's number 77.  So he goes, oh, that's interesting.  Then the stage opens and the announcer comes out and it's an interracial couple in chains  is marched out.  And the announcer says, you've won.  You get to throw the first baseball at this interracial couple.  It's very, it's like, oh my God.  And then you have a choice in the game whether to throw the baseball at the interracial couple,  which of course would be a evil thing to do, or to throw it at the announcer, the MC instead.  And the thing about...  And you have to make what is ostensibly a deep moral decision.  Well, by the way, I tried it both ways.  That's a deep moral decision?  Well, I tried it both ways.  It's the same exact outcome no matter what you do.  That's a spoiler.  It doesn't matter.

End time: 6317.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This sucks.  So, ultimately, there's a certain level of pretentious high-mindedness in the game that  stems from a very poor understanding about how things like...  It's pretentious, let's face it.

Start time: 6318.46
End time: 6321.93

Transcript:  All right.  We're pretty much...  We clearly have run out of whatever we had.  It was good.  Do you think Warby Parker...  I was really surprised.  Giga Ohm...  And unfortunately, the Giga Ohm writer who was here left early.  Don't blame him.  Giga Ohm says the Warby Parker...  You know Warby Parker is a glasses...  The internet startup that's selling glasses frames.  Why they're creating a retail store is a big moment for online brands.  They're opening up a show, a store rather, in Manhattan using sensors, Wi-Fi and other  technology to understand how people use their retail space and take that data and marry  it with their online sales trends.  Is this really a revolution?  They're selling glasses frames.  It's a store.  It's a store.  It's a store.  And in fact, it's a store in a category that is traditionally not an online category.  I think what they may have discovered...  And they were an advertiser with us, disclaimer.  What they may have discovered is that people really want to go in and try glasses frames  before they buy them.  I would hope.  What a revelation.

Start time: 6418.40
End time: 6429.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think it works for things like Zappos, but when it comes to something so critical to  your everyday functioning like glasses, it's something you want to make sure you test out  and block out the store.

End time: 6459.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The company is a darling internet startup.  For reasons I'm not completely...  Hipster glasses.  They're hipster.  And by the way, what's interesting is Google...  It's been rumored that Google Glass will actually go to Warby Parker to get some stylish Google  Glass.  Get some black frames.  Black frames and stuff.  You know what?  In a way, they did solve the conundrum because what you do is you order...  You pick five frames that you think might look nice and they send you the five frames.  You try them all on and say, I want that one.  Then you send the trial box back and you get the frame with your glasses prescription.  So they do kind of solve that issue of how do you try them on.

Start time: 6459.96

Start time: 6465.13
End time: 6473.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  What you need to do is take a device like the Kinect that you sit on your monitor and  do a little 3D scan of your head and then they find out which frames will actually fit  in.

And it gave me courage, the courage to, I want to talk with you guys about how you did  that because maybe we could afford to do it ourselves and manage to get through that approval  process because it's very expensive not to do it.
