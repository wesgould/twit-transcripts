Start time: 210.34
End time: 232.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I just noticed that there's a little tribute if you look in your shot to Call for Help.  Remember on the old Call for Help show we had a kind of a window like the one behind you.  And there was a fake tree branch with a string on it.  And every once in a while somebody would, every time you walked by you should just tug the branch to make it look like.  So I mentioned that and apparently our staff has decided to put a fake tree branch in the window behind you.

Start time: 232.12
End time: 239.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

End time: 315.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, this is podcasting.  So part of my media presence is to get in front of the vendors and learn about their technology.  But do you work?  I mean, do you consult?  I do consult and analyze.  I advise a number of companies about their technology strategies.  Big networks too.  I mean, not just, yeah.  So I'm working on one of the biggest highest performance compute labs in the UK right now,  working on their next supercomputer build out, which is really interesting.  And I have a number of companies that I advise to keep my hand in as a professional network engineer or an enterprise IT engineer.  And then, but my real full time job is the podcast.  And I want to keep my finger on the pulse of real technology, not just, you know, become a podcast host who's like, which is the risk.  I'm just looking at you.

End time: 350.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anybody who's doing this is doing, keeping up to date somehow.  I'm not hands on though.  I've got to keep up to date, but I'm not hands on.  Yeah, but I'm much deeper, but I'm much more vertical.  So I'm in a niche of data networking and enterprise.

Start time: 385.00
End time: 390.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 397.55
End time: 406.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Negative.  It's only the second one I haven't gone to.  Wow.  Why not?  No interest.  I think, you know, I've heard from a lot of people that just was not a media story.

Start time: 408.01
End time: 413.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, the stories, maybe there's little crumbs.  I think you actually had a great story about about Zeiss's smart glass.

Start time: 414.02
End time: 443.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that was last year.  That article was written about a year ago.  But the reason I kidding.  No, the reason I put it there is because we were talking about Apple working with Carl Zeiss and people like, gosh, does Carl Zeiss have any?  Yeah, they have amazing technology.  And that's smart glasses.  That was that was teased at last year's CES.  The technology is super solid.  If you read that article, I'm talking about how they're working with some competitor to Google.  So that doesn't support or not support.  Well, that's that's that's the big story from Robert.

Start time: 444.00
End time: 475.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Anyway, he says it's not clear.  We talked about this a little bit last week.  It's not clear where he got this.  He says in his Facebook post, a Zeiss employee confirmed the rumors that Apple and Carl Zeiss are working on a pair of augmented reality or mixed reality glasses that may be announced this year, maybe next year.  Then later on in the post, he says something about the fact that the people in the booth made faces when he mentioned that as if they were laugh nervously.  I hope that wasn't his source.

Start time: 476.00
End time: 481.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's what that's what he said in the post.  That's his source.  That's the source.  He said to the employees, why are you doing something with Apple?  And they laughed nervously.

Start time: 482.44
End time: 507.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This implies though, as Zeiss employee confirmed implies that he's a Zeiss employee said something to him, not merely laughed nervously.  You think it's a little nervous from what I saw?  Well, this is the previous post.  I don't know.  Anyway, it wouldn't be so much of a surprise.  And the other piece that's of interest is the Zeiss booth was in the augmented reality marketplace, and yet they had no augmented reality products.  So that kind of, you know, yeah, confirm something.  They're working on something secret.

Start time: 508.17
End time: 514.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So so you remember that techno and remember what remember bookstores?  Yeah, there is a building where they built there was books inside.  You know, I was in one yesterday.

Start time: 515.04
End time: 547.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, wait a minute.  That was augmented reality.  I literally I literally was.  We had a company called Oxypital who makes the first one I've ever seen for an iPhone, the advisor for the iPhone.  And it's augmented reality.  So you can see things and touch things.  Watch the new screensavers from yesterday.  And then our co-host, Nathan Oliveris, Charles from the Wall Street Journal, the guy said, OK, now touch that wall.  He touched the wall and a hole opened up in that wall.  And there was a bookstore in there that they had scan and you could walk in and go from augmented reality, a real world to a virtual reality in a bookstore.  Yeah.  So thank God we still have bookstores.

Start time: 549.74
End time: 583.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. And thank goodness Amazon didn't run them out of business and into virtual.  So anyway, so in bookstores, they used to sell these flat lenses.  It was a flat little credit card size lens to magnify the book.  Remember those that they check?  That's called a Fresnel Fresnel lens.  It's 200 year old technology.  That's the technology that the Carl Zeiss technology is based on.  They put it into the glass and they have 250 patents supposedly around smart glasses.  And so the idea is for augmented reality, mixed reality, they'll be able to build these into ordinary glasses at low cost.  And these will be just you go to the automatist office.

Start time: 583.04
End time: 597.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's the key to Fresnel because unlike a regular lens that you have to grind to precise tolerances, these are just and you've all seen them.  They're just little wedges of glass that give you a less, I have to say, a less high quality experience.

Start time: 597.22
End time: 626.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But imagine what's possible now with lasers and computer driven.  Oh, maybe they could be better.  Yeah. So they've apparently got some really fantastic technology and it's actually a separate company.  They spun out a separate company just to do this sort of thing.  And I'm really excited about this technology in particular, but other efforts in general that will result in smart glasses that look like ordinary glasses.  There are a bunch of companies working on things like that, taking different approaches.  But I love this approach because you definitely want visuals.  You definitely want a screen.

Start time: 627.26
End time: 648.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, so let me ask the question.  Why does this form of augmented reality glasses differ from Google Glass?  Why do you see the difference between the bright screen in the upper corner of the lens being so socially different or sort of from a market use case?  Yeah, better compared to Google Glass.

Start time: 649.38
End time: 704.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I think that the the hot part of the company they should be partnering with them.  And I talked about in the article is Luxottica, which is the umbrella company for almost every company.  Sunglasses Hut, Ray-Ban, all the vanity.  You get Gucci glasses. Those are Luxottica glasses, an Italian company.  And so I'm pretty sure that within three, four, five years, you'll be able to go to the optometrist office.  And do you want progressives? Do you want this?  Do you want smart? And if it's smart, what's your platform?  Whatever. It's a checkbox item and you just get your ordinary glasses and there they are.  They're like they have this similar effect as as what do they call it when you have two different lenses?  Bifocals. Bifocals.  It'd be like bifocals and you'll be able to just get little notifications.  So and so is calling you.  And the problem with Google Glasses were twofold.  First, they looked really stupid.  It was a big boom that came out in front of your phone.

Start time: 704.08
End time: 708.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  By the way, this guy spent fifteen hundred bucks on them and wore them around.  I still use them. I love still wears them around.

Start time: 709.32
End time: 722.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think the fundamental thing about Google Glasses was they were an ego play.  The idea was that they were meant to look like you're a dick.  Well, I don't think they were meant to.  So you would stand out in a crowd.  I think that was incidental.  They were meant to be mobile advertising.  I think the dick came free.

Start time: 724.18
End time: 736.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Stupid comes. Stupid is a stupid does.  I just want to show you up here in Fort Bragg, there is and there are a number of these.  The old lighthouses.  That's how they started.  We're for now. Lenses.  These are made in France.  I think it's pronounced probably pronounced right now because it's a French.

Start time: 737.04
End time: 737.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's right now or right now.

Start time: 738.34
End time: 761.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, there's an estimate.  But well, you don't want to say wrong because your TV announcer on this podcast.  But these lenses are jewels.  I went up to Fort Bragg and saw these and this one's still operational.  It's run by the Coast Guard, but it was completely restored and they're just gorgeous lenses.  And so they could make these giant crystal lenses without having to focus the light.  There's a few things in there.

Start time: 762.22
End time: 767.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One is, so Google glasses were meant to be an ego play.  You put them on your face and they're a statement.  I disagree. That wasn't meant to be an ego play at all.

Start time: 768.00
End time: 772.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Absolutely.  I tried to diffuse it.  It was an experiment.

Start time: 773.22
End time: 785.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So if that's the case, then why is Snapchat's glasses working so well?  Because they look like glasses.  Now the problems with Snapchat glasses is that if you're medically got an optical medical optical, you can't use them.  Well, that's why Luxottica should get the advantage.

Start time: 787.04
End time: 791.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're saying Snap's glasses are not an ego play?  They're limiting, they're putting the machines?

Start time: 792.06
End time: 798.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They certainly are. They're trying to make ordinary glasses look like an ego play, but they look like ordinary glasses and they operate like ordinary glasses.

Start time: 798.00
End time: 801.00

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Of all days, the day I didn't bring my Snapchat spectacles in and I couldn't be wearing them now.  How do you feel when you wear them? Like a dick?  Well, like a schmuck.  Like a trendy dork.  I think I might have started something.  I wore them to Vegas because I was just curious what the reaction would be.  Of course Vegas is camera shy to some degree.  In fact, when you get to Vegas now, they even have ads that say, let's keep what happens in Vegas here.  Let's not share it too much.  But nobody knew what they were.  So only we hipsters and Snapchat folks and tech people.  We hipsters.

Transcript:  I know what they are. Even the waitress at the restaurant.  I'm like taking pictures of her. She says, what are you doing? What are those?  And I had explained what they were to her.  And I think she was probably somewhat uncomfortable.

Start time: 856.20
End time: 868.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is maybe the difference that the Google Glass was attempting to be very...  It almost looked Euro or intellectual with the phone.  That's what Greg's saying.  And then the Snapchats are goofy.

Start time: 870.52
End time: 877.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Partly it's also that they cost $1,500.  So it was a little pretentious to wear them because it was a statement.  I'm willing to spend $1,500.

Start time: 879.00
End time: 899.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They were trying to attract content creators and experimenters and people like that.  It was an experiment. They were upfront about it.  They said this is a trial. We're going to try it.  Because they didn't know what to do with it.  They had technology. They didn't know what the application was.  It was so new that they...  What happened to the rumor that they were going to keep making this?  They are doing it. They're going to work.  It's going to be a real product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's where I fundamentally disagree with what you're saying, Greg.  That this is going to be an add-on to your specs.  Do you want polarized? Do you want sunglasses that go with it with that prescription?  Do you want smart?  I'm still not seeing a regular human use case.  Oh I am.  It's notifications.

Start time: 968.08
End time: 980.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think it exists. I think it's completely doable.  So they've turned off. Of course Google has that capability.  But Google has turned it off because of the creep factor.  That's the biggest problem in my opinion with Google Glass.  Exactly. It's a camera.  It's a creep factor.

Start time: 981.61
End time: 1020.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Without a camera it's just you have...  It's informational.  So if you think about entering this world of artificial intelligence virtual assistants  where you can have a really actually smart and useful Siri, Cortana, etc.  I'm not supposed to say those words.  Just don't say Alexa.  Don't say that.  So imagine when you have real preemptive...  You're walking down the street and say,  Hey, you should be interested in this.  I know that you care about this sort of thing.  And just a little subtle notification that other people can't see.  Meanwhile you're wearing ordinary glasses.  I think that's really what people...  I would love that.  I can't believe how much I disagree with that.

Transcript:  Go ahead.  Most people here have an Apple Watch.  My visualization is if you take the Apple Watch and put it on the inside of the glasses  as something that you can see as you're moving around instead of having to wrist watch it,  then that's loosely where I see the progression going is down that direction.

Transcript:  So it's meaningless to say they're doing it because of course they are.  Because they're talking to Laxotica.  They're going to have meetings all over the place.  Nothing's going to come of 99%.  Tim Cook has said now at least twice meaningfully like we're very interested in AR.  But I think that that's him putting a little flag in the sand saying we want to claim this.  And people are looking at Apple saying look, you got nothing.  You got no VR.  Siri is lagging way behind everybody else's product.  What are you doing besides coming out with watch bands?  And I think this is Tim saying no, no, we're doing something.  As typical Apple, we're not going to tell you anything until we have something.  I think it's very credible because of what you said that this would fit into their line.  By the way, somebody's pointed out, I think we talked about on MacBreak Weekly, the AirPods could have a similar augmented.

Transcript:  But this is another thing.  Apple would love for people to be able to wear AirPods every waking moment.  All the time.  They're too weird looking.  But glasses through bone conduction can give you audio in a device that only has to be charged once a week.  And since you've already got this smarts and the intelligence and the battery and all that stuff in the glasses,  people are going to want a little visual cue to go with the audio.  But think about the production challenges here.

Transcript:  But now you've got to produce an outlet which can customize for every human head.  Do you want round frames?  Do you want square frames?  Do you want clear?  Do you've got women's?  Do you've got men's?  You've got children's?  That's how it works already.  It's just a question of having something they can add.  And Apple is not about customization.  Apple is about producing one Apple watch that everybody gets and we shove it down your throats.  My excuse.  You have AirPods.  There's no ear pod.  There's no ability to have a soft or over ear.  You can't have headphones.  You can't have earphones.  AirPods are what they are.  This is the only choice you get.  Suck it if you don't.  Apple is not about customization.  It is about personalization of the experience in software.  It is not about customization of the hardware.  So for Apple to do glasses would require a fundamental shift in its corporate operations  and that is not something that's likely to achieve.  Unless they make clip-ons.  Well, this is where these Luxotica comes in because those glasses are actually manufactured  in regional locations.  So when you go to the optometrist and you get your glasses made, they're actually made in local region.  The machines are fully robotic and your order goes off into an area usually within about 500 miles of where your optometrist is.  They're manufactured on the spot and then shipped to your location, popped into the lenses, blah, blah, blah.  And so in theory, this Fresnel effect could be something that could be a base lens is produced in a factory overseas,  shipped to their local location, and then it's actually customized for the person.  It's popped into the frame that you choose and maybe the frame's got switchable components inside.  Well, there you go.  You just answered your own...  Perhaps.  But I think that that's a decade away.  Oh, decade away.

Transcript:  I do think they're going to have to support it from a software thing.  I mean, if people start switching to Android so they can have the new smart glasses from their optometrist,  then they will have to do something.  I think there's something...  I'm sure they're looking at it and considering it and wondering about it.  You talked about batteries.  Talk to a startup in San Francisco, tiny startup.  Tiny startup called Vue.  And they're getting around all these issues.  They have good audio through bone conduction.  They have batteries on both sides...  No, they have battery on one side, the electronics on the other side.  And they're using lights and blinking lights and things off in the corner that alert you and you can customize it.  Green means your wife is calling, that sort of thing.  And their batteries last for a week and so on.  They're not projecting a screen, but you can easily see how notifications with screen,  a visual element could be optimized and customized to give you at least a couple of days of battery life using today's battery technology.  And again, somebody is going to figure this out.

In fact, it hasn't from Samsung.  But Apple could make a fairly expensive product that they could get early adopters.  What I find interesting, I don't think Apple will own this space ever, but I think Apple wants to be in this space.

Last year, a tiny little woman from Google got up on stage and told us how Smart Reply works in Inbox and in Allo.  Is she going to be in the Google Home?  How tiny is she?

Now, that's, I think, a very big challenge for any intelligence because a Doberman Pinscher doesn't look anything like a Shih Tzu.  And yet it knows that both are dogs.

It was never about selling products.  It was about collecting data to build an AI.  We argue it's both. Why not?  It doesn't have to be one, right?  No, but it's not explicitly just...

But what DeepMind, what Google has been doing without announcement,  is unleashing DeepMind against real players all over the world,  particularly in China and Japan where Go is played.  I guess people didn't know that they were playing DeepMind.  They thought they were playing a real Go master.  It has now beaten the 50 top Go players.  Just complete dominance.  You could say when it beat Lisa Dahl, who was a great player,  well, but that was one guy.  It was tuned to beat his style, et cetera.  DeepMind and AlphaGo are getting better and better.  This is the thing that people...  In my opinion, Google's huge advantage,  and the thing that should scare people,  because I think they are farther ahead than maybe even Go.

Consumer Reports really blew it because they should have noted, for instance, they got  everything from 2 hours to 18 hours in their tests.  Then they did it with Chrome and it was great.  At that point, they should say, red flag.  Something's wrong here.  Maybe we shouldn't say anything yet.  I don't know if this is true or not.

Transcript:  Look, there's a lot of this methodology that I'm confused by.  First of all, a couple things you should know.  Consumer Reports has never been sued.  What?  Never been successfully sued for a review.  They told me this themselves.  Number two, what confuses me about the methodology here is that when I do a test or anything  for ABC, our lawyers, and we have a negative result, our lawyers insist that we go to the company,  talk to them about it, and work through any concerns they may have lest we get sued.

Transcript:  So it turns out that Consumer Reports, and I don't think this is an unreasonable methodology,  but they use Safari.  They say, we're not going to use a third-party browser to test because we want to use what  comes on the platform.  That's reasonable.  They did go into the developer options and they turned off caching in Safari.  Reasonably because this test loads pages over and over again with Wi-Fi.  So it's testing Wi-Fi page loads.  It's a probably fairly decent test.  It's not real world, but it's close enough.  It turns out when you disable caching in Safari, a bug surfaces.  A rare, never seen bug.  And that's what happened, according to Apple.  Apple fixed the bug.  Consumer Reports retested and got consistently high 18-hour battery life and now recommends  the MacBook Pro.  So how long has this been running?  What been running?

End time: 2216.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apple released a patch on January the 9th that fixed the issue.  Consumer Reports evaluated the laptops in December.  So they announced it, I think, before Christmas.  So it's taken Apple roughly a month to come up with a response.  So in terms of damage control, that's not good.  Nobody looks good at any of this.

Start time: 2224.20
End time: 2239.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And by the way, I would say my experience, completely anecdotal experience with my MacBook  Pro and Lisa as well, is highly inconsistent battery life.  So the initial Consumer Reports measurements, in fact, despite the errors, match my actual  experience.

Start time: 2240.00
End time: 2283.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Back in the 90s, I was the editor of Windows Magazine.  And I don't turn off the caching.  We developed all kinds of battery tests.  And you don't have a one-dimensional test using one application.  You go after graphics, you go after this, you go after data, you go after...  You hit that battery with all kinds of different things.  You don't just try one test in one browser.  And so everything about this is flawed from both Apple's perspective and Consumer Reports.  But the biggest thing to me is it has to pass a test of reasonableness.  When they got really horrible battery results from Apple that were not being broadly reported  in the press, they should have said, wait a minute, there's something wrong here.  Let's figure it out.  Not, oh, we don't recommend this product.  So I thought it was really irresponsible of Consumer Reports.  Well, I'm with you.

End time: 2297.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The waters are very much muddy now, though, because Consumer Reports is now recommending  it and saying, oh, no, the battery life's great, which isn't right either.

Start time: 2317.00
End time: 2364.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Battery life is hard to test, though, right?  Because everybody uses it differently.  In fact, the fact that I don't...  I used the MacBook Pro when it first came out, maybe in the first week.  I used it on the MacBook without a plug, and it died after two hours.  I didn't freak out because there's all sorts of reasons you could have crappy battery life.  And then the next day, it was six hours.  Google Chrome, for example.  Yeah.  Chrome apparently about 15% higher battery usage.  It could have been that, and I was using Chrome.  It could have been it was brand new, so it was still spotlight indexing.  There's all sorts of things.  And I've just kind of lived with it.  But consumers...  I mean, we do want a number from the company that is at least apples to apples so that  we know that, well, if it's going to be more than last time, I know what I got.  And the last one, it should be relatively...  Right.

Start time: 2365.00
End time: 2392.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But there has to be a connection with reality.  We all have multiple devices.  We all have a sense.  We walk around with the sense of, oh, my laptop gets really great battery life.  My phone, not so much.  After using it a while, you get a sense whether battery life is a problem or you're kind of  thrilled with battery life.  And so the tests have to reflect that.  So it has to be very, very broadly done.  You have to be very careful about how you do it.  And you always have to tweak it over time so that the experience of using and owning  this device matches the general sense you gave it.

Start time: 2394.00
End time: 2407.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Apple cited that this was one specific flaw in Safari and that they had turned it  off, that Consumer Reports had turned this feature off, and they do this with all their  testing.  So it was consistent.

Start time: 2407.06
End time: 2416.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why isn't Apple doing the tests that Consumer Reports are doing?  Because they're public.  And Apple tried to downplay the bugs saying it's an obscure usage model.  I don't think that's that obscure to turn off caching.

Start time: 2416.14
End time: 2416.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think that's...

Start time: 2417.00
End time: 2457.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not obscure.  And more importantly, if you go and talk to HPE or Dell about how they test their consumer  reports, that's what they do.  They go and run the Consumer Reports test to make sure it's valid.  So I think a few things here.  One, Apple isn't actually doing its basic due diligence in saying, this is going to  be tested by Consumer Reports.  Why don't we do this?  Failure.  Second, their reaction was not to actually do anything about it and just throw up the  walls and pretend that it's not a problem and blame Consumer Reports.  Third, Consumer Reports should have said, yes, look, we're getting inconsistent results.  They shouldn't have been so didactic and locked into a position and said, well, you know,  blah, blah, blah.  And finally, why did Apple take so long to fix what is a fairly full problem?  That bug should have been really easy for them to find.  So who's at fault?  Both?

Start time: 2458.00
End time: 2462.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Instead of spreading out the team and having enough people to cope with the inbound requests  and hiring in enough people, they're saying, no, what we'll do.  You deal with it.  You deal with it.

Transcript:  You're talking about neuro-linguistic programming.  So Apple is a straight out neuro-linguistic programming in every single one of their decks.  Explain that.  So neuro-linguistic programming is when you use keywords to trigger association.  So when you use the word, it's fantastic.  And you repeat the word, it's fantastic.  And then you repeat the word, it's so amazing.  And it's fantastic.  Which Apple does.

Transcript:  Well, there's several examples of this.  One of the ways is if you put three colored objects in front of somebody and you want  them to pick a single color, what you do is just use rhyming words with the color.  And they'll actually be triggered to a statistically significant degree to pick the color that  you want them to pick.  And it's a standard contric.  So Apple's using these types of tricks in its marketing.  I think it wears out after a while.  In the same way that when a politician comes into power, you see them use a certain set  of media tricks.  And all of a sudden people go, like when Obama came to power, he was very much like, we're  going to be, and then all of a sudden he started to move into a centrist position because  he wasn't able to control the message.  He wasn't able to bring the right wing along with him, blah, blah, blah.  So you end up, these media tricks wear out.  And I think Apple's media position is starting to struggle.  It's certainly not able to cope like it used to be.  Which, and the general exodus of staff is an issue.

Transcript:  But from a technology perspective, I think credit has to be given to Steve Jobs, who,  I don't know how he arrived at it, but he was the genius and master at this whole idea.  Every time he gave an interview or announced a product, you walked away with something  in your head that he wanted to put in your head.  One of the most casual examples of this is when he went before the Cupertino City Council  and said we'd like to build the new headquarters.  Looks like a spaceship.  And since that moment, we've all called it the Spaceship Campus.  He planted this wonderful, fun idea around his building, and he just did it like a bodily function.  He was so good at it.

And when Trump got his brow furrowed, and then he says, it was amazing.  It was terrific.  It's really powerful when an angry person says positive things.  I always got that vibe from...  You're grateful.  Yeah, I got that vibe from Steve Jobs that he was sort of...  He was angry at you.  Yes, that was your fault.

I mean, I'm aware of NLP.  I've been aware of it almost my whole life.  But I consciously choose, at least attempt to not use it because I feel it's manipulative.  And it bothers me that people that I respect, like Steve Jobs, I feel like the word is stoop to using these kinds of trickery.

Transcript:  And both Trump and Jobs persuade by reframing the conversation.  You'd say, you know, Steve Jobs, why are you killing Flash?  Why are you doing this to Flash?  It's unfair to your partner, Adobe, blah, blah, blah.  You would say, you know, we have limited resources and we need to put all of our resources behind technologies that we feel have a future.  So we're looking at the future and is Flash have a future or does HTML5 have a future?  And so pretty soon you're seeing it from his perspective.  It's not about his relationship to another.  What both of them never do is they never defend their position.

Start time: 2845.00

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They always attack the next position.  Exactly.  And so instead of defending and saying, look, Flash is a battery hog and it makes my iPhone run for half a day.  You don't do that.  You don't defend your position.  You attack the next position and say, I'm going over there while you're over here, futzing around, pretending and talking about.  And really it comes down to what I call the don't tell me what you did for me yesterday.  Tell me what you're going to do for me tomorrow.  I don't want to hear about today's problems.  I think that that's not necessarily manipulative or bad.  Unfortunately, that catches up with you because if you don't solve today's problems, you don't manage.  You're holding it wrong.  Yeah.

Transcript:  Manufacturing workloads at scale is an enormous challenge, and whether that will ever happen or not.  But not all of the problems in the MacBook Pro are Apple's making.  They're Intel CPUs.  The Intel production of CPUs has been problematic.  Intel's fumbled considerably.

Start time: 2959.20
End time: 2967.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  In fact, I think Intel has lost the game.  I think ARM is about to take over.  What do you think?  Now, this is really up your alley.

Start time: 2967.30
End time: 3056.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I think we're seeing things like, last time I was on the show, we talked about the new types of RAM, the permanent RAM, the SD RAM.  And the challenge that Intel's now got is that those permanent RAM options aren't able to be serviced at speed by the CPU.  So the bus between the CPU and the memory isn't fast enough to take advantage of this NV RAM capability.  And they've started producing it and getting it out there, but it's only seeing like a 10 times performance improvement.  So instead of these things being a thousand times faster.  Which it would be.  Which it should be.  The bus is fast enough.  But the NVMe interface has to run over electronics and it's just too slow.  And we were supposed to be seeing silicon photonics by now.  So this idea that is really, yeah, the theory was a decade ago.  Instead of electrons.  Yes.  So instead of the chip talking to the graphics chip or the chip talking to the DRAM shouldn't be an electrical signal propagating down a copper trace.  Because the way that electricity, I'm going to try for a metaphor here and just stretch it over so slightly.  But if you know in a pipe and you've got water running down the pipe, the water actually sticks to the side of the pipe.  So the pipe prevents the water from flowing properly.  And when you take the pressure off, the water keeps flowing because it's got momentum.  Well electric current is roughly the same.  And so there's only so fast you can drive the electric current.  There's only so fast you can trigger the edges and create signals.  And it's actually incredibly slow.  It's like half the speed of light as a result.  And you can only get so many clock cycles.  We need to be into optical communications between CPU to memory, CPU to storage, CPU to network.  There should be silicon photonics on the Intel die.

Start time: 3057.52
End time: 3070.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  One way Intel is trying to solve this in all the chip manufacturers is to bring them approximately physically closer.  The shorter the distance, at least, you get less of that effect.  So the shorter your distance, the higher you can increase the clock speed.  And they're putting it in the chip.

Start time: 3070.18

Transcript:  It might come down to some very obscure metallic, you know, material science about what type of doping and what type of metal substrates they're using.  And they might have made a decision five years ago to go down a particular technology.  I'm not an expert enough here.  No, but that happened with the Itanium.

Start time: 3117.58
End time: 3130.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We saw that happen exactly with the Itanium, where they went down the wrong road and ended up with a product that didn't work.  Yes.  And they had to rewind.  They were fortunate they had a Skunkworks in Israel that was working on something better and saved their bacon.

Start time: 3144.82
End time: 3150.00

Start time: 3150.68

End time: 3182.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  TSMC has managed to build a 10 nanometer fab.  But I haven't gone deep enough into the technology to know what type of silicon compound like there's a whole pile of gallium arsenide.  And I'm just not going to track the technology at that sort of level because quite honestly, who cares?  Well, we have Kevin.

Transcript:  So in networking today, we're now building components which do we have a piece of silicon which can lays directly.  So instead of using silicon electrical signal into a laser, which is usually a crystal, which then is excited and transmits the laser, they're now building the laser directly into the silicon chip.  So that's the 100 gig e-th and modules that you're doing today as silicon photonics.  But that is not that materials that does the lasing that actually is silicon that can laser transmit is not fit for CPUs.  So you can't suddenly build that silicon photonics component in the same die that a CPU is, which is what we need.  So to some extent, that's where the next advance is going to be.  And Intel doesn't seem to be winning there.

Transcript:  I think also at a higher level, the fact that Microsoft has announced Windows on ARM, I think the world is moving towards and one of the advantage ARM has is better battery life.  It's funny. I love Marcus Brownlee's quote this week. MKBHD, of course, you know who he is.  We've had him on his YouTube channel is huge.  He said, all I wanted for 2016 or maybe he said 2017 was bigger batteries.  All I got was a missing headphone jack.  And right on.  It's as if we're as if the consumers, the buyers, how much I hate Bluetooth headphones right here.

Transcript:  And again, this is a conversation that we've had on on your you've had on your shows in many different ways.  But basically, people don't know that they don't want a floppy drive.  People don't know that, you know, the people always whining, complaining, people know they want headphone jacks and they're right.  No, they don't.  Headphone jacks. It's an analog technology.  Once you make it digital, magic happens and you have a new revolution.  It underestimates the human nature to lose everything.  Meanwhile, how do I charge the thing when I'm listening?  Exactly.  But it's a temporary problem.  Eventually, I'll be super grateful that they forced us kicking and screaming into this world.  They did the same thing with onscreen keyboards.  Such an optimistic nobody forgets that when Apple ten years ago released the iPhone, people said this is crazy.  Nobody can use an onscreen keyboard.  Give me a Blackberry that has a real keyboard.  No, that sounds like crazy talk because all phones have an onscreen keyboard.  We were wrong and Apple was right.

Start time: 3344.28
End time: 3353.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I think that's the same thing with Apple may win because already many Android manufacturers have announced no headphone jacks.  It doesn't look like the Galaxy S8 will have a headphone jack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But there's a 2.5mm jack instead of a 3.5mm jack.  So there's an argument for both ways.  My problem is that the Bluetooth standard is so crap that it's simply not fit for purpose.  And why are we even bothering?  Going to Bluetooth isn't going to create a new Bluetooth standard for at least two more years.  So we're now stuck with substandard technology that we're being forced to use by a company that wants to drive me in a particular direction.  That's my complaint.  Not the fact that the jack's been removed, fine.  But Apple should be in the Bluetooth body making them make a decent Bluetooth standard that actually works.

Start time: 3393.28
End time: 3409.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, they are the largest manufacturer of Bluetooth headphones in the world.  So they have some clout in this space.  And they claim this W1 chip that they invented for the AirPods is the key to all this.  I have to admit, pairing is much better.  You don't get the dropout.  But there are some issues.  There are some issues.  As long as you're not poor.

Almost every month there is a great article in Rolling Stone or Vanity Fair or Atlantic  or the National Geographic or the New Yorker.  An article I'm dying to read.  I can't always read online.  A lot of times I can't read online.  If it's National Geographic, I want to see the pictures, the photos.  Well, now I can get it all on my iPad, on my iPhone, on my Android device with Texture.  I don't have to get the expensive newsstand edition.  I don't have to worry about cluttering my house, piling up magazines on my coffee table.  Texture gets more than 200 of the best magazines in the world and delivers them right to your iPad.  Or you can read them.  It's just like reading the actual magazine.  You have all the same pages.  You turn the page.  There's bonus features that you can't get in a magazine like video and many of these.  It's very affordable, much cheaper than buying a magazine in the newsstand or subscribing.  And you just don't have the clutter.  Plus, because you get to get so many magazines and Texture is searchable, you can find so much stuff.  Find new magazines, new articles.  Back issues are there as well, of course.  Now, Texture is normally $9.99 a month, which is really a great deal.  That's the cost of two magazines on the newsstand.  I like to take the sex quizzes in Cosmo.  I don't know about you, but that's just fun for you.  I always fail them.  Yeah, almost always.  I'm trying to.  One day I'll pass.

On January 15, 2001, the crowdsourced encyclopedia launched to the world, which means that today is its 16th anniversary.  It's the 16th birthday and it would like you to buy it a car or give a donation.  FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler resigns this week.  He's already given his final speech in which he gave one last plea in support of net neutrality, which will arguably be his greatest legacy.  This week, we officially say goodbye to six second video phenomenon Vine.  Twitter has confirmed that they will shut it down on January 19 and convert it to the Vine camera.  It's an app that will let you record Vine videos.  The Vine community, however, and the social network will be no more.  Netflix announces earnings after the close of market.  This Wednesday, we'll be watching for revenue, contribution margin and subscriber growth numbers, which are the big questions for Netflix since they continue to avoid the advertising model.  Jason Howell and I will cover all of this and a whole lot more all week on tech news today.  That's recorded each and every weekday at four p.m. Pacific.  And that is a look at the week ahead.

This actually was it.  So iPhone is 10 years old. Yeah.  This week, the video game industry began in 1968 with a patent that made TV video games possible.  It ended up being the Magnavox Odyssey.  Do you remember that? I don't think I remember the Odyssey.  That was a terrible, terrible thing.  What else?  This was the big anniversary to this day.

But just a little anecdote, this is a genealogy site, supposedly.  But these aren't dead people.  These are living people.  Now, I sublet my apartment in Seattle in back in the early 90s.  The guy stiffed me.  I sued him in small claims court.  He never paid.  I've been searching for him for 20 years.  Did you find him?  Hired a private investigator.  Found him on the site.  He lives 10 miles away from me.  Are you going to go visit him?  Search his name on LinkedIn.  2 30 in the morning.  Guess where he works.  Guess he'll be getting a garnishment notice from me.

It can buy you lots of things.  And one of the things it can buy you is influence.  And he has enough money, ten times over, to buy all the things that money can buy.  What he doesn't have the money to buy is to have much more influence in how the world works.  And we all like, I like solar power better than other types of things.  We all have opinions that we want.  Yeah, you have a pet project.  Yeah, I'm not so crazy about GMOs.  I have all these different opinions.  What he's doing is he's promising to take his money and buy the things that currently his money can't buy.  That is, he's going to throw all this money into things so that the world works the way he'd like it to work.  Whatever that is.  And Bill Gates has done a similar thing to that.  But essentially, it's, we all saw the Matrix.  What do men with power want?  They want more power.  So he's spending his billions to put himself in a position to overrule other interests in the world so that his ideas and his views and his desires win the day.

Transcript:  I disagree with you guys.  You nailed it with your description of the Silicon Valley icons.  They are often the smartest.  I remember Steve was this way.  They're often smart.  Steve Jobs was like the smartest person in the room that didn't make them a good person.  But sometimes people who are so smart, they can't see the failings.  And they believe that they are a good person, empathetic and all this stuff.  They don't understand that they in fact lack that.  And that's exactly what got us Brexit and Trump.  Well, what's interesting is, and Nick's article says, he wants to be emperor, is a phrase that's become common among people who have known Mark over the years.  He points out some other data points.  Remember, Mark got religion.  Or at least didn't deny that he was an atheist, right?  He says, I believe religion is very important.  He didn't say I am religious.  But that is a checkbox you have to check if you're running for president.  His sisters.

So if you cast your mind back to Victorian era politics, say around the 17th and 18th century,  when the incredibly wealthy people who'd built up enormous wealth on the backs of slaves or trade or exploitation of the Far East or India or the colonies down in Africa and stuff like that.  And then suddenly they developed a conscience and started to invest their money in making life good for their workers.  Carnegie Hall.  So for example, in England during that Victorian era, the reason that they started to introduce school meals was not because they wanted to be good for the children.  What they actually were concerned about was one, that the children were starving by the time they were growing up too small.  Yeah, they're not good workers.  They're not good workers. And they're also not good army, not good soldiers, because they're not physically strong.  So they literally institution feeding of the poor as a way to ensure the perpetuation of their positions of privilege.  But closed in generosity.  Now what we're seeing is massive wealth distorts your perception of reality, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Everybody got a big check.  How did that work out?  My fear is that this is a perpetual motion machine because who's providing the money?  I mean, I'm going to then give the money to the corporations.  I'm going to spend some of my income so the corporations can make money so they can give me back my income, but that doesn't, it's not going to work.  It has to be something, right?  Because there's got to be something adding value to the system like oil reserves, adding value to the system.  Well, look at the riots you saw in Ferguson.

So if you don't start thinking about, so if you start to increase, you know, cut jobs at radical levels, you're now going to have vast unemployment.

Transcript:  How universal basic income works out over time.  There's going to be models.  I mean, how do we get to the current set of economic models that we operate society on today?  They've evolved over two or three hundred years.  So trying to predict where UBI goes is very, very difficult.  But we know some form of it will be needed if we start continue to reduce jobs with tools like Facebook.  Look at what Facebook's done for recruiting.  Look what LinkedIn's done for recruiters and just wiped out vast industries like and there's no more need to place job ads in the local newspaper to find them because you go and find them somewhere else.  Right.  So all of that technology that these guys people in Silicon Valley get all clever and feel great has actually been destructive to the economy overall.

Transcript:  Yeah, I wrote a column about this and did a lot of thinking about it.  And it's like they talk about disruption.  Let's disrupt this. Let's disrupt that.  And within Silicon Valley circles, disruption feels like something is being fixed outside of Silicon Valley.  Disruption sounds like something's being broken.  So basically somebody like is going to have self-driving trucks.  Well, there's hundreds of people who own small trucking companies.  And that disruption means that one 30 year old is going to crush your industry and become a billionaire while you get in the unemployment line.  That's what disruption is to a lot of the world.  And I think that has a lot of currency to its politics.  Look at Amazon's public cloud.

Transcript:  Oh, there we go.  Actually, we can talk a little bit about that.  There is a tech angle to this leaked dossier.  I shouldn't say leaked, but it's interesting.  For instance, one of the pieces implied that Telegram, the secure messaging service created by the Mark Zuckerberg of Russia, Pavel Dorov,  in fact was cracked by the Russian security service, and that some of the information came from that.  Telegram was quick to deny that they had been hacked, but they've always used their own roll-your-own encryption,  which has never really been fully vetted.  In fact, there's good reason to think it may not be fully secure.  They had a good explanation for what they believe the leak was, which had to do with phone number verification of an account.  But I thought that was very interesting.  I always get a kick out of pundits who say...

Start time: 5421.08
End time: 5443.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Maybe not want to use Telegram anymore for secure messaging.  Well, but see, you don't know what is secure and what isn't.  I always get a kick out when people say, oh, well, the NSA can't crack that, and the GCSQ can't crack that.  We don't know, do we?  We don't know.  They exist to crack everything, and I'm sure that they have access to lots of things that we have no idea that they have access to.

Start time: 5443.10
End time: 5455.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, here's what we do know.  We know that the math is hard, but we also know that it is solvable, that it is crackable given enough time and horsepower.  And what's the missing piece of that puzzle is how much horsepower the NSA is capable of applying.

Start time: 5457.33
End time: 5472.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So for the current generation of cryptos, we're talking about 1024 keys.  It's generally assumed that that's not crackable with brute force.  So you can't just feed the key into it.  At all.  No, until quantum computers come through, the broad assumption is...  It's just not fast enough.

Moxie Marlinspike, who created the OTR protocol used by Open Whisper Systems, the protocol used by WhatsApp and Signal, says that was a misunderstanding of how Signal worked.  And in fact, he does not believe that WhatsApp has a backdoor.  There is no WhatsApp backdoor, says Moxie Marlinspike.  If Moxie says it, then it's going to be true.

But the EFF has you covered with two powerful tools.  The first is HTTPS Everywhere.  It's a plugin for browsers like Chrome and Firefox.  It encrypts your communication with most major websites.  So they can't spy on it.  They being the hackers.  The hacker flipped me off.  Questionable choices in style.  This is also good.

Start time: 5695.04
End time: 5704.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it is Let's Encrypt.  So they deploy Let's Encrypt certificates.  Now Let's Encrypt is very important because it's actually a conglomerate of big technology companies.  Funding it.

Start time: 5705.66
End time: 5712.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And it's free and easily implemented.  In fact, I use Let's Encrypt.  A lot of people use Let's Encrypt.  It's really great.  Yeah, I think so.

Start time: 5713.22
End time: 5719.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My only concern is who's funding it.  Because once you can get your hands on those private keys, you can theoretically decode everything.  Oh crap.

Start time: 5721.70
End time: 5727.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, one thing that Let's Encrypt does, which is interesting, is that the key is only good for three months.  Yes.  So you get a new key every 90 days.

Start time: 5728.00
End time: 5738.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's deliberate because when you do certificate keys, you want to revoke them.  So let's say I gave you a certificate and now I want to revoke that certificate because you're not who you say you are.  So instead of maintaining certificate revocation lists, CRLs.

Start time: 5739.00
End time: 5744.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Which, by the way, Google has said we don't want to do.  Mozilla doesn't want to do.  It's impossible.  It doesn't work.

Start time: 5745.12
End time: 5777.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, what actually would have to happen is your browser, every time you connect it to a website, you would have to go and check a CRL server to say is this certificate revoked.  And if it is, then you would have to put that round trip time.  Not only have you got to connect to a DNS lookup, then connect to the web server, and now you've got to do a CRL.  Well, on a mobile phone, now you've put your phone down and walked away and no ads can be shown and Google's not making money.  So you want to get away from CRL.  So the answer to that is to go for a 30 to 90 day revocation.  So you just revoke the certificates.  Automatically.  Yeah, they have an expiry date.  So at 30 to 90 days, they automatically just switch off.  And that's effectively your revocation.

Start time: 5778.68
End time: 5789.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But what's great about Let's Encrypt and the Certbot is it's automated to renewals.  So you don't really have to pay any attention.  I have an automated script just every 90 days gets me the new Let's Encrypt.

Start time: 5790.22
End time: 5800.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the most common HTTP server software, Apache, Nginx, and Harproxy.  And you just download Certbot and run it on those machines and the crypto keys will just rotate automatically.

I have monthly donations for Wikipedia, EFF, and then a few like ACLU and a few others like that.  Because I think we got to support these institutions going forward.  These are the institutions that are making us safer and making the world a better place.  Let's take a break real quick.  Real quick, more to come in just a moment, including the hackers being hacked.  But this we can take this week brought to you by ITProTV.  Good friends of mine, people who are teaching you the info you need to be a better IT professional or to become an IT professional.  This is a great job market.  I think it's got to be the fastest growing job market of all and so many opportunities.  So if you're thinking of starting a career in tech in IT or you want to get better at your job that you already have, you don't have to go back to school to do it.  In fact, the school is the most expensive way to do it.  And maybe you're a self-starter, but just go into the bookstore and buy in a bunch of books.  That's a little challenging and expensive.  ITProTV is the middle way, the best way.  Great, entertaining, engaging content just like Twitter.  They stream nine to five Monday through Friday, Eastern Time.  They cover all of the major certs.  They have 2000 hours of content and they add 30 hours more every week.  You can stream them using your Chromecast, your Roku, your Fire TV.  They've got a great Apple TV app they just launched.  Of course, on your PC or your tablet.  And they cover everything.  You want to get the certified ethical hacker.  That's the cert I want.  CEH.  They've got it.  They've got it.  They've got the version nine.  CompTIA's project plus certified information systems security professional.  Cybersecurity analyst plus CCNA, cyber ops.  ITIL operational support analysis.  Microsoft system center.  And also the day-to-day stuff that makes you money like Microsoft Office and managing Apple computers, things like that.  You get the virtual machine labs, which are awesome.  You don't have to have a Windows server.  You don't have to have a Windows machine, just an HTML5 browser.  You can configure the server, configure the clients.  And every time I do it, I blow it, but it's easy.  You just press the reset button.  You start over.  Transcender practice exam so you can take the test before you take the test.  That's worth under nine bucks by itself.  I love ITProTV.  And you're going to love it, too.  We've got a great seven-day trial for you and a really big discount.  Normally $57 a month, which by even then, that's a good deal.  Or get a year.  That's the most economical.  $570 a year.  That's less than buying the materials, let alone going to a technical school.  But if you use our offer code TWIT30, it's 30% off forever, for the lifetime of your life.  ITPro.tv slash TWIT.  Tim and Don are good friends.  Really love what they've done.  And they're just knocking it out of the park.  Incidentally, they are going to be introducing a new membership level beginning February 1st.

They also, we think, may have been the company that sold the hack to the FBI that allowed them to get into the Bakersfield iPhone.  They've been hacked, which frankly is not good on your resume if you're a security firm.  According to Motherboard, which has been doing a great job on tech coverage, Joseph Cox writing,  Motherboard has obtained and validated 900 gigabytes of data from Celebrite, including customer information, databases, technical data about their products.  And most importantly, you can use this information to see who's been using their MyCelebrite domain,  which is the portal you log into to get new software versions and make sure you've got the latest version.  Celebrite is widely used by US and federal law enforcement.  Plus, according to the hacked data, possibly also with authoritarian regimes in Russia, the UAE, and Turkey.

So we don't, we do a show every week where we talk to some of these issues.  We've actually just stopped bothering with breaches because it's pointless.  It's too common.  It's so common. The second thing is there's no impact.  So look at Yahoo lost a billion accounts over a sustained five year period.  And yet Verizon still bought them for the value that was agreed.  So they've gotten away with that.  So if that, a breach of that magnitude should have had in any reasonable reading of the situation, some sort of impact to the company financially.

The former mayor of New York as his cybersecurity advisor, Rudy Giuliani.  Now you may say, well, Rudy Giuliani, what does he know about security?  Oh no, he has a company, a full service security investigative and crisis management consulting firm called Giuliani Security and Safety.  Let's just run over to that website right now.  This site can't be reached.  The reason is it was a mess.  It was running a four year old copy of Joomla with more than a dozen known exploits.  Yes.  You could, I mean, it had a publicly, look at this is, this is Michael Fienan, who I guess is a security researcher.  As soon as he heard Giuliani had been appointed to the cybersecurity job, he checked expired SSL certificate, doesn't force HTTPS,  exposed CMS logins.

Transcript:  Can I go back to that point you made about breaches and the idiocy of reporting on them?  I really think that there's an opportunity for me to learn from this.  In conjunction with an anecdote, I was at the grocery store like a little mom and pop bodega kind of place.  And the guy was asking me about my credit card.  Did I feel nervous because it was a high limit credit card?  I said, no, I use a service on my phone that lets me see every time a transaction comes through.  So it doesn't freak me out because if something comes through, I see it almost immediately.  And he calls his son up. Did you know about this? The man.  And the son says, I don't trust it.  And I said, well, it's on my Intuit.  And that's a good indicator that it's not a fly by night company says doesn't matter.  They've all been hacked. I don't trust anybody.  And then at the same time, I got in the car and there was an NPR interview going on.  And it was this Russian journalist.  And she said, when you don't trust anything, you can't believe in anything.  And I just thought that was so interesting.  This concept of like, we don't trust companies.  We don't trust governments.  We don't trust the security of our security services.  So we're in not just post truth, but we're in like, what do you believe in?  Post belief or post fundamentals.  So I mean, the breaches thing is just really true to me because I'm continually reporting, oh, this breach, that breach.

Transcript:  Can I make one other point?  We pay three percent on all of our credit card purchases.  That's why we don't care, because they have the liability.  That's the unbanked should care.  They're the ones who's who have more at risk.

Transcript:  Hey, your data breaches don't just happen at Target.  They might also happen at Best Buy.  So the Geek Squad. Now, this is an interesting, challenging story because no one likes child pornography.  That's a bad thing.  And when you bring your computer to Best Buy and if the technician is going through your computer and happens to see child pornography, it is their legal requirement to report you to turn you in.  It's anybody's. Anybody's. Not just not just Best Buy.  If I'm looking over Greg Farrow's shoulder, I notice he's got that film on there. I can't.  But if I were able to read his screen, I might want to turn him in. I don't know what he's doing.  But I know. But this is where it gets interesting.  And by the way, a court, a judge has ruled now the defense can bring this up.  A California doctor is facing federal charges after his hard drive was was flagged by a Geek Squad technician.  But the lawyer in the process of discovery for his defense found the FBI had cultivated eight sources in the Geek Squad over a four year period.  With all of them receiving payment.  And at that point, the judge says, well, you can pursue this.  Is the Geek Squad an employee of a federal agency, in which case the search is illegal because it's a warrantless search.  So a private person, I can look at your hard drive and it's not a warrantless search.  As a citizen, you can report it and go ahead.

Start time: 6560.52

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know how this is any different. I mean, I watch all the police procedural dramas.  They all use CIs to go do illegal things all the time.  And then they get this information through the illegal activities of the person they're paying.  And then they go and they're like, well, we didn't do it.  We didn't break and enter. We didn't do these other things.  And everybody's like, yeah, you know, the right side wins again.  And it's like this feels to me has the has the flavor of just something that happens in the world generally  has now entered the world of technology and privacy.  And now we're like, oh, my God, this has to be stopped. This happens all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The only way that the police force works in this country is it works with very little funding.  So their only way to make it stick is to use CIs and to do entrapment and stuff like that.  It's not legal to do that in most other countries in the world.  It's just the way your legal system works here.

Start time: 6632.00
End time: 6648.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait, entrapment is not. I mean, I think that that's an overarching assumption.  I mean, I'm reading what the judge will throw it out if he detects it.  So the point is, this guy signed his computer over to Best Buy.  They found this file in a weird partition that has been erased.  They had to dig through it.

Start time: 6648.02

Start time: 6653.08
End time: 6658.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.  But the bounty, and that's the question, is this is a bounty.

Start time: 6659.48
End time: 6661.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Start time: 6664.20
End time: 6693.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So if you did that in other countries, European countries, Asian countries, that would be entrapment.  It's just not allowed.  You can report that as a citizen's arrest.  But the way that, so for example in this country, let's say you get arrested on a drug offense, a minor drug offense.  The police will make it a condition.  They will let you off.  They'll cut you a deal if you go and find eight more drug dealers and report them.  So that is exclusively something that only happens in the U.S.

Start time: 6695.30
End time: 6711.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, but I'm sure this is the case in other countries.  If a psychotherapist protected by client privilege does hear of a crime that is about to be committed or is required, there's a reporting requirement, is there not?  That's true in other countries.  And also that kind of payment for illegal snooping and all that kind of stuff.

Start time: 6712.02
End time: 6733.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In fact, it is much wider spread than you claim.  I mean, in Asia, you mentioned Asia, in China and Japan, two massive countries, that is fairly widespread.  And then beyond the English speaking world in Europe, most countries don't fit in those categories.  I should exclude the French system out of this because that's completely different.

Start time: 6735.08
End time: 6744.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't want to conflate this beyond whatever.  I'm saying that there are past specs of this which are unique to the U.S. legal system and the way that your legal process runs.  So therefore, I just wanted to highlight that.

Start time: 6745.78
End time: 6812.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, in fact, that's why the judge has allowed the defense attorney to pursue this line of questioning because it does raise the issue of the legality of the evidence.  And here's a memo, for instance, from 2010, where an FBI agent said,  Source has reported all has been quiet for the last five or six months.  However, Source agreed that once schools started again, they may see an influx of child pornography.  The Best Buy technician involved in this case was later identified as a source.  So for six years, the FBI has had direct communication with this Best Buy Geeks God technician  and has been saying, do you see what's going on?  And so this is what the defense attorney says, this two-way thoroughfare of information suggests the FBI considers the Best Buy technician to be a partner in the ongoing effort of law enforcement to detect and prosecute child pornography.  So that's where this might, in fact, get that evidence suppressed because it is illegal search and seizure if he's working for the FBI.

Start time: 6813.58
End time: 6838.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I always question myself in these stories by saying substitute child pornography for tax evasion.  That's the problem.  Because it's such a loaded.  Yeah. If someone was reporting tax evasion based on Excel spreadsheets that they found in partitions that had been deleted on a computer, I think we would all very clearly articulate this is not OK.

Start time: 6839.83
End time: 6840.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's very difficult.

Start time: 6841.00
End time: 6848.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. So that's where I would say if they have a legal mandate or we have a different set of rules for child pornography or the imminent harm to be done to a human.

Start time: 6849.32
End time: 6877.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It might be different rules because you do sign when you hand over your hard drive to Best Buy that you have waived any right to raise a Fourth Amendment claim because you have to sign this.  I am on notice any product containing child pornography will be turned over to the authorities.  Done.  So you're on notice, right?  On the other hand, the Geek Squad guy has apparently lied to investigators saying, I do not remember ever being paid by the FBI and prosecutors have acknowledged the FBI paid him $500.

Start time: 6879.43
End time: 6882.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  And in the transition of the show, it also muddies the water in the world of advertising.  Child pornography does.  Yeah, with the Fark story.  Oh, I love this story.

Start time: 6901.26
End time: 6923.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And of course, we know Drew Curtis very well.  Friend of the show.  Friend of the show.  I've been a fan of Fark since we used to have him on weekly on the old screensavers.  And he's pretty upset.  There's a couple of things going on.  He's pretty upset because Google has blocked him from having ads.  Now it turns out he's not alone in this.  What's going on, Mike?

Start time: 6925.12
End time: 6982.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So Drew Curtis, of course, with Fark, basically there was a story from years and years ago that contained a photograph which in after a little bit of digging, they found was a photograph of a fully clothed adult.  I'll show you the picture.  I think it's in the Fark story.  It's totally an acceptable picture.  It was flagged as child pornography.  And so they simply stopped payment for his advertising for weeks.  And this is during a bad year for Fark.  And they really needed the end of the year.  And they just turned off the tap.  And it took Fark a long time to even get through to Google on this whole question.  And when they finally got through and were communicating with Google, Google said, well, you had the Peto Bear logo also present.  And therefore we considered it child pornography.  Peto Bear is some kind of teddy bear that I guess trolls or whatever use to associate with child pornography.  Anyway, there was no child pornography.  They did nothing wrong.  But there was an adult actress in the photo.

Start time: 6982.14

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It was not, you know.

Start time: 6984.08
End time: 7017.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But they essentially accused Fark of committing a horrendous felony and cut off all the money.  And Google was completely wrong.  And it took forever for them to.  And Drew Curtis goes on this.  Given that that's their business, you know, I mean, fundamentally, and I agree with Drew Curtis on this, fundamentally, any business should take care of their customers.  Google's customers are the advertisers.  They're off canceling drone programs and building self-driving cars and all this stuff.  Meanwhile, their customers are sitting there being burned and accused of felonies.

Start time: 7022.24
End time: 7041.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think these people are incredibly foolish for running such a stupid business.  If you think so, if your sole revenue.  So what they've effectively done is outsourced their advertising to Google.  And so they're completely dependent on Google as their only revenue source.  That is the dumbest thing you can do to your business.

Start time: 7041.34
End time: 7048.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And in hindsight, they have no human contact with their sole source.  No one to talk to.  That is a huge problem.

Start time: 7049.06
End time: 7053.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But none of them are actually.  Including a bunch of Macedonian teenagers.  Now, sure, clearly he has accepted that risk.  Now, there are certain parts of your business that it is wise to outsource.  Right. And they are things like cleaning toilets and rubbish bins and we're washing the windows because they do not impact.  If you give away a key part of your business that is literally where the money comes from to another company, you have put yourself at risk to the platform.  And this goes over and on and on.  Now, when we built the business that we run or that I run at Packet Pushers, we deliberately do not run on Google Ads.  Because I would not want to have my business at someone else's beck and call.  But this happens all the time.

Google AMP is a pair, which is the idea of Google AMP was to speed up loading on mobile platforms by eliminating disgusting ad tech, elaborate, you know, JavaScript, punch the monkey things to pre cash content.  And it works really well.  Google's made a deal with Outbrain and Tabula so that that content will load very fast.  And unfortunately, it looks like it's native advertising.

And what he should be doing right now is he should be out there working on a business strategy to start selling advertising on himself, himself and doing direct deals with companies to put ads on his site so that he owns his business and stop whining about Google didn't give me all the money that I had.

They don't use Google for that exact reason, which is why Google now has an enterprise people who would actually.  But anyway, I just think that I really think that the people the mistake that people make is just because I managed to write something and publish it on the Internet.  I have a right to make money. You do not write.  You have to write content that people actually want to read.  And if you want to monetize it, you have to understand what making money is all about.  And that means a sales force and selling it and managing sales at the very least diversification of income streams at the very least.  If that's a 15 year old business model in 2001, yeah, you could publish something and money would come teeming out of the sky.  This is 2017 media companies of any sort need to grow up.

Bring it home. Our show brought to you by those good folks at Tracker.  We're all used to who doesn't lose stuff, right?  I saw a stat the other day.  The average person spends 40 minutes a day looking, looking for so me.  That is so me.  Glasses, remote controls.  All you got to do is get the tracker.  The tracker is a cute little quarter sized anodized aluminum device.  By the way, there are other Bluetooth trackers like this.  The problem with the one I'm thinking of when the battery dies, you throw it out.  It's done. You can't replace the in the tracker.  You can replace the battery. It's awesome.  What you do is it doesn't have a GPS built into it.  I want to be very clear about that.  I think a lot of times people say, it's not GPS there.  You can't put GPS in that thing.  It would cost a lot more for one thing.  You pair it to your phone, your phone, the tracker software can track up to 10 devices.  I actually have my tracker attached to my keys because that's what I lose the most.  You can have a couple of things it'll help you with.  First of all, separation alerts.  You leave your keys behind.  The tracker app on your phone goes, hey, your keys.  You left them behind as soon as you get 100 feet away.  But it can go the other way too.  Your tracker device, if you've got your keys but you left your phone behind, can beep at you.  You can even push a button on the tracker device that will make your phone yell.  You get to customize that alert.  If you, let's see, what else?  If you leave, oh, I love this.  Okay, so a lot of these devices you leave your key.  Let's say you go to Vegas.  You're doing really well.  You have a couple of drinks.  You're playing the craps.  You leave your keys at the craptable.  Okay, you get back to the room.  You look at your phone.  The phone says your keys are at the craptable.  Problem is since then, some guy from Muncie picked up your keys and got on a plane.  And your keys are now in Muncie.  I don't know why Muncie, but that's where they are.  How would you know?  Because the tracker is in your room in Vegas.  Well, here's the thing.  Everybody, see that?  That map has three and a half million.  Zoom out.  You can see it's all over the world.  Three and a half million tracker users.  Tracker devices out there in the wild.  That means zoom out, Karsten.  Just zoom out a little bit.  There you go.  You can see the whole world is loaded with all over the place, even Muncie.  So the moment somebody with a tracker app on their phone walks by your keys in Muncie,  their app goes, oh, there's Leo's keys.  I'm not saying that happened to me.  But the app said, there's Leo's keys.  And then it said to me, hey, your keys are in Muncie now.  And now I know where they are.  This is beautiful.  This is the largest crowd GPS network in the world.  Leo, I used this in Marseille.

And it occurred to me that this is actually a security thing.  So if I'm out and about, I lose the keys or something happens to the keys.  If those keys are away from the apartment, I know that some burglar hasn't broken in  and waiting for me with the giant knife.  But if they're in the apartment.  They have the apartment.  Then I have another issue.  And then I have to...  Yeah.  And I have to wait for travelers.  It really does work.  You could put them in your bags.

Where the hell is that?  That's brilliant.  And if you've got a piece of it, you pop it in and then ship it around and then you know  where the hell that critical documentation is in theory.

Transcript:  What else?  A couple of quick things.  Here's a, I really like this.  The Ipeg guy is a designer said this is the next Mac Pro.  Upgradable.  Just spread it out a little bit.  I've been saying Apple should bring back the cheese grater, the old Mac Pro, because it was upgradeable.  And Apple, I don't know if this year Apple is going to have an upgraded Mac Pro or if they're just going to abandon the whole line.  Sometimes I think Apple doesn't.  What are we looking at Leo?  This is somebody's concept.  But see how you could upgrade.  It's got a real video card so you could actually change it.  You could upgrade the hard drives.  It's got slots for four hard drives.  And it's still beautiful.  You could still say innovate my ass or whatever it is Phil Schiller said when he introduced the Mac Pro.  And stopped all innovation.

Start time: 7673.46
End time: 7683.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It just strikes me the Mac Pro is probably the precursor to dongle hell.  It was the first.  It was the first of the dongle hells.  Apple says we're going to put this inside and everything else is going to hang off this thing.

Transcript:  According to Ars Technica, Andrew Cunningham was very good and should know.  He says Apple is planning a Netflix and it's going to do scripted TV shows.  They're getting into the TV business.  It actually comes from Wall Street Journal.  So let's give credit where credit is due.  The Wall Street Journal.  Apple sets its sights on Hollywood plans for original content.  That's a hard thing to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So you think this is a shot across the bow.  This is playing hardball.  We're trying to get them to cooperate with Apple.  We're Apple.  You've got to come to us on our terms.

End time: 7756.49

Start time: 7766.46
End time: 7776.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hollywood was absolutely refusing to give Apple content for fear of them dominating the market.  And they did the same thing with Netflix and with Amazon and then Netflix and Amazon just  turned around and started making their own content.  That's what I mean.

Transcript:  It's the fact that they're now using Netflix and Amazon as leverage to say, sell us your  content.  Isn't that funny?  Wow.  How we have...  Flip that around.  Apple could go and start making content.  And yes, with repatriation on the horizon and a tax holiday from President-elect Trump,  sure, what's $10 billion invested over five years?  It's not a cap.

Start time: 7837.26
End time: 7847.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But their best move was just to...  What did Netflix do?  They had no expertise in making stuff, so they gave $100 million to Kevin Spacey.  You're just funding your stuff.  And say, make House of Cards.  You just fund it.  You find the right people.

Start time: 7848.00
End time: 7859.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Becky's right.  It's just such a massive upfront cash commitment to commission these works.  And for every success that we actually see on Netflix, I believe there's two or three  shows that die on the vine or die in pre-production.

Start time: 7859.89
End time: 7871.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That is the expertise is choosing the shows.  Actually, Amazon does it brilliantly.  They do a bunch of pilots and then they put them all up and they let you choose which  ones are going to get made.  I think that's brilliant.  Analytics.

Start time: 7872.48
End time: 7908.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And because these platforms show, they know how long people are watching for.  They know whether they're binging them.  They know whether they're watching in the evenings or in the mornings.  They have much better ratings than TV.  There are even things like, are people actually attentive?  Because if you're not online for more...  You can't just press play and let it play all day.  It stops.  Netflix actually stops.  The reason it stops is so they get the analytics on whether you are actually watching.  Oh.  Right?  I thought they didn't stop.  Yeah.  Netflix...  For a while they didn't stop.  They played through.  And then when you're pressing start, it'll actually pause and say, are you still here  watching?  And that's literally not because they want to stop streaming, partly because they want  to save money, but mostly because the analytics, are you actually watching?

End time: 7976.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't.  I mean, the story is that at the end of the day, the deal didn't fall apart.  You would have thought the breach of this deal was starting.  You would think.  Right?  The deal should totally fall apart.  Half a billion accounts.  Yahoo should be dead.  There should be nails going into the coffin and people pouring, sprinkling holy water  on top of it because it must be cursed.  But it still makes money.  Yahoo.  It still makes money.  Yeah, but what it actually does is it makes double money for Verizon because Verizon makes  money.  And then the traffic crosses Verizon's backbone.  Verizon can now match the content.  So this is why they buy HuffPo.  Oh, it's for peering?  No, they sell the data about what the traffic going, their backbone to the ad tech company  so they can do better ad targeting.  Your data.  They get 10 to 20% better targeting.  You're actually paying for it.  It's a $24 billion market selling traffic data as it crosses the internet backbones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is a company that comes through your email to see what receipts you have.  And then it tells you when things ship, when there's a price drop.  I love it.  Yeah, it's a great app.  But I didn't realize they are also selling the data of what's selling.  They were the ones who had the ear pod story.

Start time: 8002.30

Start time: 8007.00
End time: 8024.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All of those services should be free because they make far more money out of the back end  selling the data.  Slice is free.  It's free.  Yeah, that's how they monetize this by selling data.  So Verizon, AT&T, those carriers are literally tens of billions of dollars industry selling  your data as it crosses the public backbone.
