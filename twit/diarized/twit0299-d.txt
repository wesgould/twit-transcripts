Start time: 193.18
End time: 201.97

Let's talk about it.  Well, you know, all right, wait a minute. There is royal tech news.  So, true to what anybody expected, the Royal Wedding did in fact break streaming records.  Lots of people watched it online. Is that any surprise?  300,000 concurrent views.

Start time: 390.14
End time: 456.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, this is, though, this is live stream. So there were different streamers, right?  So you can add it all together.  OK.  Total unique viewers on live stream, 2 million.  Livestream was doing the CBS Entertainment Tonight, Associated Press, UK Press Association coverage.  Akamai said that it did more streaming.  Akamai is a CDN, a content distribution network.  So it has, you know, it serves a lot of people, including probably all of these other guys.  Akamai said that they had... Let me find the story again.  Somehow got replaced by Beatrice's hat.  Akamai said that the 4.6 million page view...  Every time. Every time.  Princess... There you go. 4.6 million page views per minute on the news site.  Akamai did say, though, this fell well short of the 10.3 million page views per minute  of the presidential election victory for Barack Obama.  And... Oh, no, I'm sorry.

Start time: 478.18
End time: 505.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kaput. Kaput.  Everyone was saying, well, this will be the ultimate test of the Internet on Friday  during this coverage.  Would it be able to hold up to the girth of people going there to watch this live stream,  people like Natalie tuning in?  But does it show where around the world most people were watching these live streams?  I think probably the reason it held up is because most of the US was asleep.

Start time: 505.46
End time: 510.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Right. Yeah. Right.  We were we were busy doing something more important. Right.

Start time: 511.42
End time: 524.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

End time: 565.33

Thirty nine percent from mobile devices.  Remember, Twitter shutting is really trying to shut down these third party mobile platforms like Uber Media.  They want everything to come from their official.  Clients, but really, I mean, look at this more than more than a plurality came from the Twitter website,  where you see all the ads, all the trends.

Start time: 705.02
End time: 714.48

Start time: 810.20
End time: 821.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's exactly what I was telling my business partner, Lisa Kensel, just the other day.  I bet she wants a job where she could take care of her boys, have more time for herself and yet still be in the limelight.

Start time: 823.20
End time: 876.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I don't know how important the limelight is.  No, OK. You rephrase that. Still perform your duties as a reporter.  You know, so I think about this like I am an on air personality.  And so I'm constantly asking myself how much I care about putting my face as a part of my journalism or do I just want to write?  And I feel like I kind of, you know, I've got to stick with the face thing for a little bit longer.  And then someday people won't want to see my face.  So maybe I'll do it for a little longer.  But there is the hope that or the possibility that maybe I just write because that's how I started my career as a writer, not as a TV person.  So but I'm interviewing for TV jobs, writing jobs, and I've got some freelance work as well that I'm working on with Consumer Reports and Forbes.  Oh, that's great. Yeah.

Start time: 876.22

Start time: 888.92
End time: 894.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  No, but I mean, that's I mean, that's what it sounds like now is that you just didn't want to work there anymore.  You want to work somewhere, but not there.

Start time: 897.50
End time: 902.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 903.54
End time: 924.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I mean, doing a show, I mean, you know, from doing broadcasting for so long, Leo, when you do a show for so long  and, you know, when you don't have, you know, really don't have any producers to help you.  And so you're writing a show every day and it's incumbent.  You don't see that changing, that structure really changing.  And I don't want to put words in her mouth, but, you know, it's you get exhausted.

But we've got Natalie just launched a new show on our nascent network, Mommy Beta, which is a show with four new moms.  We've got our daddy on board shows. So we're you know, we're having fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

End time: 990.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_11

Start time: 1000.78
End time: 1018.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  No, I think that really I would I think that's great.  I encourage you to do that.  Everybody who works in mainstream media fantasizes about doing their own thing and controlling it.  A hundred percent.  Leo would never do that, though.  I personally couldn't afford to.  So, yeah, no, actually, I'm just trying to build a mainstream media outlet so I could tell other people what to do.

Start time: 1018.48
End time: 1037.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm curious to find out.  There's so many people who listen to your shows and find what you do so so inspiring and at the same time, perhaps liberating.  But because you're running the day to day operations of everything, do you find it is liberating?  Well, it's Merlin Mann says Merlin Mann says you always are working for a man.  You're working for the man somehow.  You working for yourself.

Start time: 1037.98
End time: 1104.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  If you're the man, that's even worse, right?  No, I think that there's it's on balance much.  It's far preferable to do your own thing.  Don't you think everybody and then what I try to do now, obviously now in order to grow, we've had to hire people and use people.  And, you know, you could speak to this as well, Will, because you're running Channel Flip, which is also a broadcast style operation on the Internet.  That what happens is you do hire people and then they're complaining because they don't have full control.  So what I've tried to do is do it's almost the United Artists model.  Remember, Charlie Chaplin and Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks formed a movie studio because they were unhappy  with being told what to do in the in the old style movie system, you know, the contract player system.  And so they formed United Artists.  And the whole idea is it's almost a co-op of performers.  And that's what I've been trying to do here.  So that people have a sense of of at least owning their own destiny somewhat.  So it's very loose here.  But, yeah, there is there's there's burdens, Clayton.  You know, you have to write checks and stuff, but it's not it's still far preferable, I think.  Yeah. So go for it, Grizzly. Go for it.

Start time: 1104.76
End time: 1108.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we're having fun. You know, I think that's great.  Until I have to start writing checks.

Transcript:  Well, and there's little things you realize that Apple's paying attention to very,  very small details like I was playing with it a little bit.  And the first thing that hit is that when I touch the screen, it's not always  the playbook on the playbook.  And I was like, I was like that as an Apple user, that would drive me absolutely crazy.  My son, for instance, who lives on his little iPad, whenever I allow him to  three years old, he wouldn't even I'm sure that the playbook would drive him crazy.  I know. But I mean, I think that that's the that's really the measure.

They did say it was a highly skilled intruder and that Sony,  as soon as they realized this, brought in a second security firm,  emailed customers and then took the whole thing, the whole damn thing down  because they couldn't figure out what was going on.  And it's still down.

Transcript:  Well, I think this is really the issue that we're going to get into.  I mean, we're kind of in the growing pains of cloud computing,  where we saw the breakdown in Amazon, we saw the breakdown in Sony,  where, you know, that this is kind of the wake up calls  that you need to make sure that you have a robust backup system,  that you have everything really separated.  I think we've kind of taken for granted.  And now we need to, you know, I think these are fortunately  these haven't been real showstoppers.  It could be a lot worse.

Transcript:  I spoke to someone at Apple this week who was, you know, said basically  they were slow on the uptake with all the location tracking stuff  and Amazon as well.  But doesn't this just speak to the larger trust issue as it relates to the cloud?  Everyone's worried about this issue.  And they're saying, oh, the cloud, can we really worry about that?  And the contrarian approach is, look, we rely on all these services  all the time that aren't reliable.  Right. I mean, we go away for a subway on a regular basis.  How often is that late? And I can't get there.  Or, you know, you take public transportation, you take highways  and you have to sit in traffic on a regular basis.  So you have these outages.  And I think everyone jumps on this bandwagon that all this just speaks.  I mean, I think there was like a thousand or fifteen hundred  articles all written about this idea of the cloud and it being a complete failure.  And this is one of the reasons why we shouldn't rush to the cloud.

I mean, I think that I think we're going to be I mean, when you look at where  we're going, I think this is these are some speed bumps.  I don't think that I think that people doing stuff on the cloud.  And I was a real naysayer for a long time because I don't like  a lot of having all my data up there.  I don't like all that stuff.  And I've now realized that half my life is connected to the cloud now.  So, I mean, I think I do I do think this is, you know,  resistance is futile at this point.

Start time: 2482.47
End time: 2514.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It looks like in their explanations.  I mean, the issue is, is that when they say that they're not tracking you,  what they're saying is, is that we all we're trying to figure out  is where all the Wi-Fi spots are and where the cell towers are.  We're not trying to figure out where you are at any moment,  but we are trying to figure out where those are,  because what that helps is accelerate a cold start.  So when you turn your computer, when you when you come out of a plane  or you come out of whatever and you you have a hot start  and a cold start with a GPS and the faster the GPS knows where it where it is,  the faster it will light up all of those connections.  And so that's what you're saying.

Start time: 2521.82
End time: 2568.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's not the GPS one because it's not using the G.  But it's cheating by using the basically a GPS, but by using cell towers  and why and Wi-Fi, it can it can more readily figure out where it is for a hot start.  You know, and so having that data in there, you know, and then of course,  it also helps Apple.  I mean, when you look at it helps Apple and Google figure out where  they're going to do things like, you know, someone was talking about,  you know, I was really surprised that my my my hometown in Montana  is completely mapped out in Google, like, you know, and there's like one stoplight.  And how does that happen?  Why does why does Google why does Google map it there is because they've seen  that there's a lot of people that are using Google services in that area  because they're getting those reports back and they go, oh, well, we can.  It's worth it to map out that area because there's enough people  that would actually use it.

I don't I think that this has kind of been blown out of proportion a little bit.  And, you know, I think the mainstream media doesn't really understand it completely.

Transcript:  There was a lot of correcting going on this week. Trust me.  I mean, there was, you know, Apple.  I would see the teases in different capacity.  Apple is cashing in on your location. Really?  I'm sorry. How are they cashing in?  Are they selling this now to third parties and they're trying to make money  based on selling you tacos because they know that you're a 34th  and vine at this moment? No.  They're using it to obviously try to improve the devices  and use this information, however, they're going to use it.  But I agree with I agree with Natalie in this.  The AT&T has this information.

Start time: 2623.98

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, we knew that they could do this for a long time  because of mobile means find my phone because you don't pay for it.  Doesn't mean that it doesn't work.  So they always have had the ability to tell where your phone was  by cell tower triangulation.  Just the fact that it's cashed in iTunes is what's so offensive here.  And I'm not offended.  I already knew that it could do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Which nobody still reads, but...  Right!  At least if you did, you'd understand it.  Right.  I think what's become very clear now, and I think every company now realizes this,  is we are aware of it, people are aware of it, and it will be a story.  Whether it's a legitimate story or not is irrelevant.  It is important that companies tell you clearly and obviously that they're doing this.  Apple didn't do that.  They didn't handle it very well.  If there's a failure here, it's a PR failure more than anything else.  But going forward, you know, Apple, Google, and everybody else,  look, it should be obvious, it's obvious to us that if you've got a phone with a GPS,  that you're being tracked.  And a microphone, and a camera, that there's... this is the ultimate spy device.  But I think it's going to... it just behooves Apple and everybody else now to say...  And they do this with other stuff, Ramayt is constantly... this is happening.

I think a lot of us just look at it and shrug our shoulders because to us,  it's obvious that you would be picking that information up.  But I think that for people who, you know, buy iPhones, you know, the general population,  I don't think that they even consider the idea.  So I think it is a great thing to get press so that people know about it.  Do I think there's any big deal?  I don't really think it's that big of a deal.

I mean, my father will tell you, and my father's a lawyer, he'll tell you if there's a car accident.  If he's got a client in a car accident, the very first thing he does is subpoena the phone records.  Right.  Because if you're on the phone, when you're in the accident, he wins.  You know, and it's just, you know, it's just like, you know, we're not, you know, they'll settle.  The insurance company won't even take it to court at that point.  You know, they've lost the case.  And so it doesn't matter whether you're in the front or the back or sideways.  If you're on the phone, you're done.  You know, and so that's the first thing he does.  And what they're going to start doing is, of course, you know, subpoenaing, you know, GPS.

It certainly should have gotten more attention than location.  Too complicated.  Yeah.  Takes too much brain power.  But not for our audience.  They're brilliant.  That's why I know that when I say, why don't you go to GoToMyPC.com right now and sign up for your free 30-day trial?  They're going to go right now to GoToMyPC.com.

I have GoToMeeting on my iPad.  Get it on the App Store.  So what happens is you put GoToMyPC on your Mac or your PC and then you leave the office and you can go anywhere.  You take your iPad with you.  And it's so weird to see a Windows PC on an iPad, by the way.  It's a little strange, but it works great.  It's very fast.  These guys at Citrix know how to really get performance out of this, even out of slower, more latent networks.  They're experts.  They created remote access.  In fact, that's what's licensed to Microsoft.  If you work in enterprise, you know about the Citrix server.  This is the best stuff.  And I like it because GoToMyPC for the iPad gives you the best of both worlds.  It's a very thin, light device.  And now you're running your computer, Windows PC.

Transcript:  How can you agree to something if you don't read it?  Exactly.  And they said that basically we said you can't sue us as a class action.  You can't, you know, like that you agree not to do that.  And the Supreme Court upheld that ruling.  So basically what this means and what this means effectively because this breaks, this is against the law.  This was against the law in 20 states, you know, to put that into the terms of agreement,  which now the theoretically overturned by the Supreme Court.  But what this means.

Transcript:  Is it the end of class action?  Now, I'm not necessarily a fan of class action lawsuits, but oftentimes the damages are so small that you're not going to sue.  You can't the only way you can correct is something.  You know, it's an early termination fee.  Are you going to spend half a million dollars pursuing AT&T over an early termination fee of 150 bucks?  You're not.  On the other hand, the purpose of a class suit is that you can get AT&T to change your behavior by having to pay a class and you know,  $150 each that's now you can get some decent money out of that.  Their contingency fees are higher so you can get a lawyer to represent you.  Contingency fee on $150 ain't so good.  I think these class action lawsuits.  I know we don't want a lot of litigation, but I think this is the only way to to take care of some of these consumer issues.

Start time: 3222.58

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think that one of the reasons people have been a little blase about it is because it is a there have been so many frivolous class action lawsuits.  And so I think that what's happened is that that so many people using it when they shouldn't and admittedly law firms who their businesses,  you know, get a class action together settle and remember some of these law firms are taking anywhere from 20 to 40 percent of the take.  So, you know, you have a hundred million dollar class action that gets settled out and they're taking 20 to 40 million dollars off the top of that.  And so those are the you know, so that these law firms that have made it a business and gotten into this into this mess,  you know, is I think why a lot of people just kind of rolled their eyes like, well, it's probably better to not have so many.  But it is very, very, it's very, very important to be able to have class actions is a very important tool  when things are happening that are beyond the reach of criminal activity, but are, you know, wrong.  And allowing people to make that decision is very, very, very important.  And this is a big deal. It's very complicated.  It would have to be fixed now in Congress.

Transcript:  Yeah, I see it.  They can also the other side of the flip coin is a company like A&TT can require can force mediation say you can't sue us.  We can force that you go to mediation if you do have a problem with this.  That's not the only decision, a court decision this week that kind of carries some weight.  This one's a little more subtle and a little more difficult.  On Thursday, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that an employee doesn't have to actually hack anything to be prosecuted for hacking.  So essentially the judge wrote and the dissent agreed that an employer can write a Internet policy statement.  If you break that policy, if you exceed authorized access, you can be prosecuted under federal anti hacking laws.  Any person that I think the judges in the minority in the majority thought that this this really means that if you're doing something fraudulent, you can get prosecuted.  They even use the word fraudulent.  But the minority decision was very clear that in fact you don't have to be committing fraud just just breaking the policies of your company.  So get ready for some all sorts of criminal prosecutions for people, you know, surfing to eBay against company policies and being accused of hacking.

You know, well, the our our CBS mail on a podcast computer or something like that.  And then you you see that you're not in your own account.  This that also opens you up to being fraudulent.

Transcript:  It was well, it's interesting because Apple you expect Apple to gross.  You have more revenue because they're selling expensive hardware, right?  But their margins you would think are so small, so much smaller than something.  What's the margin on a copy of Windows?  I mean, once they've done all the R&D, they could sell you a trillion of them at the same, you know, with full 100% profit.  But in this case, Apple's hardware is so profitable and they sold so much of it.  They actually made more money.

Start time: 3481.84

They just made a little bit more margin, but they made I think 50% more revenue.  So it's still a smaller margin, but they're just they're just outgrossing Microsoft.

Start time: 3708.28
End time: 3726.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that was cheap.  Well, the bottom line is it gives them the option that if they need to buy something to solve some issue, I mean,  they someone talked about, you know, Comcast making money.  They could they could.  I mean, they could buy, you know, Netflix, for instance, they just write a check for Netflix.  It wouldn't even show up on the would even show up on the main page of the, you know, of their expenditures.

Start time: 3726.62
End time: 3777.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think one of the things they like doing and one of the things I think, you know, the operations guy quite high on are quite hot on doing is  because they have this massive pile of cash, they can make really, really big advanced orders for all the actual components of hardware  that they that they manufacture in China.  And that means they can guarantee cheaper prices.  So when something like the you know, the Japan earthquake happens, they've already got all their pricing and all their hardware, you know,  locked up for the next six months or something like that just doesn't affect them at all.  So we saw, you know, I think in Apple's results that the Japan earthquake kind of had no effect on the net margin.  And that's because they've got so much cash to be able to guarantee all these orders, you know,  six or twelve months in advance to make sure they get the pricing that they want.  And that's why Apple is able to, you know, really make such great margins on all its products.

Start time: 3786.74
End time: 3822.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but I think that they could at some point in time, it does give them room to be very aggressive about certain things.  If they need to push a technology, if they need to push something down the path or they need to purchase something much larger,  maybe they have ideas about that.  But it also does mean that they can, you know, they can do that without worrying about running out of cash.  And because they're a hardware manufacturer, I mean, you see that, you know, these expenditures that they're making over the next year,  I think the next quarter, I think was like 11 billion.  And so they, you know, if they're going to continue to grow, you know, they have to be able to buy,  they have to have a massive amount of cash on hand, much more than a software company like Microsoft,  because they're because of their dealing with all these issues.

Start time: 3823.08
End time: 3834.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I'm surprised Clayton hasn't said this yet, but you can tell they put a lot more money in research and development when it comes to a new product.  They don't skimp, they don't cut corners and they will go back to the drawing board if it doesn't come out.

Start time: 3934.00

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Because they spent so much.  Have you seen the...  I can't imagine it's back end infrastructure, but so much on getting this thing up and running  and the partnerships that they spent.  They spent money hand over fist.  Plus, they're doing all kinds of events like it's South by Southwest.  They're running people in buses.  Do you remember at CES, they had all like the Bing buses you could take all around Las Vegas.  They spend money hand over fist on these large concerts where they're trying to be hip and cool,  where people are going to show up to a concert that's put on by Bing.  Or they were rolling off, remember the Kin?  Remember they rolled out the whole Kin?  And they did that whole big concert series for the Kin.  Like they wanted hip young kids to come and play with their Kin phones at a Microsoft concert series.  Two people showed up.  Right.  So they spent like $5 million on little things like that on a regular basis.  I can't imagine that that's...  I imagine that's probably what they did with Bing.  Have you seen the maps on...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they're spending a lot more money on maps, I can tell you that, than Google is.  If you look at...  If you go to San Francisco and you compare the Google maps and the Bing maps.  So Google is going around with a car and that's cute.  You know, they got little cameras and stuff like that.  I saw one go by.  And I was trying to think of something to do.  I saw a Google car and I wanted to...  Like it was coming by me and I felt like this is my moment and I couldn't think of what to do.  This is my moment to moon it.  I know, yeah.  Something...  It was like something but I couldn't do anything.  But the Bing maps...  He froze.

If you actually move through the maps, you're realizing that there's like 3D models.  It's not just like...  They're not just planes.  They can actually move in a lot more...  It's much higher resolution than what Google is doing.  And so this is just another area where they're dumping an enormous amount of money into things that they're kind of upping the level of competition, which I think is good.

Number one, you know, it wasn't so long ago that everybody was really down on the hardware end of Microsoft  and that, you know, it's their games division that was losing hundreds of millions a quarter.  And now their games division is making them a ton of money.  You know, they put that investment in and they're now reaping it back.  And I don't think it's gonna be too long actually before the games division starts to get into sort of net profit over the sort of five or ten years they've been operating it.  I think they're hoping the same will happen for the Internet division.  If you look at the revenues for the Internet division, they're actually up year on year.  So it is, you know, although they're losing money, it is growing in the way that they want it to.

But they can afford to, right?  You can afford to and it's not unheard of to buy market share in search as long as the market share doesn't shrivel up and blow away when you stop buying those ads.  It looks like our federal budget.  Yeah.  At some point you have to make money on this thing.  Yeah, right.  You can't just keep spending and say, well, we're growing our search share.  Speaking of saving money, I think this is kind of interesting.  Amazon is getting into a price war with iTunes over the cost of a song.  iTunes brand new songs cost as much as a dollar 29.

End time: 4275.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, they don't.  Remember, they got taken to court by the publishers because the publishers wanted to control the price.  Amazon had to capitulate.  And so now the publishers have more control.  So you would think that the same would apply to music.  I don't know, because apps, they do set the price.

I was having this debate the other day with someone about whether or not it's valuable to have this storage locker in the cloud.  Steve Jobs has argued that we all want to own physical media,  but does this give us some sense of ownership when we put our ones and zeros in some sort of a sky cloud locker somewhere?  We don't own it anyway.  We don't have access to this physical ones and zeros anyway.  It's not like we're sitting here with a CD in our hands.

Transcript:  We had a great interview with Michael Robertson on Triangulation on Wednesday.  He's the guy who did MP3.com and was chased out of the business by Universal to sue them.  And then when they got the stock price of MP3.com low enough, they bought it.  So, I mean, just a classic, just shark story.  But he, that was the first music locker.  The whole idea of MP3.com was if you have a CD, you put it in your CD player, your computer would generate a hash and then say,  OK, now you can listen to that without ripping it, without uploading it.  Now you can listen to that music on MP3.com because you've shown us that you own it.  And even though there was no merit to the lawsuit, they couldn't afford to defend it.  This is what Michael says. Great interview. You should listen to it on Triangulation.  But and then you and universally even admitted to him afterwards.  Edgar Bronfman celebrating in the closing dinner after they bought MP3.com.  Even then, he said, no, it's just business, man. It's just business.  We just we sued you. So you'd have to sell to us at a lower price.  Just the record industry has such a horrid track record.  It's just amazing. And of course, there is a cable vision decision.  Remember, Cablevision made a online DVR in which you would record shows  and store it on their cloud for your DVR instead of a hard drive in the thing  and was sued by the movie industry and won movie industry lost in that one.  And that's kind of a definitive case. But do notice that Amazon and anybody else,  you have to even though they may not even be keeping a copy of the song,  who knows how they're actually doing it, but you have to upload your music  and I think before you could store it in the cloud.

Transcript:  the same thing with Netflix and they're trying to do the same thing with Google.  They don't want what they don't want is anybody to get control because all  of these companies are much more savvy than they are.  So if you with Google, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, these guys are moving much faster  if any of them get far enough ahead, they know that they'll start dictating terms,  which interesting left would most likely be good for the industry because they  actually know what they're doing. Right. But the industry is I think that they  don't know which way is up at this point. I think they can't figure out why people  aren't buying more DVDs. They can't figure out why people don't want to buy  any more music and what's wrong with Jews people. Yeah. And they're and they're  trying to figure out how to how to stem the bleeding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  They've got a monopoly. Actually, the library does it and and so forth.  But as far as I'm concerned, there's no choice simply because there's nothing better.  Right. Audible.com has all the greatest books, seventy thousand plus titles.  You can play them on pretty much any device, including, of course, all the iOS devices,  but also all the Android devices. In fact, I really love and I use it all the time.  The audible application on Android. It's got a great widget so I could see what's playing.  I could see the album art. I don't have to download books ahead of time.  I can I see my entire audible library on my Android or iPhone and then pick a book that I want to listen to at the moment.  And you know what I love? One of the things I love about audible is that your library is always available to you.  Unlike iTunes, you can read download those songs any books. I'm sorry. Anytime you want.  So it is like a library that works on the Kindle effect. I just got that new Kindle, you know, the ad supported Kindle.  It's interesting. Amazon is now putting all your audible books on there as well as the books that read the text books that you're reading.  That's great. Isn't that good? Because because they've got three gigs on there.  That's enough for quite a few audio books in addition to the regular ebooks that you're reading.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's interesting with the Kindle, too, because you can do the text to speech on some of the books if the if the company allows it.  So you're sitting there with your audible books like on a flight, for instance, and you've got one that's a text version of the book.  And you can flip it to the text to speech. And you can also then jump over and listen to your audible audible books on there with the voice actor who does it better than that.

There's no sign of it anywhere when you go into iTunes on the Apple TV or when you go through the interface on Apple TV.  But then when I jump into the App Store or jump into iTunes on my iPad, it's right there.  I can rent every episode. I can buy the whole season, get a full season pass and watch it that way.  Makes absolutely no sense. This this content fracturing on these devices.  And I get really frustrated. So we're going to fly out to San Francisco tomorrow.  I'm going to load up a few episodes of it. I have to rent them. I have to buy them.  But then if I want to go through the Apple TV to watch them, I can't unless I use Airplay to throw it up there.

You don't need cable to get movies or TV.  You just get it all over over iTunes or IP or Netflix or something like that,

Transcript:  And obviously both you and I have a vested interest in this, Will, because we're Internet broadcasters.  Caps capture.  It's a problem. Yeah. Channel flip.  I mean, you're you're aspiring to be a television network over the Internet, right?

Start time: 5441.88
End time: 5477.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah. And so I think, you know, over here, we're we're already starting to see it,  albeit with with phone companies rather than cable companies where people are starting to question,  you know, we have to pay all this money to have a, you know, effectively over here.  If you have it, you have to have a phone line to have Internet.  And people are saying, well, I don't really need a phone line because I have a cell phone.  So why can't I just have Internet? And all the phone companies are saying,  well, we don't want you to really just have the Internet because then we won't really make any money.  So, you know, the same thing is happening over here.

Start time: 5478.02
End time: 5481.78

Start time: 5482.18
End time: 5493.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, they don't have cable companies, because we don't really have cable.  So all of the services through the phone.  So you really in a worse competitive situation, at least in the States,  you usually have a choice between cable and the phone companies.

Start time: 5494.94
End time: 5529.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah. So generally over here, you can't most, you know, everywhere obviously has phone.  So you can have DSL and you can choose between your DSL providers.  But you still have to have the you still have to pay for a phone  because you have to have the phone service to have the DSL service.  And so people are saying, well, why is that? You know, why is that really?  It's the same. Why can't I just have Internet and not have phone?  If you're in a place in England where you can get cable, most people who can do  because it's faster and the packages are generally better.

Transcript:  But Larry Page, you get from the book, you know, and you really get this big thinking person in Larry Page.  And, you know, I want to build this monorail system.  And I feel like I feel like this issue that we're just talking about is an area where Google could once just swoop in and say, you know what?  Incredible high speed Internet access for every community in America.  We're just going to cover it. We have the money in the bank. We're going to build it.  We're going to cover it. They're already doing it in certain communities.  And you know that it benefits them to have more people more quickly on the Internet.  There's still I don't know, was it twenty two percent of the country that still doesn't have broadband access?  This seems to me like a Google problem. Something that you wouldn't.

Transcript:  Wouldn't the real the real when the top 20 markets be the place that you could put a lot of pressure on them?  You put a lot of pressure on the top 20 top 100 markets where you could put a lot of pressure because that's where everyone's making their money.  You know, the and there's typically a lot of bad service, you know, you know, the the service that we get in San Francisco or where we used to get in San Francisco until I moved, you know, is just horrible.  And now some of that has to I think some of that requires some legal battles.  But if you started really saying this is what it's going to look like in these big markets, it would force a lot of these companies to go to backtrack, I think, because everyone would jump on.  I would jump on like if Google came in here and said gigabit Ethernet.  I do it gigabit connection for $200 a month or $150 a month.  No caps. You know, you can you can.

Start time: 5635.84
End time: 5670.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  The problem is that then they would be a monopoly.  So because nobody would compete with that.  And that's the problem is that all this all this infrastructure is so expensive.  So they have to put fiber in to make that work. And that's very expensive for a subscriber.  Here's my suggestion. And I don't this isn't my idea.  This is an idea that Bob Frankston came up with.  We had Tim Poser on triangulation last week.  The cities should treat the wiring for Internet broadband as infrastructure just as they do water and sewer.  Yeah. Put that in and then say compete.  We will do the infrastructure. Now let's have a hundred ISPs trying to provide the best service.

Start time: 5670.86
End time: 5704.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know who's doing that? Who?  I hate to bring this up because I always bring up Rwanda.  So Rwanda owns all the fiber going through.  They are running fiber to every city.  They're all the fiber coming in and all the fiber going around.  They have tons of extra dark fiber that's there.  They do everything up to the last mile.  And then they say, OK, now all of the cell providers and all the Internet providers get the plug into this fiber backbone.  You know, and it's done. It was done correctly.  It's done by one. And then but the government also says this is the this is the amount you're allowed to charge over what we're charging you for that for your service.  Now you can add other services to that. I don't think they should do that.

Start time: 5704.94
End time: 5724.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I think they should just say, hey, you charge whatever you want.  If there's competition, the price will find its natural resting point.  The reason you do this, though, is it really is infrastructure.  And you don't want the government in the Internet service business because then they control the channels here.  But but it's infrastructure. I don't think you want the federal government doing it either.  I think you want a lot of small municipal governments doing it.  But that's just the thought.

Start time: 5725.26
End time: 5740.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the problem is, is that in these ISPs saw this happening.  And so some cities started getting into this business and the ISPs immediately came in and got laws passed.  So like in Pennsylvania, the government's not allowed to not allowed to even roll, not even like the fire.

I think they did this. It was a couple of million.  I think it was a charitable donation to the Internet.  I think they said that delicious should be kept around.  Well, you know, it costs us nothing. We'll just throw a couple of little money.  We got a few billion from Google.

Start time: 5800.00
End time: 5813.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I end up using I find that I'm using insta paper more and more.  Well, I love that. Just but I don't use it.  I think I'm using it obviously to read content. Right.  But I'm also saving stories there that I just want to remember.

Start time: 5814.02
End time: 5878.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And I'm you know, here's my I'll give a plug for Pinboard and why I like Pinboard.  It's not free, by the way. You have to buy it.  But that's one of the reasons I like it, because they have a financial model that makes sense.  Right. You know, and we use it to bookmark all our stories.  So Pinboard follows the delicious API, but it adds some features.  Yahoo never added anything to delicious. They just let it lie fallow.  But for instance, it will follow a Twitter account.  So I have a special Twitter account links underscore for underscore twit.  And any time I tweet a story there, it automatically goes into the bookmarks there.  I can add a hashtag if I want.  So then when Eileen, our producer, sits down and says, what are we going to talk about?  All the stories we've talked about have been tagged by me and others into our Pinboard account.  Then she go through it, which makes it really easy.  It does do what you want to do, Clayton, which is for a slight I think twenty five dollars a year.  You could say I want you to capture this entire page, save it, cash it, have it local.  Have it locally for me. So it has that feature.  So you don't have to read these pages. You save them forever, though.

Transcript:  It's just scattered all over the Internet for me.  I mean, if I'm going to go into a meeting and pitch stories for the show on the weekend on Fox and Friends,  and I've got, you know, I'm in this app and I can't I can only email it to myself.  I can't save it out to delicious somewhere because it's a native app on the iPad or something.

Start time: 5895.90
End time: 5911.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's exactly what I use it for. You have a special Pinboard email so you can email it to your Pinboard.  You also have the tweets and almost all the all the things like Flipboard and everything will support you tweeting something.  And listen to this high praise.  I use Evernote for this kind of thing. Evernote is great too. I love it.

Start time: 5911.88

Start time: 5923.84
End time: 5938.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Didn't they just have an update, though? Didn't this week they just added social?  I was listening to the Evernote podcast, by the way, this week, actually.  And they I think they just added a big social component to Evernote.  I don't check that. I will.

But Evernote updates every day.  It does. They always have an app update.  Don't you want that? What's wrong with that?  Every time I log in to Evernote, I have an update.

Transcript:  So this is the Twitter links for Twitter account.  So I follow a lot of news organizations.  So one way that I can send something right now to Pinboard is just by retweeting this.  And as soon as I retweet this, this is let's say I want to retweet this.  Nick, Bill. Oh, I'm not logged in. So I can't.  But if I were logged in, I could retweet it and then it would go right into Pinboard and I can add hashtags.

Start time: 5990.98
End time: 5997.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just think it's and so you don't have to search through Twitter to find stuff you've shared.  No, you don't have to search through Instapaper to say it's all right there.

Start time: 5997.96
End time: 6019.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's all right here. And then see Pinboard just adds it as something it saw on Twitter on the Twitter account.  Let's see if I can find. Yeah, it says from Twitter. See?  So that means it was from from the Twitter account.  And I used hashtags to 99. That's episode to 9 in Windows Weekly.  And that's so that way it pulls it right in.  It's just a retweet. But I have the article now.  I like that. I listen is really great.

Facebook is so easy to be eager to protect copyright that the mere accusation of copyright infringement is enough to get an account locked ours.  Technica, which is a really great site for tech news, found this out the hard way Thursday morning when our own Facebook page became inaccessible.  No warning, no explanation, no clear appeal process.  All it said was we have removed or disabled access to the following content that you have posted on Facebook because we received a notice from a third party that it infringes.  They don't say what infringes and there is a link that you can find out for more information.

That's the first mistake number one.  So I'll put a send button on there but it shouldn't be the only thing that you do.  And I agree, I mean I look at YouTube, you have to go to copyright school.  I mean we're going to, for instance, putting that South Park clip in the show, we'll almost certainly get this show taken off of YouTube for copyright violation and then we have to respond.  And then you get three strikes, you have to go to the YouTube copyright school.  The pendulum has swung all the way over.  At least you don't have to show up anywhere.  Yeah, and the test is very easy, I already passed it, I didn't even watch the video.  It had a pirate kitty cat on it though.  That was good.
