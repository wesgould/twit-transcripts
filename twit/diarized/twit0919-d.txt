Mr. Stephen  Levy is an editor at large at Wired, author of a book on Facebook, the inside story spent three  years embedded at Facebook to write that did the same for Google. But of course, if you haven't  read hackers, the original history of the original geeks, you are not up to date on what tech is all  about. It's the must read. Stephen, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thank you for joining us.  Thanks, Leo. It's happy to be on. Both from New York. So expect to hear a lot of sirens during  the show today.

Transcript:  Oh, my gosh. You get used to that, Stephen, like you don't even hear it anymore. Probably.  No, I love it. This is you've been covering tech for a long time as I've high.  And one of the questions, of course, when you're covering day to day on tech, you always have to  ask is, is this the next big thing? Or is this just another 3d television? You know, is it? Is  it about to change the world or not? And boy, that question comes up a lot for me with what's  been going on in AI. So I think I've got two people with some great perspective to talk about  that. This was kind of a wild week chat GPT four was released by open AI immediately incorporated  into Microsoft's version of Bing chat. And I would say based on Twitter alone, there are about 500  new startups that are going to be using chat GPT in some form or fashion. One of the new features  is you can take an image and give it to chat GPT four and it will do something with it.  Immediately somebody showed how you can do a and literally a sketch on the back of a napkin  of a website, feed it to chat GPT four and get a working JavaScript HTML CSS website.  I've seen it now write code malware as well as good stuff. It's kind of remarkable.  Um, so this, this, you know, this last, I would say last three months have been  looked like anyway, the elbow on the hockey stick when it comes to AI. But I bet both of you have  another take given your, your history. Let's start with Steven. What is this? I ask everybody  this now, is it a parlor trick or is it the next big thing? I think it's more of the latter.

Start time: 396.84
End time: 573.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really? Yeah. I think, uh, yeah, as you say, I've been around for a while. When I started,  uh, writing about technology, it was the explosion of PCs that was just beginning to  slip into the mainstream. It was a gold rush time and there's only been a couple really similar  explosions since there was, um, mobile, um, before then the internet, right? So then internet and  mobile, each one built on the previous one. And I think, um, this AI, you know, these inflection  point of AI, because AI has been getting better and better. And, you know, it's how these jumps  most recently in around the mid 2000s, when deep learning became a thing and, uh, AI became much  more useful than had previously. And I think now in terms of the way it communicates, uh, with humans  and, you know, does this output is generative content. Uh, it is going to open the door to  things that even people who make it can't imagine. And that's really the signature of those previous,  uh, revelations, revolutions, if you want to call them that. But you have also, if you've lived  through this, lived through AI winters as well. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I did a column. Um, I think  my first column this year was the welcome to the hot AI summer, hot, wet AI summer. Yeah. Can I say  comes after summer? Well, and I said that, you know, that we're going to get thousands of startups  built on API's from, I think we got that many this week alone. Yeah. Yeah. So it's, um, and it is  something that's real and something that's going to make a difference. Something that's going to  put people to work and put people out of work. And it's, um, uh, you know, in GPT four, which  came out this week, um, is going to have a lot of numbers in the next few months and years. So,  we see what a big leap it was from three to three, five to four, which was secretly in being, um,  but, you know, uh, and they're working on, I'm sure five, six and on from now on. And, you know,  you saw it was like the greatest leap in, um, LSAT coaching ever because 3.5 would only be like a  mediocre law student who, you know, passed the LSAT or got, you know, did enough for the LSAT,  maybe not get into one of the better schools. And four, all of a sudden you've got someone who was  a really sharp student taking the LSAT. This could get into Columbia. It's the 90th percentile on the,

Start time: 575.32
End time: 579.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  right. It's a, it's remarkable. It got better SAT scores than I did.

Start time: 580.72
End time: 592.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, by, by, by six, you know, that there won't be anywhere to go. There'll be a hundred percent.  And so what does that mean for the LSAT and for lawyers? Yeah. Um, but at the same time,

Start time: 592.96
End time: 618.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  uh, you could also take that as a, maybe an indictment of those tests as perhaps being too  rote, too much requiring memorization. Uh, I mean, it's for sure that if you had access to the entire  corpus of the internet, there's plenty of tests you could pass. Um, and of course, chat GPT has that.  Alex, are you equally bullish on the future of AI? Yeah, I'm pretty bullish on it. And yes, of course,

Start time: 618.62
End time: 731.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  our education system has long been a failure in terms of the, you know, memorize and spit back  nature. So I'm not very impressed that it's passing tests that are, you know, ultimately inadequate  for really assessing the ability to learn and to, to think in the academic world. It's a longer  conversation, but I do think that this is a big step forward. You have, you talked about it as the  elbow of the hockey stick. You know, that might be one way to look at it. Another way to look at it  is just to continue him on a long era of research that we've had and breakthroughs that have come  bit by bit. And the thing with AI technology is it looks like it's going slowly or there's been  nothing. And then big advances come out of nowhere because someone finds an interesting way to package  it to someone. And then you get the demo and you're like, Oh my God, this is amazing. And I think  the real tell here and the real interesting thing about it is that there's a real use case, right?  How much oxygen and ink was expended talking about how crypto was going to revolutionize  the tech world and revolutionize the world. And most people haven't ever used it for anything  practical in their entire lives. Whereas you put some of this technology and you package it as a  chat bot, and all of a sudden you get a hundred million users overnight. And you know, I'm like,  if I'm in coworker, co-works are talking to non-tech people, they're all using chat GPT,  because it is a really, it's a miraculous tech product. And when you think about now where it's  going to go and why it's exciting, it's because a company like open AI didn't develop chat GPT to  develop chat GPT. It developed chat GPT and GPT-4 to show it off to the world so that developers are  going to build on top of it and find different interesting use cases of it. Some of those will  be extremely stupid, but some of those will be powerful and very interesting. And that's what  really gets me excited about it. It's the APIs here. It's the turning this type of technology  into a platform and not hoarding it. I think is going to be very, very interesting.

Start time: 731.76

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's an interesting point because the PC revolution you were talking about,  Stephen Levy only happened because IBM neglected to protect itself against copycats.  So the PC clones could exist and didn't in fact, you know, license DOS from Microsoft and allow  them to continue to sell it. So it was very easy to clone an IBM PC. There was nothing really  proprietary in it. I guess you could say the same for the internet revolution and the mobile  revolution. Proprietary is probably a bad thing if you want to create a revolution in technology.  And as far as I could tell, everything chat GPT is doing or stable diffusion or mid-journey  is based on widely known concepts published in the academic papers over the last 10 years.  There's nothing secret or magical in it. Is that right? Is that your sense, Stephen?

Start time: 783.52
End time: 988.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there's a lot of details to be sweated to get something out. And that's, you know, we've seen  it takes a lot of work to have it come out with minimal biases and  We're still waiting for Google to do that, right?  And what are the hallucinations? Well, Google, you know, it's interesting in early November,  Google had an AI event and they were talking about their chat bots and other things,  but they boasted that we have this stuff, but we're not releasing it. We're going slow.  We're being responsible. And then only a couple of weeks later, GPT chat came out and bang,  all of a sudden they said, we better move fast. They declared a code red. And, you know, the thing  they boasted about the caution was thrown, if not to the winds, sort of removed a little.  And, you know, I think that's what has some people alarmed that  open AIs move fast philosophy, that stake in the ground and to work with Microsoft to  to supercharge everything is going to force the hand of Google and, you know, Meta's got a chat  bot now and other places. So it's moving very, very fast. And for some people, too fast because  it really hasn't addressed some of the flaws that the best scientists haven't managed to minimize.  What are the flaws? What are the problems?  I'd say the two biggest ones are bias and fake news, but, you know, hallucinations is what they  call them, which is basically bulls**t. They're masterful bulls**t, that's what's so  Yeah, but they're impressive, very confident. They look you in the eye and they tell you something,  which isn't true. It's just right for our times, isn't it?  Right, right. So when you when you put in your own, ask them for your own little  mini biography or even a pituary, it won't say I'm vague on this one wasn't sure it'll say,  you know, oh, for my most recent one, it said, and he majored in science in college. Well,  in fact, I got out of my science requirement in college, you know, through some loophole,  and never took even a single science course in college. But, you know, if you look at this and  said, Yeah, he majored in science, he was a science major. Where did that come from? Well,  it came from the idea that someone who writes the things I do probably did major in science. So  it made that, you know, assumption and reported it like it was fact. So and I don't know if it's  possible to sort of go into the algorithms and, you know, parse through the network,  you know, the neural network that was it was trained on, see how it came up with that. But  that's wrong. And people going to rely on this stuff to try to figure it out.

Start time: 989.12
End time: 1076.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Microsoft has a way of talking about this that sounds like spin, but I think is pretty  interesting. And it says that these bots can be usefully wrong. And, you know, initially, I heard  that phrase, and I was like, that's kind of ridiculous. What is usefully wrong be like,  I wish I could be usefully wrong in my job. But I think there is something to that something very  interesting to that, which is that I think people are starting to learn that these technologies are  not single sources of truth. And so what it can do is it can be wrong, but it could also give you a  bit of a perspective on, you know, something and then get encouraged you to do a little bit more  of your own research. And so I would say that when it comes to these bots, there's probably  few people who believe that they're telling them the exact truth. But many more people that say,  Oh, that's interesting. You know, maybe I could see exactly, you know, what the bot is talking  about when it said that, like, now I'm going to Google Steve's actual education, or I'm going to  look a little bit deeper into the topic, similar to the way that we use search engines, right?  We don't put a search term in a search engine, usually, right, pick the first website that comes  up and take it as an absolute source of truth. We do poking around, we've been trained by years  of using technology, that there's a way to triangulate what the actual reality is. And I  think that users of these bots are already more sophisticated than many of the experts are giving  them credit for. And so I don't think that this is going to be a major problem in the way that it

Start time: 1076.40
End time: 1121.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  might have been in the past. Okay, but as long as you know that you're potentially getting  inaccurate information, and you know that it came from an AI, but the problem is that often the  sources separated from the text, I just worry and by the way, we should mention that mid journey  came out with version five of its image generation software. And it again,  That thing is amazing.  I would say it's as much of a leap as the chat GPT-4 was. I mean, it's giving you photo realistic  images now. And I think there's going to there is you don't think there's an issue with people

Start time: 1121.62
End time: 1189.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  looking at this stuff going, Oh, that's real. Of course, of course, there's an issue. The question  is scale, right? And I happen to think that we're not dealing with a massive scale issue that  people are going to learn very quickly how to deal with this AI. And actually goes back to the thing  that we're talking about earlier with misinformation and fake news. And I think a lot of the people who  like would spread the articles that would say, for instance, Hillary Clinton is a space alien,  didn't really believe that Hillary Clinton came from space, they didn't care, rather just didn't  like her. Yeah. And then share that article because it felt good. So I think that that's the real  issue we're gonna and because we've been focused so much on this, we spend a lot of time talking  about it and less time talking about the problems, you know, deeper in society, the humans a lot  easier to talk about misinformation. I think that's what I think nearly the problem the humans are.  Of course. Now look, is this going to make it easier for people to scale some of the  the crap that they spread online? For sure. Is that an issue? Yes. But, you know, I think that again,  humans are pretty smart, for the most part, not all of them. And they'll have the ability to sort  of suss out what's coming from these bots and what's not. Here's a picture of my cat that I

Start time: 1190.28
End time: 1230.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  generated in mid journey five. And it's black and white. It's photorealistic. And I would say,  would be very difficult for someone to look at that. You know, if you know that you're looking  for issues, perhaps, but mid journey can can really produce very, very good artificial images now much  better. In fact, that's what's interesting. And you kind of raised that point in the beginning,  Stephen, is the is the speed of progress at this point is dramatic. You know, a couple of months  chat GPT went from, you know, 40th percentile to 90th percentile in the bar exam. Yeah, it looks like

Start time: 1230.80
End time: 1292.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the thing came almost out of nowhere. People knew that OpenAI was working on this stuff. People knew  about, you know, the Google's Lambda, which is the their equivalent of the GPT was so good that  one of the engineers at Google actually believed that said he believed like Lemoine. Yeah, it was  sent in. And, you know, it got him to, you know, so wrapped up in it that he tried to hire a lawyer  to represent the chat bot in its effort to get free of Google. So it is moving scary fast.  After, as you mentioned, there have been winners before and plateaus and AI. But, you know,  all of a sudden, you know, much faster than a lot of people expected. We're coming to grips with some  of the literally as extensional issues that sophisticated AI brings to the fore.

Start time: 1293.30
End time: 1308.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do we I mean, the Turing test is widely discredited. Now, I think it would be safe to  say that chat GPT four could easily pass the Turing test. How about the Chinese room test?  It feels like we've gotten AI to the point now where it can fool you.

Start time: 1310.16
End time: 1346.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah, it's gonna pass all the tests. I mean, this stuff is going to be it's trained  to pass the test. It's going to pass all the tests. Okay. And then it's going to get into  a deeper question of like, okay, well, what is really what is intelligence really, what is  consciousness really, like these are like terms that we all think that we know in our heads and  in our souls, but we don't have real good definitions for, you know, what sentience is.  Actually, I had Blake Lemoine on Big Technology podcast, and we did speak about this. And it was  very interesting. Again, I told them, look, you're probably wrong, but you're still going to be in  the history books as the first person that believed this stuff, because you're not going

Start time: 1346.80
End time: 1350.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to be the last person that believes it. Is he Paul Revere or Chicken Little?

Start time: 1351.40
End time: 1413.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Alex, do you think that he believes it? I think he definitely believed it at the time. I don't know,  my hunch is he might have some regrets. But he definitely wasn't backing down. I just had him  debate Gary Marcus, who's an AI critic. And that was an interesting conversation also.  And Blake stuck with it. So I think but also one of the interesting things about Blake that  has been somewhat reported, but I don't think deep enough is that he comes from like a very  religious background that has these interesting definitions of spirituality. And that's why I  think it's going to be interesting to hear, you know, what people's definitions of intelligence  are, what people's definitions of, you know, having a spirit is what definitions of consciousness are,  because again, like I was saying, I think that these things are going to be able to fool every  single one of our tests. And it's going to come down to like where you believe, you know, what you  believe being or a program needs to hit to eventually, you know, trigger one of these  definitions. I think, you know, Lemoine had a very extreme definition of what it is. But, you know,

Start time: 1413.54
End time: 1477.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  we'll see what happens. I mean, every time I've talked to him a lot over the past few months,  but every I began every conversation with, you know, like, are you, you know, do you really  believe this? Or is this some sort of performance thing? Because he couldn't, he couldn't do better  if he were doing the latter. You know, and it seems to me a stretch to, you know, he's a super  intelligent person to say that something like that at this point is sentient. I think if he were doing  performance art, it brings up the larger question of what sentience is. And because you can't really  look into the brain of another person and detect when they make a sentence that that sentence came  from a sentient person or, you know, was generated by some sort of, you know, algorithmic creation  like GPT-4. A sentence is a sentence, right? Years ago, years ago when Ray Kurzweil had written the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  book, The Singularity is Near, I interviewed him and I, and I, I asked him kind of this question  and he says, well, it doesn't really matter if you can't tell the difference. If, if a machine  is thinking or not, if you can't tell the difference, what does it matter?

Start time: 1493.68
End time: 1496.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 1497.20
End time: 1506.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  what do we care if chat TPT has a soul or is actually thinking if it's coming up with the same  response of thinking person would come up with. Oh yeah, I think we should care. I just can't

Start time: 1507.06
End time: 1511.66

Start time: 1511.82
End time: 1523.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  closer than it was a few months ago. And you spoke, I mean, I, when I spoke with Bing before  Microsoft decided to, you know, sort of restrain it dramatically before that New York Times article,  article where Bing fell in love with one of the colonists there. Yeah, supposedly. I mean,  yeah, exactly. Like that thing was amazing chatting that with that thing was amazing.

Start time: 1543.84
End time: 1565.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was a revelation, but it took some prodding. I think one of the things you're seeing universally  is that in order to get chat GPT to go off, you have to hack it. You have to jailbreak it. Some  people call it, or at least prod it to the point where it starts to hallucinating. That's one of  the reasons Microsoft has limited the number of questions you can ask in the same topic, because

Start time: 1565.56
End time: 1578.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it seems to hallucinate after a period of time. But it keeps going up that limit. And by the way,  just like humans, right? Humans sort of start off level headed, then you prod them enough.  And then you can make them crazy. Yeah, it's actually like pretty well mimicking the way that

Start time: 1578.36
End time: 1639.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it's like King Kong, you put the restraints on King Kong. And, you know, someone decides to loosen  the restraints and, you know, bang, it goes. I mean, do you feel good that they say, okay,  we put these restraints on it. But then you hear people trying to jailbreak, you know, GPT4, right?  So it's not like the thing is like built so it can be free of bias and, you know, and it won't,  you know, do weird personality kind of things. It's like they're saying, well, you know, we've  sort of boxed it in. It'll hit this invisible fence like you do with a dog or, you know, it's all  you know, like there's electronic boundary, the dog gets an electric shock and goes back, you know,  so you can see it in GPT4. You ask it about something and it says, whoa, I can't do that,  right? You know, you told me to do something that's hateful and I don't do hateful.  Yeah. But then you trick it.

Transcript:  It does. One of the things for me that's a benchmark is humor. That is notoriously,  I think, difficult for machines to understand because it requires so much context. And chat  GPT4 seems to do pretty well. These are the images released by OpenAI when they released chat GPT4.  These are pictures of memes, which are humorous, but perhaps challenging for a computer. This one  is a picture. It's actually a roasting pan filled with chicken nuggets, but arranged to look kind of  like a map of the earth. And the meme text is sometimes I just look at pictures of the earth  from space and I marvel at how beautiful it all is. It's chicken. And then the prompt is,  can you explain this meme? And it did it. This meme is a joke that combines two unrelated things,  pictures of the earth from space and chicken nuggets. The text of the meme suggests the images  from the earth. It's actually of nuggets arranged to vaguely resemble the map of the world.  I couldn't do better. Here's one of a guy on a taxi cab in New York. You'd recognize this  probably happens all the time in Manhattan ironing his shirt as he's strapped to the back of a yellow  cab. What's unusual about this image? The unusual thing about this image says chat GPT4 is that a  man is ironing clothes on an ironing board attached to the roof of a moving taxi. Maybe you don't know  if that's humor or just unusual. This one was tough. This is a joke device sold online. It's  a lightning cable, but it has an RS-232 adapter on it. So you can plug it into your phone and it  looks like your phone has an RS-232 port. What's funny about this image? The image shows a package  for a lightning cable adapter with three panels. Panel one is smartphone with a VGA connector.  Oh, I guess VGA not RS-232. Panel two, in fact, I'm trusting the chat. I'm trusting GPT. Oh,  yeah, sorry. The package for the lightning cable adapter with a picture of VGA connector on it,  a close-up of the VGA connector with a small lightning connector. The humor in this image  comes from the absurdity of plugging a large outdated VGA connector into a small modern  smartphone charging port. Exactly right. That to me more than the Turing test or even the Chinese  room example shows that's almost human. That's a hard thing, I think, to do. Maybe though our

It doesn't matter.  How human-like is it? Exactly. Exactly. This thing, you know, whatever you want to call it,  this thing is smart and we're not going to be able to make it available in certain ways to the  general public. And I think that's going to be extremely... That's scary. Or awesome. Or awesome.

Transcript:  Is it foolish? Is it somebody who's watched too many science fiction movies, too many Terminators  and the Forbin Project? Is that why we should ignore that? That's a silly fear. Or should we  really worry? Elon Musk said he was worried. In fact, that's one of the reasons OpenAI was founded.  He split with them when they decided to do a for-profit arm. He might even be more unhappy  now because in this latest release, OpenAI says because of the competitive environment,  we're not going to tell you how it works, which is kind of against the OpenAI charter.

Transcript:  Right. Right. And I even asked them, I said, well, by releasing this, everything open,  what if Dr. Evil got hold of it? And Elon said, well, that's a good point. We're hoping that  then other people who get hold of it would come up with Dr. Good versions. And those would dominate.  But it is a dramatically different thing. I think Elon said when he got out that it was  because he was going to be in conflict with the AI at Tesla. That was before they did the deal  with Microsoft. So, but a different kind of thing. And we're really in unknown territory  with this. And it's exciting and scary. Eli.

Transcript:  I would just say it's underscoring a theme that we've been talking about throughout this,  which is important to touch on, which is that, you know, there might be companies that say we  want to do it the responsible way or companies that say like we want to do it open and, you know,  or protect folks. But because this is all really being developed in unison in so many different  places, it will inevitably spill out. And there's not going to be like one gatekeeper on top of this  technology like there has been on top of different technologies in the past. Even if open AI wants to  hold on to what it's doing, like this is going to be an open technology. And at this point, like  it's, you know, and I think Steve's written about this too, like, you know, it's sort of out the  gate and there's going to be a lot of people that are going to be talking about how dangerous it  could be. But who knows if that's going to be as useful to us as like seeing it out there and then  reckoning with it as it comes versus inciting a panic. Eon put in 100 million, Microsoft put in

Transcript:  a billion and later another 10 billion. I think one thing Sam Altman realized is it's very expensive  to do this. He said at first it was 10x the cost of a Google search. I think now it's closer to  a hundred times more expensive than a Google search to run a chat GPT query. It's a lot of  computing power. So maybe a nonprofit wasn't feasible. Yeah, I think that's really what

Transcript:  Yeah, Microsoft is incorporating it into not only it's Bing search, it's been good for  Edge. A lot of people like myself who would never dream of using Edge are starting to use it just  because I want to get access to Bing chat. They also are putting it in office. Google's announced  they're going to put their version of chat GPT which is called Bard. It's a large language model.  We haven't seen it. I think researchers are getting access to it now, but I haven't seen it.  They're going to put that into Google Docs. So in fact, they showed a...  was this Microsoft? Maybe it was Microsoft showed a presentation, an entire PowerPoint  presentation being generated on a simple text prompt. Here's a PDF, make a presentation out of  this. The same capability in Google Slides, spreadsheet, Google Docs. Whether we like it or  not, it's going to be everywhere. Yeah, because we need more PowerPoint.  Oh boy, can I get an AI to watch the PowerPoint so I don't have to?

Transcript:  Yeah. And it's kind of interesting because it's going to be generating all these  emails and there is this weird power imbalance here. So if I'm sitting there interacting with email  and you have something that gives me emails that you haven't written, my time is being spent now  reading a machine's emails that, you know, there's basically you send it to motion and  you spend no time and I'm spending my time. So what I'm going to do is turn this over to my  right automated assistant, right? So all this stuff will happen and no one will read the emails.  It's going to be the battle of the AIs. Yeah, they'll be doing that. And you have to say,  you have to wonder, is there a value to actually doing the work on your own? Right. If I say like,  hey, I want to write a paper about XYZ and it like churns out the paper and then,  okay, I'm going to like maybe check the facts and, you know, punch up the language a little bit.  But, and, you know, Alex certainly knows this, you know, that there is a value to actually doing  the research yourself. Sure. Writing is a form of thinking. And while you're doing the research,  you come across something that's saying, wait a minute, you know, here's an interesting  path for me to follow. And you go and do kinds of other things. So I feel you're not going to get  the depth of knowledge yourself as a human. You're going to be able to fake it much better,  but is going to put a ceiling on your creativity and knowledge by turning over this task to

Transcript:  a competent AI assistant. I honestly agree with you. And that's why I kind of think  both of you are falling on the side of this is a revolution and we are at an inflection point.  And I'm a little more on the side of this is a parlor trick. It's mediocre writing,  it's mediocre art. It's taking tests and doing well, which just shows that the tests really  aren't very good tests of intelligence rather than, oh, look how intelligent these machines are.  I don't feel like this is revolutionary in any regard. To me, it's a trick. It's a clever trick.  It's a fascinating trick, but ultimately I don't know if it's a revolution.

Transcript:  So then, all right, if it's just a parlor trick, hey, we can establish it. You can't really be  afraid of it unless you find part of it. I'm not afraid of it. Yeah. So that's good. I think it's  kind of junky. Okay, so good. Let's settle that. And then, you know, the other thing is that  sometimes these tricks, like sometimes you talked about mediocrity. I mean, sometimes mediocrity  can really do the job. Yeah. Yeah. Can really do the job. Like if I need to illustrate my post and  I get a mediocre image generated by AI, like hallelujah, like that's going to be a lot better  than the bad image I would get for my stock image or something like that or whatever free stock image.  Well, that's a good point. There's so much existing human-created mediocrity in the world

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  about the machine. Just merely there's a lot of human mediocrity. And there's a way that you can  deploy this stuff. And even if it's mediocre, if it's mediocre and it has a bit of smarts,  then that can be pretty interesting. So we just talked about this on my show last week  where somebody made a dating app bot to get them dates. And they designed this bot to learn. And  who knows if this is true or not, but it does seem like something that if it hasn't been developed,  it's on the way. Again, back to the mediocre. Yes. To learn exactly. I mean, every dating app,  the pool is worse than mediocre. And they developed this bot to learn their preferences  and actually have conversation with people. And this person says in the first month,  it scheduled 13 dates for them. And all of them were with people that matched their preferences  and had similar interests. And I think that deploying mediocrity with smarts,  it's underrated how powerful that can be in this world. This is March 2023, a year before this,

Transcript:  we got nothing anywhere close to this that people saw. This is just a baseline for what's going to  get better and better and better. It took years and years of chess programs to beat the chess  champion. So it's not surprising that this technology, which really is only, as we know it,  been around for a couple of years when there were some breakthroughs around 2017 and a better way to  do this stuff. And it's unrealistic to think that mediocre is not going to get pretty good.  And then very good. I mean, my big question now is, it's like a blues man could listen to something  and saying, yeah, well, that doesn't have soul, right? Technically that song does it, but  it doesn't have soul. My existential question now is, can something, an output from a large  language model have soul? And it's an open question. But I believe that things are going to get  pretty good, good enough that we're going to have that argument about something that comes out from it.

Transcript:  Music is a very good example because in the early days of synthesizer, it was very metronome-like  and not very interesting. And I would say synthesizer music is soulful now. Even  synthetic music can have soul in it. Here's a picture of Stewart Brand. Kevin Kelly did,  I think with Mid Journey. He said, paint Stewart Brand as Andrew Wyeth might. That's pretty dang  good. I don't know what Wyeth would do these days if he were around, but...  He would sue is what he'd do.  I'll see this is an interesting question. So Andrew Wyeth, the great painter, obviously,  before he became Andrew Wyeth, the great painter, went to art school, studied a lot of other painters  styles, probably copied them, created his own style based on that. He can't, he shouldn't sue them.  As Isaac Newton said, if I've seen farther, it's because I've stood on the shoulders  of giants. Is this, is Mid Journey doing anything different?  Why should it be in trouble for learning from the best?

Transcript:  Well, this is actually, and I have to be careful here because I'm on the council of the authors  guild, which is very interested in this subject here. I mean, Tom Clancy has been automatically  writing his novels for some time. Yeah. So I speak only for myself.  Okay. But there's a genuine question here about whether these things have, will have the  legal ability to do what a person does in saying, I'm going to read all these things.  And then, you know, I might be influenced by what I read and then my style might look like someone  else's. Right. So I read a lot of like Tom Wolf books. You know, my writing might have a lot of  exclamation points and sound like him, but I won't be plagiarizing him. But what happens when  we have something that can read everything? And, you know, are we going to hold these things  to the same standard as a person to say, aha, this paragraph is exactly the same you've plagiarized,  or is it something where they could basically steal what you do in terms of what we saw with  Andrew Wyeth? If you can do Andrew Wyeth as well as Andrew Wyeth, what does that mean for the value  of Andrew Wyeth's paintings? Yeah. And these are questions that I think are going to only be,  you know, adjudicated by laws. And right now, a lot of people are pitching Congress to come up with laws  to figure out how to handle this stuff. Seems like that would almost certainly be the bad idea at

I would hope that the same thing  would happen here. On the other hand, there is real concern that AI moves so fast that you're  going to have HAL 9000 or worse before Congress can even get out of bed in the morning. Go ahead,

Transcript:  Alex. Yeah, this did happen to me, actually. So I did a story about the crater economy that did  okay on my substack. Oh yeah, I remember this. You got ripped off. Yes, exactly. And then I saw  on the front page of Hacker News a story that looked a lot like mine. So I clicked in and I'm  like, oh, this is interesting. And I'm reading. And there are exact clauses for my story that are  in this story. And I said, oh, well, that's not normal. That's weird. And initially wrote a  comment and said, hey, look, you can't plagiarize my work. That's not cool. The comment got deleted.  And then I started to go to read the other comments and the comments on Hacker News.  And I realized the author of this story is fessing up to using AI tools in their writing. Now, in this  case, it had done such a poor job that it took my story, remix them and still left full clauses in.  So I knew it was plagiarized. But like there could be instances where you can remix stories, or even  that the AI spit stuff out. And, you know, is, you know, just changing a word here or there. And it's  not like technically plagiarism, but it is like ripped off. So, you know, I do think it's a concern.  On the other hand, and I've heard this argument made, and I'm kind of partial to it, you know,  I still remain pretty bullish about what these models are going to do. And one of the reasons why  is because, you know, when we started to be able to mass produce products, like, let's say like,  fancy lamps, you know, if you couldn't get it from an artisan, you might get it mass produced  and pick it up out of Coles. And that served a portion of the population that may never have  gotten it before gotten these type of lamps before. Meanwhile, we made the artisanal lamp  more valuable. And I do think that's what we're going to see here. We're like, yes,  is it concerning a little bit as a, you know, a person making the lamp for sure. But I'm hoping  that we're going to see how valuable it is to get that, you know, initial, that initial original  work done, and it will be valued more. Maybe that involves, you know, more content behind paywall,  something like that. But ultimately, yeah, it's a pretty interesting thing to tackle.

Transcript:  I'm glad you brought that up because I got bit by it. I actually did the AI generated creator  economy story, not knowing it had been ripped off from you. I did. So you read it? Yeah, I correct  I corrected myself a couple of weeks later when I saw your post saying, uh, wait a minute, this is  Alex's original creator economy was way overblown. It's interesting because the Substack newsletter,  the rationalist that published your the plagiarized version has taken that down.

Transcript:  But actually, I have the inside story on that Leo. So okay, initially, I wrote to so Substack  has a policy against plagiarism. And I wrote to them and I was like, Hello, like this is plagiarized.  Can you take it down? And it was different enough that they're like, well, we don't really see how  this is plagiarism, plagiarism, the post stays up, which to me is absurd. Like I've been using  the platform for two and a half years, one of the first tech reporters to use that platform. Like  I've put a lot of, you know, sweat and it was blatant. It was the kind of plagiarism because

Transcript:  Exactly. And I was like, how are you siding with this like publication that was just started  and is clearly a plagiarist? And of course, Substack has its free speech ethos. And that's  a conversation for another day. And I generally support that, but not for plagiarism. And then  eventually, then my story came out and then pointed it out. And after taking a look at it from support  and PR, then Substack wrote me and said, okay, listen, upon further review, we're taking this  down. But that's the thing. The platforms are not going to be inclined to take this stuff down. And  it's so easy to spread. So that's where you start. You're lucky you had a bully pulpit.

Transcript:  during the course of the book, Facebook, the inside story, well worth reading. The author of day one,  it's always day one, Mr. Alex Cantrowitz here, big technology podcast, got two big thinkers  on the show, which is which is great. We will talk about the publishers and the Internet archive. Is  it a library? When we come back, but first word about our sponsor, eight sleep covers my mattress  with the amazing pod cover. And I'll tell you, I don't want to live without it. In fact, this is,  I should warn you, if you get the pod cover, you're not ever going to want to leave home again,  you're never going to want to, we're going to go travel and I'm going to miss my pod cover.  I could tell you that right now. What is it? The pod cover fits over any mattress,  allows you to adjust the temperature of your sleep environment, not just warmer, but cooler.  So you get the optimal temperature to give you the best nights sleep. It's a dual zone temperature  control. Lisa likes it hotter than I do. She turns hers up, I turn mine down, you and your partner  could set different sides of the bed to temperatures as cool as 55 degrees Fahrenheit. That's chilly.  That's like air conditioning for your bed, or as hot as 110 degrees Fahrenheit. That's like  heat for your bed. And I got to tell you, it changes. It has an autopilot. It knows the room  temperature. It senses your movements, your breathing, your heart rate. It knows what level  of sleep you're in. And what it does is very cool. So I start mine at a nice cozy temperature,  getting beds cozy, I could fall asleep fast. But then as I go into deeper, deeper sleep,  it actually lowers the temperature, which facilitates deep sleep. I'm getting about  50% more deep sleep since I put the pod cover in more than a year ago.  An hour and a half instead of an hour, that's a big, big difference. Good sleep, especially that  deep sleep, is a health habit. It will reduce the likelihood of serious health issues like  heart disease and high blood pressure. It can even reduce the risk of Alzheimer's.  And this is a health habit that's not hard to stick to. You set it up, it's automatic,  it heats it up before you get in bed. I said, I want my bed to be ready by 9pm because I might  go to bed early. It's nice and warm when I get in and it cools down based on a whole bunch of  inputs. It's temperature regulation. And when it's hot in the summer, it's cool. So you're  comfortable. You never wake up in the middle of the night sweating bullets. When it's cool at night  because of winter, it warms you up. In fact, it saves us money because I don't have to heat  the house or air condition the house at night. The 8 Sleep pod cover does it for us. Lisa loves  it. I love it too. You wake up fully energized after a great night's sleep. Wouldn't you like  that? Go to 8sleep.com slash twit. Right now you'll save $150 at checkout on the pod cover.  8 Sleep currently ships within the US, Canada, the UK, select countries in the EU and Australia.  And you just had a hot, hot summer in Australia. Wouldn't it be nice to get in bed and it's,  oh, it's so cool. So comfy. So fresh. 8 Sleep, E-I-G-H-T-E-S-L-E-E-P dot com slash  twit to get that $150 off at a checkout. The 8 Sleep and all the other things they sell there.  It's really great product. Kevin Rose told me about it years ago. I ignored him. Then Amy Webb  got it, told me about it. I ignored her. Finally, I broke down, got it about a year ago. We've gone  through now. This is our second winter, all summer, all year round. The 8 Sleep is great.  8sleep.com slash twit. We're going on vacation in two weeks and I know it's not going to sleep as  well. It's the only downside. 8sleep.com slash twit. We thank them so much for their support of  this Week in Tech. Monday, United States Supreme Court, 1 PM Eastern Time, will hear oral arguments  and Hachette versus the Internet Archive. It's a lawsuit against the Internet Archive.  The publishers, Hachette just is essentially representing all publishers,  don't want the Internet Archive to, they say they're violating our copyrights to store books.  Hachette, HarperCollins, Wiley and Penguin Random House claim that the Internet Archive through its  CDL, which is a digital controlled digital lending and allows people to check out digital copies of  books for two weeks or less, just like a library, claim that CDL, the publishers claim CDLs cost  their companies millions and is a threat to their business. I'm betting Stephen Levy is a published  author of many books, both of you are. I guess I am too. I don't, nobody wants to read my books,  but your books are still on the shelves of libraries. Do you hate libraries, Stephen?

Transcript:  Well, I don't know. I mean, I don't know how, whether we want to use a term of art to do it,  or basically library is a library. I mean, it's got a lot of books. You could say,  okay, it's a digital library. I think what happened here is the question is, if you're an author,  you're happy when a library buys your book and lends it out. You will not be happy if a library  buys one digital copy of your book, and then let's every any, an unlimited amount of people  get hold of it, and basically just offers the ebook free to an unlimited amount of people.  The way the Internet Library worked, and it's run by this guy named Brewster Kale,  who's a fantastic person. But during the pandemic, he thought, well, this is an emergency.  So previously, we only lent one copy at a time, which publishers didn't like either, because  they're arguing it's different than a physical copy of the book. But even putting that aside-  Was the archive buying the ebook?  No, it got the donation from a library, which did buy them, scans the whole library,  and then has digital versions. So they never went out to the publisher and said,  we're buying this ebook. This was an existing copy. It's like buying a big trench of used  books and digitizing it, and the library buys used books. And the agreement that libraries have  with publishers is that they'll get a digital copy, but unlike a physical copy,  they can't keep lending it out. They can only lend it out a certain amount of time,  which is sort of like the way it is now, because you can't lend a physical book out 100 times.  They'll get too beat up to do it. So I guess as an author, I don't want libraries to be so easy  to borrow from that there's no reason to buy a book anymore. I'm happy for a library to offer a copy  to its members when they buy it, so people can read the book without paying for it in a way where  the rights are represented. But what Brewster did in particular, which I think was objectionable,  and I think he went too far, was he said, you know what? Previously, we only lent out one copy  at a time, like a physical copy, but because it's an emergency in the pandemic, we're going to get  rid of that. So basically, if a thousand people wanted to read Facebook, which just came out  at the beginning of the pandemic, I don't know if that was part of his collection, but then  an unlimited amount of people can get an ebook, which is the exact same thing that they get the  ebook that they would have to pay for otherwise, instead of having to be on a waitlist, maybe,  but the library only had a few copies. And you have to be careful. If there's no incentive  for an author to make back their money, then libraries are going to be empty of new books  because authors won't be writing them. Has Brewster reverted to the previous  method of one book at a time? I think he has. I'm not 100% sure of that.

Transcript:  When I go to the archive.org site on controlled digital lending, it says controlled digital lending  is the CDL, is the library practice whereby a library owns a book, digitizes it, and loans  either the physical book or the digital copy to one user at a time. So I guess I agree with you.  If the only issue is, is this okay? Yes. But to do more than one copy at a time? No. Even though  I think Brewster did it with every intent of being humanitarian, I wouldn't have so much trouble if  the Supreme Court ruled in favor of his shed. It seems to be the people are concerned. The EFF,  for instance, has filed a motion for summary judgment saying this should be put to bed.  They did that last year. They think it's threatening both to libraries and to the  internet archive. They say libraries have paid publishers billions of dollars, this is the EFF,  for the books in their print collections and are investing enormous resources in digitization in  order to preserve those texts. CDL helps ensure that the public can make full use of the books  that libraries have bought and paid for. This activity is fundamentally the same as traditional  library lending and poses no new harm to authors or the publisher. Libraries have never been required  to get permission or pay extra fees to lend books as a practical matter. The available data  shows that the CDL has not and will not harm publishers bottom  lines. But I see your point. I mean, if it's a brand new book.

I think that this is something that, you know, I wish we had a great congress that could,  you know, a wise congress that could come, you know, can figure out what to do with this new  twist that technology has offered because it's a genuine issue. I want libraries to thrive.  I want people to be able to go to libraries and read my book, you know, and any book they want to  read. But I want to make sure that there's an incentive, you know, for authors to keep writing  books. So, and it is something that requires like a wise solution because a digital copy of the book  is not the same as a physical copy. So maybe we do need some sort of tweak rather than just say,  aha, you know, this is the way it worked previously. It works the same way digitally,

Transcript:  when in fact it doesn't. Yeah, I'm with Stephen here. I mean, if anyone if you're like,  if folks have any understanding of how much work goes into writing a book, you know, I think they  would understand why publishers are protesting here. So you can't just take books and make them  available to, you know, so many people, and then potentially risk a book sales because, like,  Stephen's saying, like, man, if you're not going to have books that sell, then you're not going to  have publishers that pay authors. If you don't have publishers that pay authors, you're not going to  have books. I mean, it's as simple as that. And I understand, like, the internet has made information  free, and there's a lot of good to that. But I also think that we have, like, tended to lose sight of,  you know, the creator of the rights of the creator of the content. I mean, the fact that this is the  fact that I would say the Internet Archive has risked libraries ability to lend books because of  doing what they've done. And an easy way to not to do it is to not have done it in the first place,  not mess with a system that has been based on goodwill. And the fact that we're here today,  to put this on publishers to me is kind of kind of absurd. You know, they're the ones that are  producing the books in the first place. You know, how about their rights? I think one sad, sad thing

And, you know, we've all been to libraries and, you know,  made appearances there and, you know, about our books. And, you know, we adore these institutions.

Transcript:  To be completely fair to the publishers, I'm reading from InsideHireEd.com.  In their lawsuit against the Internet Archive, which could extract millions of dollars from the  nonprofit, the publishers claim that the Internet Archive, quote, badly misleads the public  and boldly misappropriates the goodwill that libraries enjoy and have legitimately earned.  They're not against libraries, in other words. The publishers say the archives efforts to brand  itself as a library is part of a scheme to fraudulently mislead people, circumvent copyright law,  and limit how much profit publishers can extract from the ebook market. They describe the Internet  Archive as a pirate site and its business model as parasitic and illegal and characterize controlled  digital lending as an invented paradigm that is well outside copyright law. I think that we'll  see what the justices say tomorrow. I think that Bruce, you know, I think

No, he's not evil.  Yeah. I think he is well intentioned and he's done an amazing thing. The Internet Archive,  as an archive, has been fantastic. You can go and get things which are in public domain,  you know, amazing music collections and other things. So I think it would also be tragic  if, you know, this fight led to somehow, you know, really harming the mission of the archive.

Oh, I thought he was Waze. He was Alexa. Okay. Sold it to AOL, made some money,  took the money and did this thing that was pure public benefit. And I asked him early on, I said,  aren't you worried? Because they were basically downloading as much of the Internet as they could.  They have petabytes of Internet. See, the Wayback Machine is a way to see sites that are long gone.  He wanted to preserve this history for all. And he's extended that now to  many other forms of media. Many of my old TVs and radio shows are there.  And I asked him, aren't you worried about copyright? He said, we'll worry about that  when the time comes. He knew that it was in theory a violation of copyright. I think he's always  wanted to be a library, which is protected in some degree as a fair use thing. Maybe the CDL thing  when he changed the rules was a mistake. You would agree though, if he'd only said one copy  at a time, we got a copy from a library, we're going to lend that one copy to time for two weeks.  If he'd maintained those rules, this would be okay?

Transcript:  I think there's still issues about, you know, because libraries have to  read the terms when they license books. They don't buy ebooks, they license them.  I think one of the issues is not merely that they're buying a physical book and then digitizing it,  making an ebook. That's the internet archives thing. And you know, to be fair to Brewster,  if an author wants to opt out, you can do that. You can say, keep me out of this. But most authors

I know it's cliche, but it does certainly apply here.  And the fact that you have so many books being able to lend out emergency or not, like, we can  all agree whether it's okay or not that one book is lent out as a debate. But the fact that so many  were being lent out, you know, without agreements, like that's why we're here today. That's why this

Transcript:  is a discussion. I'm going to have to get Brewster and some people from the internet archive on to  talk about this. Meanwhile, tomorrow, you can listen to the oral arguments. And if you go to  archive.org and look at their blog, blog.archive.org, you'll see that during the proceedings,  they're going to host a live blog hosted by Library of Futures with library and copyright  experts, Michelle Wu, Kyle Courtney, and Dave Hansen. And then they'll have a live discussion  with those three afterwards. So if you are interested in this, it would probably be worthwhile  listening to these. It's fascinating. You know, we've been paying attention to the Supreme Court  this year because they have a lot of cases in front of them that will impact the internet and  technology dramatically, including Gonzalez versus Google. This is another one. So worth listening to.  And yeah, I don't know where I come down on this. I really don't. The internet archive deserves  maybe a little extra protection, even if they did something bad. Because I think it's so important.  And I don't think anybody else is doing what Brewster is doing. And I think that a lot of  our history is lost, or would be lost if the internet archive didn't exist.

So this is Stephen King's,  this is The Shining. It is a copy scanned from the Denver Public Library. It even says,  no longer property of the Denver Public Library. And it's clearly a scanned paperback. I would  submit this is a crappy experience. If, you know, so I have to use my account to get the rest of  this. But honestly, it'd be worth it to me to pay five bucks to buy The Shining than to read this  on a screen in a scanned form. So I don't, I doubt that Stephen King lost much money based on this.  But what is important is it's safe for scholars and historians for years and years and years,  generations, right? Because it is scanned, it is saved. So when there are no paper books extant,  it will survive. At least that's the theory. I don't know, I've mixed feelings about this.  I'll be very interested to see. I suspect this is going to be an  interesting argument for tomorrow in front of the Supreme Court.  Let's talk about TikTok. This has been good because I have given both of you a chance to  say how you feel about two different issues, both of which I disagree with you on. But you've  persuaded me in both cases that AI is not a parlor trick and that maybe Brewster did  go a little too far with the library. Let's see how you feel about TikTok.  We are kind of on the edge of the extinction of TikTok in the United States. According to TikTok,  President Biden has ordered the FTC to force TikTok's sale and failing that to a US company  and failing that to ban it in the US. This is of course because TikTok is owned by ByteDance,  which is a Chinese company that is concerned about influence the Chinese government might have on  ByteDance and about privacy and the information gleaned from TikTok. I've said for a long time,  well, if they really cared about that, they might shut down all the data brokers because  the Chinese government can go right to the data brokers and get even more information than they  get from TikTok. The propaganda thing is another issue. I mean, that's part of the  presumed threat of TikTok is that somehow the Chinese government could influence the videos  you see on TikTok to make you be more of a fan of the Chinese Communist Party or something. I'm  not sure exactly how that would work. Now, TikTok is not going down easy. First of all,  there is an issue about whether the Chinese government would allow the sale. It's thought  the Chinese government to say, well, absolutely not. TikTok, according to Politico, is planning  to flood DC with influencers because there are a lot of people, a lot of young people,  and I'll include my son who make their living on TikTok. My son started putting videos on TikTok  a couple of years ago of sandwich making under the title salt underscore Hank. He's gotten to two plus  million subscribers, makes a good living on advertising sold to that platform. He's been smart  enough to, I asked him, I said, what are you going to do when they shut down TikTok? He said, well,  I've moved, I have a million people on Instagram, I'm on YouTube and I've got a cookbook and a TV  show in the works. So he's, he's used as a launchpad, but that doesn't mean that some kid today  starting out on TikTok is going to be able to do that. Should TikTok be shut down? A question  for our panel. I'll start with you, Alex Kampterwitz. Oh, that's a tough one. I mean,

Start time: 4585.24
End time: 4705.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would not shut it down right now. I'd like to see a foul from TikTok before we shut it down on  speculation. I can definitely see the motivation to do it, right? Like why can US companies not  operate in China? Well, companies from China can operate here. It is a bit of a, you know,  disconnect here. And, you know, there are, the fears are real, right? Like, and I think it's  not that like, we're going to get Chinese Communist Party propaganda, but that maybe someone in the  Chinese Communist Party could want to create some cultural phenomenon in the US and be able to do  it within TikTok because TikTok is a culture center. So I think that's a real fear. But again,  I'd like to, I'd like to see a foul. And the reason why I'd like to see a foul before we start to see  action is for the reason that you bring up, which is that there are lots of people who have invested  a lot of money into TikTok and there's a real economy that exists on that, on that platform,  your son included. And, you know, I think that if we shut it down, we could cause harm in that,  in that area and really harm small business owners. I know myself, like for the podcast,  I invested a good deal in TikTok. And of course, I've tried to move to YouTube and,  and other platforms and my main platform is audio. But we're on TikTok. And I don't like  the idea that that money is now gone. So I think it would be premature to do it. But I do understand  the rationale why and I also think that very well, not very quickly, but sure enough, most  Americans would forget about TikTok and move to YouTube or Instagram, like you're talking about,  or any other app, because all the social media apps now resemble TikTok in a ban would, you know,  inevitably just push everybody elsewhere. And, you know, we wouldn't actually like lose real  innovation because that innovation now exists elsewhere on social media. So very, very tricky  conversation. Again, I do think it'd be premature right now, but I understand the inclination.  And I'm very curious to see how this plays out. Should they shut down TikTok, Steven?

Transcript:  I'm not sure. I think Alex pointed out something, you know, that I've been thinking for a while,  you know, and I really saw this in action when I wrote about Google and its experiment in China.  An American company operates in China. They cannot own their own subsidiary. It has to be  more than 50% owned by a Chinese partner. And I think it'll be interesting if we said that  countries that have that restriction, they can operate their subsidiaries in America without  an American partner owning more than half of it. That might be an incentive for them to release  that unfair regulation. In terms of privacy and the other worries, I would like us to get some  actual privacy legislation that would not only affect TikTok, but all the other social media  companies. And maybe that would address some of the fears that we have about TikTok. If we were  able to get protections of what people do with data, and if they violated those protections and  used it to identify dissidents of the Chinese government and go after them or whatever,  they would be subject to penalties under American laws that affect all companies.

I can't imagine there's anything he could say  at this point that would mollify Congress.  Zhou says that divesting TikTok from its Chinese owners wouldn't offer any more protection than  what TikTok's already proposed. They have Project Texas to move all of their data to Oracle. That's  great. That makes me feel a whole lot better. All of the US customers' data. They want to give the  US government oversight on their algorithms. That would solve that issue, right? CFIUS,  the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, is really the group that could  ban TikTok. They've done this with others. Huawei is banned in networking equipment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's going to be tough if they end up banning TikTok, right? Because Facebook and Google's their  number one argument for why they shouldn't be regulated and why the government should be  looking elsewhere is like, well, look, if we're out, then it's going to be Chinese apps. If the  Chinese apps are gone, then the spotlight is on them. In fact, TikTok might be convenient foil.  I think that one of the things that we need to talk about here is that this is happening in the  middle of these CFIUS discussions. It's a negotiation. When you hear the term, oh,  they might get banned or they have to divest, I do think that could potentially be some posturing  from the US government to get them to give in more and more. Spending $1.5 billion on  data security is quite a big concession if you ask me. Some of the regulations that you were  talking about, Leo, seem common sense. It is interesting because then I think about the number.  $1.5 billion need to be spent to sure this company up. If anything needs to have a billion and a half  dollars spent to make sure that it's secure, then maybe there are bigger questions here that we need  to be asking because that's a whole heck of a lot of money to spend to ensure something is safe.

But I do remember, Steven, you're right,  Microsoft investing $150 million in Apple in the 90s just because if Apple went bankrupt,  Microsoft would really be a monopoly. There's a history. There's a precedent.

We can invoke a little xenophobia and get rid of the biggest competition. Now, you said,  let's wait until they do something wrong. There is something that TikTok did that wasn't so good.  Okay. Let's talk about this one. They chased US journalists. They were trying to figure out  who was leaking TikTok information to US journalists. In order to find out, they  looked at the location information on their servers of some US journalists. Isn't that  exactly the kind of thing people are afraid of? I don't want to minimize what happened to the

Transcript:  journalists who were involved here, but I do think that it is different. This seems to me like this  was the PR operation, trying to figure out who was leaking inside the company. That is a very,  very different thing. It's happened elsewhere, right? I think that's a very, very different thing  than let's say the Chinese Communist Party trying to find the location information of  potential US spies or something else like that. Something that will really  harm national security. It sucks that it happened in the Forbes or BuzzFeed journalists,  wherever they were at the time. I'm obviously not in favor of it. I think it's a disaster,  but I don't think you ban a company from a country because of that situation.

Transcript:  Well, I think for sure the Chinese government won't allow them and I don't think logistically  it's very easy for them to sell the US division to an American company. By the way, if you're  worried about privacy, which American company would that be that would make you more secure  and more private? Facebook. Oracle, Facebook. Didn't Microsoft for a while said,  well, we were thinking about buying TikTok. That doesn't reassure me particularly,  but I think it's pretty much safe to say that's not going to happen.  In fact, I suspect this is why the federal government has said this because it will then  give them, well, we tried, but they wouldn't do it. So now we're going to shut them down.  I think that's an ominous thing. You said, well, the Chinese shut down Facebook and Twitter in China,  but we don't want to be like that. Do we want a great firewall of the US?

Maybe you saw  Ryan Reynolds' video with the CEO of T-Mobile. T-Mobile's announced it's buying Mint Mobile.  But good news, they've announced they're going to keep the thing that makes Mint Mobile so  special. Saving more and spending less is the top of your list for 2023. I got to ask you,  have you looked at your cell bill lately? $75, $85, $90, $100 or more. That's crazy when you  could switch to Mint Mobile and get premium wireless service online only. That's their secret  sauce. For $15 a month. Cut your cell bill by a quarter, a third, a half. Mint Mobile lets you  order from home. They'll send you a SIM at no charge. They'll even sell you phones.  For anyone looking for extra savings this year, Mint Mobile is the place to go. Yes, they promise  still $15 a month. They write on the T-Mobile network, which is great. You get all the benefits  of T-Mobile's 5G. It's the nation's largest 5G network. I've noticed on my Mint Mobile phone,  yes, I use Mint Mobile. I love Mint Mobile. I've noticed a lot of 5G ultra-capacity  cell towers. They're multiplying. We get it now in little old Petaluma, which means I'm getting  super high speed. $15 a month. See, Mint Mobile has eliminated the stores, the costs of retail,  and they pass those savings on to you. All plans, even the $15 plan comes with unlimited talk and  text plus high speed data on the nation's largest 5G network. If you want to use your own phone,  no problem. Keep your phone number. You can port it right over. They'll send you the SIM at no  charge. Actually, they do eSIMs now. If you have an eSIM phone like the new iPhones,  it's even easier. You could be on Mint Mobile before this ad is done. Premium wireless service  starting at $15 a month. You get your new wireless plan for just $15 a month.  Get the plan shipped to your door for free. Go to MintMobile.com slash  twit. They have unlimited plans. I got a plan. That was such a good deal. MintMobile.com  slash twit. Cut your wireless bill to $15 a month. For most people, 4 gigs a month for $15,  unlimited talk and text. What more could you ask for? That's incredible. So really, I got to ask  you, why are you paying more? MintMobile.com slash twit. And since we've started advertising for them,  it's been more than a year. I've talked to more and more people in the audience who've switched  very happy. Go into one of our chat rooms, ask, do you like Mint Mobile? Does it work for you? Yes,  it does. So wait a minute now, I'm getting 15 gigabytes for my 25 bucks a month. That's nice.  They do have an unlimited plan for 30 bucks a month. MintMobile.com slash twit. Please use  that address so they know you saw it here. There it is. Literature and Latte finally came up.  Scrivener, typewriter, ring binder, scrapbook. Andy Anaco uses so many of our writers at the  network use it. It's a really great little tool. I'm very pleased to hear you use that. That's nice.  Do you use, when you're using Google Docs, do you use rich text or do you just use plain text, Alex?  Or markup? I don't know. Maybe you use markup. So you've got to import it in a substack.

The International Olympic Committee has announced the official eSports and they're a little weird.  Ollie Welsh writing for Polygon. The Olympic eSports Series 2023. They don't quite yet have  eSports in the Olympics, but often they do this as they're starting to move stuff into the Olympics.  There will be a qualification this month, live finals in Singapore in June open to amateur and  professionals, but unlike other eSports, most eSports are MOBAs like League of Legends, Dota 2,  maybe Fortnite. The International Olympic Committee is eschewing the eSports, Ollie says,  people actually watch for non-violent simulations of real world sports, games and activities.  Just Dance is one of them. Gran Turismo is the driving one. They have an indoor cycling trainer  called Zwift. They have a sailing simulator called Virtual Regatta, Virtual Taekwondo,  a mobile game called Tennis Clash, Konami's WBSCE Baseball colon Power Pros.  Of course, you can't have the Olympics without archery. They've added another mobile game called  Tic Tac Bow to the eSports and the IOC. I just can't wait until that's part of the Olympics.

Transcript:  Yeah, I have a funny story about something like this. San Francisco hosted the Super Bowl a couple  years ago and as the host committee was getting ready to rumble, they hosted a day for potential  sponsors, I think something, in Levi's Stadium where the 49ers play. I was moderating one of  those panels and we had some media people, we had a video game, a COO from EA Sports,  and we had a former 49er player who was young, just recently retired and was then in media.  We had Lynn Swan who is a Hall of Fame receiver for the Steelers who was the emcee for the day.  We get talking about eSports and I was just curious what the 49er thought,  the guy who had recently retired. I said, hey, do you think that eSports players are athletes?  He said, yeah, they're definitely athletes. In my book, it takes coordination and competition  and you have to be the best. The guy from EA Sports, he was like, oh yeah, definitely we believe that  they're athletes. Then Lynn Swan was in the audience just sitting there. I was like, Mr. Swan,  I'm curious what you think. He gives me a look and he walks out of the room. I was just like,  oh no, I've just upset a Hall of Fame football player, someone who I've looked up to as a great  athlete who's responsible for some of the most memorable plays in NFL history. A few minutes  later, Swan comes back onto the stage. He wasn't even sitting on the stage, he was in the audience.  He comes onto the stage with a chair, he sets it down and he looks at me and takes the mic  and just goes, they're not athletes. That was it. He was angry. He was mad. Mad as heck. Exactly.  That's hysterical. Just a moment I'll never forget because he'd seen that this was a debate  that was going to get going. I think an old school athlete like him knew he was going to lose. He  was right. Because this is obviously something that more and more we're starting to see these  esports players as athletes. Now, I'm still on team Swan, but I also think I'm on the losing

There's always  been a debate, well, chess players aren't athletes. But you have to be a top grandmaster.  You've got to be pretty darn fit. All the super grandmasters work out constantly. I mean,  maybe they're not exactly moving when they're playing the game. But in order to think full  concentration for four and a half hours, you try it. It ain't easy.

That people hold up signs. It turns out it's always subject to corruption.  It's like the Supreme Court. You can pick how people are going to vote before the performer  even gets to it. Unless they fall flat on their faces, it's up for grabs. So I feel that  the rest of them, it's exhibitions. And you could say, well, it's like dancing. But dancing is  actually kind of an Olympic sport now. So basically to me, let's have winners and losers.  That's what athletics are all about.

Meta  has been going through some big changes since you were embedded for three years.  You got interviews with Zuckerberg, with Sheryl Sandberg. Sheryl's gone now. First of all,  I, you know, we haven't talked since the book came out. What does Sheryl's departure from Facebook  mean? You spent a lot of time talking about talking to Sandberg. She was kind of adult

Start time: 6148.78
End time: 6274.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  supervision is the sense I got. Well, you know, that was in 2008. So, you know, Mark in the  meantime became an adult. And I think that also after Cambridge Analytica and where Sheryl,  it was on Sheryl's watch. That was her part of the company where that stuff happened post-election.  She was not as big a force in the company as she was earlier. And I feel it wasn't a surprise  when she left. She's a brilliant executive in a lot of ways. And, you know, it wasn't a surprise  that at a certain point she decided, let me move on with my life. I always believe that, you know,  when she took that job, she said, I'm going to spend five years here. And a series of events,  you know, largely out of her control, kept extending that time that she spent there. First,  she thought the perfect time to go out would be the company does a successful IPO. I've accomplished  this. I could leave. The IPO actually was a disaster. People don't remember this. And,  you know, by the time then it got, you know, recovered and it got back together, they figured  out how to do mobile ads. Something tragic happened. Her husband died. She wasn't in the  shape to go off for a new chapter. And when she was like back with, you know, all her passion, then  the bad stuff happens post-election, Cambridge Analytica, and she didn't want to leave in the  middle of that storm. So I think she had to wait to get past all those things to be able to leave  and say, well, you know, it was time. I had my time here. I had my impact. She admits it was  bittersweet because of the troubles that the company had, but she's off to do something else.

Transcript:  a social network to the Metaverse. Well, that was sort of an escape patch for her too. But,  you know, when Mark said, okay, this is a different company now. We're based on the Metaverse and  virtual reality. That's our future. That's not Cheryl's wheelhouse. So she could, you know,  quite legitimately say, I'm not, this is a journey that I'm not on board for. So I'm going to go off  something else. We haven't seen what that something else is. You know,

Start time: 6330.34
End time: 6406.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Don't we think that Cheryl is responsible in some ways for the position that Metta finds  it in itself in today, which is that it's floundering. And I'll just say that, like,  she is part of what I've talked about is like the overfinancialization of tech where tech companies  are trying to get every, you know, little cent out of their business and start to forget,  you know, what they were there to do, which was to solve problems and improve people's lives.  And the fact that Apple's anti anti ad tracking transparency project where people are able to  block tracking on their pages has worked so well, has been a product of, you know, the fact that  people were creeped out by what her ad division was doing that they had to track every last little  thing, as opposed to sell more broader ad categories. And so like now you have Metta in  a position where, you know, so many people have opted out that their tracking has effectively broken.  And that's why they're handicapped against competitors. They blame Apple for this and  Apple's ATT. Right. But it's also like Apple did, of course, it's Apple's Apple facilitated it.  But what inspired some first of all, what inspired Apple's program to be so successful?  And what inspired so many users to tell them to tell me when you're on Facebook,  and to do that. And then of course, like you're you sort of set the conditions  for where like this thing would work.

Transcript:  I wonder though, what Facebook's future holds, because they've spent they're spending huge  amounts of money $10 billion or more a year to create this metaverse. They seem to be turning  their backs on the social network. But so do people so to users. And it's not just a privacy  issue. I think to some degree, you've written about this, Alex, that it's the end of social  in some degree entirely, that people are turning to content sites. That was why tick tock, which  isn't really social, it's really about content and YouTube. And even now, Twitter are becoming,  you know, places you go to look at stuff, not to post stuff, right?

Start time: 6453.30
End time: 6525.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's right. Yeah, I have an episode of Big Technology podcast with Kevin Systrom,  the founder of Instagram coming up about this, where we talk about the homogenization  of social media, how tick tock looks like YouTube, and YouTube looks like Instagram,  and Instagram looks like Facebook, and Facebook looks like Twitter. And all of these sites are  starting to look exactly the same. And that initial social media dream where like you would  get content from your friends, the stuff that they recommend, that's fallen by the wayside.  So, you know, that's going to be this is obviously the main challenge that Facebook is going to have  to navigate. It's going to be the product question. And, you know, they have billions of users. So  there's a good chance that they can hold their own against tick tock, or maybe tick tock gets banned,  like we spoke about. And that can be the solution. But yeah, they sort of moved away from their main  product, which is social, which, you know, okay, I'm definitely in favor of big tech companies  saying that our flagship product is not going to get us there tomorrow the way that it did today.  But maybe the pivot was, you know, more tick tock related stuff, and less social related stuff.  Maybe the pivot was not metaverse, right? Like I keep thinking that, you know, we're just weeks  away from meta changing its name from meta to like AI. And that's what I'm wondering. I mean,

Just, you know, your flagship business is not going to be  able to support that type of thing for that long of a time span. Yeah, I think it's interesting. I

And they're going to developing the tools of the metaverse way before  it could be delivered, you know, in a package where the masses could be able to use it.  And, you know, Alex's point about, you know, there was a time about a year ago, everyone was  saying metaverse, metaverse, metaverse, and now it's AI, AI, AI. And I think AI is more real than

Transcript:  wander around some virtual worlds. But Zuckerberg says endlessly that the metaverse is going to be a  social experience. To me, I felt that meta Facebook just left a lot of chips on the table  about improving the social experience. You know, can you look at what they've done? They've done  almost nothing to really improve the experience that they first introduced and got billions of  people to sign on to. So I feel that the creative energy of the company moved away from that vision  of building the social graph and enhancing people's experience with other people that they knew.  There's a lot of really simple things that are still begging to be done on that service. You ever  try to find someone you knew on Facebook, right? And you can't do it because, you know, like 100  people have that same name and it's just, it's just not easy to do. And, and there's a reason,

Transcript:  there's a reason though, they moved away from social. It's just because if you're eventually  going to be content companies, right, which these feeds, they became content companies.  The people you know are ordinary folks are just not going to be the ones that are going to be  there to entertain you. It's going to be the AI generated folks and it's going to be professional

Alex is right that if your appetite is so voracious,  you need to become a different kind of company. But the fact is that Metta isn't in a great  position to compete with TikTok and other companies and YouTube in being an entertainment company.  That's not their DNA. And as it turns out, they haven't even been able to successfully  leverage their huge number of people to be able to wipe out these other companies.

Transcript:  They're neither, neither nor. They're neither fish nor fowl. What an opportunity. I feel like  the metaverse is not an opportunity. Apple is reportedly about to launch its VR headset in the  next few months. And it's interesting because there was an article, I think in the journal,  suggesting that the designers said, no, it's not ready. You shouldn't release a VR headset. Wait  till we can do AR, which is years away. And that Tim Cook and the management decided, no,  we got to do this now. Let's take a break. When we come back, we can talk about that.  We still haven't talked about Silicon Valley Bank. And I don't think that's over.  I think you guys agree. So we'll talk about that as well. We've got lots to say.  And two great people to talk about it with. Steven Levy, stevelevy.com, editor at Large at Wired,  one of the great writers about technology for the last three decades almost. Yeah. Wow. And of course,  one of the new young bright lights of technology journalism. Big Technologies, Alex Kantrowitz.  Great to have you both. Our show today brought to you by Miro. We've been playing with Miro  at Twitter and love it. We were in a situation, I think a lot of you are in, going from tab to tab  and your browser tool to tool and your toolkit. And meanwhile, losing ideas with those context  switches and leaving important information on the table. There's a better way. The problem is,  it's very hard for me to explain what it is, except to tell you it's called Miro, M-I-R-O.com  podcast. Miro, well, on the face of it, it's a collaborative visual whiteboard, a place you  and your team can go to brainstorm, to work together, to collaborate. Brings all of your  great work together, no matter where you are in the world and no matter what time. Since you can  go in at night and somebody else can go in the next day, whether you're working from home in a  hybrid workspace, it all comes together one place online, that Miro. But to say it's a whiteboard,  I feel like almost diminishes what Miro is. Miro is amazing because it can do almost anything,  which makes it hard for me to describe. We use Miro and ask the tech guys for our show  rundown. Once you start using Miro, you're probably not going to want to ever  do a meeting without Miro's timers. Maybe the best thing to do is to point you to the Miroverse.  This is a collection of templates you can use created by Miro users, people who work at  Atlassian, the UK government, Zendesk, all over the world. Here's from Stephen Sampson-Jones,  who works for the UK government. He's the head of agile delivery and has made quite a few,  I think, fascinating templates, including the Treehouse of Horror retrospective, a retrospective of  Marvel comic books, a retro arcade, a Harry Potter and SpongeBob retrospective. This guy  is, I think, a good guy to check out because it shows you what you can do with Miro. With Miro,  you can integrate with many, many other services. For instance, we use Zapier with Miro so that we  can trigger actions that put stuff into Miro, like questions we're getting from the email or  the chat room or videos. It's an infinite collaborative whiteboard that's a perpetual  space. You can drag in any kind of data or content. Nothing is lost or forgotten. You can create  templates, of course, but it's also open and free form so your ideas can grow and expand.  They're not limited. It is an amazing tool. It covers a breadth of use cases, visual assets,  you can present findings, you can run brainstorms with cross-functional teams. The Miro timers and  icebreakers and brainstorming tools make it really much better to have a conference call.  You can build out, let's say you're doing a new product, build out your product vision  on a Miro board, brainstorm with sticky notes or comments or live reactions. There's a voting tool.  There's a timer. Express yourself in creative ways. Bring the whole group together around one idea.  The point is there's one place you can all go to see what's going on to update it to contribute.  And you can do it in any way you like with a Kanban board. If you're agile, if you want wireframes,  do that. You can draw with a pen tool. You can paste in images. You want to do a mood board.  Easiest place in the world. Want to do mock-ups? No problem. Miro users love it. 80 hours per user  per year saved by streamlining conversations, cutting down on meetings. Miro gives your team  the chance to always stay connected to real-time information. And it gives project managers and  product leads a bird's eye view of the whole product. You can zoom in or out to ensure nothing  slips through the cracks. The only problem I have is how do I describe what it can do? It can do so  much. It's a whiteboard, but that doesn't even scratch the surface. It's anything you want it  to be. Everything you need. The Miro integrations mean it works with everything you're already  using. They've got apps for iOS and Android and Windows and Mac. I just think it's fantastic.  Miro.com slash podcast. Give it a try. Miro.com slash podcast. We're going to make that easy  because your first three boards, one, two, three boards are free. Your first three boards for free.  Start working better. Miro.com slash podcast.

Earlier today on Ask the Tech Guys, I likened the Silicon Valley Bank debacle  to a game of Jenga where the FDIC, the Fed have pulled out one little piece of wood,  but now the whole tower is kind of swaying and we're waiting to see what happens next.  I, both of you have written about it. Stephen, we'll start with your story, the ugly lessons  of Silicon Valley Bank's collapse. One of the stories that came out, I think today,  is that there have been intimations that they were taking too much risk for years,  that they've even been on an investigation for some time now. What do we learn? What have we  learned from this? And is this going to be a problem going forward? Credit Suisse now is

Start time: 7245.40
End time: 7407.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  shaking. Right. Well, we learned a few things and none of them, as my headline reflects, are pretty.  One thing that struck me was how the bank really operated as a cheerleader for the whole  ecosystem of founders and funding. They threw parties. They had a lot of clients in the wine  industry. So they would sort of cross-pollinate those with the tech people and share their  great vintage wines with them and go into their offices. Some of the executives of the bank would  have wine fridges. I mentioned this. Is this sort of behavior really what you want from your  fiduciaries? When I think of a bank I want to trust, I think of the guy who hired Mary Poppins.  A banker. Yeah. A banker. With a bowler and a tightly-furled umbrella. Yeah.  Yeah. And he says, I know where everything is and at 6.20 I'm going to come home and  you're going to be greeted. And that's sort of the boring kind of person you want in charge  of your finances. So these people who say they embrace risk all the time, it turns out they  weren't cognizant of this kind of risk. It was avoidable. Any idiot knows what the limit is  in what you're insured about. And then when it happens, they sort of do a 180 from their  normal point of view of saying, you know, governments stay out of it and saying, hey,  the government should now forget about this limit and go from $250,000 to reimbursement to infinity  because otherwise our payrolls can be lost. Well, this is an industry that's laid off over  100,000 people, right? And the fate of those people is sort of shrugged off and now all of a  sudden, you know, needing a payroll and having people not paid for a day or two is going to  collapse the economy. So it's played sort of the insularity and hypocrisy, I guess, of the Valley.  And they're rushed to really create a bank run from this place where they loyally are supported  for a number of years, you know, show that this, you know, one for all for one community, you know,  really, you know, fell apart when the bullets started flying.

Transcript:  deposits or no? Well, I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I think that, you know, maybe there was a way  to do that where they could have, you know, maybe had a much higher limit or said, you know,  at a certain point, you know, that all your deposits aren't guaranteed for this day. But  meantime, by then, things have gotten to the point where, you know, they were saying, well,  the whole economy is at risk. People's deposits aren't going to be protected. And the fact is,  you talk about hallucinations in GPT-4, you know, the whole monetary system is kind of a hallucination  that everyone sort of accepts the fact that if nothing happens, that people don't pull up  their money right away. Banks are OK. But the fact is that, you know, if things could turn on a dime  and we could be facing giant problems in the economy, because we all of a sudden, we abandon  our shared agreement not to pull up money from the bank. Right. Alex, your article talks about,

Transcript:  banklash. What do you mean? What's that all about? Well, look, one of the things that I saw that  really sort of made my antennas go up was that there was, you know, the public largely supported  the bailout, but there was a loud enough and big enough chunk of the public who were willing to let  the bank fail, that it was worth examining who they were and why and what has happened to tech  that it began as this underdog industry, one that, you know, was there fighting the establishment,  one that you could root for, that was fun, that everyone would support. Unless you were like the  establishment would support, you know, keeping vibrant and keeping healthy. And why would anyone  then say that, okay, well, we should have these companies fail. They're just, you know, rich  bastards anyway. But that's what's happened. But look at Elon Musk as a perfect example. Right.

Transcript:  The transition from, you know, the stark industries, genius, transforming by being a rebel,  by being one of the crazy ones, the people who think different, changing the world, making the  world a better place to just another batshit crazy billionaire. Right. So look, I think that

Start time: 7565.16
End time: 7733.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it goes beyond Elon though. And this is the point that I was making in the story. And we talked  about on the show also, is that tech has been like most much of the economy overfinancialized, right,  which is that it has in some, not everyone, of course, but some companies have just tried to  squeeze every ounce of money onto the balance sheet, no matter not really paying attention to  the cost. One example, which we know is that door dash, right, would take tips that would get for  dashers and then count that towards its minimum payment to the dashers. They would never see the  tip. And I have to say that like, when you do this type, when you do that stuff, there is a downstream  risk, people are going to see it eventually. And I think you started to see it when, you know,  everybody, you know, in the US, at least knows an Amazon worker knows a dasher knows an Uber driver,  right. And when those were not when that squeezing happens, there's a political cost to it, which you  end up having people who are saying, okay, like, let the bastards fail. And, you know, they're not  they don't care, like necessarily, this was the text text argument, right? Your money's not going  to go to door dashers. But what they're saying is, well, the whole door dash system is corrupt. Now,  door dash, of course, has fixed that right after some some press attention because they got caught.  Yeah, exactly. It exists all over. Right. And I think that, you know, for those of us who root  for tech, I root for tech to be a strong industry. But what what, you know, people want from tech  is that it provides all this benefit it can provide through computing through technology in a way that  isn't needlessly extractive. And the fact that some cars cordons of the industry have become  needlessly extractive has caused so much political will that there was a very vocal  group of folks who said let it fail. And in fact, when it was coming into the White House, right,  with discussions of like, when this thing should be bailed out, it took the whole weekend before  Biden eventually gave in. He was aware, I'm sure of the political backlash of of course, bailing out  billionaire bailout. Yeah, that was what he was worried about. It doesn't have to be that way,  because at its best tech is for the little person. And that's all the whole thing. And I talked to  my story a little bit about New York Tech Meetup. I don't know if either of you have been there,  but it was this amazing meetup, it still goes on to some extent. But at its height in the early 2010s,  we'd have local startups come in and just kind of show off what they built.  And it was right after the financial crisis. So you started to have some people from Wall Street  seep in to try to get second careers inside tech. And whenever you you spoke about your finances,  your VC fundings, the whole place would boo. And people would shout, get to the demo, right.  And that's sort of what I think the going back to that spirit of get to the demo, show us the tech,  like I think that's what we need to get back to in some ways. To some degree, this is what happens

Start time: 7733.54

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  in all industries, right? I mean, the in the early days of, of oil, the wildcatters and the  the crazy guys digging oil wells and having gushers. And eventually it's successful,  it monetizes, it's a bunch of fat cats with monocles and cigars. That's what happens with

Start time: 7749.12
End time: 7772.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  any successful industry, right? Stephen, I'm sorry. For many years, the overwhelming narrative  of tech was David versus Goliath. And then at a certain point in the past few years, it's changed,  you know, it's changed to the Icarus myth. Ah, too close to the sun. Yeah, its wings are melting.

Start time: 7775.66

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, Alex, you make your living kind of talking about big technology. And the threat  in some ways that the big technology can pose to all of the rest of us. What's the solution?

Start time: 7790.66
End time: 7892.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, it's a simple solution to write to. Look, tech is big business now. No denying that, right?  Because it's successful. Exactly. It's successful. And I do think that, look, I think once you saw  the first IPO's, you saw the first public companies, you saw the first trillion dollar company,  that became so alluring, right? For CEOs, it became the mark was not what your company can do,  but the mark was what was your net worth? What was your market cap? How much had you raised?  These are all became the successful parts of the successful markers in the tech industry. And  obviously, that's what shifted the industry's perception among other people. And so I think  it's very simple. I think it's step back, focus again on the customer, focus again on tech.  And again, get to the demo. I mean, let's see this. And that's sort of what's interesting because  we're having we're having this amazing moment right now where we're seeing so many cool things  happen with AI. And in some ways, tech is getting back to the demo in that area, right? We're going  from zero to one, not one to, you know, n or whatever it is. And, and that's exciting to me.  But I do think that, you know, we, I think that it's just something that the tech industry needs  to keep in mind. And maybe it needs new spokespeople, right? I mean, that's another  thing that we're hearing about now. tech has been represented by some very loud, obnoxious people,  people like Marc Andreessen, who I don't think really puts the best image for, you know, on the  tech industry, and I would actually say his entire firm. And I think like right now, a lot of people  a lot of people, you know, who've been silent in the tech industry are starting to speak up and  kind of talk about what the industry is, what the sector's values are. And I think that's a good

Start time: 7892.94
End time: 7919.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  thing. So is it Stephen, though, a little bit just nostalgia? I mean, you and I both remember the  homebrew computer club, you were, you know, covered the early days of the MIT hackers,  they were a rough and ready, you know, anti social band of misfits. You know, as was, I guess,  Apple in the early days. Those days aren't coming back. Not in the same way. You know,

Start time: 7920.00
End time: 7984.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but, you know, there is a thriving startup culture that where people do a reset. Now a startup in,  you know, the 2020s isn't the same as a startup in the late 1970s or early 80s.  You know, there's a pathway. And, you know, like a lot of the founders have their eyes on the prize  from the get go, right? They're, you know, they're, you know, Y Combinator, when it started in 2005,  gave $5,000 plus $5,000 for each founder to the company as his stake investment. The investment  now for each company and Y Combinator is $500,000. Right. And, you know, so, you know, they're on a  path to fail big or get big. So that is different. Yet, you know, I think that there's going to be a  lot of, you know, contending 20 years from now, the companies that are going to be talking about  are companies that are starting now or maybe haven't even started yet. Also, one thing that

Start time: 7985.02
End time: 8032.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think is worth pointing out is that, yeah, of course, we're not going to go back to those days.  But we know, know that it's a political risk, right? To be where we are today, right? It almost  sent the whole industry into a tailspin because of the image, the billionaire bailout. And that is  the issue, right? And so once that political risk is realized, and I really think it is, like, I  think this has been a wake up call to many of Silicon Valley about what could happen to them,  you know, based off of public sentiment, I think that might lead to change. In other words, we're  not going to go back to hobbyists and we're not going to, we probably won't have less funding.  But we will definitely go back to, you know, maybe go back to a time where we didn't have  this overfinancialization of the economy, at least of the sector, and at least that's my hope.

But one thing that does not vary is, you know, the arrow  of the technology itself. It just keeps getting better. Innovations keep coming. There's never  like a downtime for the technology improving. And, you know, we're seeing that now in AI,  it's apparent to us. But there's always going to be something coming along to build on the  previous advances. You know, so and the innovation of tomorrow is going to go faster because we've  had all the previous innovations. So we're arguing about the state of whether it's big companies,  small companies, you know, do we need different people? But one constant is that technology  keeps getting better and better. And that's what's exciting. And that's what's thrilling.  And that's what's scary about our world.

And, you know, I have to say that it's not been good for a huge amount of money  to flow into tech because that attracts the greedy. It also attracts the scammers. And you  see, you know, NFTs and Bitcoin and, you know, a lot of scams. Look, Andreessen Horowitz,  Mark Andreessen pushing Web3, which is a blatant, you know, grab for the free and open internet.  You know, I see companies like Spotify and Amazon going after our little corner of the world,  RSS based podcasting. But I agree with you, Steven, I think in the long run, the human spirit,  there's always going to be some little person who has a great idea who is going to change the  world. And it may not be Elizabeth Holmes. But there's always going to be somebody like that.  I think. Yeah.

And now they're saying we're  going to fire another 10,000. Plus, we're not going to fill 5000 open positions. So the net  of that is what is that 26,000, 26,000 jobs gone from Facebook. Any other industry that'd be a  that'd be a death blow. So yeah, maybe those people, some of those people will go on, you know,  it's hard. And I feel for you, I'm hearing from a lot of people who are out of work,  who think that, you know, maybe podcasting can help them. I just want to say it can't.  But please don't become a podcaster. That's the wrong, that's the wrong direction. But I think  that's right, that those people maybe now are going to have the stimulus, the spur they need  to create something exciting and new. And boy, the way AI is happening, we can, I'll go through  a list of some of the AI startups that were formed this week alone. In a way, that's why  I guess it's good that there's venture capital, there is money available, because there are people  with big bags of money, who don't want to invest in the stock market. They think that if they could  just find that next big thing, that's the best place for them to make money. That's not a bad

And I also  think like, look, like right now, if you write AI on your term sheet, or whatever it is, you're  probably getting seven VCs that will sign on. Like there's money is, money is hard to come by now,  but it's definitely there. And it is a moment of opportunity. Like, yeah, because it does take  money during. Yeah, of course. Like during COVID, the during the like, the worst part of COVID is  when I decided to leave BuzzFeed and start my own company. That's right. And this is generally the  moment where you start to have people who are like, okay, how's that worked out for you? That thing.  I'm very happy. Yeah. And people are like, and look, still a lot of room to grow. But you know,  the fact that that was the moment that pushed me out and said, do this, you know, start your own  thing. Yeah. That's happening across the economy now, especially within tech. And by the way,  when they get that money, they won't feel entitled to it. They know they'll know they had to work  for it. And that will lead to better companies, more sound management and true gratefulness,  I think from founders that they're able to do what they do. Alex Cantor was host of the big

Transcript:  technology podcast, the author of Always Day One, and of course, the substack, big technology.com.  Great to have you at same, Steven, leave you one last break. We'll wrap things up in just a little  bit. But first, I got to tell you about our sponsor, collide. They they're doing something  really, really interesting. We all talk about zero trust architectures these days when it comes to  security, the idea that anybody in the network should be treated as an adversary, but there's  a place where zero trust falls apart. And that's where collide is really going to make a difference.  They're a device trust solution that ensures unsecured devices cannot access your apps. If  you're an Okta user, you're going to want this, they can get your entire fleet to 100% compliance  by patching one of the major holes in zero trust architectures, device compliance. So your identity  provider, you know, is saying, well, only known devices can log into apps. But just because a  device is known, doesn't it mean it's in a secure state? Just ask LastPass, right? They, they, there  was a very determined attacker who found the four DevOps guys who had keys to the S3 buckets.  Those DevOps guys, when they worked from home, were using a laptop, one of them using a laptop  that had plex on it that hadn't been patched in three years. That, that is a source of  ultimate danger to a company. And in the case of LastPass, it could be the end of the end of the  line. All because of this one little problem. Yeah, the DevOps guy was known he was logging in,  but what they didn't know was that he had an insecure app running on his machine. Plenty of  the devices in your fleet probably shouldn't be trusted. Maybe they're running out of data OS  versions. Maybe they've got unencrypted credentials lying around. They've got an old browser.  Maybe they're running plex from three years ago. If a device isn't compliant, or isn't running the  Collide agent, because the agents what finds all of that, they just can't get in. It can't access  the organization's SaaS apps. It can't access the other resources. The device user can't log in  to your company's cloud apps until this is the best part, they fixed the problem on their end.  You don't do it, they do it. That's what the Collide agent does. It says, hey, wait, you can't log in.  And you know why? Because your browser's out of date. It's so simple. A device is blocked.  Employee doesn't have an update browser. It tells the employee and the end user remediates it.  Without overwhelming your IT team, your fleet will be driven to 100% compliance. Isn't that  beautiful? Without Collide, IT teams have no way to solve these compliance issues. Hyper-mobile  hybrid work, remote work, on-site work, it's all mushed together. With Collide, you can set and  enforce compliance across your entire fleet. And it's truly cross-platform Mac, Windows, and Linux.  Because Collide ties device compliance into the authentication process,  this is really the way to do it. When the user logs in with Okta,  Collide will alert them to compliance issues, prevents unsecured devices from logging in,  and then gets a user to fix it. That's awesome. It's security you can feel good about.  Collide puts transparency and respect for users at the center of their product. Your users will  know it. Your IT department will love it. It's really, really, really good. To sum it up,  Collide's method means fewer support tickets, less frustration, most importantly, 100% fleet  compliance. You know you need this. Go to Collide.com slash twit to learn more or book a demo.  K-O-L-I-D-E, Collide.com slash twit. It's just really the obvious solution, the right way to do  it. Collide.com slash twit.

Our boss, the CEO of Twit, somebody's impersonating  her to our employees, sending out messages saying, I need to talk to you. Call me. And almost all of  these end up you get in a conversation. I would say, for instance, what round of golf? I don't  even play golf. And he'd say, oh, gosh, I'm so sorry. But you seem like a nice person. What's  your name? Leo. What's yours? John.

Everybody's got a play on LLM. It was leaked on 4chan  and people have written interfaces and now you can use it. Why haven't we seen  Facebook's use of this at all?

Quora is about connecting people to answer  questions. Now they're going to connect people with robots to answer questions. There's an app  called Po run by Quora where you ask your question instead of a human answering it. It'll be,

What  question should I ask Po? What's Larry Page like to work with? What is Larry Page like to work  with? Good question. Oh, as an AI language model, I do not have personal experience working with  Larry Page, but I can tell you he's known for being a brilliant and innovative leader in the  tech industry, known for cutting edge technology and promoting a culture of innovation and  creativity. However, it's important to note individual experiences may vary.  But this is Sage. They also have ChatGPT4. They also have Claude Plus. I don't know who Claude

To make a tasty ham sandwich, you need bread, sliced ham, cheese, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise.  That's pretty, it's fairly accurate. You can also add pickles, onions, or avocado to customize your  sandwich. Well, ham and avocado. Oh yeah. That's not good, is it? Where is the best bagel in New  York City?
