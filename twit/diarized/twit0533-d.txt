End time: 215.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You might be the first.  You know, it's something that I just sort of picked up over time. I have about 20.  Is it your trademark?  It is. I've actually, I don't think I've ever done a Twitter show without them.  Every time I've been on Tech News Today and Tech News Tonight, it's always the bow.  Love it.  Actually, I got inquired by one of the producers as to how many bows I actually own.  Well, now we know.  Yeah, it's a lot.

Start time: 217.24
End time: 230.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have a knot of bows. I wear bow ties frequently. Had I known, I would have worn my bow tie today. I apologize.  Look who else is here. Not from Sweden or from Bloomberg. Patrick Béja from France.

Transcript:  Hey, so I usually wear scarves and it's sort of become my French trademark.  Is it? Really?  I'm not wearing mine now.  No, now you're joking.  But with the magnificent, no I am. Wait, wait. I'm going to go get a scarf.  Go get a scarf.  Now I have to.

Start time: 243.00

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  While I explain the Patrick Béja, last time he was here he worked at Blizzard, but now he is a full-time podcaster.  Strange though that may sound, with Le Rendezvous Tech, frenchspin.fr, or actually frenchspin.com.  Look! Yes, now I remember. You do wear scarves.  Insanely fast.  You do wear scarves.

Start time: 263.92
End time: 273.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I always, always have a scarf handy, not too far from me, because at some points during the day I might get scarf panic and I have to have one.  So, there you go.

Start time: 274.95
End time: 277.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I've heard that exists in France.  Scarf panic.  It does.

Start time: 279.09

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But only in France.  And for today's show, I don't know if we have it available to you, we have the binocular version of this show.  For no apparent reason, because there is nothing you can do with that.  But I got my Ricoh Theta S camera, which I pre-ordered months ago, finally came.  350 bucks, 3D camera.  It does 3D stills.  And then you can do 3D video.  But we haven't figured out how to do it live yet.  You need some software somehow to stitch this.  It's live, but it's not, you know, it doesn't look like anything.  It looks like you're looking at us through a snow globe.

Transcript:  It looks like it should work in cardboard, right?  But it doesn't.

Start time: 323.02
End time: 328.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really? But it doesn't.  No, you know why?  Because each one is in a separate camera.  One's the front, one's the back camera.  You need to stitch them.

Start time: 329.98
End time: 335.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you looked at this in cardboard, you would have one eye seeing the front and one eye seeing the back.  That would be kind of weird.

Start time: 336.74
End time: 377.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Only good for certain kinds of lizards, but not in fact for humans.  But we're going to, but we, apparently, Ricoh is coming out with stitching software.  But that's what Google with the jump thing with a 16 camera rig.  But that's like $10,000, the GoPro version of that.  This is $358.  I'm very intrigued.  Anyway, we'll keep you posted and eventually we'll figure out how to make this a live stream.  Well, this was the week we got quarterly results from Google, Microsoft, Amazon.  And boy, this was the quarter of the cloud.  Is that the takeaway from all this, Mark Millian?

Start time: 377.20
End time: 424.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is the common thread that all three of those companies have invested a lot into those businesses.  Amazon being the first that got out way ahead of this move to the cloud.  But Google and Microsoft, Microsoft being the latest comer to that group.  But they're all way ahead of the legacy companies like IBM and Oracle who are just getting hammered by this transition in the industry.  And you see in the results from those three companies, they just absolutely murdered.  I mean, their stocks were up anywhere between 8% and 12% after the earnings came out.  They added a combined something like $85 billion in market cap in a single day.  Wow.

Start time: 425.64
End time: 464.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Microsoft had the highest stock price it's had since 2000 since the Department of Justice inquiries into Microsoft's monopoly.  I mean, and it's been a stagnant stock for years.  But I think this is a boy, this is at least Wall Street's judgment on such an Adela that he's done the right thing.  He's moved Microsoft into the cloud.  And the other big story, at least from Microsoft's point of view, was that Bing for the first time ever is profitable.  Bing made a billion dollars.  That's a shocker.  Bing's on the Microsoft.  I guess it's more than just search, right?  It's just Microsoft online services, right?

Start time: 465.72
End time: 503.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think they did single out Bing making a billion dollars.  But you have to, I mean, yes, they are profitable, but they're not profitable in the sense that we think of search engine being profitable,  like, well, basically like Google.  Probably it's mostly things like Yahoo using them and embedded into other OS's like Windows 10 and iOS for Siri.  In fact, Yahoo's moving away, so it might be the end of the line for.  So it is profitable, but it's not people didn't all of a sudden starting started, you know, started to go to Bing.com and start searching for stuff.  Right.

Start time: 504.16
End time: 527.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Microsoft revenue is a whole down 12 percent.  But that is that the earnings beat the estimates.  And that's really what the Wall Street's looking for.  You know, part of the problem for all three companies is their global companies and the dollar strength against global currencies means that they didn't make as much money as they could.  The currency was, you know, the currency exchange rates were a big problem for these companies.

Start time: 527.10
End time: 550.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's been an issue for the last year to two years as the dollar has gotten really strong in the euro has gotten very weak,  and especially in the last quarter or two as China has disappeared.  Yeah, their growth is has gone, you know, has just completely vanished.  But a lot of these companies, all these global companies have hedging programs to minimize the risk from.

Start time: 551.70
End time: 555.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They buy euros and they do some trading and things.

Start time: 555.16
End time: 568.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly. Yeah, they invest in other things in certain markets to kind of hedge against any fluctuations in currency.  But it's I mean, there's still there's no perfect there's no like silver bullet against currency fluctuation.

Start time: 568.74
End time: 608.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hard to read the results at Microsoft because the new reporting structure is extremely confusing.  There are three segments, productivity and business processes, intelligent cloud.  And believe it or not, they have a segment called more personal computing productivity,  which is office, SharePoint, Skype, Exchange, Dynamics, Intelligent Cloud, Azure, Windows Server, SQL Server,  System Center, Visual Studio, Enterprise Services, more personal computing, retail, OEM and volume licensing for Windows,  patent revenue, Windows phone revenue such as it is hardware devices, Xbox and gaming revenue advertising and search.

Start time: 609.34
End time: 624.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In other words, miscellaneous. Yeah, Microsoft's earnings are a mess.  I can't even. And intelligent cloud you would you would assume means cloud.  And yet Office 365 is not included in there, which is one of their fastest growing cloud products.

Start time: 625.02
End time: 650.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So just to break it up, revenue of six point three billion for productivity with an income of three point one billion.  Those are both declines, which you might expect because cloud was up a lot.  Intelligent cloud revenue of six billion operating income, two point four billion.  That's a 14 percent increase in profit. More personal computing was down four percent with a mere one point six billion dollars.

Start time: 650.12
End time: 710.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you'll notice a lot of things are down, which would sound pretty bad initially.  But there's because of this big industry shift to cloud revenue in the right place, right?  Right. It's up in the right place.  What what the industry and analysts all seem to think is kind of the future of where the industry is going.  All the companies, the three who all reported earnings on the same day that show promise in this area, they're getting rewarded for it by investors.  And, you know, cloud revenue ends up looking very different on in earnings than say like selling a box of windows for three, four hundred dollars.  Why is that? Because with selling windows or selling office, you sell it all at once.  It's a huge. Yeah, you got your big revenue, but that customer may not buy from you again for three or four years.  Cloud is like every month you get a little check.  Investors love cloud right now because it's like Netflix.  It's like a subscription model and you can kind of more predictable, isn't it?  It's more predictable source of revenue, which investors like.

Start time: 711.26
End time: 725.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Amazon is I always thought a retail company would know Amazon's a cloud company more than anything else.  Net sales at Amazon. Well, I don't know. I can't I can't read any more of these numbers.

Start time: 727.03
End time: 761.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Amazon is kind of this unseen behemoth in cloud.  I mean, everybody who is anybody with their salt in cloud knows about AWS and how important it is and how vital it is to so many companies.  But, you know, most people just think of Amazon as like the place where they buy their diapers or, you know, what?  And it's it's remarkable how they've sort of silently been able to take over cloud and not only that, but sort of held back and grouped their cloud profits and structure in a way to essentially lay low and lay quiet and capture the business sort of before everybody else got wiped out.  And I think that's the biggest surprise to it because now AWS is ubiquitous.

Transcript:  And Jeff Bezos is one of the top 10 most rich richest men and people in the world, right?

Start time: 767.28
End time: 772.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, he shot just after their earnings. He shot up to number three richest American.

Start time: 773.28
End time: 782.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And he made. It's funny money. It's stock money, but he made two point nine billion dollars in one day in the stock price increase.

Start time: 784.09
End time: 785.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He owns a newspaper for fun.

Start time: 786.32
End time: 787.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 788.16
End time: 792.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wish there were more Jeff Bezos who would subsidize newspapers.

Start time: 792.38
End time: 798.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bezos is worth fifty three billion dollars. Third richest person in the U.S.

Start time: 798.48

Transcript:  The Koch brothers must be unhappy.

Start time: 801.28
End time: 830.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they're no longer number. We're number four or whatever.  That's not as fun as saying we're number one.  That's just phenomenal.  But I think I think you're right, Lauren, when you point out that Amazon, despite the fact of appearances, they really are the cloud leader, aren't they?  I mean, there's lots of other companies.  Microsoft and Google, you'd think would be cloud leaders.  But Amazon saw the potential of the cloud and launched Web Services long before Azure or Google Services.

Start time: 830.78
End time: 865.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And now it's integral into not only, you know, a lot a lot of ways that companies do business, but also, I mean, every app spins up an instance of AWS practically.  And they're gaining a lot of reliable money from a lot of companies that are not going anywhere.  And they've sort of established themselves as top dog.  It's interesting to see other people veer into cloud, you know, seeing kind of how Google finally steps into the arena and how Microsoft grows.  But I mean, at this point, it's it's hard to think about anybody actually becoming a formidable foe to AWS.

Start time: 866.57
End time: 903.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't that amazing? That's not what you think.  But Bezos, in fact, I think, as I remember, I read the Amazon book that was almost an afterthought.  We've got some extra. We've got all these computing power which we don't use after five p.m.  Maybe there's something we could do with it. It wasn't it wasn't a huge, big strategic move.  The other thing I think maybe this is telling is you watch the Walton fortune slowly dwindle away.  They lost about a quarter of their net worth.  That's brick and mortar retail, while Amazon and particularly Jeff Bezos sword.  Is that is that just a coincidence or is it also I think it's got to reflect the change in how we shop?

Start time: 904.50
End time: 919.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, one, I believe that Amazon is now the largest retailer in the world.  I believe that they've officially passed Wal-Mart.  There you go.  One, two, I'm finding it really hard to not make a good night.  John Boy joke.  The Walton family. Yeah.

Start time: 920.30
End time: 922.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is they're all going to sleep.

Start time: 922.10
End time: 958.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, they're all going to sleep now.  But it's true. It's now Amazon is now surpassing brick and mortar stores.  There's no such thing as this online retail versus brick and mortar.  I mean, Amazon is retail at this point and Wal-Mart is struggling as our other brick and mortar stores.  So it's interesting to see how the landscape will change and whether or not going brick and mortar is going to ultimately be a niche market as we get more savvy with our Amazon Prime Now button.  Deliver yesterday.  I got that.  I got one for toilet paper.

Start time: 961.05
End time: 989.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know that button you press and they can send you toilet paper.  And I got a 12 year at home and we got like I got 18 cases of toilet paper because he kept pressing it.  You can get notifications though.  Well, yeah, I had it set up for me to auto order.  Yeah.  And it says, well, we won't order a new one until the old one comes.  But they're so damn fast that by the time I noticed this was happening every other day, I was getting a case of cotton.  Now, I finally, finally realized, oh, my God, Michael's pressing the button.  So I've hidden.

Start time: 990.20
End time: 1044.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I don't know if how they're reporting their earnings.  But another thing that Amazon has going for them is how international they are.  I've noticed in France as well.  A couple of years ago, a lot of people were using Amazon, but a lot of people were a little bit defiant and thinking, you know, basic and not anti-Americanism, but thinking, oh, they're the big American company and we have to preserve our own blah, blah, blah.  And, you know, whatever.  And slowly with their Amazon Prime and their incredible services and in spite of all the bad press they've been having, I've anecdotally, I've seen more and more of my friends starting to use Amazon with Prime, which is magical.  You know, you just press the button.  So you even have Prime in France.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.  And they're improving it all the time, too.  That sounds very chauvinistic of me.  I apologize.  Why?

Start time: 1045.00
End time: 1051.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have Prime in France?  You can't have that in the third world?  A couple of years ago.

Start time: 1052.10

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 1054.08
End time: 1089.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But, you know, until a few months ago, you had to order before 3 p.m. in order to get your order on the next day.  Now it can be later in some places.  And so my friends who are tech heads are using it.  But in the last few months, I've noticed my mom is using it, too.  She just tried it because I basically made her.  And now she lives in a slightly remote location.  She can't live without it.  It's just become better, you know, the way she shops.  She's like, if I need something, I'm not going to take the car and go somewhere.  It's going to come to me.

Start time: 1090.28
End time: 1100.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That actually was the knock on Amazon for a long time was it was, you know, very successful in the U.S.  and maybe the U.K., but not an international seller.  That sounds like that's changing.  And that's, of course, going to make a big difference in overall sales.

Start time: 1101.84
End time: 1109.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What I think is really going to be important is how Amazon tackles Asia.  A lot of Asian countries, specifically China.  China's got Baidu, right?

Start time: 1110.10
End time: 1112.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or not Baidu. What is the Alibaba?  Alibaba.

Start time: 1113.46
End time: 1134.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And Korea has Gmarket, which are both incredibly popular and sort of like the patriotic choice.  When you live in those countries, you use those.  And it'll be interesting to see whether or not Amazon will actually try to move into Asia in any concerted effort  and really make their presence known in places where they're really shocker, the minority retail system.

Start time: 1135.18
End time: 1138.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You feel like there's a collision between Alibaba and Amazon about that.

Start time: 1138.94
End time: 1186.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For sure. But Amazon is investing an insane amount of money into India,  which has, you know, for as behind as India's Internet economy is,  e-commerce in particular is an area where they're one of the biggest players in the world.  There's two homegrown companies called Flipkart and Snapdeal who do just insane amounts.  I mean, it's the second most populous country in the world.  And Amazon is seeing this pop up like right before their eyes.  And so they pledge over a billion dollars to invest into India.  And China is another good example with Alibaba is an area where I don't know that they're going to be able to push in at this point.  Alibaba is a gigantic, gigantic company.

Start time: 1186.32
End time: 1199.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Alibaba would love to be here, I think. I mean, I don't think that their ambitions are no less than Amazon's.  The problem Amazon has is they've paved the way, right? They showed you how to do it.  And so it's no longer secret sauce.

Start time: 1201.04
End time: 1212.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. The battleground is going to be some of these developing markets like India,  which is already more developed than a lot of the other countries say in like Southeast Asia and Africa.  Some of these global companies are starting to look more closely at it.

Start time: 1214.28
End time: 1217.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They just build the infrastructure. That's what they do. That's what they did in the US.

Start time: 1218.20
End time: 1239.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, infrastructure, literally the infrastructure is an interesting piece of the puzzle because in India, for example,  there are no FedEx or UPS that service a lot of these areas.  Russia also has a company called Ozone.  I think that they had to buy up a logistic network, buy all their own trucks to deliver in person.

Start time: 1239.22
End time: 1251.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't you think they'll do that? In fact, they'd probably prefer to do that.  Amazon?  Sure. A ton of money goes to UPS because of Amazon. They're really tough with UPS negotiating those deals.  Wouldn't they rather just do it themselves?

Start time: 1251.94
End time: 1257.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe. I mean, I do see some Amazon branded trucks driving around San Francisco.  That's the Amazon Now stuff, isn't it?

Start time: 1258.08
End time: 1259.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, Prime Now. Prime Now is finally available,

Start time: 1261.84
End time: 1319.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  which is interesting because you would think that that would come to San Francisco much sooner,  but actually it's been working pretty well in New York City.  Have you tried it?  I have not, although I've really thought about it. I was sick all week this last week and was like,  should I use Prime Now to order myself soup? And then I was like, no, I should go outside and see sunlight.  No, don't go see people.  I did. I made the social choice. I made the wrong choice.  But what I have heard, I mean, Amazon Prime Now is actually really interesting when it comes to interactions  with Amazon's real time deals and sales. That's really where it can get interesting is if you are looking at something  and all of a sudden it goes on sale, you can get the Prime Now and they'll send it to you right away  and it's easier to get things that might otherwise sell out. That's what happened on Amazon Prime Day  when they had the discounted Echo, I believe, and also a couple of the other stuff.

And he got it the same, he gets it like at 8 o'clock.  He said the biggest problem was that they didn't let him know they delivered it.  You don't really expect it's going to come that day. And it was sitting on his porch for a couple hours  because they didn't let him know.

Transcript:  But that's exactly what Amazon's selling. Jeff Bezos has said that they're a logistics company first and foremost  and anything that's about logistics is going to be their prime objective.  So as long as they can continue to progressively make their delivery processes painless as possible  and also develop a culture of having painless deliveries, I don't think that Amazon is ever going to have any trouble,  especially in developing countries. If you can have a reputation for bringing things like that super quickly,  then people are going to be more interested in trying you because you have developed this international reputation  for delivering your toilet paper yesterday.

Transcript:  You know, I think the most, the most impressive thing about Amazon is that they keep improving on all of this  because by now they're a pretty old company in web terms and they could very easily rest on their laurels  because they're already super... they're basically the fastest and most other companies are copying or lagging behind,  but they're still finding ways to do things faster that at first seem kind of useless.  Why do you need your thing delivered at eight on that day? You can wait until the next day.  That's already super fast, but they're still improving on things.  And there's probably something to be commended about. It's becoming an Amazon love fest here.  There are things, bad things to say about Amazon as well, but for now we're focusing on the good things.  But it's probably a testament to Bezos' leadership that they're not just stopping and raking in the money  and they're still thinking about how they can improve whatever their service is.

And then of course, the New York Times responds back, hit their executive editor.  It was just, and by the way, but the whole fight occurred on Medium of all places.  Good for Ev Williams.

Oh, he was a fraud.  The entire argument built around like these, like few employees that you, ex-employees that you quoted in your story.

Transcript:  Yeah, I'm like, what is it? I'm not even like a small time stand up comedian.  I'm like a micro time stand up comedian when it comes to like my headlines.  Headline comedy has a long end to it.  Fact check slap fight. It was real though.  Thank you.  It was.  It was really funny because, you know, it was like months ago.  It's one of those things that's become sort of a PR tactic where a company, months after or weeks between,  weeks and months after a story, a hit piece has been filed.  They'll generally go to medium and do sort of like a glorified press release of sorts that like demonstrates the proper amount of outrage about how reporting was conducted.  And it's basically what Jay Carney did. He, you know, questioned a lot of the sources.  He talked about the validity of some of the programs that the New York Times had described.  It was, it was a lot of just semantics months after the fact.  And, you know, it was just so far back in the news cycle.  It was, I had to think about it for a minute.  Right. Right.  Because especially when it comes to tech news, it's like, you know, there's a new drama every day.  So when you look at it from this perspective, it's like, what?  I thought Bezos already said something. Carney.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And from a public relations standpoint, why do you drag this back up two months later?  There must have been some recruiting problems for Amazon behind the scenes that would have been the impetus for something like this.  But still, you don't wait that long to give your rebuttal.

Start time: 1633.06
End time: 1653.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. And also I mentioned that pretending to be mad on medium and releasing sort of like this press release style thing that's like, we're a good company of, you know, noble breed.  And we are honorable and chivalrous to our employees. It's like, yeah, OK, just do it.  I think that people would rather you show that you're not that company than if you just stomped around and threw a fit about it.

Transcript:  Part of it, though, is Google, that when you search for Amazon, you might find those articles.  And so there is, you know, this is that this is why the right to be forgotten for some people might not be a bad thing.  Google surfaces this stuff. Yeah, maybe old news, but it got so many links and so much attention two months ago that it's still ranking high in a Google search.  And that might be something that Carney feels like they have to do something about.  In fact, that's one of the theories that came up in the in a New Yorker article headline.  Why did Jay Carney use medium to criticize the New York Times? With a great cranky Jay Carney photo.

Start time: 1705.80
End time: 1750.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's possible. I mean, medium has become surprisingly, I think, a place where you go to post, I was going to say, serious talks, but it might be more accurate to say seemingly serious talks.  And for some reason, when you see something on medium, it has that air of respectability, probably more than if it was on some other random blog.  Medium has become a place where you go to air your deep thoughts about, you know, your theories about the tech world and about the message you have to pass to your people.  I'm not sure why medium works that way, but I think it kind of does for most tech reporters now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So in French, computer is ordinateur, which actually means a thing that computes.  So it was back in the day when we actually translated words. And if we did that today with any other tech related topic, we would be outraged that we can't even use the English word.  But for some reason, back in those days, it was normal.  That's l'Académie Francaise.

End time: 1915.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, well, basically, all right. I never miss a chance to make fun of my own language.  Basically, we have a bunch of different ways to officially, according to the French Academy, to say an email.  And one of them is a French way of writing the English word, mail, which is mel.  It's basically a transcription of the way you pronounce mail when you misread it as a French person.  Mel.  It's ridiculous. Yes, it's mel.  So you could say, oh, I'm going to send you a mel.  And that's the way you're supposed to say it.  Basically, every word now is translated or adapted by the Académie Francaise.  It's infuriating. But again, ordinateur makes sense.  I like it. It would be completely ridiculous if someone said in French, oh, je veux acheter, I want to buy, je veux acheter un computer.  It would sound, I was going to say retarded, but that's not good.  Really? Sounds good to me.  No, it sounds weird. Sounds right.  I think in Canada, in Canada, they say it.  And in that case, the French Canadians get angry because they shouldn't use English words.

Start time: 1963.62
End time: 1996.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think a lot of people are speaking English that maybe wouldn't have before just because they're exposed to a lot of that language.  And the cultural dominance has always been there.  I mean, for the past few decades and the web basically transports that.  But, you know, even beyond the fact that it's coming from English speaking countries, people who need to communicate, who might not have English as a native language, are probably going to navigate to English.  That's the third choice.  Yeah.

Start time: 1997.70
End time: 2032.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's actually an issue that they're having at Google for Google Translate.  They found that so much of the majority of web pages on the Internet are English that they're having a hard time being able to accurately translate smaller languages like Bulgarian into the Google Translate database.  They don't have a big enough database to catalog all of the words.  So they've actually started polling countries and asking them to help in collecting and gathering words and phrases to make Google Translate more accurate because they can't rely on Internet crawling alone to do the work.  Shocking.

And I don't know if it's related to the amount of information they have, but even for digital assistants like Siri and Cortana, usually, I mean, well, it's just two examples, but it seems that they've been more accurate in English faster than they have been in French, for example.

Harry's is for guys who want a great shaving experience for a fraction of what you're paying  now.  Look, nobody likes shaving.  I'm going to admit it.  Yes.  Sometimes you scrape yourself with all blades and the blades are crazy expensive.  That's why they lock them up at the drugstore.  Four bucks a blade for the fusion.  But there is a company that is changing all that Harry's.  They decided to disintermediate shaving.  I like this idea.  They make their own blades in their own factory in Germany.  Yes, they bought the factory.  That's how we do it nowadays.  You get that venture funding.  You say, how can we make this work better?  Well, what if we owned the factory?  Because then we can design blades for sharpness, for performance.  And because we sell direct, we can sell them for a lot less, like half the cost of those  expensive blades.  Plus, they ship them free.  Harry's.com.  I want you to check out the Harry's kits because that's how you start.  The Truman kit, 15 bucks.  The Winston kit, $25.  That's a metal handle.  I actually really like the Truman set.  And with both sets, you get three blades, three blades, plus the travel cover, plus  the foaming shave gel or the shave cream, your pick.  Very, very nice.  You know, you could take five bucks off if you use the offer code TWIT5 at checkout.  So that means the Truman's going to be like 10 bucks.  What a great gift, a great way to get started.  And then you sign up for the subscription.  If you wish, you can get the blades shipped to you automatically.  You can get the shave cream or the shave gel shipped to you.  They also have aftershave balm and other great products, moisturizers.  Harry's.com.  They're making shaving a little bit better.  Just use the offer code TWIT5 at checkout.

They don't even mention his wife and his three kids.  When I spent the weekend with Steve, Lisa was with them.  She was a high school kid and they loved her.  Everybody was happy.  It just wasn't the Steve Jobs that any of us remember.  That's the problem I have.  But you're right.  As long as people know that that's not real.  So it's no Sorkinisms either.

And so people like Jobs, Larry Page, wield immense power without, they're not elected officials without any oversight.  That's not a bad point of view, a bad point to make, I should say.

And I think it's it is kind of a voting with your with your wallet situation.  And certainly the leaders of those companies do are concerned with the ability to sell their products.  I'm not sure, you know, it's equivalent to being to do doing right by your constituency, which arguably politicians don't do either.  But I mean, there is some form of accountability.

Harder, though, with Google, they feel like their infrastructure, even if you use an iPhone, for instance, you're probably using a lot of Google services.  I just feel like there's some some of these people are a little bit more immune from that kind of pressure.  Google's, by the way, quarter was was fairly good as well.  Revenue of eighteen point seven billion dollars.  That's 13 percent year over year growth.  Mobile search revenue. Once again, very big.

Transcript:  It's very nice.  They haven't opened it to everyone yet, but I think that's going to be the key.  First of all, when they open it to, you know, just more developers, because for now it's very limited.  I'm guessing it's, you know, Netflix, Hulu, whatever.  But the more important thing is the apps, right?  That's the big game changer, not the search.  The search is cool, but the apps is what is what's going to really well to have the potential to change things in the set up box market.

Transcript:  I agree completely.  I think the apps could potentially be huge based on what Apple has been able to do in a lot of different categories of devices.  But your point about Siri is a good one.  I mean, even on the iPhone, developers have been waiting for them to open up a Siri API since Siri came out.  And they've shown no signs of doing that and going more of like the preferential treatment route.  I'm sure it's a very complicated problem to get voice search to open that up so any developer can build into it and not, you know, turn it just into a mess of responses.  But I think that once they get there, that'll potentially create a very interesting product.  Yeah, I wonder about that.

And I think the thing is that I am a person who uses my Chromecast for very specific things.  You know, I can cast my tabs or I can run Netflix or if I wanted to on it as sort of a backup device because I also have a smart TV.  And it often like doubles up on on apps and devices.

Transcript:  Sorry, just want to go back to the gaming thing for just a second and say that one of the assets that Apple might have there is the controller.  Because the touch, I was going to say touch screen, the touch surface on the remote might provide a more adequate way of controlling your game than other set-top boxes have.  And that might help push the gaming ecosystem on Apple TV forward a little bit because the biggest issue with gaming on any device is the control scheme.  And with this one, maybe a little bit better.

Casual gamers are players who play when they have time to waste.  And serious gamers are gamers who make time to play games.  And are they going to convert one into the other?  And the big thing is, if they manage to do that, developers are going to be interested because for some reason, psychologically,  I'm pretty sure you're going to be able to sell a game that plays on your TV for, you know, four, five, seven bucks when that's totally unacceptable on your phone.  And if some people think, well, I'm playing on my phone already, I might check out that thing that they're making commercials for on my TV.  There might be an intermediate market that's going to make a lot more money to the developers.  There is a big it's a big if here is video from Clash Con.

Transcript:  Which is interesting, right? Because when you look at something like this, you think like, OK, well, this is what people like what Apple and what Amazon have in mind when they're putting forth their gaming experiences on a television, which is completely different from the way that I grew up.  As a gamer, you know, I have four brothers and sisters and we had an N64 and you better be good because you didn't want to be the fifth person that was out and not able to play the game, which is how it works.  You got your controller taken away from you and given to the other person. You lost your privilege. They get to play now.  So we were really serious about it. But it's one of those situations where you look at this experience and you think to yourself like, OK, well, if we're looking at modern gaming as it is now, you have you have this.  But then you have, you know, Sony and Microsoft and you have Oculus and you have Valve and you have all these companies that are pushing into this other direction.  And I sort of wonder whether or not this is actually going to be a good fully realized big screen experience rather than just kind of like a novelty.  Like, oh, yeah, I can definitely play Crossy Road on my fire TV, but I'm not going to sit down for hours and like, I'm agreeing with you.

Yeah, I think actually the big, that's what Steve Jobs was saying apparently on his deathbed, you know, when he said he's cracked it.  I've had a pretty revelatory, that word, experience a few years ago.  I hadn't used a TV for I think 10 or 15 years and then I moved and I bought a big TV and I thought,  yay, I'm going to buy a TV and I'm going to have a cable box and it's going to be really different from what it was 15 years ago.

But the main thing is that now that we have all of those services that are completely independent from one another,  you never know where what you want to watch is or if it is available.  You can go to the Netflix app, you can go and that's where the C research is really killer.  It's that you just say what you want to watch and it tells you if it is available and if it is where and how much, you know, if you can buy it.  That is definitely a significant improvement on the TV UI that I don't think many other services or devices offer.  I guess the Fire TV, but I'll be up at midnight.

Yeah, and they're really working on integrating a lot of what Alexa does in the Echo into the Fire TV without it being actively listening,  which I know is really hinky for some people.

Transcript:  Speaking of police states, Apple has told a US court that it is not possible for us to unlock new iPhones.  We don't have a back door. They laid out a brief on Monday after a federal magistrate in Brooklyn asked Apple.  He was weighing a US Department of Justice request to force Apple to help access a iPhone seized during an investigation.  In the brief, Apple said that for 90 percent of its devices, anything running iOS 8 or higher, we cannot.  We strengthen encryption methods. We have no way of unlocking that phone.  Department of Justice says, too bad, you better come up with a way.  And that is the battle that's going on. Not listening in on your Alexa.  I'm sorry. I shouldn't say the name out loud because people listening to the show on their Echoes are annoyed right now.  I've said it quite a few times.

I don't think you're listening. We cannot do it.  Well, the DOJ says you may not, but you better.

Transcript:  But you better figure out a way because you own the software.  Apple and its license agreement says the software is not sold to you, but is licensed to you.  And so the Justice Department replied to Apple's filing, saying Apple designed, manufactured and sold the phone that is subject to the search warrant.  But that's only the beginning of their relationship with the phone.  Apple writes and owns the software and this software is thwarting the execution of the warrant.  So the threat is we're going to come after you, Apple, because this is your software that's getting in the way of our investigation.

I mean, I guess it's just covering your bases. But I mean, if you're if you already have access to email, Facebook, there's lots of other ways.  All these other things. Yeah. Then how much of an impact would or could a device that is unlocked make as something that I guess really isn't quantified or qualified in these hearings?

Transcript:  They say very publicly, oh, no, we're protecting your privacy.  But then when it comes to behind the scenes lobbying, they may not do that.  And case in point is this latest bill which was just passed in the Senate, CISA, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act in public Google and Apple and Facebook.  And Dropbox and Twitter all wanted to stop CISA.  They made a big noise about how much they hated CISA.  But there's some evidence that behind the scenes, some of these companies might have been lobbying for CISA to pass.  One of the reasons they might want it to pass the CISA allows companies to share data about security issues with each other, but also with the U.S.  government.  The theory is that as we're getting more and more cyber attacks, the better the information sharing is, the safer everybody is.  But of course, people are concerned that this will also allow companies or in fact force companies to share private information about its users with law enforcement.  And one of the reasons it's thought that Facebook and others might like this bill is because it would eliminate any liability they might have for revealing that private information to law enforcement.  Anyway, the bill has been passed.  The president's indicated he will sign it.  I mean, I guess it's a done deal.  If you want to continue to fight it, you can go to fight for the future dot org and write your member of Congress.  But I think it's a done deal.

How original.  There are a few people, to be fair, who say, oh, this is so exciting.  Four hundred dollars for an MP3 player.  I call it the cube 2.0.  It won't sell.  It'll be killed off in a short time.  It's not really functional.  Can I have a key?  I have to say I didn't.

I had a tiny like two inches by two inches MP3 player from Panasonic that held, I don't know, maybe 128 megabytes.  And I loved that thing.  It was super small.  So the iPod was too big for me.

Isn't that funny?  There are a few people who understood it, but most of the people were very disappointed.  And that just shows you really in a way this in many ways is a tribute to Steve Jobs.  The guy did not pay attention to what people asked for.  He did what he thought was the right thing to do.  And it turned out more often than not, not in every respect, but more often than not, he was absolutely right.

And the Nano after that was me and iTunes, of course, and iTunes on Windows was a put the iPod on the map, which was something Steve Jobs fought for a long time, but eventually gave it on.  Let's take a break.  Come back with more.  We are talking about tech.  I want to talk about YouTube Red, the new YouTube subscription channel that launches on Wednesday.  A one billion dollar funding round, not just for magically, but also for Uber.  This is not valuing them.  This is the new unicorn, not valued at a billion dollars.  Give us a billion dollars.  Uber will now be valued, if they raise this money, which I think they will, at something like 50 billion dollars.  And they still haven't made any money, have they?  There's no profit at all in Uber.  I don't think so.  Certainly not magically.  Not that I'm laughing or anything.  And a real tech hero, Jack Dorsey, gives back his Twitter stock, at least part of it, to his employees.  Our show today brought to you by audible.com.  I'm a big audible fan.  I don't think it's a surprise.  I am listening to audiobooks all the time.  We're all excited about this new Sarah Vowell book.  This is one that Andy Anaco recommended.  Sarah Vowell, who's a contributor to This American Life, has this wonderful, quirky voice, has written a book about the Marquis de Lafayette.  You've heard of him, right, Patrick?  Of course. Lafayette, I am here.  He is the Frenchman, the 20-something Frenchman, who helped win the Revolutionary War for America.  And she's apparently written, I don't know what it is, a biography?  A humorous and insightful portrait of the famed Frenchman.  And listen to the people that are reading this with her.  John Slattery, the good-looking guy on Mad Men, you know, the white-haired guy on Mad Men.  Fred Armisen from Saturday Night Live.  John Hodgman, we all love John Hodgman.  And more, this sounds like an amazing book.  Nick Offerman, the guy with a mustache, is also in this.  Is this on Audible now?  Oh, I didn't know it.  Do you know the Night Vale podcast?  Welcome to Night Vale is now an Audible book.  They released, let me just look this up.  This is awesome.  So the deal is I'm going to get you two books.  So there's two books you might want to get right there.  If you listen to the Night Vale podcast, the novel of the Night Vale podcast is now out.  Welcome to Night Vale by Joseph Fink and Jeffrey Kraner, based on the podcast.  I wonder who narrates it.  Is Cecil Baldwin the announcer on it?  So he's in this.

Your iPhone, your Android device, your Windows phone, your Mac, your PC.  You can even listen on the web.  So Audible, which is so cool, now works on my Chromebook.  I am so thrilled.  180,000 titles.  This is my Audible library.  I'm just finishing now the three-body problem, amazing science fiction.  Trilogy that just came out of China.  Neal Stephenson's Seven Eves is probably next on my list.  I'm a huge Neal Stephenson fan.  Felicia Day's book is out on Audible.  Of course, she narrates it along with a forward by Joss Whedon, who narrates his forward.  There's so much good stuff.  Fiction, nonfiction, science fiction.  The new Ernie Klein Armada, narrated, of course, by Will Wheaton.  He's a guy that did Ready Player One.  The hardest thing about having an Audible subscription is, and you see I have two credits available,  picking two books.  I love it.  I've got so many great books available, and you could too.  Go to audible.com slash twit, the number two.  You're going to be signing up for the Platinum account.  That's two books a month, but your first month is free.  You cancel any time in that first 30 days.  You'll pay nothing, but your two books are yours to keep forever.  You also get the Daily Digest of the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.  Audible.com slash twit, and the number two.  If you have seen the movie The Martian, but you haven't read the book, please do yourself a favor.  If you haven't seen the movie, read the book first.

I don't know if that's my first or if that's just something I have had for a while.  I really don't know the provenance of this.  Okay.  What did I say I was going to talk about? I forgot.  YouTube Red.  I don't understand what's going on with YouTube Red.  So I want somebody to explain to me.  I think ESPN doesn't understand either.  They've been shutting their videos down and putting them back up.  So starting Wednesday,  YouTube, if you go to youtube.com slash red, you can learn all about it.  YouTube is going to launch a subscription tier.  Ten bucks a month.  You'll be able to watch YouTube videos without ads.  YouTube music videos without ads.  And you'll get a subscription to Google Music.  Or the other way around.  I have a subscription to Google Music.  So I will get ad free YouTube videos.  And I will get ads for YouTube.  I have a subscription to Google Music.  So I will get ad free YouTube as well.  You'll be able to save songs offline and videos offline.  That's something YouTube has always blocked.  There have been third party apps that do that.  You'll be able to play them in the background.  It's really an interesting play.  But I wonder who's going to pay ten bucks a month.  For YouTube videos without ads.

Transcript:  So that's the issue right?  They're essentially establishing this channel that's going to bring people like Toby Turner into the original YouTube channel.  They're going to be the original content space.  It's going to be YouTube is going to back this content.  We have all these great creators that have these millions of followers.  But are those followers the same people who have that kind of paper route money to spend?  I guess.  This is YouTube has been doing this all along.

Start time: 4677.24
End time: 4692.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They don't want to be the 12 year old channel.  They really want to be the new TV.  And so when they had the they were giving people a million, two million dollars to do YouTube channels.  You know, Shaq got a YouTube channel and that was a miserable flop.  They really want to create a premium content to replace television.

Start time: 4699.90
End time: 4743.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's expected to be a part of this subscription service.  That they'll have exclusives that are only available if you're a subscriber.  Much like Netflix has House of Cards and Daredevil and a bunch of other very popular shows.  YouTube won't necessarily go the Netflix route and do high quality Hollywood style.  But there is money to do that, I think.  I mean, I think there's plenty of stuff.  There's money to do it.  But I don't at least what we've seen, they're not looking to take on Netflix directly and create a Netflix copycat.  I mean, they will pay money to commission exclusive videos that look and feel more like what you're used to with YouTube and not sort of hour long adult dramas.

Start time: 4753.00
End time: 4909.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, I think I would.  I've transitioned from basically I used to watch a lot of video podcasts and now all the video I watch is on YouTube.  I think there's a lot of valuable content, not just for 12 year olds.  You're totally right.  PewDiePie's audience is, you know, 12 year old boys and 14 year old girls.  And but it's not just that.  I think YouTube is in a runt and they have a problem with revenue.  The big problem on YouTube is that creators don't make enough money to make a decent living because the ad revenue has become so low.  You know, it's always been very low.  But with the ad blocking and everything, it's impossible for people who aren't basically either students or unemployed to make a living on YouTube because it takes too much time.  It takes too much energy and it eats up your life.  And people are with respectable followings are not making the amount of money that makes their activity sustainable on the long term.  So I think what they're doing is basically kickstarting it, kickstarting a longer process.  First of all, by giving a lot of people lots of different reasons to to to get that subscription.  It's not just removing the ads, it's the music and the ability to, you know, they've artificially constrained the app so that it couldn't play in the backgrounds and stuff like that.  And I would like to have that ability and the exclusive content.  It's a big package.  And once that happens, not only do people provide ten dollars a month to YouTube, which is an enormous amount, the equivalent to an enormous amount of ads watched.  So the revenue per user would be significant for those who choose to do that.  But also it removes a little bit of ad inventory and potentially could raise the ad price a little bit and make the even the CPM on ad supported content a little bit higher.  And I think they don't have a choice.  They have to provide that option because the revenue from ad only is not sustainable in the long run.  It's just they even if it doesn't work out in the first year or two, they have to provide that option.  And maybe if it's not good enough, you know, if they don't get the numbers to affect their revenue, they can then introduce, you know, a three months or yearly deal that is going to make it cheaper that people are then more likely to go for.  So I think it's a very important play for YouTube.  And it's actually I would say platform defining.  You're a creator.  You, in fact, I mentioned this at the beginning of the show, Patrick, you now are a full time podcaster.

Start time: 4913.10
End time: 4996.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's because of Patreon.  You have a model.  Jack Conte, who founded Patreon, is quoted in this article on The Verge.  He said he doesn't think Red will bring about any improvements for creators.  Subscription.  By the way, Jack was on here a couple of weeks ago.  He said one of the main reasons I created Patreon is because Pomp and Musse is the wonderful music that he and his girlfriend Natalie Dawn make would get a million views on a Pomp and Musse video.  That cost them $6,000 to make and make $1,500 in ad revenue from YouTube.  It wasn't a viable model.  So he created Patreon so that viewers could support the artists directly.  He says subscription services are great for consumers.  Pay 10 bucks.  Have any song or video in your pocket whenever you want.  But for the creators, there's still too way too many people.  And so he created a platform that's going to make it easier for people to get to the bottom of the platform.  And so I think it's a great way to get to the bottom of the platform.  But for the creators, there's still too way too much of a middleman.  He said my art might be worth $10 to a super fan, but if she's listening on Spotify, even with a subscription, I'm still only getting pennies every time she interacts with what I've made.  Patreon is, of course, a better model if you want to support creators.  But YouTube is where the audience is.  Yeah, the audience.

Start time: 4997.72
End time: 5053.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, Patreon is for engaged audiences.  Right.  It's a very small percentage of your of your audience that is actually going to go and support you on Patreon.  For me, for example, I have a bimonthly show and it's supported by about a thousand people out of a much wider audience.  And they give about, you know, two and a half to three dollars per episode.  And that's with additional revenue on the side.  That's roughly enough to make an OK living.  I don't think that's the audience that YouTube is going to go after.  I think what they're what they're hoping is going to happen is that it's going to make currently on YouTube.  If you don't have, you know, at least five hundred thousand to a million subscribers to watch your videos, you're probably not going to be making a good living.  And even then, I'm not sure it's decent.

Transcript:  The vast majority of YouTube creators are just not making money.  They're doing it for promotional reason or something else.  I think YouTube always trots out PewDiePie and Michelle Phan because they are making millions.  But they're the exception, I think.

Start time: 5068.00
End time: 5102.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think those people are making enough money to live on if they're students living in their parents' basement.  Or, you know, it's ironic.  And I think what they're trying to do is to get that threshold where you can make a living out of it, not on Patreon level, where you can make a living out of a few thousand people that support you,  but maybe a few tens of thousands people, you know, watching and subscribing, maybe a hundred thousand.  And a portion of those people are going to go and subscribe to YouTube.  And that's going to raise your revenue level.

Transcript:  There's a lot of unknowns about YouTube Red.  We don't know how they divide the $10 up.  Is it based on views?  Am I not going to get more money from YouTube Red than I would have gotten from ads embedded on my content?  We personally, Twitter, we don't know exactly what's going to happen to us.  The current thinking is nothing because our ads are interstitial.  We don't turn on monetization on our...  We've been told we can't turn on monetization on our shows, our full shows, because they have their own ads.  And I don't think that YouTube Red will hide our shows.  But I think even ESPN is confused because they've been taking shows down and putting them back up.  It's not obvious what's going to happen at all.  And it could be that all of a sudden, come Wednesday, none of our shows with advertising, our own advertising, like this show, will be visible on YouTube.  I don't know what's going to happen.

Start time: 5153.06

Transcript:  Well, the intricate thing about the ESPN situation is the fact that ESPN, a lot of ESPN's content is licensed from somewhere else.  It's usually licensed from the NFL or the MLB or the NBA.  And those have separate licensing deals, which is why you saw that whole...  I'd like to think that it's connected, but I'm sure I don't get to see fully what's behind the curtain over at ESPN.  But it's kind of the same issue when you look at the fact that they had to do DCMA takedowns over...

Start time: 5185.38

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think the timing might be coincidental, but it also shows the tenuous agreements that ESPN might have in creating and producing content that is licensed or has specific deals in terms of sharing for these big sports leagues.  What happens when you have a viral NFL video that ESPN is running but ESPN is using for something like YouTube Red?  Does that violate the deal with the NFL? Does YouTube have to make the contract with the NFL directly?  All of a sudden you start to see these things.  If you have this old media, how that interacts with the way that YouTube Red is established is really not clear.  The only thing that YouTube is really talking about are these original shows that they're working on and the expansion or the gussied up version of what you normally see from YouTubers.

They've been testing it. They apparently either haven't been able to get the rights done or haven't been able to find a way to make the service work.  Now they're folding music together with all of the rest of YouTube.  It's really about the music, you think?  I think it's really about the music.

Transcript:  That might change with a subscription service that actually works and brings in a lot of money.  But I think music is important. I think it's a portion of what YouTube could become if it managed to make decent money for its creators.  All in all, music is not a huge, an enormous industry compared to everything that we have in the tech world.  I think TV is not going away, but it's kind of dwindling a little bit.  It could be replaced by IPTV in a sense in the next few years.  And YouTube has done a great job at sort of moving from the funny cat on a skateboard video image it had.  But it's not quite a place where people go for actual content.  It's been getting to interesting videos.  I think I don't know if you guys know channels like Crash Course or PBS Space Time or things like that that are super interesting, super well done, high quality content.  But I think it could go even further.  And in order to do that, they need to raise revenue for the creators and the potential, I really think far exceeds music alone.

I mean, there's not bad views, but in other words, I'm saying this is a promotional vehicle for PBS.  They're not trying to make the money back.  Crash Course, huh?  What is that all about?

Start time: 5591.02
End time: 5613.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Very possible.  But the MOOC's were thought of by teachers.  If you look at things like Crash Course, I'm sure there are a lot of them, but they are very fast,  10 minutes videos made with humor in the way that YouTube videos work.  So they were conceived from a YouTuber's point of view and a YouTube audience point of view.  And I think that's why they're working.

Start time: 5615.94
End time: 5622.00

It's a 20,000 square foot screen in effect.  Wow.  And the screen will... maybe there is a screen. I don't know what it is.  The screen will make it... must be a screen.

Start time: 5894.64
End time: 5931.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. I think that a lot of it has to do with the fact that Facebook wants people to connect with public figures in the way that they're sort of promoting their live streaming and sort of all of this engagement  surrounding Facebook subscribers. I know as someone who tried to get Facebook verified recently and was told that I don't post publicly enough in order to be...  I'm sorry.  I know. Although Google tells me I'm the only Lauren Hawkinson in the world. So there's no fake...  Oh, that's nice.  I know. It's great for SEO.  Are your parents planning ahead?  I think that they were given the name Hawkinson, which is cool. Thanks.  Thanks, Mom and Dad.  Yeah. Thanks, Sweden.  But actually what happens is that...

Transcript:  I think that that is actually kind of the point.  When I was saying Facebook is going to become Google or whatever stupid way I said it, I think there is a path to that.  Basically, let's say I'm going to tie it all together. It's going to be beautiful.  When the Master Chief video thing in Sydney gets released and posted by Microsoft on Facebook, you're going to be able to...  Someone is interested in Halo 5 and instead of going to Google to learn more about Halo 5, they're going to be able to go search on Facebook and get these kinds of posts that are going to be what they would have traditionally gotten on Google.  I think there is a play for keeping people more into their ecosystem and making the content, the very large amount of content posted directly to Facebook, including video, which they've been making a big deal of in the past couple of years, surfaceable and accessible to all the people who are already on Facebook.  So, yeah, I think it is a big deal.

I'm sure that felt that Jack moving into the CEO position in terms of prioritizing Twitter as the company that he cares about, now that he's CEO of two companies.  I think that it's an easy way for Jack to engender loyalty and trust in a way that feels like he believes in the company.  And I think he does. I think it's genuine. I think he wants Twitter to succeed, obviously.  But a lot of it is also getting employees on board and doing so by saying, like, here, I am giving this back to you guys so you can invest in Twitter.

But there's some point where you... Bill Gates said this. He said, at some point, you're infinitely rich.  More money is not going to change your lifestyle at all. And maybe he just feels like, I got plenty. It's time to give back.  He also said, I don't know if this is going to change anything. He wants to reset relationships with developers.  It was Dick Costolo, his predecessor, who killed the third party ecosystem, essentially, by limiting Twitter clients to 100,000 new users and so forth.  You actually wrote a story saying the Twitter client has gotten better on the Mac side.

Start time: 6199.20
End time: 6204.00

Start time: 6210.00
End time: 6286.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes. But TweetDeck actually does... It was updated. So it has group DMs and emoji.  Group DMs? What a concept.  Emoji support. You know, it's the little things, right? Twitter for Mac does not have those things yet.  They promised them it's kind of the moving forward and understanding that maybe they should be putting a lot more effort into their native apps rather than relying on third party developers.  Or in this case, with TweetDeck, a company that initially started out as a third party developer but then was included under the Twitter umbrella.  Jury's still out. Again, like I said, I'm a TweetDeck loyalist. I'm all about it.  I use the dark mode because I think I'm cool. And I think it works really well for me.  But it all depends on sort of what they really want to do.  And I think that this is them saying, like, not only are we investing in our apps, but we're also investing in developers to create more with our SDK and with our API to sort of do more and to make Twitter as exciting as it should be, given how big it is, given how big the platform is.  The fact that they've been shut off to developers for so long now, it's kind of remarkable.

Start time: 6288.29
End time: 6297.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 6298.76
End time: 6327.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's true. But there's so much information and data and value that Twitter has sort of stored away that I think that there will be some people who are really interested in creating something, even if it's just other companies.

Transcript:  Did you read Kara Swisher's latest and recode?  Kara, of course, has made her living with leaks from Yahoo.  This may be the last one.  Yahoo talent exodus accelerates as Marissa Meyer's turnaround flounders.  Apparently, Yahoo's been trying to cover this up.  In fact, Marissa's not been too happy about it either.  She had a recent company-wide meeting.  She put up photos of purple kittens to indicate a successful period of no leaks about the company's business.  There were no leaks about the company's internal issues, including staff departures.  But that never stopped Kara.  Apparently, many executives leaving.  There is a sense of doom, according to her, at Yahoo.  Marissa Meyer's attempt to turn around the company is now being viewed inside as failing.  The Yahoo situation is troubling, says one source.  Another is worried about the ability of managers to staunch the flow of valued employees.  And, boy, when you read about it, two senior women execs left just last week.  Development head Jackie Reese to square.  Marketing partnership head Lisa Licht.  The CMO, Kathy Savitt, who was brought in by Meyer, just close to Meyer, now is left.  Mike Kern's SVP of Homepage and Verticals left in April.  I mean, the list goes on and on and on.  People, even people who just arrived departing very quickly.  So I don't, you know, I feel like Yahoo has so much value in it.  But I also feel like it's been such a challenge.  And Marissa Meyer was hired as CEO to turn it around.  And you cannot say looking at it in any way there's been a turn around at Yahoo.  Right?

Start time: 6810.88
End time: 6830.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think it depends on what you would consider to be the turn around point.  I guess I was, I read something in the San Francisco Chronicle.  I believe it was an AP story regarding the possibility of Yahoo getting into the fantasy sports.  They've actually, they have.  They have fantasy sports.

Transcript:  And it could be a really big boon for Yahoo Sports because it was a huge fantasy sports bastion.  And it's been for so long until DraftKings and Fandool started eating its lunch and started getting real money payouts from it.  I think that there are ways that Yahoo can sort of pivot or really push into new areas.  But that really comes at the behest of Meyer's judgment.  And what she sees is as the image for the company, which to be frank, I don't know if I see a clear one right now.

Transcript:  I feel like, and this ties into Jonah Peretti's company wide memo.  Yahoo is very old school, right?  The monolithic portal content company, continent services company.  And then you look at what BuzzFeed is doing, which is, I don't know if it's going to be successful or not, but very, very, almost the opposite.  BuzzFeed creates content that they don't put on their own site.  They put everywhere else.  And I thought this was a great memo from Jonah Peretti, the founder and CEO of BuzzFeed, to his staff, which he then later put on the BuzzFeed blog,  in which he basically said, we've been hiring like crazy.  We've got talented reporters and storytellers and business people and engineers.  We are building a global, it's interesting that he has to, in the memo to the company, explain what the company is doing.  A global cross platform network for news and entertainment, kind of the opposite of Yahoo.  If Yahoo was a monolithic portal, BuzzFeed exists on Facebook and YouTube and everywhere else, wherever potential viewers are.  He says, we see a post like 26 problems only anxious people will understand, which got 10 million views on our site,  evolve into multiple videos with 10 million views across YouTube and Facebook, which turned into a comic on Instagram,  then on our Snapchat Discover channel and on and on and on.  It's stories, it's global, it's a multi-platform.

Transcript:  There are virtues to both media strategies and there is our drawbacks to like BuzzFeed's entire model is to some extent built around capturing lightning in a bottle.  If it's not viral, you never know what's going to go viral.  You can get an idea of what works and what doesn't, but you can never really know when you've got like the dress, for example,  which is a phenomenon that still doesn't make any sense to me, how people saw different colors of the dress.  Different colors of the dress. Yeah, exactly. Black and gold.  Whereas Yahoo has the advantage of like Sunday's NFL game that aired in London is on Yahoo.  It's a perfect example of taking something that's incredibly boring, the worst game of the week, Jaguars versus Bills,  at 6.30 in the morning in San Francisco and driving tens of millions of people to it, likely.  They haven't announced numbers yet, but driving millions of people to it.

Start time: 7057.18
End time: 7062.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because it's a lot easier to monetize that than it is a post on Facebook or a post on YouTube.

Start time: 7063.58
End time: 7069.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Arguably, they didn't do a great job of monetizing this particular event. They had to undersell some of the ads, I think.

Start time: 7070.04

Transcript:  I think, though, the point that BuzzFeed is making is that people no longer go to a site.

Start time: 7075.50
End time: 7083.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, many people do. Definitely, it's going in a different direction, but Yahoo's homepage still drives many, many millions of people.

Transcript:  Well, I'm certainly saying what Bloomberg people are going to go to because they're on a mission.  But it must be challenging for somebody like the New York Times where people don't go to the front page and browse the Times.  They go to links that they see on Twitter and Facebook and follow those links.  And that's what BuzzFeed is trying to capitalize on. I'm sorry, Patrick, go ahead.

Start time: 7102.30
End time: 7132.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I think that's what BuzzFeed has been doing really well.  First, because they manage against all odds to capture some amount of lightning in a bottle because they do get very viral posts.  They do get very viral posts. I've never seen anybody so good at it.  It's incredibly exploitative. They make those kinds of listicles that honestly make any, I was going to say any serious journalist, but really any journalist kind of roll their eyes.

Start time: 7132.00
End time: 7139.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 7140.16
End time: 7192.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sure they are. They have formulas. But beyond that, I think they look at the way the articles are taking off and then they're pushing the ones that really start taking off a lot more.  And you see them everywhere. And what the you're right, Leo.  The lesson is for a lot of publications, they have to sort of divorce themselves from this idea of content ownership.  It's a very, very dangerous and counterintuitive thing to do.  But you have to be willing to let go and to put your content everywhere.  People will want to see it because if you don't, people are just not going to see it.  And ironically, BuzzFeed has been starting to do actual investigative journalism.  That is, you know, they've had some pretty substantial articles.

Start time: 7193.06
End time: 7205.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As is Vice, another company kind of built the same way. Lauren, you said it though. You don't go.  All you need is Slack and Twitter. You don't open your browser and go to your home page, your MyYahoo page.

Start time: 7205.52
End time: 7368.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I don't. But I think that it brings up an interesting point, right?  When you look at something that's cross-platform like BuzzFeed, what you're seeing is a division between two different kinds of BuzzFeed reader.  You know, the people who click on those Me Too listicles or like I like to say, I actively say to my computer, oh, that is so me.  All those posts that make you go, that is so me is what BuzzFeed is really known for.  They want you to click on the article that is so you, that's so about you.  But at the same time, there are other different ways of news gathering.  I mean, I spend my time on Twitter and I follow different news sources and I get it directly there.  And every once in a while, you know, I'll see something from another social site or it'll come up in my RSS or however, you know, I choose to get news at that specific moment in time.  But what BuzzFeed is trying to capture is this instance where it's like, sure, I'm not going to click on Me Too posts on Facebook.  I'm not going to click on, you know, 10 reasons why, you know, girls who went to college in Boston love coffee.  Like, I don't care about this.  It's so me, though.  It's so me, but I don't I don't want to click on it.  I think that what we see is we see those people and they're on Facebook.  What we see, you know, people on Twitter who perhaps are searching for specific news sources and may follow BuzzFeed or seeing people on YouTube or on Instagram or on Vine who are following BuzzFeed.  Or they're going on Snapchat Discover or they're going through BuzzFeed's, you know, native app.  What we're seeing is this idea that BuzzFeed is saying, which is just why do we need to have a site for all of this?  How can we integrate it more?  And I think, you know, that we're seeing it, you know, in a real way being played out, you know, by another media company.  And that would be Business Insider.  They have their insider, INSS insider that's different from Business Insider.  It's different from TechInsider.io.  Yes, we have Insider, which is it doesn't have a website at all.  It doesn't have.  It's really hard to search for because you just want to.  How do you search for it?  But it's just there.  You know, it's one of those things.  Because nobody is supposed to go to it.  Yeah, it's just called Insider.  The Insider.  I think that might be right.  No, that's not it.  That's wrong.  That's another insider.  So what you're seeing is that they have this thing is called Insider and they have, you know, Instagram and they have other methods that they're that they're delivering news.  You can't find it.  I know.  But part of it is that they're then.  Well, that has to do with the fact that Google doesn't allow, you know, Facebook or Twitter searches.  But the idea is that you're going to come across this stuff natively and you're not going to want to spend a lot of time bouncing around a website.  You're going to want to consume that video or that news into.  Oh, here we go.  Tech Insider dot io slash latest tech insider chat.

L.Y.N.D.A. Linda dot com slash twit two.  I did not watch the 11 hour marathon of Hillary Clinton testifying before Congress in the Benghazi investigation.  But I did think what was interesting is Matt Bors article about it on medium.  Of course, he's pointing out now that apparently Clinton has become a master of the GIF, the animated GIF.  And it does seem to be there are a few moments in the testimony where she was clearly aware that she was creating a moment that would be spread virally.  You know, it's not just Jonah Paredi who's figured out that the best way to get attention is to go viral.  I think Donald Trump's figured that out.  She is the cross platform candidate.  She is the look at this, brushing it off.  You don't think that that was unconscious.  That was very clearly conscious.  This that's made for a GIF.  So I think what he's pointing out in his article is, by the way, here are some of the headlines.  Eight times Hillary Clinton didn't care in GIFs.  Hillary's testimony before the Benghazi committee in GIFs.  This is the greatest Hillary Clinton Benghazi reaction GIF ever image.  He says GIFs matter at a fast traveling GIF bite will prove devastating for candidates unable to preemptively supply the public with GIFable reactions and gestures to fit the campaign's narrative.  Is this is this?  This is the election we're heading into, folks.  Nixon sweating Bush checking his watch to caucus in a tank.  This election will produce GIFs that will negatively shape the perception of candidates until the day they leave the earth.  I love this.  He says candidates need to sit down and address their GIF plan.

Now they have to pay for the play and they're losing money like crazy.  Investors are turning away.  But see, it's not just Pandora.

Start time: 8523.00
End time: 8580.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's really interesting.  This comes from MIT's Technology Review.  And it says if you're going to do autonomous vehicles, you've got to solve a really challenging  ethical dilemma.  What do you do when you have to make the decision between, say, for instance, killing your occupants,  your owners, or plowing into a crowd?  How should the car be programmed to act in the event of an unavoidable accident?  Should it minimize the loss of life?  Even if it means sacrificing the occupants or as I would like it to do, should it protect  the occupants at all costs?  And how does it do this?  And I think this is actually going to be one of the more intractable problems that have  to be solved before we have self-driving cars.  Or maybe the companies will just ignore it and let the computer just algorithmically.

Start time: 8580.18
End time: 8588.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but you can't.  You can't ignore it.  You have to make, you know, to write the algorithm that's going to decide.  Do you?

Start time: 8589.12
End time: 8600.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's something that...  No, I got another idea.  What if you just, okay, you write the algorithms.  What are you doing with that?  You're saying avoid an accident.  Period.  Just avoid an accident.  You don't even address the unavoidable accident.  You say avoid an accident at all costs.
