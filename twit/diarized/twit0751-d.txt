Well, it's that time of year again, the final episode of 2019 as we head into 2020.  We'll be back on January 5th.  Our first episode of the new year will be all new.  Should be exciting because right after that episode, I'll be flying down to Las Vegas for a whole week of CES.  I haven't gone to CES in years.  That'll be interesting and I hope you'll watch our special CES coverage.  It'll be Aunt and Leo's excellent CES adventure.  We're going to go booth to booth and talk about a whole bunch of new products.  We've got Samable Samad.  He's going to be our car guy.  We have Stacey Higginbotham on IoT.  Dick DiBartolo with the junk in the basement of the sands and Scott Wilkinson on home theater.  So we've got a lot of material from CES.  That'll be coming up in about two weeks, all week long, January 6th, through our wrap up on January 10th.  But we're still in 2019 and we've got some wild stories from that year, including, you know,  this didn't get a lot of attention, but I still think it's pretty important.  A big win for the public domain.  So as of a couple of days ago, a number of works from, everything from 1923 became public domain.

Transcript:  Oh my gosh, what falls inside that?  I'm sorry, 1922, yeah.  The great guy, Steamboat Willie would be included.

Start time: 176.62
End time: 197.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, Steamboat Willie's 1924, so this is what will be interesting to watch.  There is no Sonny Bono anymore to get the copyright extension law.  That's what happened last time.  There will only be one Sonny Bono.  It's the first time in 21 years.  Sonny Bono Memorial Ski Run.  In 21 years, the first time that anything's gone into the public domain.  In two, more than two decades.  That's how significant this is.

Start time: 197.96
End time: 213.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  See, I'm with Alex on this, because if you create something, fine.  But give it 25 years and then it goes public domain.  Some of the arguments they're putting forward for 80 years, public domain,  or not even maintaining the copyright after the author's dead.  That's ridiculous.

Transcript:  Whoa, that's going to lead to an awful lot of good films.

Start time: 240.52
End time: 276.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, this is the interesting thing.  Of course, Disney based their entire work on other people's work.  Even, by the way, I should point out Steamboat Willie was stolen.  Grimm's Fairytales, public domain.  They were able to make Cinderella and Snow White.  But then they pulled the ladder up behind them, made it copyright.  Exactly.  And every time this has come up, they've got Congress to extend it.  The last one was Sonny Bono's Copyright Term Extension Act in 1999.  That added 20 years, keeping everything locked up until January 1st.  1923 works are now coming into public domain.  I'm probably in the minority.

Start time: 277.04

Start time: 289.96
End time: 301.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I have to correct myself.  Sonny Bono was already dead when the Copyright Extension Term was passed.  He died in 1998.  So Congress to honor him.  What an honor, too.  Honoring your wife's pizza.

Start time: 303.74
End time: 351.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It was a different time back in the 20th century.  So this is interesting.  Apparently, you can take some credit for this.  The internet takes some credit for this.  The Motion Picture Association of America,  the Recording Industry Association of America, the Authors Guild,  all of whom have been ones to lobby for the extension in the past, gave up.  It's not something we're pursuing, said the RIAA, because there's now a well-organized  grassroots lobby against copyright extension.  There are large business interests, Google, now on the anti-expansion side.  Also a wide popular movement they can tie it into.  The internet, internet activism.  The Netroots.  Netroots.  I think that's a good thing.

Start time: 351.62
End time: 370.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is why sites like Tech Dirt, they really keep tabs on this stuff.  Thank you, Mike Maznik.  I really appreciate the work you do there.  Super important acts of journalism that do lead to change in how we think about things.  Because the RIAA is not notorious for its cuddliness,  its politeness, its willingness to give away profits.  We're going to get some of our stuff back into our own culture that we made  and should be tied to commercial demands.

Start time: 371.10
End time: 391.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  It was interesting, the Motion Picture Association of America already did it,  back down on this, and they were just like,  This is crazy.  It's costing us too much.  It's costing them an awful lot in terms of legal fees and false positives.  When the RIAA did that big anti-piracy campaign,  started suing people for downloading, they lost a ton of money on that.  The only people that got rich on that were lawyers.

Transcript:  He Jiang Kui did in fact, China has confirmed,  use CRISPR to gene edit babies.  Those babies were born.  China says he forged ethical review papers,  recruited eight couples to participate in his experiment,  resulting in two pregnancies.  One of the mothers gave birth to twins nicknamed Lulu and Nana.  These are the first, as far as we know, humans born with their genes CRISPR edited.  He had removed a gene that supposedly would give these children  better resistance to HIV and other diseases, smallpox, I think.  But the problem with CRISPR gene editing is the side effects are unknown.  While people have done this in the lab to rats and other things,  it's the first time we know of that.  This was a big story when we talked about this.  It was unclear whether it really happened,  but now that we know it's really happened, I think this is a watershed moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  CRISPR is likely to be one of the biggest breakthrough technologies of this century.  When we get to the end of the century and we look back,  it is likely to be one of the big ones.  Moving too fast in this area is fraught with all kinds of risks and dangers that  it just doesn't feel like we should be moving that quickly.  There should be a lot more research.  There should be a lot more things done in labs before we put this in human beings.  That's the scary part.  That's why I think the scientific world is really cringing and has been cringing about this  and why they haven't supported, obviously, the work behind it.

Start time: 499.14
End time: 507.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Every nation has laws against this.  Everybody agrees this is not the time to start doing this,  although once the genie is out of the bottle…

Start time: 508.76
End time: 550.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, don't you think, not to be too cynical about it, but part of it is some of the articles  that I read, people are suggesting that this guy did this on his own, was going to promote himself.  Not to be overly cynical, but if China was the first to make some sort of CRISPR breakthrough,  I feel like they would have gotten behind it and looked at how Chinese technology and medicine…  I'm wondering if the problem here is that this guy was a lone wolf that was trying to be a little  too promotional because if he wasn't and there was real legitimate breakthroughs,  I don't feel like China would be throwing him under the bus like this.

Start time: 555.58
End time: 584.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I think there's two things here that we aren't considering.  One is that the current research indicates that the use of the CRISPR technology is actually  incredibly damaging to the genes themselves. Not only are you using CRISPR to target specific genes,  what's coming out is the evidence is that CRISPR is actually damaging entire gene structures.  You may actually be causing more genetic defects than you're actually fixing.  This is the reverse side of a breakthrough. The reality starts to set in that there might be some

Start time: 584.92
End time: 603.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  downsides. The children are not being identified by the Chinese government, but the Chinese government  says we are going to monitor them because there is some concern about their long-term health.  Remember when Dolly the sheep was the first cloned animal, these cloned sheep died very quickly  because it turned out not only were they cloning the sheep, they were cloning their biological clock.

Start time: 606.42
End time: 634.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  The senescence was actually cloned at the same time. I think the challenge here with  the CRISPR stuff is they're actually attacking the germline. What that means is if those children  have genetic defects, they'll carry through into the children of those babies. They replicate down  through the years. We don't want a situation perhaps where uncontrolled use of CRISPR that  is actually damaging to the germline then gets fed into the gene pool.

Transcript:  FACE RECOGNITION UNDER THE GUN  San Francisco has now passed a city ordinance banning  face recognition tech. On Tuesday, the board of supervisors passed the Stop Secret Surveillance  Ordinance. I love living in the Bay Area. I actually am thrilled about this because as we know,  here's what supervisor Aaron Peskin said, the sponsor. I want to be clear, this is not an  anti-technology policy. It's an accountability measure to ensure safe and responsible use of  surveillance tech. It passed by 8 to 1. Clearly, we're starting to see the flaws in face recognition.  I'll give you a really great example from Vice this week. When the police department interviews  you and says, well, the guy who did it, what did he look like? If you say, well, kind of looked like  Woody Harrelson, they'll take a picture of Woody Harrelson and feed it to the face recognition  technology. Law enforcement, this is a great piece of advice, is identifying suspects based on all  manner of probe photos, photos of unknown individuals submitted for search against a police or driver's  license database, including celebrities. Harrelson's photo in this case returns.  A guy was caught on camera stealing beer from a CVS in New York City. The surveillance footage  was so low quality, they didn't get any suspects. No hits on the NYPD face recognition system.  So the detective swapped in Woody Harrelson saying, well, he looks kind of like Woody.  And yes, they got a lot of hits, including the guy who did it. Now you tell me,  if I'm Woody Harrelson, I'm going to be a little insulted. He looks more like Colonel Sanders

Start time: 764.54

Start time: 771.36
End time: 791.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The NYPD also fit an image of an unnamed New York Knicks player to find a Brooklyn man wanted for  assault. I think this is not ideal. Can we say? And so I kind of think that maybe San Francisco

Transcript:  and sunglasses. I mentioned this before, our founding engineer, Colleen, who now works for  Facebook, right? She went to the dark side. Had a plan to build an LED collar with infrared LEDs  that were so bright they would blind cameras. So you just look like a glowing ball on camera.

Start time: 822.66
End time: 848.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See if Carson can look this up real quick, but there's a shirt that had a t-shirt that's being  sold. That'll trick him. Yeah, you maybe talked about it. No, no, but I remember reading it.  Yeah. So it's got some sort of a graphic on it that will fool the cameras to be like,  well, this is not a person. Forget about the, this is not going to solve the facial recognition  thing. But yeah, there's a shirt out there to, if in a crowd and a protest in theory.

Start time: 848.64
End time: 854.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's the Hyperface Anti-Paparazzi collection. Actually, that's different. This is glowing.

Start time: 854.24
End time: 863.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  Yeah. Cause that's for the, that's only if it flashes. Yeah. That's for the flash of the cameras  and then it, it, it, it's reflective. So it reflects back. Sounds like a brilliant idea.

Start time: 863.76
End time: 883.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's a great idea. This is Hyperface, which apparently if you wear this and on a t-shirt,  this, this, this image, the, you don't have to wear it on your face. You wear it on a t-shirt  and the cameras go, but on the other hand, this is being designed by an artist. So I'm nervous

Start time: 883.68
End time: 894.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  about the whole thing. Yeah. And how many software updates until the cameras just get smart enough  to get around that? I mean, yeah, it's immediately been borked. Still. I like the idea. The other

Start time: 894.78
End time: 904.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  problem is if you're a person of color, if you're African-American, there's a much higher incidence  of false positives, mostly because this stuff's trained on white folk. So that's not, that's not

Start time: 904.96
End time: 920.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  a good thing. And also if correct me if I'm wrong, but all this law said was that the city cannot use  this technology. There's no, this doesn't say that any grocery store or private home or whatever

Start time: 920.58
End time: 925.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  cannot use this technology. Yeah. I don't think they can even stop you, right? I guess they could.

Start time: 927.12
End time: 932.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, in theory you could say something stops at the borders of our municipality, but

Start time: 932.22
End time: 990.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  that's hard to do. Yeah. No, the ordinance, uh, it says that city departments have to seek specific  approval before acquiring any new surveillance equipment and private companies are not affected.  Although if you wanted to sell tech to the city government of this kind, you would be, but, but  not if you're a CVS store that wants to have it in there. Actually, you know, there's some very  beneficial uses of face recognition. Uh, who was the artist who had a problem with stalkers and she  used face recognition to, who was it? Richard. Huh? It was Tay-Tay. Tay-Tay, Taylor Swift. That's  right. And so they used face recognition at the concert entrances to look for bad guys. We know  other stadium have used it to ban people who are known disruptors or problems. On the other hand,  if you get a false positive and you can't go to the Tay-Tay show, that sucks. The classic positive

Transcript:  Right. Yeah. Yeah. I saw a demo at a Qualcomm's AI day a few weeks back where they were, you know,  showing you an interpreted form of what the AI sees when the camera looks at you and say a retail  storefront situation. And I've, you know, it's meant to do the catch shoplifters thing, but in the demo  was calibrated to detect whether, you know, to try and guess your apparent gender, you know,  and also your age. So I spent, I wasted probably 35 minutes trying to train various pouts and smiles  to get it to go from adult person to young person. And did it. And I was able to fool. Yeah. I fooled  it about three or four times. Right now I'm trying to guess how old you are. I can't figure it out.

Somebody in the chat room saying it wasn't so long ago,  a Google AI thought a turtle was a gun.  Right. So, and honestly, let's think about this use case in Disneyland.  So what is it doing? Looking at everybody at Disneyland to see if they're the lost kid?

Start time: 1061.48
End time: 1069.56

Transcript:  I, I'm ashamed to admit I'm a terrible parent. I lost my daughter at Legoland,  but I got somebody who's better and she graduated from college. So I feel like it was,  it was truly terrifying. I was there with my son and daughter. Thank God. My wife wasn't there  at the time. She would, she would have killed me. She never, she's hearing about it for the first  time now. And, and I'm with Henry and where's Abby? Where's Abby? And we, you know, I went  immediately like to the entrance to block whoever stole her from getting out, which was stupid,  but she found us and she was not happy. She said I was shopping. She was like,  I was in the store looking at Lego. Ever since San Francisco banned face recognition,  more and more cities are doing it. I think even states are thinking about it. This definitely is  a trend and we'll keep watching that in 2020. Our best of show brought to you today by Health IQ,  a life insurance agency for people who are healthy, healthy like you. Are you paying attention to your  diet? Are you exercising four or more times a week? Do you make sure you get at least eight  hours of sleep on average? You're going to live longer. You're going to live longer. You still  need to protect your family in case something happens. The problem is that for most life  insurance companies, you're just a number and they don't take into account your healthier lifestyle.  That's why you need Health IQ. They use science and data to get lower life insurance rates for  people like you, health conscious people. In fact, you can get as much as a million dollars  in life insurance for $36 a month. The health conscious folks like you and me have overpaid  and subsidized basically the less healthy people in our society. It's not a conspiracy.  That's just how statistics work, how life insurance works. You might be healthy, but your health  insurance company doesn't really know that. You're just a number to them. Enter Health IQ. Basically,  your life insurance concierge. They're going to actually represent you with one of the top  30 life insurance companies. They work with 30 of them and get your policy, a really good policy  for a much lower cost. I'll give you an example. Our friend, Ant Pruitt, is a weightlifter. His  body mass index is very high because it's all muscle, but BMI doesn't take that into account.  That number to a life insurance company looks bad. They might say,  oh, you're overweight, Ant. We can't give you good insurance. That's why Ant goes to Health IQ,  takes the Health IQ quiz. It's a scientific way to assess your own health literacy. Not a self  assessment, but a knowledge assessment. They actually put this together with some of the best  medical health and fitness experts in the country. It's a really cutting edge analysis.  Now, when Ant goes there, takes it, depending on his score, as well as other related qualifying  factors, he and you can save up to 41% on your life insurance premiums compared to other providers.  That's because Health IQ goes to bat for you. They'll say, look, Ant's BMI is high, but his  body fat is practically zero because he's a weightlifter. They know how to talk the talk to  the best insurance companies to give you lower rates. There's no commitment. You're going to  learn even more about potential opportunities to be rewarded because of your commitment to living  healthy. You're going to get the best possible rate. I think that's a fantastic thing. Let's  all start doing it by going to healthiq.com slash twit and taking their proprietary exclusive Health  IQ quiz today. It's actually kind of fun. I love doing it. healthiq.com slash twit. Then once you  complete the quiz, their team will call you. You'll talk to your life insurance concierge.  They'll walk you through the process and then they go to bat for you. You really can get a  better rate. You're crazy to pay more than you ought to, but you've got to use Health IQ.  healthiq.com slash twit. Let them get a better rate for you. No cost to you. In fact, it'll save  you money. healthiq.com slash twit. Thank you. Health IQ for making our best ofs possible on  with the show and speaking of life insurance, I hope they had some for grumpy cat.

He likes to do that.  And I don't know why it's a national emergency, but suddenly it is prohibiting U.S. companies from  using telecom services that are solely owned, controlled, or directed by a foreign adversary,  which includes Huawei. Huawei's been in the spotlight since 2012, I think,  when the Department of Commerce said, be careful with Huawei, ZTE, and Xiaomi.  They're all Chinese companies. People have pointed to the ownership of Huawei. It seems  no one can really be sure who owns it. Huawei says, we're owned by our employees,  but without much proof.

Transcript:  Well, also in Huawei's case, the founder was in the People's Liberation Army. So the  implication is that he still has ties to the PLA. And I think also that's part of the story too.  So, okay, go ahead and finish the intro and then I'll jump in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, no, no. I think that's enough. I think people have been talking about this for a while.  My position on this is I'm a little on the fence because it does seem like it's part of a political,  part of the Chinese tariffs, kind of the political tenor. And we've never seen evidence that Huawei  is doing anything. Huawei says, we've never done anything. Show us the proof.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's exactly what I was going to say. So, you mentioned that we're doing the weekend  episodes now. And so last weekend I had Dexter Tillian on who's a telecoms analyst,  I think in London, because I've been reading these headlines. I'm like, so what is this Huawei? I'd  never heard of them. And now all of a sudden, there's that huge trade war that they're at the  center of. And the three things that I learned were, A, like you just said, one of the reasons  that other countries are not willing to ban Huawei is because, and even the British and the  Germans have said this apparently straight up, like if there is intelligence that Huawei is spying  and is too close to the Chinese government, the United States government has not shown us that.  Maybe we'd be willing to get on board with this banning, but we haven't seen the proof.  And again, I'm not an expert in this and Dexter is more than I am. And he said, yes, as far as I know,  there is no smoking gun. Now that doesn't mean if there was some sort of a conflict or a war,  maybe China wouldn't lean on Huawei and be like, maybe shut this or that down.  But then the US has been able to do that for years. So is part of this just somebody else can do  the thing that was implicit that we could always do? But the two things aside from that,  that there's no actual proof that anyone seems to know of, that there are these close  connections. The second thing was, is how come they're the only ones basically that can do 5G?  And they're not. There's also- Ericsson does it, Nokia does it, Samsung does it.

Start time: 1750.82
End time: 1753.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But the problem is- Number one is Huawei by far.

Start time: 1755.02
End time: 1820.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're number one, they have the most 5G patents. And then what happened is over the last 10 years  or so, it's classic. They come in and they do it cheaper and better. So if you're Vietnam,  if you're India, if you're Argentina and you got to dial up a national 5G network, not only is the  company that will do it for you the best, Huawei, it's also the cheapest. So if the US leans on all  these other countries like they're trying to do to say, no, no, no, don't use them, it doesn't make  economic sense. And then the third thing was that, I said, well, how come they're the only ones left  standing? And Dexter said, well, it's like whatever became of Motorola, whatever became of  Lucent, Alcatel. He's like, yeah, it's just over the last 20 years, everything has shifted to where  while no one was paying attention, this Chinese company came up from below and can now do,  is the best at doing the technology that is, as everyone tells us, the key to the next generation

Start time: 1820.78
End time: 1878.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  of tech. I should also point out, this is going to be a big, on the other hand, segment, that  much of Huawei's 5G switching gear is software bound. And so when it was just hardware, you could  look at it and say, well, this is okay, it's not phoning home. But once it's software, there's,  and it's getting regular updates, anything could happen. And if you're a Chinese company, I wonder  how much freedom, even if you're not owned by the Chinese government, I wonder how much freedom you  have. If the Chinese government came to Huawei and said, okay, we'd like you to put this in your  firmware. Could they say no? But I noticed we don't say it's just Huawei, we don't say ZTE, we don't  say Xiaomi, we don't, I mean, OnePlus, OnePlus. And most of our gear is made in China. So I'm sure  Foxconn would have the same problem if the Chinese government said, hey,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  According to Dexter, it is the so the way that Huawei in the late 80s, early 90s,  I think that's the timeline, became got off the ground is their first contract was with the PLA.  So in the late 80s, early 90s, Liberation Army, yes. So when the Chinese army says we need our  own national network telecoms network for security purposes, it's Huawei that gets that contract and  delivers. And then there have been these whispers behind the scenes that why does Huawei have  apparently this access to unlimited capital in certain instances to win certain contracts.  And so people are assuming that then that's because why do you think it's so cheap?

Transcript:  Right, right. Right. Well, the other shoe dropped today because Google, according to Reuters,  this is not yet confirmed, at least not as of press time, as if we had presses as of press time.  But apparently Reuters says Google has suspended business with Huawei, will no longer update  Android phones made by Huawei. That's not a concern inside China, because of course, Google  doesn't do business in China. So those phones are not, you know, they're open source Android,  but they're not using Google Apps. And furthermore, Huawei phones will lose Google Apps,  Google services, including the Play Store and YouTube apps. That is a big penalty. And by the  way, the Huawei phones are beloved in the United States. You can't buy them, you know, from a phone  company. But but people like Paul Theron of Windows Weekly, he loves his Huawei. I was just going to

Transcript:  make that point. I mean, when when about a year and a half ago, when Huawei took the stage at CES,  was supposed to have this great AT&T deal to announce they didn't. And then Richard Yu, their  consumer business group executive sort of went off script and said, we think this is really bad  because US consumers don't have access to the best choice, which at the time was their Mate 10 Pro  they were announcing. They were pissed because basically it was the United States government

Start time: 2002.74

Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Transcript:  And AT&T exhibiting its its usual I forgot what the NSA memo said. It's unusual cooperativeness  for something was like, oh, yeah, okay, fine. But my thing is, at the time,  them to be cooperative. Yeah. Well, at the time, I was like, well, the Mate 10 Pro is fine. But I  don't think it's the big loss to US consumers that Huawei said it was. And then what they did over  the next year was build two of the most impressive and innovative from a hardware standpoint,  smartphones I had ever used. And now, you know, I mean, it's a cameras from the cameras to the  reverse wireless charging that we saw Samsung do to the weird material finishes. They're wonderful  phones. And now to see to see this develop is really a shame because if it goes through, yeah,  you won't even they won't even work if you import them or they won't work. Well, you won't want an

I have a P 20,  which I guess I won't use anymore. Even more to the point, no more security updates. It means  you're really you know, this is not a phone to buy. We can't recommend this phone. But that's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  other point. The this this they actually haven't as far as I can tell, brought the full hammer  down yet where a US company cannot do business. Remember, they did that with ZT for a while  and then dialed it back. Was it CT? Anyway, forget about the software. Leo, like, like they won't be  able to manufacture their phones. And there's articles that have come out about, you know,  Huawei has been been stockpiling components and stuff like that. But if they can't do business  with US component providers, like they can't manufacture a modern smartphone. It's almost  it's almost the reverse of what we're saying. Like you can't do a 5G network without Huawei.

Transcript:  Huawei says in anticipation of this, they've been stockpiling American parts. But  others are unconvinced. The head of Huawei's high silicon chip division Friday,  shrugged off concerns about disruptions to supply saying it has long been preparing for this kind of  extreme scenario. They will aim to be technologically self reliant going on going forward. Industry  experts say that's going to be a stretch. It's hard to isn't that funny? You if you ask somebody,  what do you think the key components for the Huawei phone are? You would where do they come  from? You wouldn't say US but that's what's different about the world today. It isn't just  a Chinese phone. Nothing your car is not just a German car or or a Japanese car. It's a global  economy. A company you haven't heard of in a while a company that made its kind of famous debut  at South by some years ago, Foursquare. Ten years ago, actually. It's exactly 10. Yeah. Wow. Yeah.  It took Austin by storm. It's taking Austin by something a little less than a storm this time  with a new app called hyper trending. But you got an interview with Dennis Crowley and saw something  that I found bone chilling. But we'll let you talk about all of that. So yeah, it's I also hadn't

Start time: 2203.36

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  thought about Foursquare maybe in a decade since it was Foursquare's heyday. But yeah, you could be  forgiven for wondering whether Foursquare even still existed. But the Foursquare of today is this  location data giant rivaling the powers of Facebook and Google almost. Like you may not even think  that you're a Foursquare user if you've never used the app, but chances are that you are.  Foursquare's technology powers the geo filters in Snapchat, Tags, Weed, Twitter. It's in AccuWeather,  Uber, Apple News, Airbnb, WeChat, most Samsung phones, the photo, their photo app on Samsung.  And essentially, yeah, swarm all Foursquare's native apps. And I mean, as Foursquare's website  says, if it tells you where it's probably built on Foursquare and all of that amounts to that  Foursquare has the capability to track most people with smartphones, track their locations in real  time. And hyper trending, which is a feature for Foursquare's apps that they rolled out at  South by Southwest, it shows this live map of Austin that update that shows basically the  locations of all the phones, all the people with smartphones in Austin in real time. Albeit, it's  aggregated and anonymized a bit. So you just see like a big circle if there's a bunch of people at  one coffee shop versus a small circle, if there's only two or three. But it's a real time tracking  service that speaks to the amount of data that Foursquare is collecting. And when I went to go  meet with Crowley on Thursday, we were going to be talking about hyper trending, but he ended up  showing me this internal game kind of app that Foursquare had been developing just among its  coworkers. And it essentially is kind of like Candyland, but an app. And the, except for the  cards that you draw, you know, in Candyland, you get cards in order to like move along the little  row, the rainbow row, except for the cards in this app are based on real people's location data  and where they are really going. So he had pulled up his phone when we were meeting and it was like,  okay, well, the Candyland that he had was based on New York City. And so he's like, okay, well,  I need to move to the Manhattan bar square next. So if I go look at whoever is in like proximity to  my phone based on who Foursquare has data on, I can see that there's one person who spends a lot  of time at Midtown bars. So I'm going to add them to my team. And next time he, this person in the  real world goes to a Midtown bar and Foursquare tracks him all moving forward in the game, which  is just insane that this company has that sort of technology. I kind of blame myself because when

Transcript:  Foursquare launched 10 years ago, I jumped on it. I thought this is fun. And I would fight to be  mayor of twit with my wife or mayor of our local coffee shop. And then they pivoted to swarm,  which was basically the same thing. Foursquare became an app that would tell you about places,  but swarm was where you checked in. And I used that for a while. I think Lisa still does. I think  she's in a battle with one of our engineers to be mayor of the twit studios. But I stopped because  I thought, you know, you've got to be mayor. It was kind of silly, but I thought, well, I've stopped  so they don't know where I am anymore. I guess I was wrong. This, you mentioned that Crowley wasn't  sure if it was cool or creepy. Dennis, it's creepy. It's creepy. I'll read from your article. Downstairs  in the cafeteria, there are 40 people, Crowley says. He's looking at a coffee company, a real  cafe on the first floor of the building. They're in 40 people. These are people that are actually  there. We don't put their names. We just put their unique advertising ID. We turn that into a fake  name and a fake avatar, but it is their unique advertising ID. So basically the same. And also

Start time: 2465.92
End time: 2503.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  So I believe in Samsung, it is Foursquare powers the geo-tagging features. Whenever you take a photo  there, how it'll show you a little- Yeah, I understand that. It's going to,  but is it also coming out? Foursquare powers that. Yeah. Yeah. So it's a two-way street.  In order to do that, yeah. Every time your phone takes a photo and tries to geo-tag it, it sends out  signals. It uses Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPS, a couple different things, and then runs that by  Foursquare's whole list of locations. And then Foursquare is like, oh, he's at Twitch Studios.  But Foursquare also gets the data that you're at Twitch Studios. That's the part that's weird.

Transcript:  Verizon got in a little bit of heat because they were sending unique IDs from their Verizon phones.  They even got fined for that. Remember how much trouble Uber got in because they had a God mode  that did the same thing, but only with Uber? This is 10 times worse. And Uber, by the way,  is one of the apps that sends information back to Foursquare. Apple Maps, all the big privacy-focused

Start time: 2529.02
End time: 2549.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Apple sends it back. Airbnb, WeChat. Basically any app or thing that uses location services that  isn't connected directly to Facebook or Google is probably powered by Foursquare because they  have the most advanced, I guess, location technology when it comes to pinpointing where you are.

Start time: 2550.68
End time: 2585.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's the backend of location services for Foursquare, who just happens to be very popular  and so has location data on a lot of people in the same way that Facebook or Google, for example,  has a lot of data on a lot of people. The thing that they're showing now, the hyperlocal app or  mode or whatever they want to call it, is completely anonymized. If we want to believe them,  this is just an application of all the location data they already have and that many other people

Start time: 2585.90
End time: 2591.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  also have. This is real-time data, Patrick, not coming from the Foursquare Swarm app. This is

Start time: 2591.58
End time: 2596.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  coming from all those other apps. I understand. So it's the location services that are used by

Start time: 2597.06
End time: 2600.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  many different apps and devices. Google can do the same thing, right? Because they get that information.

Start time: 2600.92
End time: 2653.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Google does on the same way as basically. Yeah, that's my point. I think the difference is that  most people probably don't realize that when you're using Uber or, I don't know, TripAdvisor or  something or having AccuWeather alerts turned on the back of your phone, that you're one,  consenting to give your data to these apps but also consenting for it to be used in the future  to create some hyper-trending app. Or the thing that I find the most worrying is that  when I was speaking to Crowley, he was saying that hyper-trending, it's going to turn off after  South by Southwest. But the reason why they're demoing it there is for developers to be like,  oh, we could use it in this way or build this app off of it going forward. And so this same  information that you didn't really consent to be used in this way, even though I suppose you  technically did, could be used for any number of other apps. The thing that concerns me is-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Very quickly. I can't believe I'm going to defend this, but just to explain exactly what he's  trying to do with this long post, he's saying we can basically build a catalog of the popular  places in this city at South by Southwest. And we're doing it now, showing it. We think it's cool  or creepy. He acknowledges the creepy factor. And we're turning it off because we think there's  something interesting here. And we want people to start thinking about these things and to kind of  think about the uses and the guidelines and all of this. So the announcement here is the use of  location data that, sure, we might have not realized that they had so much of it, but we know Google  has a lot of it. We know Facebook has a lot of it. It's not that different. The big new thing here  is, I guess, two things. First, Foursquare also has a lot of location data like the others, and  they built this application with that hyper trending mode, which again is anonymized and only  shows the popular places in the city. So it's a way to see which locations and stores and  restaurants are popular in a way that you couldn't before. So I don't know that there's something,  I don't want to say new, but I don't know that it's that different from what Facebook or Google  can already do. I'm not sure why it's that creepy if I want to play a little bit of Devil's Advocate.

Start time: 2753.54
End time: 2820.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, here's the case on the other side. First of all, I think that they should release that  game to the public because I think that'd be a great consciousness raising exercise for people  to see that this is real people. This is what they know. Because right now people just don't get it.  The other point that I think is the bigger point is that the phone in your pocket,  we all have a phone on us right now, all of us, everyone in this building and everyone in the world.  And Google is tracking everywhere you go. Facebook is tracking everywhere you go.  The carrier is tracking and selling that information everywhere you go.  Many of the apps on your phone are doing it, most of them sending it to Foursquare. How secure is  that communications medium? The point is that it's not just somebody is tracking. Lots of people  are tracking you and we have no access or knowledge about how secure it is, how hackable it is,  whether the Chinese government is tracking, is tapping into this information,  whether it's being sold, whether it's not being sold. What I do know is that it's all for the  purpose of commerce and advertising and the advertising still sucks. I'll give you accurate

And it  would be such an eye opener. I think these companies know very, very well, and maybe Dens does,  maybe that's his reason for doing this, that there would be a hue and cry. Right now, nobody,  but the geeks at South By and the few people listening to the show know about it, and read  your Wired piece, but that's not the mass of general population. I think if the general  population, I think if Elizabeth Warren saw this, she'd flip her lid. And I could give you a,  I could give you a nightmare scenario, Patrick, that will that so it's anonymized, right? It's  just a ID. It's not. So I'm a, I'm a Russian spy, and I want to keep track of an NSA agent.  I just hang out until in a bar until that agent that I want to keep track of, because I have his  picture, shows up. And then I can start tracking his hyper trending presence on Foursquare. Maybe  it's not public. Maybe I have to buy the service. And I can pretty quickly triangulate, oh, that's  him. Once I've got his ID, I no longer have to surveil the guy. I know where he is at every moment  of every day. I know who his girlfriend is. I know when he's at the office. I mean, hyper trending

Transcript:  claim to make it, it can be de-anonymized. I do have to point out that both Apple and Google claim  they use a technique to deeply anonymize it, which is not to take the full trip, but a segment of the  trip. So they don't have a starting point and an ending point. They make some, I think better  efforts. And there are claims that you can supposedly mathematically prove that this stuff  is anonymous. It doesn't look like Foursquare is making any attempt to do that at all.

Of course, all those things happen all the  time. And it's just something that everybody needs to be much more aware of. And I think that  we need help from all quarters. We need phones that can turn off location by default quickly,  more conveniently, more transparently, and a whole bunch of other things. Because right now,  it's just getting to the point.

Transcript:  normal thing in the world. And I think at one point later in our conversation, I was like,  this is honestly very surprising to me. Because one, I mean, I'm a tech reporter. I follow these  faces pretty thoroughly and regularly. And it didn't seem obvious to me or my editor, even when  we were talking about this conversation to begin with, that this sort of granular level of data  was something that Foursquare had and was playing with on a regular basis. And I think he replied  something to the effect of, oh, yeah, this happens to us all the time. We don't realize how,  I guess, not callous or how blase we are towards things that anybody outside of our company would  be like, oh, my God, wow, you have this sort of information. I think he said that he often,  whenever he has conversations with his mom or sister or family members and mentions some of  the things that they do, he gets shocked back into, steps back into reality.

Transcript:  to this panel. Yeah. But I mean- But to what Mike was saying, how do we address this? You were saying  we need an easy way to manage location services. On the iPhone, at least, I'm guessing it's the same  case on Android phones. It's very easy to go in and disable location services as a whole,  or per application. Yeah, but the minute you open your map, it starts sending data back to Foursquare.  The minute you open- No, not if you disable it for the application.  Because it doesn't know where you are. Yes, exactly. So that's the point.

Even if you only send location when the app is running, which is probably the  right default setting for all of these, you're sending out enough information that it could be-  I think the real issue here is there are so many signals that somebody with the desire to combine  signals is going to get a very complete map. So really, the only way is just to not carry a smartphone.

I think that the idea of consent, like consent  in these cases, is an illusion when it's just a binary choice when it comes to our sort of  privacy settings. Whether it's if you get this feature or you get access to Facebook and the  things that you need to be a person in the world, unfortunately, nowadays, or you don't if you want  to not send all of your information out. And even in the cases of, okay, let's say you turn  off location services for one thing and you only use it for one second to order your Uber,  you're still sending out just more- when we think of location services, maybe we think of  you're sending out one signal, but no, your phone is sending out, here are the 10 Bluetooth signals  I'm picking up next to me. Here are all the Wi-Fi networks that I can read. They're using GPS, GSM,  and all of that's going to Foursquare or Google or whoever who is then going to check that against  their range of locations to be like, oh, Paris is at World Trade Center.

Transcript:  there. Just to flesh out what Patrick was saying, the situation with user control of location data  apps is getting better. And I know on Android, it's constantly saying, hey, this app is using  your location. Is that okay? And you can just write there. iOS does that, not Android. Android  does that too. So they both do it. They both made improvements. But the problem is that, like you  mentioned Uber, the way it really should work is at the point when you're ready to order an Uber,  you should have an explicit option to turn on location for Uber, the Uber app, and say, okay,  I'm going to turn this on until my car comes and then it goes off automatically or something like  that. That would be the user advocacy default. But it's actually the industry advocacy default,  which is that the Uber is tracking you all the time. And you have to actively say no.

That's the key. There you go. Bingo. And that it can't  be used for any other services or it can't be shared with advertisers. It can't be used to  be a hyper trending map.

Transcript:  to lose all of you. I used to use Foursquare all the time. In fact, for a long time, I was the mayor  of the Twitty site studios, but I gave it up when I learned what Foursquare was doing with that data.  Now that we're renaming it the Twit LastPass studios, I wonder if I can become mayor  all over again. Our show today, we'll get back to the show in just a bit. But first,  a word from LastPass. They have bought the studio naming rights. You'll start to see that  next year. I'm very excited about that. I've been using LastPass for 10 years long before they  became a sponsor. In fact, it's the other way around. They became a sponsor because,  frankly, I've been recommending LastPass for as long as I can remember. Remember, we even went  to Steve Gibson and said, Steve, check this out. And Steve went to Joe Segrist, the guy who created  LastPass. Joe showed him all the software, all the things that LastPass does to make sure your  passwords are safe. And Steve gave it a thumbs up. He uses LastPass. In that intervening years,  I started using LastPass Enterprise here at Twit. And in your business, it's so important.  The reason we started using LastPass Enterprise at Twit is because we realized that this is a weak  point in our security. Our staff has the passwords to the keys to the kingdom. The bank accounts,  the websites, the databases, everything, your data too. And we got to secure that, right?  So we use LastPass. That way, employees can access these resources, but they don't get the passwords.  They don't get to share the passwords. And we know people share passwords or worse,  write the passwords on a post note, stick it to their monitor. That's not good. That's not secure.  With LastPass Enterprise, it's convenient for employees. They can easily log into the  resources they need to access. We control that access. We can see what they're doing at all times.  The IT department loves it. And they never get the passwords, so they never can share it. We can  revoke access at any time. When a new employee comes in, it's very easy to add them, to onboard  them into our LastPass database. LastPass is also doing something I think really remarkable,  something almost, I thought, impossible in security. They're making your company more secure  and more convenient for your employees. Usually that's one or the other, but in this case,  they're doing both with things like single sign-on. Your employees can use their phone to log into the  resources they need. Much easier than a password. Multi-factor authentication that goes beyond  two-factor authentication. It uses geolocation, IP address, a bunch of factors to verify, yeah,  this person is who they say they are. And yes, they have the right to access this database or  this login. That's really important for security, but it also helps make it easier for the employees  to use. LastPass, of course, is also the best password vault. Generates long, strong passwords  and keeps track of them. In a secure vault that can only be decrypted on device. That means no one  else has access to it. It's so safe. We put everything in there. Not just passwords, but  Wi-Fi logins, software licenses, employee IDs. Everything is stored in this secure vault. At home,  I use LastPass families and we put our passports in there when we travel so that it's mine. No one  else can see it, but if I need a copy of the passport, I've got it right at my fingertips.  Same thing with social security numbers, driver's license. All the things you want to keep secure,  you keep in your LastPass vault. It is the most secure place on your device and every device, too.  Mac, Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, every browser under the sun. LastPass is the first thing I  install when I get a new device. For home, it's LastPass families. For individuals, LastPass premium.  And don't forget LastPass Enterprise. Their expanded business lineup has features that  will improve security across your company, give you and your IT department a much better window  into what's going on and make it easier for your users. It's amazing. LastPass.com slash twit.  Find out how they can help you. LastPass.com slash twit. And LastPass, I gotta thank you for  making our life easier and more secure and for supporting our best of episodes. Thank you,  LastPass. And now back to twit. Let's see, we just talked about a four square. You know, people,  I get a lot of email from people saying, I don't want you to talk about politics on twit,  but really twit is more than just a gadget show. When politics and tech intersect, we need to talk  about it. And here's a perfect example. One of the Democratic candidates for president this year  wants to break up Google, Facebook, even Apple. Elizabeth Warren, one of the front runners,  certainly she has the name recognition, wrote a post on Medium. Well, it says Team Warren,  but it's by Elizabeth Warren. Here's how we can break up big tech. 25 years ago, Facebook,  Google and Amazon didn't exist. Now they're among the most valuable and well-known companies in the  world. It's a great story, but also one that highlights why the government must break up  monopolies and promote competitive markets. Aren't we glad, she writes, that we now have  the option of using Google instead of being stuck with Bing? Yes. But today's big tech companies have  too much power, too much power over our economy, our society, our democracy, and then the price  process. And I think this is maybe her most important point. They've hurt small businesses  and stifled innovation. So she says her administration will make big structural  changes to the tech sector to promote competition, including breaking up Amazon, Facebook and Google.  And in a conversation with Neelai Patel later this week, she said, and I'm going to put Apple in there  as well. You can read the arguments. I think a lot of people will have a visceral reaction to this.  I underlined an important part of this, as did John Patel. These companies would be prohibited  from owning, and this is something I've actually always complained about with Google, owning both  the platform utility and any participants on that platform. It's always bothered me that YouTube was  owned by Google and that YouTube results always showed up very high. There's even a bar of YouTube  results on Google searches. Platform utilities, she writes, would be required to meet a standard of  fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory dealing with users. That's Frand. That's a little different.  That's a patent dogma. Platform utilities would not be allowed to transfer a shared data with  third parties. I like that. So let's start with you, Paris. Regardless of your political bent,

Start time: 3811.78
End time: 3947.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  is this viable? Is this doable? I think that this is viable and I think it's incredibly necessary,  especially I think for coming from a platform and e-commerce perspective. I mean, sure,  people think about Amazon as an e-commerce company and really Amazon is so much more than that. I  don't think most people realize the breadth of Amazon as a company and the things that it touches,  but I suppose if we're going to just look from the e-commerce niche, Amazon's a great example of why  this is necessary and the fact that if you go search something on Amazon and probably something  in the first three results, top results is going to be a product from Amazon, either an Amazon basics.  Like let's say we search for charging cables for your iPhone, you're probably going to have  an Amazon basics cable pop up or if not that Amazon has hundreds of private label brands,  something that doesn't seem like it's being sold by Amazon, but is manufactured,  shipped and fulfilled by Amazon. How the company does this is since it owns the platform,  it realizes, hey, a lot of people are looking for iPhone chargers or dog hats or whatever.  We don't sell dog hats. We're going to make an Amazon label dog hats so that we get both  the, in addition to the commission we'd normally make off a third party dog hat being bought,  we get the entire price of it. We get the entire revenue from that.  And Amazon has the power to direct consumers towards its goods and to sync its competitors  down in the search page to page two, which means no one will see it, much less if it was at page  15. And this sort of power is something that has serious consequences for small businesses  and innovators because why would you, if you're an entrepreneur or a small business, why would you  invest resources into trying to figure out the next hot product that people are going to be  buying online? Because you're going to have to go through Amazon and the minute your product ends up  succeeding, Amazon is probably going to copy it and, or push, copy it and then push you back  to the second or third page or push you down to search result five. And you won't be making any

Start time: 3962.14
End time: 4030.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  and then buys it. Right. And Amazon's done with those hundreds of companies. I recently,  me and my colleague, Luis Matsakis, at the end of last year, we tried to put together a list of all  the different companies that Amazon owned. And it was one of the hardest things that we've ever done  because it's absolutely unreal, the hundreds and hundreds of companies that are Amazon. And anytime  something comes up that is a competitor towards it, it purchases it. In India, in Saudi Arabia  and other places, Amazon has bought the Amazon equivalents. And most recently India passed  one of the strictest e-commerce regulations aimed at breaking up the monopolies of companies like  Amazon or Walmart when it comes to e-commerce. And even that has kind of only had mixed effects  on the company. It's required Amazon to reduce its stakes, how much it owns of these third-party  entities that it sells on its site. But still Amazon has so much market share that it's able  to kind of get around even some of the strictest regulations. So it's kind of a-

Transcript:  Right. And the algorithmic, Leo downplayed what they did. Undercut pricing sounds like,  oh, they have competitive pricing. That's a good thing. No, they were using really sophisticated  algorithms to in real time undercut the price of literally every product on diaper.com to always  be lower no matter what, no matter how much money. They don't care about losing money. They're making  money in other places. And it's like, literally they could just drive any company out of business.  It's almost classic monopoly use of monopoly power.  But on steroids, because it's all algorithmic and now they have AI that-

Transcript:  She says we would spin off Amazon's marketplace, Google's ad exchange, Google search. They would  be called platform utilities, Amazon marketplace and basics. Google's ad exchange and businesses  and the exchange would be split apart. Google search would have to be spun off. She would  split off Zappos and Whole Foods from Amazon. She would unwind the Facebook acquisition of  WhatsApp and Instagram. She would take away Google's Waze, Nest and DoubleClick, which is  their ad platform. She says unwinding these mergers will promote healthy competition in the market,  will put pressure on big tech companies to be more responsive to user concerns about privacy.  I have to say my first reaction was, oh hell no, because it feels like you're- I think we have this  in this country sometimes, you're punishing them for being too successful saying is that what went  wrong? The tree got too big? But I have to say the arguments you just gave Paris are a really  perfect example of why it's not good for society if a company owns too much and gets too big.

Start time: 4137.82
End time: 4203.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it's worse than that because as Paris was alluding, the problem is that our laws are based  on a world where, okay so there's a company and you buy products from them and if they get too big  and then you can break them up and then you know it's a one-to-one relationship between the customer  and the company. In this case, there's no pressure that the public can put on Amazon when they don't  even know that the companies they're buying from are Amazon, when they don't understand that the  profits they make from AWS are enabling them to lose money on all kinds of markets until they crush  it, in which case at which point in time they raise prices. There was a study done where they did this  in certain narrow academic markets for books where they basically undercut these books and to the  publishers that they were competing with, to the point where the publishers went out of business  and as soon as the publishers went out of business they quadrupled their prices.  Perfect example.  Even if they don't do it, they have the power to do it and should they have the power to do it and

We must give people more control, this is what we were talking about earlier,  about how their personal information is collected, shared and sold and do it in a way that doesn't  lock in massive competitive advantages for the companies that already have a ton of our data.

I'm also very surprised that you all seem  to be in favor of it. That's another thing I wasn't expecting. But overall, I'm not sure  how doable it is, but I think it almost doesn't matter. The key takeaway I have from this is that  this is now in the conversation. This is a concern for the American public, for the American  political scene. Even if it doesn't happen, even if she doesn't become the Democratic  nominee, even if she does and she changes things when she actually gets into office,  it's kind of putting it in the public consciousness in a way that I think until  six months ago would have been unimaginable, maybe going back a year, and until she actually  put it in that media post, I don't think people would have thought it was possible.

A few years ago,  you couldn't even suggest something like this, but now everybody's taking it seriously. The  chances that Elizabeth Warren will become president in 2020, I don't know what the chances are,  but it almost doesn't matter because they're building a Democratic party platform.  It might end up on the platform. Does it help them or does it hurt them?

End time: 4424.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that's probably true. What Americans are not thinking a lot about, on the other hand,  just to play devil's advocacy, personally, I agree with Patrick in the sense that I don't care.  If they break up Facebook and Google and some of our beloved companies, Apple, etc.,  a lot of people's instinctive reactions say, I love the products, I love this company,  I don't want them to be harmed. But if there were three apples, that wouldn't be terrible,  and all the shareholders would now be the owners of three.  They actually could create more value.  Absolutely. Alphabet did it voluntarily, sort of. But the larger implication is that these companies  are global giants. I mean, Facebook, Google, Amazon's becoming a global giant. Apple is  obviously a global giant. Somebody's going to be a global giant. If we dismantle the American  global giants, then the Chinese global giants are going to become the new global giants.  We've got to think about whether we want that. I wish Europe would step up in terms of—there's  so much technology in Europe, but the funding and other cultural aspects of the startup culture  aren't happening. Where's the French Google? Where's the German Facebook?

Transcript:  We ask ourselves that question all the time. I have no idea what I'm talking about, but I think  there is a lot of market size that is problematic. In Europe, even though we try to create a single  market, and we have in many ways, the language barrier is one thing. Then even with the  harmonization of laws, there are still variations with different parts of the EU. In the U.S. and in  China, you can start your business and immediately have access to what is 250 million customers.  It's a little bit more complicated for us. So I think that plays into it. I also think as much as  it pains me to say it, our tax regiment, or however you want to call it, is maybe a little  bit less friendly to aggressive entrepreneurship. That's possible. But we have now lived in a world  where we have, as we call them in France, the GAFAM—so Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, and  Microsoft—are ruling the world. We know what it looks like. We know what the positive things are.  We know what the negative things are. I think it wouldn't necessarily be a horrible thing to try out,  try breaking them down and seeing what happens. Maybe it would open up. We were a little bit slow  in Europe and in other countries to get on the internet train, and maybe it was too late.

Transcript:  As you know, Baltimore for three weeks now has been shut down by ransomware. It's frozen. Thousands  of computers shut down. Email disrupted. Real estate sales. Water bills. Health alerts and  other services. Here's the bulletin they put on the city of Baltimore webpage.  The city of Baltimore is currently unable to send or receive email. If you need assistance, call us.  The ransom, $100,000. City officials to their credit refuse to pay it.  In a side note, I just read an article, I think it was on Motherboard, that  a lot of the companies that get hired to remediate ransomware, what do they do?  They pay the fine. They add 10, 20% for profit. Job done. So do not pay the Bitcoin ransomists.  Okay, I'm just saying. But here is what, this is the great writing, again, from the New York Times,  from Pearl Roth and Shane. Here's what frustrated city employees and residents do not know.  A key component of the malware that cyber criminals used in the attack was developed at  taxpayer expense, a short drive down the Baltimore-Washington Parkway at the National  Security Agency. This is- Woo, peace to evident. This is Eternal Blue. You remember this shadow  brokers leak of a bunch of NSA exploits some years ago. NSA never really explained how it  happened, although if you piece it together, it sounded like an NSA contractor decided to take  those files home with him. So not so he could steal them, but so he could work at home. He was  running a Kaspersky antivirus on his machine. One of the things Kaspersky does is quarantine  threats. Whether intentionally or not, Kaspersky recognized that the guy had a bunch of really good  hacks on his machine, so they quarantined him and sent him back to the home office, which happens to  be in Moscow. The Russian secret police apparently have people working at Kaspersky. It's unknown how  close Kaspersky is to the Russian secret police, but they certainly have access to those quarantine  files and the rest is history. The thing I said on the radio show today, and I wanted regular  people here, not geeks, is this is the problem. The NSA, the top spy agency in the United States,  the most security focused, these guys really know their stuff, couldn't keep this stuff  internal for long. And you want us to put back doors in all the encryption.  Thank you.  Right? Right. If you can't keep these secrets, are you going to keep the back door secret?

But their legal team has come forward and they've  had a lot to say about the NSA stockpiling zero day weapons and talking about how we need to have  a national ban on them doing that. Because what happens is these zero days are out there. It  prevents people from patching it. And rather than kind of using this for cyber warfare,  and being able to use it to get their own way, we should have them working proactively with  Microsoft, with other architecture to plug these holes and address it because it's exactly as you  said, it's just going to get weaponized against the American people.

Yeah. Eternal Blue was so valuable. Former NSA employees said that the agency never seriously  considered alerting Microsoft about the vulnerabilities and held onto it for more than five  years before the breach forced its hand. The breach was two years ago. So for seven years,  that SMB one flaws existed. Right. So, but, but Brianna, let me, let me please counter you though.  Clearly, you know, national warfare struggles, espionage is all going to become cyber based,  right? That's where we're headed. Right.

We do need to take this seriously, but in this particular case,  the NSA was unable to keep this safe. And I would invite you to- Well, they get to stay for five

And if you're working at the NSA, you don't take,  I'm pretty sure, I mean, I couldn't be wrong. Rules may have changed. I don't know anybody  at the NSA that well, but we spent, I got to spend a couple, like a day with the NSA. They have some  pretty, they're uptight people. They're really uptight.

Transcript:  until the government is not run by humans, I think we've got a problem. I feel like we're not going  to give up developing these tools, but I think there is an analog here and that is biologic  weapons. So there is also a lot of incentive for governments to create biological weapons,  but we have a con, I don't know if it's Geneva convention, but we have an agreement among  governments that they won't do it. And the reason is these pathogens that probably do exist in labs,  I'm thinking, should they get out would wipe out the population of the, of the country. So,  so there are restrictions on this kind of warfare. Maybe we need, is it even possible to get people  like Iran, Saudi Arabia, North Korea, China, Russia to agree to some sort of cyber moratorium?

Transcript:  I think if you're talking to people at the NSA, if you're talking to InfoSec experts, they are  talking about this. The United States cannot go it alone and solve these kinds of problems. If we're  talking about truly unilaterally disarming, if we did exactly. So we've got to do exactly what  you're talking about form, form alliances with other nations, form standards. Well, it's not great,  but we can change that. We can change that.

I don't know  if she, I think she totally gets it, but her priorities in terms of, you know, national security,  that's much more important to her than, than maybe not every bank account in the planet getting  hacked. I mean, it's, it's, you know, the priority, you talk to people at different levels of  government. I mean, one of the fun things about DEFCON is who you run into drunk at two in the  morning. Yeah. And people who are at the front lines have a very different perspective from  people at home. And if somebody spends their entire day going, yeah, well, we get, you know,  we get hit by this, we get hit by this, we get hit by this, we get hit by this. And people are  constantly, the whole cyber warfare thing, you know, there's little skirmishes going on all the  time. There's all sorts of mayhem going on.

Transcript:  Eternal Blue was first used by the North Koreans. They, they used it, uh, to bring down the British  hospital system, the national health system. Uh, that was the first use of it. Uh, they brought  down German railroads, 200 organizations, 200,000, I'm sorry, organizations around the world.  Russia used it with NotPetya. So North Korea had WannaCray, which used Eternal Blue. NotPetya  used Eternal Blue. It was aimed at Ukraine, but it ended up leaking out. FedEx cost them 400 million.  Merck cost them 670 million. So these companies could reasonably lobby and say, look, we've got  to do something. But I think you also have to convince these countries. And I think it's a case  of you have to say the damage, the collateral damage to your infre... Promise. How do you  convince North Korea? Yeah. Here's this, here's the Island, by the way. How have you ever been  to Plum Island, Patrick? Off Long Island Sound? No. Well, you can't go there. Good.  And, uh, it's, it's, uh, it's where DARPA runs war games for a massive cyber attack.  Oh my goodness. Yeah. It's, uh, it's owned by the department of Homeland Security.  Uh, major attractions are a defunct lighthouse and a center that studies infectious animal diseases.

So you can't really say to them,  oh, you got to watch out. Wanna cry could bite you too. No, it can't. Oh, so we just do an EMP  above the country. No, don't say that Patrick. People will think you're serious. Although that  also wouldn't affect them. It wouldn't affect them. They're the Battlestar freaking Galactica.  They're using phones with wires and dials. We'll talk about EMPs later. Will it break those too?  Does it break a fine Western electric phone made of hard rubber? That's a really good question. I  bet it doesn't. No neutron bomb will blast that out of the sky. So the Department of Homeland  Security last year issued a dire warning that state and local governments are getting hit by  a particularly destructive malware that is relying on Eternal Blue. Microsoft, this is the Microsoft  Center, the Eternal Blue Tracking Center. Notice they have one of those fine Surface Hub.

He walks through the sort of how towns and cities got to where they are with the ex-urban  production and then how big box stores are dying and this sort of endless series of rings.  I understand.

Transcript:  I mean, the answer is obviously there's not going to be any Leo. And this is why there's very  clearly a federal role to play in securing this. If the NSA is going to stockpile these weapons,  we need to have a process to be able to get emergency patches out. And that's why I do think  we need to be funding free and open source software for local city governments to use.

In an interview in March, Michael  Rogers, the Admiral who was in charge of the NSA during the leak, said this. Well, I don't think  he said well, but he's thinking it. If Toyota makes pickup trucks and someone takes a pickup truck and  welds an explosive device into the front and crashes it through a perimeter into a crowd of  people, is that Toyota's responsibility? The NSA wrote an exploit that was never designed to do  what was done. Yeah, no. Yeah, it was. It's exactly what it was designed to do. Yeah, I kind of think.  Microsoft's response, Tom Burt, corporate vice president of consumer trust, said you can't compare  cyberweapons to pickup trucks. Or the NSA to Toyota. Yeah. These exploits are developed and  kept secret by governments. This is exactly what you were saying, Brianna. For the express purpose  of using them as weapons or espionage tools, they're inherently dangerous. When someone takes  that, they're not strapping a bomb to it. It is already a bomb. Yeah, I was going to say this is

This time it's going to  be fine. I really think that that's how they, that's how they think. Right. Yeah. Yep. Ransomware  was a big story in 2019. No surprise there. I have a feeling it'll be a big story in 2020.  Two coming up a way to get fined billions of dollars and still make money. But first a word  from our sponsor, Mack Weldon. I love my Mack Weldon underwear. Actually Mack Weldon is more  than underwear. It's a men's premium essentials brand that believes in smart design, but  premium fabrics. No, this isn't my underwear. I've never worn this, but  as soon as this ad's done, I'm putting it on because Mack Weldon underwear is so comfy.  They make socks, underwear, shirts, undershirts, hoodies, sweatpants, and they don't only look and  feel good. They perform well because Mack Weldon believes in smart design, premium fabrics. They  make it easy to shop on Mack Weldon. These innovative fabrics they use are wonderful. For  instance, their silver line of underwear. They also have t-shirts. They're made with a natural  antimicrobial material that eliminates odor and keeps you feeling fresh and cool all day.  You'll find these are the most comfortable underwear you've ever worn. You'll love your  Mack Weldon. And by the way, Mack Weldon is great whether you're going out to the gym or if you're  going out on the job or on a date, just every day. It's a good fit. It's comfortable. You're  going to love it. Here's a beautiful silver jersey polo long sleeve. You know what I love about all  of Mack Weldon's silver line is you know how sometimes gym wear gets a little sour after a  while? Not with Mack Weldon, never. So you'll wear these for a long, long time. I've actually  thrown out gym clothes from other companies and replaced them with Mack Weldon. This is a beautiful  polo. Comfy, stylish, and it fits great and it keeps you smelling great. And by the way,  if you order some Mack Weldon and you don't like your first pair of underwear, keep it. They'll  refund it. They don't want it back. You get to keep it, but they'll still give you a refund. No  questions asked. So there's absolutely no risk when you go to MackWeldon.com and entering the  promo code TWIT. I'm in the process of replacing all my underwear, all my active wear, all my polo  shirts, all my sweatshirts with Mack Weldon. I love it. MackWeldon.com promo code TWIT. 20% off  your first order. Maybe you didn't get what you wanted for the holidays. Maybe it's time to gift  yourself a little Mack Weldon. MackWeldon.com. Use the promo code TWIT. 20% off your first order.  Now back to our best of show. By the way, thank you Mack Weldon for sponsoring the best of. I  appreciate it. That's really, that's really generous of you. We really appreciate that.  This was the year that Facebook got that big $5 billion fine. I think it's the largest fine in FTC  history, but you'll never believe what happened next. Watch. The largest fine in the history of  the FTC. $5 billion. That sounds like a lot of money, right? Sounds like a good Dr. Evil.  Except Facebook's stock price went up after the fine $6 billion. So Mark Zuckerberg is smiling  because he made money. He made money. I guess Facebook was smart. They had said in their  quarterly report that they expected this $5 billion fine. They budgeted it. They budgeted it.  And so they prepared the market, right? And then when the fine actually was $5 billion, as usual,  you sell on the rumor, you buy on the news or you buy on the news and you sell on the rumor. I can't  remember, but whatever it was good news. Everybody laments the political division of society,

I remember a couple of months ago, there were a couple of other figures that were being thrown  around and it seemed like they were potentially going to be hit with a lot more money, but it  really doesn't seem like this is going to have an impact on them at all.

Transcript:  want to fine them. Add a zero to the five. Make it $50 billion. Elizabeth Warren said Facebook made  $5 billion in profits in the first three months of the year. Actually, that's not true. I think it was  revenue, not profits. The company's too big to oversee and this drop in the bucket penalty  confirms that. It is true. I mean, look at anything with a B is a lot of money for any company,  but it isn't, you know, Facebook had $15 billion in revenue. Oh, I'm sorry. It is  $15 billion in revenue last quarter, $22 billion in profit. So it was one quarter profit.  You could see the stock jump there. Mike Isaac said the real story is that Facebook shares surged.  With that, fine. So clearly the market's saying, yeah, slap on the wrist.  You're not on Facebook. In fact, I used you as an example, Mike Elgin, because you have Mike's

Start time: 5884.40
End time: 5915.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  nice book. Yes. So what I did was last year I said I was getting off 4th of July and I spent the whole  all these months this year harassing and criticizing Facebook. Of course, they did no good at all  because they were censoring my posts clearly, but I replaced it with a Google folder I call my nice  book. And you can go and it's a public folder so anybody can follow it just as they would on  Facebook. Yes. So if you search for Mike Elgin nice book, you'll find links to it and I invite you  all.

Transcript:  Where do you put your dank memes? Can you put them up there too? You cannot. So each person's,  this is the beauty of it. This is how a social network should work. Only I can post in my nice  book and I can follow your nice book and then I see it in the stream. So if you're on Google  photos and you go to sharing, which nobody ever does, it's the, it's the, it's the tab on the  far right. You get all the stuff that's been shared with you, all the, you know, and it's,  it's kind of like a social network. So I think Google could turn it into a nice book. I follow

Start time: 5946.42
End time: 5957.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  your nice book. Yeah, there it is. There it is. Yeah. So I could make one of these, what, what,  if I wanted to make one, I would just set up a sharing and say it's public. Yes. And it's kind

Start time: 5957.44
End time: 5983.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  of, I believe that's the default actually that is public. And then you just share the link.  Okay. With family and friends by email, people can choose their own notifications. So some people  get it on their phone. Some people get an email. Some people don't get the notifications. They just  see it in Google photos when they go, but it's beautiful. These photos are full quality. If you  click on these photos, they're full quality, much better than Facebook, which squishes them.  And you can, you can add little, you know, comments. You can like things and it's an,

Well, exactly.  And some people, some, lots and lots of people say, I don't use the internet. I use Facebook.  Right. And, and so- It's AOL for the 21st century. And the scheme that Mark Zuckerberg is hatching  as we sit here is he's trying to turn it into WeChat. So in China, WeChat is everything. It's  an e-commerce platform. That's why Libra coin. That's why he's got a currency because he wants  this to be, everything goes through Facebook.

I mean, Facebook was used in terms of like finding college roommates,  freshman year, doing introductions and that's sort of pivoted onto Instagram, which is, you know,  again, still a Facebook property. So it seems like you're still sort of relying on this biggest  common denominator. Like there's this assumption that you have an account on at least one Facebook.

Transcript:  It's the, it is really the reason Facebook is an incumbent and it will be hard to unseat  so-called network effect. You have to be where everybody is. So I guess Apple had some sort of  shindig on Tuesday by innovation only. There were a few people who said, okay, if you're going to  have an invitation that says by innovation, you best innovate. Devendra. Now, first of all,  you probably already have an iPhone, but you can't say it because it's embargoed. I don't have it,  but I have touched them and they're very nice. Oh, you could say that about any old phone. Yes.  The iPhone 11, it was a weird, it was kind of a weird event for Apple. First of all, they had so  much to talk about that they had to jam it in. They didn't start with their traditional owed to  moneymaking and the stores, but they kicked, they kicked right into Apple arcade plus and then TV  plus. And then they went to the watch by the time they got to the iPhone, which I thought was going  to be the story of the hour. They only announced one, the iPhone 11. They said the most successful  iPhone this year was the iPhone 10R. Here's its successor, the iPhone 11 now with two lenses.  And I thought, well, this is interesting. The big, I think the big story there was the price,  which is 50 bucks less than the iPhone 10R at its launch 699. And then they said, oh, oh, and by the  way, there are some other iPhones, the iPhone pro iPhone 11 pro and the iPhone 11 flow max.  I mean, sorry, pro max. I say flow max because I can't remember the all the, all the, they all  have slow fees. There's a lot. They all have slow fees, slow mo selfies. Oh, so these, this is Apple  is now in a tick tock tock situation. Aren't they since the iPhone 6, they don't used to be  every other year would be an S and kind of the same form factor, but a little bit improved.  And then a big improvement in the next year, like the 10 was a big improvement, but the 10S  was a talk. And this is really a talk to the talk, isn't it?

Transcript:  I think it kind of that speaks to like how smartphone upgrade cycles are working now too,  like most people keep their phones two or three years. It kind of makes sense. There's no point  killing yourself to bring something new and groundbreaking out every two years when you can  kind of coast on how people actually buy these phones and take some more time with that hardware.  So yeah, I'm not surprised that this year's phones aren't too revolutionary. It is nice  having an extra lens across the line. The three lenses on the pros, that's going to be really  interesting. They really cleaned up the phone names too, cause the 10R and the 10S and those  were all really dumb and confusing. Especially cause it was a Roman numeral. So it looked like  exactly. It's just, it was a mess. So iPhone 11, nice and clean. iPhone 11 pro, just like  MacBook and MacBook pro. It's all good. And I think we're all expecting the big, big upgrade  to be next year's when we're going to see 5G most likely the 2020 iPhones. Yeah. But is there such

Transcript:  And I think the thing for me that makes it pro is like as someone who spends like literally all  day on your phone, cause I mean the light listening to podcasts or making software that's making  podcasts is like, I just need more battery life. And I think the fact that this year Apple finally  put more, more battery in the back of these things. You know, for me, like having that extra battery  life is what makes it pro. Actually, we don't even know if it's more battery. Yeah. You make a huge

We do know that  the new display they're saying, I think the new O-light is like 15% more efficient and the, the  new processor is likely more efficient too. So these, this is where the battery life is coming

They're getting much better battery life. So it's great.  It's on all three fronts. Apple, the new processor is the a 13 bionic. Is that right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Believe so. Yeah. Sorry. I think, I think that's the, that's the other annoying thing by the way,  with the pro designation. Last year, the 10 R and the tennis phones had the exact same processor.  And that was a big price difference. Now it's like an iPhone 11 basic and iPhone pro still with the  same processor. And that's, I, I dunno, I kind of wish there was a little more of a bump there,  just to really earn that pro title. Cause right now you have the extra camera, you have the OLED,  really nice refresh OLED screens and the kind of slick, not slick, but like the matte glass back  and the stainless steel construction. That's kind of all you're getting. That's surgical stainless

Transcript:  Yeah. I think for me, the most frustrating thing about the whole, um, you know, 11, 11, pro 11,  pero max is that as you can see here, they ship the case for your new phone, a whole week ahead  of the actual new, I hate that you get a box from AI and you go, Oh boy, it's here. Oh my word. It's  here. I opened the box and it's just a flipping case. You're like, well, you really, you really

That's what you're  paying for. But you know, it'll fit just right. So that's probably important. Um, okay. So the,  so the, this is a seven nanometer processor.

Transcript:  This week, Apple joined Amazon Netflix in the realm of being an entertainment provider on their  own with Apple original programming on the new Apple TV plus service, which debuted November 1st  free. If you bought a qualifying Apple hardware product in the last couple of months and for a  year and a 4 99 a month for everyone else launching. Okay. I'm going to say it. This is  whoever the marketing genius who came up with this one, they get a cookie. Uh, Apple is boasting that  this service is the world's first originals only streaming service. What that means is they didn't,  they didn't buy any catalog content. There's no back to rivet appear chase. There's no sitcoms  or no repeats or, or detective shows from the seventies or anything that you've seen before.  It's only a handful of shows that were made specifically for Apple TV plus. And there is  an argument to be made that with such a limited supply of programming, it's kind of hard for Apple  to make the case that this service is worth buying. Then again, if you bought any Apple hardware in  the last couple of months, guess what? You can get it for a year for free instead of having to pay  4 99 a month. So the service is out. The, the shows are out. Um, they're not doing a weekly  release or a binge drop. They're doing a hybrid where they've released, I think three episodes  of a lot of shows, some things they've dropped a whole season, but they are going to do weekly  releases of their, uh, top line shows from this point. So rather than doing the Netflix thing,  quite honestly, they don't have enough shows, right? They would drop them all and then they  would go away for several months and nothing would happen on the service. So instead they're doing  weekly releases after in, uh, the case of things like C and the morning show and for all mankind  dropping three episodes on day one. So we can talk about this as from a strategy perspective.  If you've seen the shows, we could talk about whether the shows are any good or not. I'm going  to bet that they're better than planet of the apps. But beyond that, I don't know, Dan, uh,

Start time: 6758.10

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  what have you seen of Apple TV plus? I've watched the first three episodes of the morning show. Um,  and that that's so far, that's it. Uh, as far as the originals thing go, it did remind me of,  I think it was maybe in the late nineties or early two thousands, NBC had a, uh, a slogan that they  would run sometimes when there were reruns. If you haven't seen it, it's new to you. And I always  thought that was such a brilliant totology of like, well, of course, like if you haven't seen it,  it's new. And in the same case, I feel like that's sort of what Apple's spinning here. Um, I've,  I've actually liked the morning show. I know that it's received kind of mixed reviews. It's something  that kind of appeals to me and it's on, I feel like it reflects certainly that they put a lot  of money into the show. Uh, it looks good. It's got really top talent, even down to like the  supporting cast or like, there's a lot of faces that you recognize. Uh, is it the kind of thing  that's essentially going to go out and win, say an Emmy? I don't think so. I don't think that it  will. Uh, but I think it's a solid effort and it's enjoyable enough that when I finished the first  episode, I kept watching. Uh, and if there had been more, I probably would have kept watching  them by now. So, you know, in some, to some extent, that's all that really matters. Uh,  and from a larger business question, there is a, there is a question of what success looks like  for Apple here. Obviously, if you're giving away your service for a whole year to most of,  at least your most devoted customers, probably the people most likely to pay for the service,  then obviously you're not pulling in a lot of revenue. That's purely based on the content that  you've spent millions and millions of dollars, if not billions of dollars, uh, on us. That's,  yeah. So you spent a lot of money. That's a lot of investment to recoup. And it's not something  that you're necessarily pulling in a lot of subscription money from on day one or even on  day 365. So I think this is a larger play from Apple. And this is still sort of them planting  their flag in the sand here who say like, Hey, we've got this as an option. Uh, this is, you know,  this is a competition to Amazon. Um, it's part of our whole package that we are sort of offering  to people who use the Apple ecosystem. And, you know, it's going to be, it's going to be good  stuff. I mean, like, I think there's nothing so far that I've heard is absolute trash. I know  there's some stuff that has gotten worse reviews than others, but I think they've realized then to  a certain extent in the order to exist as this mega tech company in this day and age, that original  content for whatever reason is a part of that equation. So I'm curious to see how they end up  justifying sort of like, does it bring in people to buy other devices or subscribe to other services?  What is the end of the day value proposition for this? Or is it just something that we feel like  it's an investment in the longer term ecosystem? And it's kind of hard to figure out exactly how  much money we're going to make out of it. Cause it's billions of dollars that they're spending

Start time: 6929.86
End time: 6953.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  this content, billions of dollars. Rene, this was available in Canada among many, many other  countries. That's one of the things that's unique, I think, in this launch is that Apple built it for  international. And so it's not going to, we're going to talk about what AT&T is doing with HBO  Max, which is a U S only service essentially. But you got to see the stuff in Canada, right?

Start time: 6954.74
End time: 7061.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, there are services that have fairly good, like Netflix has built out fairly good  international representation, but because it is so like the licensing model is so fragmented and  it's filled with these little different fiefdoms, you don't have the same catalogs globally. And  it's incredibly frustrating. I'll go to watch some, I subscribe to CBS All Access and I'll go to watch  a show and I'll hit the button and it'll bounce me into one of my local cable apps because they  have the rights in Canada. And then they want me to put in a cable subscription, which I don't have.  And so I can't watch the thing that's part of the service that I'm already paying to watch. And  it's endlessly frustrating, but because it's originals only, Apple owns all the rights to  them and they can put them in hundreds of, you know, a hundred plus countries right away. And  I think that's great. And I think in general, if Apple decided they had to do it, this was probably  the best way for them to do it. It's a very Apple way to do it. It's like, if we have these billions  of dollars, we want to help tell great stories. Let's go out and let's just tell the best stories.  Like we don't make four phones a year the way OnePlus does. We make like, we have our shot of  phones all at one time. They're just making a few series all at once and they're going to be top  notch series. I mean, the morning show isn't the newsroom and C is not Game of Thrones by any means.  They started off with good ingredients that weren't stirred very well. They got better  over the episodes. And to Dan's point, like I would have just kept watching the morning show  if all the episodes had been available and I would have just kept watching see if all the episodes  had been there. And I get why they're not because there's a free week trial and you could probably  get through all of the content and then cancel immediately if you did that. But it's good enough  and it's getting better with the opening salvo that I'm curious to see. And I don't know if they  necessarily have to make a lot of money here. I think they just have to get their platform going  and then use it to again, increase the value of the overall Apple ecosystem for people.

Start time: 7067.44
End time: 7166.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  doing here? I do. And I've been following this closely and I was really excited to see like,  what would Apple do differently? And it turns out kind of kind of nothing. Like my review title is  Apple TV plus is fine. And it is like none of the shows are terrible. They're all perfectly  watchable in certain ways. But yeah, the morning, you know, the morning hour feels like the newsroom  and it feels a lot like Aaron Sorkin without Aaron Sorkin, as I think the New York Times review had  said. A lot of all these shows in many ways feel like things we've seen before. And it seems like  at least right now, Apple is taking kind of the Netflix approach to some of their content where  it's like, well, this is this is okay. I guess I'll watch this because it's on a service.  To what Dan was saying, I think this is the opening salvo. And I feel like launching this  thing in 100 countries, that's pretty impressive because Disney plus is only I think going to be  available in a couple once it launches in November or later this month. Yeah. So the scale of what  Apple did is impressive showing that they could produce a streaming platform. I mean, we knew  they could deliver this stuff because of iTunes and people have been buying that stuff for a while.  But showing that they could produce original content. It's more like they prove that they  can do it. I'm interested to see where they go from here, especially like that M. Night Shyamalan  show coming up soon. They talked about some content coming into next year to nothing seems  incredible. Nothing seems like, oh, man, I really have to subscribe to this. It does seem like, oh,  this is a nice benefit because I'm an Apple customer because I just bought an iPhone or an iPad or  something. I don't think they're doing this for subscription money at all. And that's why it costs

Start time: 7166.42
End time: 7233.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  $5 for sure. Yeah, I wonder about stuff too. I just want to say it's tough too, because they've  also not done the thing that a lot of the other competitors have done where it's like, let's license  large existing IP or own existing IP, right? Disney gets to roll out all its Marvel and  Star Wars shows. And that's a huge way to bring people in. And Netflix obviously had its Marvel  shows back in the day and got to use that to sort of bolster its original like early on.  I don't see Apple deciding it wants to play in that pool, certainly not from corporate partners  that are that large. It seems to be a very Apple way of focusing on let's kind of do this ourselves,  stem to stern. And I think that that presents potential challenges for them. And in terms of  them building up their repertoire, I think it's still possible that you know, a show that comes  out next year from them could pick up enough buzz to be the show that drives people to the network,  right? The water cooler show. I think that's kind of what they're in search of. Is there,  not necessarily Game of Thrones in genre, but Game of Thrones, i.e. the show everyone is talking  about when it goes on every week. That is what they would like. I just don't think they've

Start time: 7233.28
End time: 7312.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  necessarily figured out what show that is yet. It does feel a little bit like these shows were  created in a lab. Oh, yeah, they're trying to find that they're trying to strike gold.  And I get that. But I wonder if you're you're actually never going to do that. If you're  trying for the big hit, what you need to do is find some people who are on the verge of  superstardom as a writer, as an actor, and they have a great idea and it's going to bubble  beneath the surface. And they're not going to be a thousand stories in the Hollywood Reporter about  it. But it will be the thing that ends up breaking through just like with Game of Thrones, other than  people who had read those books, nobody knew anything about it. And the show runners had  never done anything before and it became the biggest TV show ever. These all feel like,  you know, let's go to Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston and craft something like the  newsroom or let's spend a lot of money on a high concept thing, kind of like Game of Thrones. And  it gives you see and we'll put Jason Momoa in it. And okay, great. But they're coming out of the lab.  Are they really going to be able to just look if you can make Game of Thrones in the lab,  there would be a hundred Game of Thrones and there's only one.  Well, there are a lot of like that, you know, it is it is let's get Ron Moore to do a space show  because we like Battlestar Galactica. And, you know, it's a little bit different. But it's like

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  that. Renee, you were saying. No, I was I was agreeing with you completely. And I think also  they managed to get the big stars by in some ways green lighting the vanity projects from their own  production companies, instead of growing them inside Apple. I mean, it's a good mix of both.  And the risk is that not all these vanity projects or these big stars are going to give you the  quality of show that you get from a writer producer like Aaron Sorkin, or you get from

JJ Abrams, several other creators that that Shonda Rhimes,  Ryan Murphy, right? All of these where they're like you have established hits, and now we're  going to give you a lot of money. And again, the question is, are you going to get a new established  hit from that? Or, you know, or would you be better off spending all that money on a bunch of people  who are up and comers? And Apple, I think maybe has just been outbid on those. I don't I'm not  sure that's a strategy because they bid on those people famously. I think there's a report that

Tim Cook is saying you shouldn't really put things on these shows that we can't  show in an Apple store. The most cutting phrase that came up in the entire discussion was that  what Apple wanted to do was make expensive NBC shows, which is a real burn, let me tell you.  And I gotta say, I think that a lot of that came from people who got fired off of shows or were  disgruntled in some way. If you look at the material that's out there, there is no shortage of  edgy material in the Apple TV shows. TV ma. No, it's not it's not family friendly stuff entirely.

Transcript:  I would say five or 10 years ago, before all these before we had this, like surfeit of content from  all of these different services. I think any one of these might have been a show that really caught  people's attention. But the problem is that the some of it's the bar is so high. We're in the  platinum age now, right? The peak TV, right? There is so much stuff that making something stand out  really requires it be amazing. And I think all of the shows sound like they are good, solid shows,  and not every show has or couldn't be the greatest show of all time. But I think that just because  the competition is so fierce nowadays, and people are dealing with essentially a lack of time,  right? There's only so much TV you can watch, especially if you need your time to read Twitter  or whatever that you're doing with the rest of your time. Like it's you're fighting for your  you're fighting for eyeballs a lot. And I think that's that means you really got to bring your  a game. And I think this is you know, this is B game. It's not bad. But it's like, it's not  it's not necessarily the thing that's going to win people over to your service.
