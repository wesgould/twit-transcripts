Transcript:  It's time for Twitch!  This week in tech, Paris Martinot is here from wire.com, we've got Patrick BÃ©ja from  France and from travels all around the world, Mike Elgin is back and boy do we have a big  agenda to talk about today.  Mark Zuckerberg's post saying he's going to change the way Facebook works, or will he?  Elizabeth Warren says it's time to break up the tech giants and to trip down memory lane  with Foursquare.  Turns out they're still watching your every move.  It's all coming up next on Twitch!  This is Twitch!  This Week in Tech, episode 709, recorded Sunday, March 10, 2019.  Third party dog hats.

And there are some massive stories we're going to get into.  Partly because South by Southwest is going on, but partly because, well, the news never  sleeps.  Mike Elgin is here.  No one knows it better than Mike.  In fact, it sleeps so little, Mike's actually moved to Europe to get away from it.  I try to move as often as possible.  Mike is of course an inveterate, long time computer technology journalist, watcher of  the trends.  He blogs at Elgin.com.  That's where his Mike's List is, which is a great newsletter.  Actually, kind of an antidote to the daily tech news is fun stuff.  It's really fun, it's cynical, it's just bursting with sour notes.

Transcript:  I'll survive.  What's the status on HQ2?  Because at first Amazon picked Long Island City just outside of Manhattan in the Queens  to be headquarters too.  Then there was an outcry and then they said, well, if you don't want us here, we are leaving.  And then the last thing I heard is, well, maybe we won't.

Start time: 304.60

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  The last thing I've heard is that Cuomo and a bunch of other people in New York politics  are being like, please come back, Amazon.  We didn't mean it.  But who knows?  I think it's it seems like all of the local politicians here are very against it and as  well as many of the unions.  So yeah, it's probably going to stay either not happening or stay in a contentious space  for a while.

Transcript:  So the big story of the week.  Well, there were several on Wednesday.  I thought the big story of the week was Mark Zuckerberg's blog post, which some say I thought  maybe was a pivot of Facebook from a public facing network to a privacy facing network.  Then Elizabeth Warren on Friday at South by Southwest announced, we're going to break  up if I get elected president, we're going to break up Facebook, Google, Amazon.  And then she threw in an interview with Neil I.  Patel, almost like she hadn't even really thought of it.  Yeah, and Apple too.  So it was really kind of offhanded.  He said, are you going to break up Apple too?  She said, yeah, we're going to break up Apple too.  Oh, OK.  Her complaint against Apple is a little bit weird.  We'll talk about that.  We'll talk about Facebook.  And then Paris wrote an article also coming out of South by about a company you haven't  heard of in a while, a company that made its kind of famous debut at South by some years  ago, Foursquare.  Ten years ago, actually.  It's exactly ten.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  It took Austin by storm.  It's taking Austin by something a little less than a storm this time with a new app called  HyperTrending.  But you got an interview with Dennis Crowley and saw something that I found bone chilling.  But we'll let you talk about all of that.

Start time: 414.58
End time: 582.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I also hadn't thought about Foursquare maybe in a decade since it was Foursquare's heyday.  You could be forgiven for wondering whether Foursquare even still existed.  But the Foursquare of today is this location data giant rivaling the powers of Facebook  and Google almost.  You may not even think that you're a Foursquare user if you've never used the app, but chances  are that you are.  Foursquare's technology powers the geo filters in Snapchat, Tags, Weed, Twitter.  It's in AccuWeather, Uber, Apple News, Airbnb, WeChat, most Samsung phones, the photo, their  photo app on Samsung.  Swarm.  And essentially, yeah, Swarm, all Foursquare's native apps.  And, I mean, as Foursquare's website says, if it tells you where, it's probably built  on Foursquare.  And all of that amounts to that Foursquare has the capability to track most people with  smartphones, track their locations in real time.  And hyper trending, which is a feature for Foursquare's apps that they rolled out at  South by Southwest.  It shows this live map of Austin that shows basically the locations of all the phones,  all the people with smartphones in Austin in real time.  Albeit, it's aggregated and anonymized a bit.  So you just see like a big circle if there's a bunch of people at one coffee shop versus  a small circle if there's only two or three.  But it's a real time tracking service that speaks to the amount of data that Foursquare  is collecting.  And when I went to go meet with Crowley on Thursday, we were going to be talking about  hyper trending, but he ended up showing me this internal game kind of app that Foursquare  had been developing just among its coworkers.  And it essentially is kind of like Candyland, but an app.  And the except for the cards that you draw in Candyland, you get cards in order to move  along the little row, the rainbow row, except for the cards in this app are based on real  people's location data and where they are really going.  So he had pulled up his phone when we were meeting and it was like, OK, well, the Candyland  that he had was based on New York City.  And so he's like, OK, well, I need to move to the Manhattan bar square next.  So if I go look at whoever is in proximity to my phone based on who Foursquare has data  on, I can see that there's one person who spends a lot of time at Midtown bars.  So I'm going to add him to my team.  And next time he, this person in the real world goes to a Midtown bar and Foursquare  tracks him, I'll move it forward in the game, which is just insane that this company has  that sort of technology.

Start time: 582.62
End time: 649.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I kind of blame myself because when Foursquare launched 10 years ago, I jumped on it.  I thought this is fun.  And I would fight to be mayor of Twit with my wife or mayor of our local coffee shop.  And then they pivoted to Swarm, which was basically the same thing.  Foursquare became an app that would tell you about places.  But Swarm was where you checked in.  And I used that for a while.  I think Lisa still does.  I think she's in a battle with one of our engineers to be mayor of the Twit studios.  But I stopped because I thought, you know, you've got to be mayor.  It was kind of silly.  But I thought, well, I've stopped so they don't know where I am anymore.  I guess I was wrong.  This you mentioned that Crowley wasn't sure if it was cool or creepy.  Dennis, it's creepy.  It's creepy.  I'll read from your article downstairs in the cafeteria.  There are 40 people, Crowley says.  He's looking at a coffee company, a real cafe on the first floor of the building.  They're in 40 people.  These are people that are actually there.  We don't put their names.  We just put their unique advertising ID.  We turn that into a fake name and a fake avatar, but it is their unique advertising ID.

Start time: 650.48
End time: 659.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So basically the same.  And also you can definitely de-anonymize that if you see, OK, there's one person  that only goes to these like four areas.  This is my bar buddy.

Start time: 659.26
End time: 678.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I keep seeing him here.  It must be four, three, nine, four, seven, two, one, three, three, four, one, nine.  And then and then, yeah, well,  I have one question and you can ask yours, Patrick.  Are this isn't from Foursquare, this information where this is like  I'm using a Samsung phone.  Is it sending location information to Foursquare?

Start time: 679.16
End time: 715.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this I believe in Samsung, it is Foursquare powers the geotagging features.  Like whenever you take a photo there, how it'll like show you like a little.  Yeah, I understand that it's going to, but is it also coming out?  Where is that? Yeah, yeah.  So it's a two way street.  Yeah. Every time your phone takes a photo and tries to geotag it,  it like sends out signals like it uses Bluetooth, Wi-Fi,  GPS, a couple of different things, and then runs that by Foursquare's  like a whole list of locations.  And then Foursquare is like, oh, he's at Twitch Studios.  But he also gets the data that you're at Twitch Studios, you know.

Start time: 715.98
End time: 719.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the part that's weird.  And this is we're going to have a sign up for this.

Start time: 719.48
End time: 744.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. And remember, Verizon got in a little bit of heat  because they were sending unique IDs from their Verizon phones.  They even got fined for that.  Remember how much trouble Uber got in because they had a god mode  that did the same thing, but only with Uber.  This is 10 times worse.  And Uber, by the way, is one of the apps that sends information back to Foursquare.  Apple Maps, all the big privacy focused Apple sends it back.  Airbnb, WeChat.

Start time: 745.66
End time: 762.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Basically any app or thing that uses location services  that isn't connected directly to Facebook or Google is probably powered by Foursquare  because they have the most advanced, I guess, location  technology when it comes to pinpointing where you are.

Start time: 763.92
End time: 799.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's the the back end of location services for Foursquare,  who just happens to be very popular and so has location data on a lot of people  in the same way that Facebook or Google, for example,  has a lot of data on a lot of people.  The thing that they're showing now, the hyper local app or mode  or whatever they want to call it, is completely anonymized.  Right. If we want to believe them, this is just an application of all the  the location data they already have and that many other people also have.

Start time: 800.10
End time: 805.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is real time data, Patrick, not coming from the Foursquare Swarm app.  This is coming from all those other apps.

Start time: 806.36
End time: 812.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I understand. So it's the location service.  That are used by many different apps and devices.

Start time: 812.08
End time: 814.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google can do the same thing, right?  Because they get that information.

Start time: 814.18
End time: 864.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, Google does on the same like with Waze basically.  Yeah. Yeah, that's my point.  I think the difference is that most people probably don't realize that  when you're using Uber or, I don't know, TripAdvisor or something  or having AccuWeather alerts turned on the back of your phone,  that you're one, consenting to give your data to these apps,  but also consenting for it to be used in the future to create some hyper trending app.  Or the thing that I find the most worrying is that when I was speaking to Crowley,  he was saying that hyper trending, it's going to turn off after South by Southwest.  But the reason why they're demoing it there is for developers to be like,  oh, we could use it in this way or build this app off of it going forward.  And so this same information that you didn't really consent to be used in this way,  even though I suppose you technically did, could be used for any number of other apps.

Start time: 865.82
End time: 870.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the thing that concerns me is...  Let Patrick finish, then go ahead.  Very quickly.

Start time: 872.00
End time: 966.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't believe I'm going to defend this,  but just to explain exactly what he's trying to do with this long post,  he's saying we can basically build a catalogue of the popular places in this city at South by Southwest.  And we're doing it now, showing it.  We think it's cool or creepy.  He acknowledges the creepy factor.  And we're turning it off because we think there is something interesting here.  And we want people to start thinking about these things and to kind of think about the uses and the guidelines and all of this.  So the announcement here is the use of location data that, sure,  we might have not realized that they had so much of it, but we know Google has a lot of it.  We know Facebook has a lot of it. It's not that different.  The big new thing here is, I guess, two things.  First, Foursquare also has a lot of location data like the others.  And they built this application with that hyper trending mode,  which, again, is anonymized and only shows the popular places in the city.  So it's a way to see which locations and stores and restaurants are popular in a way that you couldn't before.  So I don't know that there's something, I don't want to say new,  but I don't know that it's that different from what Facebook or Google can already do.  I'm not sure why it's that creepy if I want to play a little bit of Devil's Advocate.

Start time: 966.80
End time: 1034.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, here's the case on the other side.  First of all, I think that they should release that game to the public because I think that'd be a great consciousness raising exercise.  If people see that this is real people, this is what they know.  And because right now people just don't get it.  The other point that I think is the bigger point is that the phone in your pocket,  we all have a phone on us right now, all of us, everyone in this building and everyone in the world.  And Google is tracking everywhere you go.  Facebook is tracking everywhere you go.  The carrier is tracking and selling that information everywhere you go.  Many of the apps on your phone are doing it, most of them sending it to Foursquare.  How secure is that communications medium?  The point is that it's not just somebody is tracking.  Lots of people are tracking you and we have no access or knowledge about how secure it is, how hackable it is,  whether the Chinese government is tracking, is tapping into this information, whether it's being sold, whether it's not being sold.  What I do know is that it's all for the purpose of commerce and advertising and the advertising still sucks.  It's not accurate in terms of...

Start time: 1035.38
End time: 1039.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nobody's getting any benefit from it is what you're saying.  So it would be OK if somebody were making money on this.

Start time: 1040.26
End time: 1043.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or they were showing me products I wanted to buy. That would be great.

Start time: 1043.48
End time: 1044.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If I were getting some benefit.

Start time: 1044.28
End time: 1057.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because that's the common defense is like, oh, then you're able to have ads that people actually want to see,  which I don't think anybody is thinking, wow, my ads are great now.  I'm so happy that I'm seeing so many relevant ads.

Start time: 1057.06
End time: 1135.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google could do this if they, for instance, if Niantic turned on in Pokemon Go or Ingress turned on a map  that showed you all the other players and where they are in the city.  And it would be such an eye opener.  I think these companies know very, very well, and maybe Denz does, maybe that's his reason for doing this,  that there would be a hue and cry.  Right now, nobody but the geeks at South By and the few people listening to the show know about it.  But and read your Wired piece.  But that's not the mass of general population.  I think if the general populate, I think if Elizabeth Warren saw this and she'd flip her lid.  I could give you a nightmare scenario, Patrick, that will that so it's anonymized, right?  It's just a ID. It's not.  So I'm a I'm a Russian spy and I want to keep track of an NSA agent.  I just hang out until in a bar until that agent that I want to keep track of because I have his picture shows up.  And then I can start tracking his hyper trending presence on Foursquare.  Maybe it's not public. Maybe I have to buy the service.  And I can pretty quickly triangulate. Oh, that's him.  Once I've got his ID, I no longer have to surveil the guy.  I know where he is at every moment of every day.  Exactly. I know who his girlfriend is.  I know when he's at the office.

Start time: 1136.02
End time: 1139.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, hyper trending isn't that specific thing.  But I think it is.  It is.

Start time: 1139.86
End time: 1147.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If it were public, it is because all you have to do, as you pointed out, you can de-anonymize it by figuring out who's that guy that's going to all these bars.

Start time: 1147.56
End time: 1161.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You had something that was individual where you had an individual like the game that Dennis showed me, the monopoly.  OK, yes, you're right.  Because hyper trending is just a blog.  Yeah, this is more of like a it's a blocked.

Start time: 1161.94
End time: 1174.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Hyper trending shows you essentially a list of stores or restaurants, places of business and tells you how many people are there.  So it's a lot.  At that specific moment.  So it's a lot.

Start time: 1174.88
End time: 1187.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not in Dennis who says, yeah, I know this is controversial.  That's why we're showing everybody.  That's a lie, because if they show them the lollipop game and what they really know, people would freak the hell out.

Start time: 1188.24
End time: 1212.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just like the Godmode from Uber.  Exactly.  Data didn't disappear.  It's just that that interface was hopefully made forbidden and no one has access to it except a few very authorized people.  But the fact that hyper trending exists or not doesn't change the fact that all of them, you know, location data exists.

Start time: 1213.30
End time: 1242.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And as anonymous as you claim to make it, it can be de-anonymized.  I do have to point out that both Apple and Google claim they use a technique to deeply anonymize it, which is not to take the full trip, but a segment of the trip.  So they don't have a starting point and an ending point.  They make some, I think, better efforts.  And there are claims that you can supposedly mathematically prove that this stuff is anonymous.  It doesn't look like Foursquare is making any attempt to do that at all.

Start time: 1242.36
End time: 1294.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Every company trusts themselves.  And their message to the public is, hey, trust us.  We're Google, Apple, Foursquare, etc.  We're AT&T.  We're this company.  We're that company.  Trust us.  We will keep your data secure.  We won't be hacked.  We won't share it.  We won't de-anonymize it.  None of that stuff is going to happen.  Of course, all those things happen all the time.  And it's just something that everybody needs to be much more aware of.  And I think that we need help from all quarters.  We need phones that can turn off location by default quickly, more conveniently, more transparently, and a whole bunch of other things.  Because right now, it's just getting to the point.  And again, I'm kind of amazed at this conversation because this is almost exactly the conversation we're going to have.  We're going to have about Facebook.  There are many, many points.  And we're going to do it.

Start time: 1294.88
End time: 1310.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's actually a good table setter for the Facebook conversation.  Paris, when you interviewed Dennis, what was the sense you got from him?  Was he proud of this?  Did he understand how upset people would be if they knew that he had this lollipop game?

Start time: 1311.72
End time: 1370.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He was speaking about it like it was the most normal thing in the world.  And I think at one point later in our conversation, I was like, this is honestly very surprising to me.  Because one, I mean, I'm a tech reporter.  I follow these faces pretty thoroughly and regularly.  And it didn't seem obvious to me or my editor, even when we were talking about this conversation to begin with, that this sort of granular level of data was something that Foursquare had and was playing with on a regular basis.  And I think he replied something to the effect of, oh, yeah, this happens to us all the time.  We don't realize how, I guess, not callous or how blase we are towards things that anybody outside of our company would be like, oh, my God, wow, you have this sort of information.  I think he said that he often whenever he has conversations with his mom or sister or family members and mentions some of the things that they do, he gets shocked back and stepped back into reality.

Start time: 1370.30
End time: 1387.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is why these people should not be allowed to decide what this stuff because they're completely immune to it.  That's why Uber didn't realize how horrific God mode was.  I mean, they're so callous about this that they should not be allowed to make decisions.

Start time: 1387.88
End time: 1401.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Foursquare even has a tech ethicist panel.  Like they have a group of thinkers in this space that they've hired anytime somebody says, oh, this might be a controversial subject.  But they work for Foursquare.  Yeah.

Start time: 1403.39
End time: 1426.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But to what Mike was saying, how do we address this?  You were saying we need an easy way to manage location services on the iPhone, at least, I'm guessing it's the same case on Android phones.  It's very easy to go in and disable location services as a whole or per application.  But the minute you open your map, it starts sending data back to Foursquare.

Transcript:  No, not if you disable it.  Well, then it's useless because it doesn't know where you are.

End time: 1469.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly.  So well, so people should stop using weather apps, map apps.  I mean, so many apps know your location.  Stop using Yelp.  Even if you only send location when the app is running, which is probably the right default setting for all of these, you're sending out enough information that could be.  I think the real issue here is there are so many signals that somebody with the desire to combine signals is going to get a very complete map.  So really, the only way is just to not carry a smartphone.  But are people willing to do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that the idea of consent, like consent in these cases is an illusion when it's just a binary choice when it comes to our sort of privacy settings, whether  if it's you get this feature or you get access to Facebook and the things that you need to be a person in the world, unfortunately, nowadays, or you don't.  If you want to not send all of your information out and even in the cases of OK, let's say you turn off location services for one thing and you only use it for one second to order your Uber, you're still sending out just more.  When we think of location services, maybe we think of you're sending out one signal.  But no, your phone is sending out here are the 10 Bluetooth signals I'm picking up next to me.  Here are all the Wi-Fi networks that I can read.  They're using GPS, GSM, and all of that's going to Foursquare or Google or whoever who is then going to check that against their range of locations to be like, oh, Paris is at World Trade Center.  I'm going to send her Uber there.

Start time: 1529.90
End time: 1578.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just to flesh out what Patrick was saying, the situation with user control of location data apps is getting better.  And I know on Android, it's constantly saying, hey, this app is using your location.  Is that OK?  And you can just write there.  IOS does that, not Android.  Android does that too.  So they both do it.  They both made improvements.  But the problem is that, like you mentioned Uber, the way it really should work is at the point when you're ready to order an Uber, you should have an  explicit option to turn on location for Uber, the Uber app, and say, OK, I'm going to turn this on until my car comes and then it goes off automatically or something like that.  That would be the user advocacy default.  But it's actually the industry advocacy default, which is that the Uber is tracking you all the time.

Start time: 1579.10
End time: 1581.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you have to actively say no.  Yeah, and you have to.

Start time: 1581.76
End time: 1604.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But in addition to that, that you should be able to say, OK, if I want to share my data and location data for that one moment to Uber,  I can only consent to it being used for things related to my Uber ride.  There you go.  Bingo.  And that it can't be used for any other services or it can't be shared with advertisers.  It can't be used to be a hyperlobed, hyper trending map.  Don't put the burden on the user.

Start time: 1605.12
End time: 1610.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Put the burden on these companies not to aggregate and share this data because that's what's wrong.

Start time: 1611.68
End time: 1622.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why is it sent to Foursquare in the first place, I guess, is a good question.  So do we need legislation?  That's where I'm going to lose all of you.  Oh, yes. OK. Excellent.  Yeah, I think so.

Start time: 1622.84
End time: 1648.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the only solution because they're not going to self-regulate.  And all you have to ask is if an adversary got access to this information, would that be a bad thing?  If the Chinese government were able to get access to this Foursquare information, would that be a bad thing?  And if you say yes to that, then we've got to do something about it because there's no way that an adversary is not actively trying to get all this information.

Start time: 1648.36
End time: 1677.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's no way that they don't already have it.  And they probably have it.  The issue is that you can't really close the doors on data.  There's no expiration date for your consent when it comes to the sort of data that you're handing over.  Let's say, OK, Foursquare allows one of, let's say, like Uber and some other third parties that it works with.  All it takes is one of those third parties breaking their contract with Foursquare and sharing that data with somebody else who decided to pay them a million dollars for the data they have.  And then that person shares it with someone else and so on and so forth.

Start time: 1677.90
End time: 1694.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who knows? Maybe there's some Chinese shell company posing as, I don't know, an American massage parlor entrepreneur that is buying this data already from Foursquare and from Google.  It's legitimate advertising.

Start time: 1695.28
End time: 1728.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You'd have to think, you'd have to hope that when Uber or an app sends the data to Foursquare, it's maybe somewhat identified.  It's not reliable, but then Foursquare actually anonymizes it and you can't really be found afterwards.  I mean, we don't know that for sure, but I would guess that's what they do.  They have some kind of process so that you don't actually have your ID number that can be easily attached to you, I would guess.

Start time: 1729.36
End time: 1788.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But to Leo's point, it's easily discernible to figure out who people are.  You can de-anonymize this stuff.  Ultimately, it's associated with a phone number and the phone number is gold and you can figure out everything.  Remember the conversations we used to have about the NSA spying and they're like, oh, it's just metadata.  A meditator tells you everything.  Yeah, we now know.  Yeah.  And this is like metadata.  Even if it's anonymized, all the contextual data.  Well, who is it that spends their days at this company and lives in this neighborhood and drops off their child at this daycare center and frequently goes to this other person's house?  You can figure out who that is.  And even if you don't know who it is by name, you know everything else about that person.  It's enough information to do anything you want to do.  It's also, I mean, everything's a mixed bag in technology, right?  So this knowledge about how many people are in the building in the cafeteria downstairs, that's really valuable knowledge for firefighters, for example.  Oh, in all sorts of beneficial ways you can think of it.  Yeah.  Right.

Transcript:  I have to think that Sundar Pichai or Larry Page is going, Dennis, you knew it.  You don't tell people this stuff.  That's right.  Keep it a secret.  We're not going to put location.  It reminded me, and this is going to be obscure to anybody over a certain age, but it reminded me of the Marauders map in Harry Potter.  Paris knows what I'm talking about.  Where it was a map.  And if you take your one, you go, I solemnly swear I'm up to no good.  And you tap it. All of a sudden it comes alive and shows the location of everybody in Hogwarts, you know, as they walk around.  It was hugely valuable to Harry and his team.  It's good. Go watch the movie, kids.  It's fantastic. Anyway, no, definitely a privacy violation.  Or read the book. Read the book.  Yeah, I was just teasing. Obviously, read the book.  It's like that. But what if what if Pokemon Go suddenly?  I solemnly swear I'm up to no good.  You tapped it and you could see every Pokemon player.  Or anybody would install that ever in their location.  It would immediately come home to the American public.  That's that's the big oh, shoot moment.

Start time: 1862.24
End time: 1882.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess we know that Facebook and Google have profiles like these with that amount of sensitive data.  We know in the back of our minds.  Yeah, but at least we know.  I don't think any of us knew that Foursquare had a profile with that much of that much personal and sensitive data, right?

Start time: 1883.10
End time: 1918.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That there are many more big data brokers that we don't even know their name.  I bet Paris knows some of them that are doing they have exactly the same information.  And the real fear is that somebody goes out and buys three or four of these databases in real time and gets a real time fire hose of them.  Because that now suddenly you've got this amazingly granular map of pretty much everybody.  I don't think it should be on us as users not to have a smartphone or make sure we turn off privacy.  I think it should be illegal to collect certain kinds of information and sell it and share it.  Here's what I think the theme of this show will be at the end of the show.

Start time: 1918.82
End time: 1971.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the theme will be that clearly our laws don't reflect the 21st century.  No. And we need a tech new deal.  You heard it here first. Is it green?  Yeah, that's another that's another new deal. This is an even newer deal.  We need to update our laws around antitrust, around privacy.  I mean, back in the day, back in the 20th century, where all of our current laws were written, basically, we had laws sort of like public television had to have a certain number of hours of XYZ because they were using the public's resource, the airwaves.  There was this idea that nobody nobody was like, oh, my God, over regulation.  Who owns the data about where you are?  Do you do four square? I mean, they're acting like they own it.  You gave it to them. That's right.  So maybe we need laws that say, OK, here's who owns that information.

Start time: 1971.56
End time: 2017.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I confess I've been a bad boy for years.  I've argued, oh, who cares?  Let them have my data.  You know, there's so much value in this.  I don't care if Google knows where I am.  And that's why I think it's I think what actually Dennis did, and maybe he knew what he was doing.  What Dennis actually did is kind of bring it home to some people.  And and I think if somebody made a map that was like this Marauders map, but it showed everybody in your town and where they were, there would be instant regulation instantly.  I think there's no question about it.  People would hop. They'd be so mad.  I think you have a lot of faith in the public.  Oh, I think if they saw it, they'd freak out.  Wouldn't you freak out if there were an app on your phone?  Somebody should do this.

Start time: 2041.46
End time: 2064.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Leo, you keep saying that.  The fact that this data exists somewhere doesn't mean that people are doing it.  It's like that that Marauders map.  It's essentially the Uber God mode, right?  Someone did it indeed.  And very quickly, they were shut down.  I would hope that if someone was you weren't shut down, they were told not to use it.

Start time: 2069.90
End time: 2089.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It exists everywhere.  I guess what we come back to is we need regulation for these types of data as, you know, while everyone was arguing that, I think is the possibly the conclusion of this conversation.  It's so much and such important data.  It needs to be regulated.  And currently, it is not regulated at all.

Start time: 2091.58
End time: 2107.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that's the final word.  We all agree. So say we all.  All right.  I mean, I hate to say we got to regulate it,  especially because we have such a dysfunctional government that I don't don't say we've had this argument before, Patrick.

Start time: 2108.02
End time: 2151.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, we have.  And and what happens when you say stuff like that is put into people's head this idea that government can't function to do what it's supposed to do,  while at the same time saying, but we need to it to be regulated.  Of course, government is not going to be perfect.  And of course, there are going to be some things that are not it's not understanding and something it doesn't do properly.  And maybe even the laws that it would pass would not would be imperfect in many ways.  But if you say if you follow up the idea that it should be regulated by the caveat, oh, but the government can't really do it, then obviously nothing's going to happen.

This was going to be the amuse-bouche before we got to the main course.  That's right.  It's going to be a long main course.  It's going to be a big main course because we still have to talk about and it is related.  Facebook saying no privacy first.  And Elizabeth Warren saying I got a solution.  Don't regulate them.

Actually, I really do like having you on, Patrick, because we often, especially on Twitter,  but in general, all Americans kind of have an American, US centric point of view.  And the EU has really been in the forefront, especially in these kinds of privacy regulations.  So it's good to have you arguing for the sanctity of government.

Transcript:  All right. But first a word from Wasabi.  Wasabi is hot. Cloud storage, hot.  That is, cloud storage is on a roll.  This is a huge category.  Almost all businesses are at this point  considering some move to the cloud of data.  It's estimated in the next six years,  by 2025, there'll be 163 zettabytes of data in the cloud.  That's 163 followed by 21 zeros.  That's a lot of data.  And choosing a cloud provider is a really, really big deal.  Cloud data, if done right, is probably more secure  than your on-premises storage.  It can save you money.  It's more robust, more reliable,  but it has to be done right.  And that's why I'm really glad to talk about Wasabi.  It was started by my friend, David Friend,  who was the founder of Carbonite  along with his CTO, Jeff Flowers.  They came up at Carbonite with a patented method  for writing to hard drives.  It lays the data on the disk sequentially, not via blocks.  And that makes it faster and more efficient,  which means it's also less expensive.  And that's the technology, that patented technology  that Wasabi is using to store efficiently and affordably  the data your business wants to save up in the cloud.  This is disruptive technology,  but they gotta get the word out.  David, Jeff, I will help you  because I am such a believer in this.  I know it's the big three, you get all the attention,  and probably if you're putting together  a cloud strategy for your company,  of course you're thinking Amazon, Google, Microsoft.  But what if I tell you that Wasabi is 80% cheaper  and six times faster than Amazon's S3?  It uses the S3 API, so you already know how to use it.  All your software already knows how to use it,  but it's 80% cheaper and six times the speed.  And it's very simple, the pricing couldn't be more simple,  there's just one tier of service.  And unlike the other guys, they don't charge you for egress.  You get free, unlimited egress.  So that really helps your budgeting and planning  because you don't even think about it.  It's just how much are we gonna put up there?  That's all you think about.  They have a form of data that is, I think, super vital.  I love this idea, it's called immutable storage.  You can designate some of your cloud storage unchangeable,  not by malware, not by a ransomware,  not by a fumble fingered employee.  That data is protected.  You have to jump through hoops to write to it.  And that's huge, I think that's brilliant.  It's just as secure because of that,  and of course all the things they're doing,  than on-premises storage.  I would say it's more secure in most cases.  It's HIPAA compliant, FINRA compliant, CJIS compliant.  And if you have a lot of data to start,  you wanna migrate to petabytes of data,  you can do that with the Wasabi Ball,  which is a really cool technology, a physical drive.  You copy the data to send it to Wasabi,  it's up in the cloud.  Experience Wasabi for yourself  with free unlimited storage for a month.  That's better than the normal deal.

Transcript:  I actually, I had deactivated my Facebook account  back in August.  I reactivated it, and I posted for the first time  in six months saying-  Well, wait a minute, wait a minute.  Now, let me justify this saying,  look, I don't know if Mark's sincere, but if he is,  this is the social network I want,  and I'm gonna stay on Facebook to find out.  Now, the minute he proves to be insincere about this,  I will be gone again, because, well,  anybody who uses Facebook, and incidentally,  that number is dwindling.  We just saw a statistic that said the number of posts  on Facebook is down 25%.  The number of people using Facebook under the age of 25  has dwindled by millions.  Millions of people are leaving the platform.  Facebook is under investigation by Congress,  by Parliament in the UK.  We keep hearing every week more horrific security stories.  Last week, in fact, coincident with this announcement,  it came out that Facebook was using the number,  your phone number that they asked for  for two-factor authentication as a way of identifying you,  and that there was searchable,  and there was no way to turn that off.

I mean, there's been no evidence that Facebook  or Mark Zuckerberg cares the least  for our privacy or security.  It seems to be, or our laws,  the only thing Facebook cares about is making more money.  Then, Mark writes this post.  And I wanna give people the benefit of the doubt.  So you guys, let me just say what Mark said.  Then you guys can talk me off,  actually, I was off the ledge.  Talk me back off the ledge.  We're gonna get you back up on that ledge later.  Talk me back onto the ledge.  My focus, Mark, I'm not gonna read the whole thing.  I'm gonna synopsize.  My focus for the last couple of years  has been understanding and addressing  the biggest challenges Facebook.  In fact, he said that was gonna be  his challenge for this year.

Transcript:  Now he's saying, he says,  I'm gonna outline our vision and principles  around building a privacy-focused message,  now this is important,  messaging and social networking platform.  Essentially, I saw this as a pivot.  Now, I've read a lot since I read this,  but at the, and I think it's still,  if you read it at face value,  if you give Mark credit for being sincere,  it still is a pivot.  He's saying, public social networks  will continue to be very important in people's lives.  People find these valuable every day.  There are a lot of services to build on them,  but now, with all the ways people  also wanna interact privately,  there's an opportunity to build a simpler platform  that's focused on privacy first.  And that's why I say it's a pivot.  Facebook right now is public,  and your stuff leaks out of it  even if you say it's private.  He says, I understand.  Many people don't think Facebook can  or would even wanna build  this kind of privacy-focused platform,  because frankly, we don't have  a strong reputation for that.  And we focused on tools for more open sharing.  But I believe the future of communication  will increasingly shift to private, encrypted,  whoa, when I saw that, I went, what?  Services.  And when he says encrypted, he says,  I wanna do end-to-end encryption.  We won't even be able to read your transactions.  So here's the principles, private interactions.  People should have simple, intimate places  where they have clear control  over who can communicate with them.  I read that to be advertisers.  And confidence that no one else can access  what they share, even Facebook.  People's communication should be encrypted.  End-to-end prevents anyone, including us,  from seeing what people share on our services.  Here's another one.  This has come straight from the Snapchat playbook,  Reducing Permanence.  One of the problems with Facebook and the web in general  is everything posted there lives forever.  You just said it yourself, Mike.  People should be comfortable being themselves  and should not have to worry about what they share  coming back to hurt them later.  In fact, many psychologists and others,  social scientists have observed that it's really important,  especially for young people, is the ability to try personas  and then leave them behind.  And that's why young people love Snapchat.  They can try stuff on, but it doesn't haunt them  for the rest of their life.  So he says, we won't keep messages or stories around  for longer than necessary to deliver the service  or longer than people want them.  That's Snapchat, right?  Safety.  People should expect we'll do everything we can  to keep them safe from the limits.  And this is really interesting.  Within the limits of what's possible in an encrypted service,  he's tacitly acknowledging that if we can't see  the messages that are being sent, people could bully you.  But presumably, they're gonna give you strong controls  that allow you to say, I don't wanna hear  from that person ever again.  Interoperability.  This is a controversial one,  and it's not clear what he means.  People should be able to use any of our apps.  So that means Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp  to reach their friends.  But then this is the sentence that I'm not sure  what he means.  They should be able to communicate across networks.  Does that mean just within the Facebook network?  Yes.  He actually has an announcement about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then finally, and this was another one  that was a big deal, I thought, secure data storage.  People should expect we won't store sensitive data  in countries with weak records on human rights.  Now, we already know Facebook doesn't operate in China.  China won't let it.  Right.  But it's a little shot across Tim Cook's bow, saying,  we're not gonna, Apple stores your data in China  with the keys.  We're not gonna do that.  It means there's no way they could operate in China.  Now, I love this.  And obviously, this is turning your back  on a significant amount of revenue,  the ad revenue that Facebook gets.  I think there are opportunities.  Here's what I interpret this, and I'm not alone in this.  It seems to me, Facebook's looking at WeChat in China,  Line in Japan.  Those are messaging platforms that have turned into,  really, platforms for almost every kind of interaction,  including financial transactions,  purchasing of plane tickets, socializing.  And the idea that I could control,  this is like Google+, this is what I like in the Google+,  who could talk to me, who I would hear from,  if a brand wanted to talk to me,  they wouldn't get to unless I give them permission,  permission which could be revoked at any time.  I love this notion.  I think this is exactly what people want  for a social network.  And what they thought Facebook was.  I will decide who gets to see my posts.  It's gonna be my family and friends.  It's not gonna be advertisers.  It's not gonna be Russia.  I think this is what people thought  they were getting with Facebook.  Here was my initial theory.  Talk me up onto the ledge again.  I thought Mark was seeing the horror of what he'd created,  maybe just because of the personal risk  that he's facing from regulation, breakup,  maybe going to jail, I don't know,  and saying, all right, all right, you don't like it,  I got a new idea.  And an idea I think Facebook is looking at Line and WeChat  and saying, you know, they're doing pretty well.  In fact, one of the reasons Facebook never had a chance  in China is because of WeChat.  I think, honestly, that this is,  if I were Mark Zuckerberg, I would like this plan.  All right, I'm done.

Now, if we take it at face value,  I think it's very easy to go,  oh, of course, he has never been truthful or trustworthy  with any of his declarations before,  so why would we trust him now?  Sure, I don't think we should trust him just on this,  but I think it has value.  I don't think he can say all of these things  and then do nothing.  And the list, as you remarked,  is essentially the dream of any anti-Facebook person.  This is the perfect social network he's describing.  I don't think he can.  Except for law enforcement.

I don't know that he's right,  that everything has to go private.  I think that is something a lot of people do want.  And I think he has the power and determination  to make it happen.  He didn't say everything would go private.

He, I believe says here, I'm looking at it,  says the thinking is that there needs to be  two types of platforms in the world.  One is a more public platform,  like the digital equivalent of the town square,  and then the other platform is a private space.  Living room.  The digital equivalent of a living room.  And then you're going to have the Facebook and Instagrams  and the WhatsApp and Messengers,  but they're both there, but they're both kind of separate  and working for different groups and for different reasons.

Transcript:  Leo, can I burn his whole post down?  Yeah, burn it to the ground.  And I want you all to join me on this legend.  We'll jump together holding hands.  Okay, good.  I like it.  Okay, so the way I look at this is he's trying to get credit  for everything he's resisted.  They wouldn't let him into China  because China wants to control the Chinese public  through WeChat.  WeChat is the Mark Zuckerberg wet dream.  You can't scratch your butt in China without WeChat.  You can't ride a train, you can't get a coffee,  you can't spin a bill.  You can't get anything. Big opportunity.  And he's like, that's what I want.  Build a platform.  He wants to make Facebook 10 times more invasive  and 10 times more of a monopoly  in the whole non-Chinese world than it is today.  That's what he wants. He wants to make WeChat.  That's what Molly Wood said in Wired, actually.  He wants you using Facebook coin to buy  everything through WeChat he wants,  everything to happen through WeChat.  He wants to know exactly where everyone is at all times,  far more information than Foursquare has.  He's going to know what you buy,  who you buy it for, who you meet with.  When you meet-  So there's plenty of opportunity to make money.  He wants to turn, he wants to make 10 times more money  by being 10 times more of a monopoly.  And the way to get there is to say,  we're going to be WeChat with encryption.  We're going to be the justifiably,  morally superior version of WeChat  because we're going to have encryption unlike WeChat,  an entirely different thing altogether.  What this blog post represents to me  is he's basically announced that we got a few more things  that we're going to copy the remaining two things  from Snapchat that we didn't copy previously,  and then we're going to start copying WeChat.  We're going to copy everything they do.  And by the way, there's three stories a day recently  about all the transgressions Facebook has committed  against everybody.  They're harvesting data about women's menstrual cycles.  They're harvesting data about people's heart rates.  They're taking phone, they're requiring you to use a phone  for two factor authentication,  and they're selling your phone number to advertisers.  All these stories are coming like this,  and he's like, we got to distract everybody from this  and give them some BS.  And so he did this post, and he said,  we're going to change all these things  that aren't really the problem.  He didn't mention tracking,  he didn't mention shadow profiles,  he didn't mention harvesting data,  he didn't mention any of the things  that are truly controversial.  He came up with these other things  that are less controversial, encrypted communication.  He's basically saying you're going to be able to send email  from CompuServe to Prodigy.  Oh my God, nobody has ever thought of it before,  and it's going to be encrypted.  Who cares?  He doesn't care.

He's got two million people on Facebook,  he's got a one point something billion on this  and that platform and another platform.  He wants to take all four of them  and combine them into one super network  that's all connected.  In China, there are a huge number of Chinese people  who never use the actual internet.  WeChat is everything online.  That's the world he wants.  That's what Facebook's dream all along, by the way,

It's a virtue that he is not allowed to in China  and I think he's gonna get kicked out of Russia too.  And I think he would be happy.  I think he wants all the money.  I think he wants the rubles and he would love to be in China.  He tried really hard.  He learned Mandarin, for God's sake.  Speaks it pretty well too.  Yeah, and it didn't work.  And so now he's trying to get credit for saying,  oh, we're not gonna work with those Chinese,  totalitarian countries anymore.  It's a distraction and designed to make you feel comfortable  about him becoming WeChat and really controlling everything.  That's what I think.

Zuckerberg had announced that he was planning  on merging Facebook Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp  into one large pool that was encrypted,  which is essentially the exact same description  as what he laid out in this post,  albeit with more detail and 3,000 more words.  It is the logical business decision  because Gen Z and people of that age,  they don't go on Facebook.  They're probably going to get tired of Instagram  by the time they have purchasing power  and are going to be moving,  already have moved towards private communication  as their primary social media platform.  And the writing is on the wall.  And this is the best financial decision.  And it is trying to spin it in a way  that sounds appealing to consumers  and sounds like a privacy-focused message  and something that will distract people.

It is the backend, the advertising stuff,  the tracking aspects of it,  the shadow profiles, as you had mentioned before.  It is this whole other separate side of Facebook  that Zuckerberg doesn't address in these sort of posts.  These sort of things that he is bringing up  in his declaration, such as the one last week,  is the consumer facing platform centric decisions,  which are ultimately missing the fundamental parts  of this conversation that we're trying to have  about privacy in Facebook.

It was right out of Breitbart News  or any of the spin control mechanisms  that have been cultivated over the decades  and now are in full force in Washington, DC  in a political speech.  He's using them as a big distraction.  He's trying to control the message around Facebook  because it's gotten out of hand.  Almost everything that Facebook has ever done  that could be considered the right thing,  they've been forced by bad press to do those things.  And it's like all this talk about giving them  the benefit of the doubt,  we've been giving him the benefit of the doubt for a decade  and he's disappointed us every time.  I've never seen anything come out of Facebook  and Mark Zuckerberg that was preemptively  doing the right thing because it was the right thing.

I think the reason why he's doing this  is not because he's thinking,  oh, we have to make humanity better  and this is how, you know, he's,  I completely believe that he's seeing  the writing on the wall and he's thinking  this is where this type of tool and platform  has to go in order to survive and maybe even grow.  But I do think that Mike and maybe Paris  are being a little bit harsh.  You make it sound like he is some kind of mustache  twirling evil bond villain who's trying to  enact the most amount of damage he can.  I think he's looking at the industry and thinking,  okay, where are we going?  How can I keep my business safe?  And where do I make my money?  There is, I think, very little doubt  that this is going to be from a revenue change point,  I'm sorry, from a revenue standpoint,  a little bit more challenging to create revenue streams  or he's gonna have to switch a few things  to keep it working.  But it doesn't mean, all of this doesn't mean  that it can't also have some positive effects, right?  Or is it all dark and terrible?

I think it's very clear, and I'm not a psychologist,  I just play one on TV, that he simply is amoral.  In the same way that he's literally color blind,  I think he's blind to moral issues.  I think he just can't tell the difference  between right and wrong, but he does want to be successful.  And I think the manifesto that he laid out  in this blog post makes it very, very clear  in this sort of like wishy washy kind of a way  that he wants to be WeChat.  WeChat is so dominant in China, like, please, everybody,  read up on what it's like to try to live  without WeChat in China.  You can't get by.  1.1 billion people in China use WeChat.  Everybody uses WeChat, and that's what he clearly laid out  that he wants to do.  He wants these encrypted networks that are private  to actually be the way you pay for everything, the way-  The primary form of communication.  Yeah, it's your everything.

I think that's kind of what you guys are saying,  which is Mark, painted into a corner,  has decided to use the energy directed at him  and redirect it into something that,  and Ben Thompson has some good things to say about this.  He's saying this is both a good move for Facebook  and a good move for us.  He says Facebook's getting its privacy cake  and eating it too.  He says stop expecting companies  to act against their interests.  Facebook isn't killing their core business.  They're doing something that benefits it,  but is not inherently bad for end users.  It's reasonable that a company  could be instituting genuinely user-friendly changes,  like end-to-end encryption,  even as it furthers its own self-interests.  And then Scott Galloway,  who's been a very strong critic of Facebook  since he wrote his book, The Four,  he says, spoiler alert,  Zuck doesn't give a fart about your privacy.  Never has, never will.  When Rohingya Muslims are attacked  and a woman's right to choose is at risk  because of a Supreme Court stacked  by an illegitimate president elected by Russians  who weaponized the big blue button,  it's clear Zuck is pretty effing far  from a town called privacy.  Well written, Scott.  Maybe a little bit invective, but...  So it's a juditsu.  So look, I wanted to give, I want,  and still want to give the guy the benefit of the doubt.  There's no harm to saying, okay, Mark, put up or shut up.  You got a good idea.  We like the idea.  Let's see you do it.  And then if he doesn't do it, calling him on the carpet,  there's no harm in that.  But it is a juditsu move in the sense  that he's got these guys coming at him.  He goes, oh, yeah, and he turns all that energy  into instead of breaking up Facebook  or putting him out of business into,  oh, it's the new Facebook.  You're gonna have it.

Transcript:  It doesn't matter if he does what he said  he would do in that thing.  What he didn't say anything about  are the issues that we're all concerned about.  He didn't say anything about the tracking.  He didn't say anything about the shadow profiles.  He let us kind of project upon it  that it would be safer.  Exactly.  He didn't say, he took these side issues  that people aren't really that concerned about  and he said, oh, this is gonna be this big pivot.  In fact, why did you get off Facebook?  It's not because you didn't have any encryption.  No, it's because I didn't trust them with my data.  Exactly, and I think this blog post  is yet another reason to not trust them.  It's dripping with a sleight of hand.  He's trying to distract everybody  from all these stories that are out.  Search for Facebook on Google News  and look at the last month of scandals  that have emerged on Google News  and see how many of those scandals  he even hinted at in the blog post.  The answer is zero.

Start time: 4210.68

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think that this move is ultimately beneficial  because the crisis of moderation  that Facebook has been facing for so long,  this solves that in a way  because they don't have to have any more-  It lets them off the hook.  Underpaid moderators.  It's encrypted and perhaps in the case of,  right now I believe Australia recently passed laws  saying that apps like WhatsApp and things like that  are gonna have to build back doors  in their encryption for law enforcement to get in.  India is planning on passing a similar law.  And then, okay, law enforcement can get in,  but Facebook's hands are completely clean.  They don't have to have any more K.C. Newton articles  about how poorly they're treating their moderators  that have to look at pictures of dead people  because that's not their issue anymore.

Transcript:  He's trying to get credit for the idea  that they won't be able to read your messages,  your private messages.  But what he's not saying is like,  but we will have your phone number.  We will know who you're talking to.  We will know when you're talking to them.  We know what you buy, how much you spent,  who you're hanging out with, everywhere you go 24-7.  And we're gonna sell that to advertisers  and we're gonna monetize the crap out of all of this stuff.  He's trying to get credit for essentially a coup.  He's trying to really take over the,  right now the internet, you use this service  for paying for things and that service for that.  We have a decentralized, still, more or less,  internet in terms of the full breadth of services.  He wants to be the sole source of information.

But if there's criticism of the things that he wants to do,  there's still gonna be criticism  when he tries to become WeChat in three years  with end-to-end encrypted private messaging  and hopefully parts of the social network.

Transcript:  And having both your private messages  and a social network having this interoperability  to where some fake news that you get in a group WhatsApp  message can be shared onto your now private  and dead encrypted Facebook group with 20,000 other people  and then spread from there to your Instagram chat  that has like a hundred other friends  all without being able to track it or see it.  I think having this sort of giant walled garden  will just make things speed up on a level  that we are unable to comprehend  and would be unable to even visualize  if all of it was completely encrypted  and we were stuck inside that system.

Start time: 4489.02

And then like last night I was looking at it and said,  this is crap and I deleted it anyway  because I don't wanna see it.  I just wanted to give Mark a little signal.  But Mark, I'm onto you.  You little son of a gun.  You thought you fooled me, didn't you?  The show today brought to you by WordPress.  If you are on the internet,  even if you have a Facebook account,  you really need to have a website.  You need to have a place that you own  that you call your own,  that you could put the best things about.  In a way, I think the web is really the secret,  the antidote to Facebook, the free, the open web.  And where I hang my hat, wordpress.com.  My site leolaport.com is based on wordpress.com.  In fact, I've been a wordpress.com subscriber  for 12 years.  I actually jumped on wordpress the minute it came out  when Matt Mullenweg wrote it the first time.  I was looking for a new blogging,  a better blogging platform.  WordPress is it.  In fact, it's so successful.  One third of all the internet worldwide runs on WordPress.  One third.  Wordpress.com makes it easy.  I was hosting my own, doing all the work.  I was realizing I'm paying more than I would  for a WordPress site and doing 10 times the work.  So I moved to wordpress.com.  It's got great site building tools  You don't have to be a web expert.  No, you just have to put content up there.  Choose a theme.  There's thousands of them.  If you have any questions,  there's great support from real experts,  not just some customer service rep, but real experts 24 seven.  WordPress.com lets anyone pursue whatever it is they love  by launching a site that's free to start with room to grow.  And you can upload anything, pictures, images, video, text.  It's all yours and you can download it at any time.  It's your site.  It's you own it.  That's so important.  And if you're a business and you don't have a website,  I don't even know how you can do business that way.  No two week trials, no hidden fees.  WordPress users own their own content forever.  And it's built to grow with you.  In fact, as I've grown, I've went to the business plan  and I just love it.  Great customer support team.  WordPress is so powerful and flexible  that many of the biggest companies on earth use it  for their websites.  Fortune.com, Quartz.com.  Millions of people use WordPress.com every day  to turn their dreams into reality.  Build your presence on the net and own it  at WordPress.com slash twit.  15% off any new plan purchase, WordPress.com slash twit.  And I have to say, that's what I do  when I have the urge to post something on Facebook.  I wanna post it publicly.  I just post it on my blog.  That's where people, if you wanna know what I'm up to,  that's where I'll post my pictures.  We're going to Hawaii in a month,  that's where I'll post a picture.  I think that's a better place to do it anyway.  WordPress.com slash twit.  33% of the net runs on WordPress.  Find out why, WordPress.com slash twit.  I love this story.

She estimates, they estimate about 10,000 new millionaires  in the seven square mile district that is San Francisco.  That's incredible.  And already real estate developers are drooling.  She goes to a presentation by a real estate specialist  saying, he asked the crowd,  are we gonna see a one bedroom condo  that's worth less than a million dollars in five years?  No.  Are we gonna see single family homes  selling for one to three million dollars?  Yes.  The energy rose as he revealed more data  about new millionaires and just how few new units  have been built for them.  San Francisco's single family home sale prices  could climb to an average of five million dollars, all cash.  It's just gonna be astounding, he said.  And it makes me so sad for my little city by the Bay,  which used to be a cultural mecca, a place of diversity,  and it was interesting.  Now the diversity is either the very rich or the homeless.

I mean, not that New York is inexpensive,  but it's just going to get worse.  That's saying something.

Not moving to Mill Valley.  Let's talk, we're going to get to,  Elizabeth Warren, but I wanted to get  a few other stories in there.  You are talking in your Elgin.com blog post, Mike,  about Apple's self-driving car.  The news has been mixed about that.  Apple's laying off 200 engineers  from their self-driving car enterprise.  They're moving many others to other parts of the company.  Right.  What is Apple, are they, you know,  we'd heard that they were at first going to build a car,  then they had changed their plans and said,  no, we're going to sell services.  But I've also quoted Elon Musk who said,  you know, you really want to build a self-driving car,  you have to have both the data and the hardware.

Transcript:  He talked about cars and trucks.  He literally meant cars and trucks.  I, basically what I do is I bust 10 myths  around the Apple car.  There's a lot of myths going around.  The first one is the one you mentioned  with the layoffs, everybody's like, oh, they're, they're.  It's over.  Yeah, it's over.  So that represents 3.8% based on our best information  of the people working on Titan,  the self-driving car project at Apple, 3.8%.  When Tesla lays off 9% of their workforce,  people don't go, oh, I guess they're pivoting away from cars.  That's amazing.  That's only a few percentages.  Yeah, there's 5,000 people within Apple.  Holy cow.  Best information working on it.  Not all of them are full-time,  but they have a lot of different things.  The AI people are working on AI  and also self-driving car AI.  It's related.  Hardware design people.  So the way, and so I talk about lots and lots of things.  People say, well, they're not gonna manufacture cars.  Well, you know what, guess what?  They don't manufacture phones either.  They use a contract manufacturer.

Transcript:  And they have people, four years ago,  there was reports that about a dozen engineers  from Magna Steyr, I think it's called in Austria,  were working in their secret Sunnyville facility.  That's four years ago.  So there's no indication  that they have stopped working with Magna Steyr.  They will do a contract manufacturing vehicle.  And there's also a report coming out of Germany this week  that they are not building a car, they're building a van.  And that Apple is very focused on the interior.  For delivery?  No, for passengers.  A living room.  A living room, right?  A content consumption experience on wheels.  This is the vision I think they're gonna have.  And here's a little bit of tidbit that I love  because it was in black and white  and almost everybody really missed it.  Tim Cook said in an interview I think last year,  or within the last year and a half or so,  that Apple is looking at launching a ride service.  He essentially hinted strongly  that they were looking at that as a thing.  And I think it makes a lot of sense.  If you think about a self-driving car  built and designed by Apple, or designed by Apple,  with the whole Apple content consumption experience,  Apple virtual reality that's coming in the future,  Apple augmented reality that's coming in the future,  Apple Music, Apple This, Apple That.  It's like an Apple store.  It's an Apple living room.  It's an Apple store on wheels.  On wheels.

Transcript:  You did point out that the number of diseng...  I guess Apple's, or California's DMV report  came out on self-driving vehicles.  The number of disengagements for Apple  was so huge it disengaged,  which means a driver took over once every 1.1 miles.  That's way higher than Waymo's,  which drove for 11,000 miles.  Waymo's amazing, yeah.

Start time: 5454.58

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Waymo's amazing.  So all the 28 companies that have been given approval  by the California DMV to test self-driving cars  in California, they require all this data  and they make it public.  So Waymo's way ahead of the pack  in terms of disengagement.  California's, I mean, Apple's at the bottom.  Second to the bottom.  Uber is like every half a mile,  or every 0.4 miles they're disengaging.  What we don't know is why anybody's disengaging.  Apple, in a letter to the DMV,  said that they are very conservative on disengagements.  So we don't know why they're disengaging.  They probably just have this policy  that it's like we are not gonna have an accident.  No matter what, we don't have an accident.  That's job one.

Transcript:  That'd be my guess.  The other thing is that Apple's disengagements  have improved by a couple of orders of magnitude  from the previous year.  From 2017 to 2018, they've gotten way, way better.  That's another distraction,  because basically Apple's not trying  to beat Waymo to market.  And they will not beat Waymo to market.  Apple's not gonna go anywhere near self-driving cars  until they're ubiquitous.

Transcript:  Here's how to reverse engineer Apple's thinking on this.  Everything Apple does is either content,  is optimized for content consumption or content creation.  Their trucks are for content creation.  They have big, expensive computers  for people who make movies and things like that.  And then the iPhones and all the other products  are for content consumption and communication.  In the future, self-driving cars,  we're gonna spend lots and lots of time in self,  I'm talking 20 years from now, 30 years from now,  we're gonna spend a third of our lives in self-driving cars.  We're gonna have hotel rooms on wheels,  where you wake up in a different city  that you want to bed in, stuff like that.  Apple can either let other companies control the profits  from this content consumption experience,  or they can control it themselves.  As Apple executives have actually said, and I quote,  "'A car is the ultimate mobile device.  "'It's an inside-out iPhone on wheels.'"  It's the way they're probably looking at it.  Right, and when the car is driving you around,  there's nothing to do except play video games, watch movies.

Transcript:  I think it's lots of things.  The way I look at it is that a self-driving car is a sandwich.  It's like an airport, it might just pick you up.  Could be lots of things.  A self-driving car is a sandwich.  The bottom chassis is like batteries  with an electric motor on each of the wheels.  That's commoditizable.  In a few years that'll be nothing.  It's cheap, et cetera.  Everybody's doing it.  The top slice of bread is the self-driving car AI  that enables you to navigate and stuff like that.  What goes between that can be anything  and almost doesn't matter.  You'd be able to plug and play modules.  You have a bedroom, a game room, a this or that.  It doesn't matter.  The point is that Apple is,  the point is that there's gonna be a lot of content  being consumed in these vehicles  because there's nothing else to do.  And so the other question you have to ask yourself is,  Apple's been on this trajectory of approaching  and then declining from and then re-approaching  a trillion dollar valuation as a company.  Are they just gonna give up and lay down and go to sleep?  Or are they gonna try to keep growing?  And what consumer product do people spend  thousands and thousands of dollars on  besides iPhones and stuff like that?  Cars.

Transcript:  I can tell you.  Our show today brought to you by Atlassian.  We are an Atlassian house.  When there's a technical issue, we put it in JIRA.  JIRA is where everything goes.  You know who's responsible, you know what stage it's in,  what's going on with it.  At the same time as they're using JIRA,  they will also put it in Confluence.  They'll document the fix, they'll document the workflow.  We couldn't live without Atlassian.  Atlassian is a collaboration software company  that empowers IT teams like ours and all over the world.  It is a big deal.  If you are an IT team, you know that  in this cloud-based world,  it's you that has to plan and execute faster than ever.  The burden is on you.  Incidents require open, agile, smart coordination  between ops and software development teams.  The expectations are high, the stakes are high,  and it's IT that's right smack dab at the center.  Falling short inside of business critical workflows,  that's just not an option.  That's why so many teams like ours use Atlassian.  The company behind JIRA,  their software tools are designed to manage complex,  challenging situations like that  and keep the collaboration flowing.  By the way, I think sometimes people think  agile is just for developers.  No, Atlassian offers an affordable, reliable  suite of tools for teams of all sizes,  from DevOps to agile, IT apps to ops to ITSM,  whatever's next.  The technology backbone to help IT organizations  plan, service, and support the kind of change  that propels business.  I mentioned JIRA, I mentioned Confluence,  there's Bitbucket if you have software code base.  With OpsGenie and StatusPage,  you can help to help to detect incidents,  coordinate response efforts,  keep stakeholders and customers up to date.  All of that's so important.  They have Trello now.  I tell you, they are an amazing company.  And it all integrates seamlessly with Confluence and JIRA  so you can document it, you can keep everybody up to date  and you don't have to bounce from platform to platform  to get the job done.  I think that's really important  because it's so important that we get this documentation.  I want to make it as easy as possible  for our engineering and IT team.  Like all of Atlassian's products,  the tools for your team are easy and free to try.  And all you have to do is go to Atlassian.com slash IT  and try it, find out which tools are best for you.  Try Atlassian today to see what IT can be.  Atlassian.com slash IT.  We thank them so much for their support.  What is it the Heinlein said?  The roads must roll.  The twit must flow.

There are how many people running for president  in the Democratic party?  It's quite a large number.  There are some Republicans who have announced as well.  Elizabeth Warren, one of the front runners,  certainly she has the name recognition,  wrote a post on Medium.  Well, it says Team Warren, but it's by Elizabeth Warren.  Here's how we can break up big tech.  25 years ago, Facebook, Google, and Amazon didn't exist.  Now they're among the most valuable  and well-known companies in the world.  It's a great story, but also one that highlights  why the government must break up monopolies  and promote competitive markets.  Aren't we glad, she writes, that we now have the option  of using Google instead of being stuck with Bing?  Yes.  But today's big tech companies have too much power,  too much power over our economy, our society, our democracy,  and then the price process,  and I think this is maybe her most important point,  they've hurt small businesses and stifled innovation.  So she says her administration will make big structural  changes to the tech sector to promote competition,  including breaking up Amazon, Facebook, and Google,  and in a conversation with Neelai Patel later this week,  she said, and I'm gonna put Apple in there as well.  You can read the arguments.  I think a lot of people will have a visceral reaction  to this.  I underlined an important part of this, as did John Patel.  These companies would be prohibited from owning,  and this is something I've actually always complained about  with Google, owning both the platform utility  and any participants on that platform.  It's always bothered me that YouTube was owned by Google  and that YouTube results always showed up very high.  There's even a bar of YouTube results on Google searches.  Platform utility, she writes, would be required to meet  the standard of fair, reasonable,  and non-discriminatory dealing with users.  That's franned.  That's a little different.  That's a patent dogma.  Platform utilities would not be allowed to transfer  a shared data with third parties.  I like that.  So let's start with you, Paris.  Regardless of your political bent, is this viable?  Is this doable?

Start time: 6219.08
End time: 6351.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that this is viable,  and I think it's incredibly necessary,  especially, I think, for coming from a platform  and e-commerce perspective.  I mean, sure, people think about Amazon  as an e-commerce company,  and really, Amazon is so much more than that.  I don't think most people realize the breadth of Amazon  as a company and the things that it touches,  but I suppose if we're gonna just look  from the e-commerce niche,  Amazon's a great example of why this is necessary  and the fact that if you go search something on Amazon  and probably something in the first three results,  is going to be a product from Amazon,  either an Amazon Basics,  like let's say we search for charging cables for your iPhone.  You're probably going to have an Amazon Basics cable pop up,  or if not that, Amazon has hundreds of private label brands,  something that doesn't seem like it's being sold by Amazon  but is manufactured, shipped, and fulfilled by Amazon.  How the company does this is since it owns the platform,  you might realize, hey, a lot of people are looking  for iPhone chargers or dog hats or whatever.  We don't sell dog hats,  we're going to make an Amazon label dog hats  so that we get both the, in addition to the commission,  we'd normally make off a third party dog hat being bought,  we get the entire price of it,  we get the entire revenue from that,  and Amazon has the power to direct consumers  towards its goods and to sink its competitors  down in the search page to page two,  which means no one will see it,  much less if it was at page 15.  And this sort of power is something  that has serious consequences  for small businesses and innovators,  because why would you, if you're an entrepreneur  or a small business, why would you invest resources  into trying to figure out the next hot product  that people are going to be buying online?  Because you're going to have to go through Amazon  the minute your product ends up succeeding,  Amazon is probably going to copy it,  or copy it and then push you back to the second or third page  or push you down to search result five,  and you won't be making any money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She also talks about the predatory practices  Amazon will use, as with diapers.com,  where a company comes along,  a former, I think it was a former Amazon employee,  said, oh, I know, I'll just take, I'll focus on diapers,  Amazon immediately undercuts them,  kills his business, and then buys it.  Right.

Start time: 6369.00
End time: 6434.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Amazon's done with those hundreds of companies.  I recently, me and my colleague, Louise Matsakis,  at the end of last year, we tried to put together a list  of all the different companies that Amazon owned,  and it was one of the hardest things that we've ever done,  because it's absolutely unreal,  the hundreds and hundreds of companies that are Amazon,  and any time something comes up  that is a competitor towards it, it purchases it.  In India, in Saudi Arabia, and other places,  Amazon has bought the Amazon equivalents,  and most recently, India passed  one of the strictest e-commerce regulations  aimed at breaking up the monopolies of companies  like Amazon or Walmart when it comes to e-commerce,  and even that has kind of only had mixed effects  on the company.  It's required Amazon to reduce its stakes,  how much it owns of these third-party entities  that it sells on its site,  but still, Amazon has so much market share  that it's able to kind of get around  even some of the strictest regulations.  So it's kind of a hook.

Start time: 6435.02
End time: 6467.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, and the algorithmic,  Leo downplayed what they did.  Undercut pricing sounds like,  oh, they have competitive pricing, that's a good thing.  No, they were using really sophisticated algorithms  to, in real time, undercut the price  of literally every product on diaper.com  to always be lower no matter what,  no matter how much money,  they don't care about losing money,  they're making money in other places,  and it's like literally they could just drive  any company out of business.  It's almost a classic monopoly,  use of monopoly power.  But on steroids, because it's all algorithmic,  and now they have AI.  He says, she says-

Start time: 6467.30
End time: 6482.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because Amazon makes almost all of its profits  from AWS, and it has a total stronghold  on the cloud services market,  it can sell everything on Amazon,  and generally does, for a loss if it wanted to,  and still be able to make a bunch of profits.

Transcript:  She says we would spin off Amazon's marketplace,  Google's ad exchange, Google search,  they would be called platform utilities,  Amazon marketplace and basics,  Google's ad exchange and businesses  and the exchange would be split apart.  Google search would have to be spun off.  She would split off Zappos and Whole Foods from Amazon.  She would unwind the Facebook acquisition  of WhatsApp and Instagram.  She would take away Google's Waze, Nest,  and DoubleClick, which is their ad platform.  She says unwinding these mergers  will promote healthy competition in the market,  will put pressure on big tech companies  to be more responsive to user concerns about privacy.  I have to say my first reaction was,  oh hell no, because it feels like you're,  and I think we have this in this country sometimes,  you're punishing them for being too successful,  saying is that what went wrong, the tree got too big?  But I have to say the arguments you just gave, Paris,  are a really perfect example of why it's not good  for society if a company owns too much

Start time: 6542.14
End time: 6608.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and gets too big.  But it's worse than that because as Paris was alluding,  the problem is that our laws are based on a world where,  okay so there's a company and you buy products from them  and if they get too big and then you could break them up  and then it's a one-to-one relationship  between the customer and the company.  In this case, there's no pressure that the public can put  on Amazon when they don't even know  that the companies they're buying from are Amazon,  and they don't understand that the profits they make  from AWS are enabling them to lose money  on all kinds of markets until they crush it,  in which case, at which point in time they raise prices.  There was a study done where they did this  in certain narrow academic markets for books  where they basically undercut these books  and to the point the publishers that they were competing  with, to the point where the publishers went out of business  and as soon as the publishers went out of business,  they quadrupled their prices.  For that category, I mean that's the kind of thing.  Even if they don't do it, they have the power to do it  and should they have the power to do it  and that's problematic.

We must give people more control,  this is what we were talking about earlier,  about how their personal information is collected,  shared and sold and do it in a way that doesn't lock in  massive competitive advantages for the companies  that already have a ton of our data.

I'm also very surprised that you all seem to be  in favor of it.  That's another thing I wasn't expecting.  But overall, I'm not sure that how doable it is,  but I think it almost doesn't matter.  The key takeaway I have from this is that  this is now in the conversation.  This is a concern for the American public,  for the American political scene.  And even if it doesn't happen,  even if she doesn't become the Democratic nominee,  even if she doesn't, even if she does  and she changes things when she actually gets into office,  it's kind of putting it in the public consciousness  in a way that I think until six months ago  would have been unimaginable, maybe going back a year.  And until she actually put it in that medium post,  I don't think people would have think was possible.  So creating that conversation.  It's a great point.

Transcript:  So many Overton windows are being shattered  in American political discourse.  Overton window is the range of topics  that is socially acceptable to even raise and question.  And a few years ago, you couldn't even suggest  something like this, but now everybody's taking it seriously.  And the chances that Elizabeth Warren  will become president in 2020,  I don't know what the chances are,  but it almost doesn't matter  because they're building a Democratic party platform.  So even-  It might end up on the platform.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's probably true.  What Americans are not thinking a lot about,  on the other hand, just to play devil's advocacy,  I mean, personally, I agree with Patrick  in the sense that I don't care.  If they break up Facebook and some of our other,  and Google and some of our beloved companies,  Apple, et cetera, a lot of people's instinctive reaction  is to say, I love their products, I love this company,  I don't want them to be harmed.  But if there were three Apples, that wouldn't be terrible  and all the shareholders would now be the owners of three-  Actually, could it create more value?  I mean, Alphabet did it voluntarily, sort of.  But the larger implication is that  these companies are global giants.  I mean, Facebook, Google, Amazon's becoming a global giant,  Apple's obviously a global giant.  Somebody's gonna be a global giant.  And if we dismantle the American global giants,  then the Chinese global giants  are gonna become the new global giants.  And we gotta think about whether we want that.  And I wish Europe would step up in terms of,  there's so much technology in Europe,  but the funding and other cultural aspects  of the startup culture aren't happening.  So where's the French Google?  Where's the German Facebook?  Where is the-  And why isn't there?

Transcript:  We ask ourselves that question all the time.  I have no idea what I'm talking about,  but I think there is a lot of market size  that is problematic.  In Europe, even though we try to create a single market,  and we have in many ways,  the language barrier is one thing.  Then even with the harmonization of laws,  there are still variations with different parts of the EU.  In the US and in China, you can start your business  and immediately have access to, what is it?  250 million customers.  It's a little bit more complicated for us.  So I think that plays into it.  I also think as much as it pains me to say it,  our tax regimen, or however you're gonna call it,  is maybe a little bit less friendly  to aggressive entrepreneurship.  That's possible.  But we have now lived in a world where we have,  as we call them in France, the GAFAM,  so Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft,  are ruling the world.  We know what it looks like,  we know what the positive things are,  we know what the negative things are.  I think it would necessarily be a horrible thing  to try out, try breaking them down and seeing what happens.  And maybe it would open up,  we were a little bit slow in Europe and in other countries  to get on the internet train,  and maybe it was too late when the things we realized  and the companies were already there  and choking the competition out of everyone else.  Maybe that could reignite a little bit of competition  in other countries as well.  Honestly, I don't know what would happen,  but I think we know where we are now,  and there are some, I could be convinced  that we should try it out, I guess.

Socialism doesn't mean anything.  So when you're talking about Europe,  you're really talking socialism in Europe  or social democracy, it's still the open market,  you still have like, it's essentially California,  more or less.

Transcript:  Here's what I meant by that though,  is the kind of anti-entrepreneurial climate,  and what you left out as something LaHuique Lemaire  has always bemoaned a French entrepreneur  who lives in the US is just the lack  of a venture funding economy and culture in Europe  means it's hard to get a startup  because it's hard to raise the money.  And also somewhat of a culture that fears failure  in a way that supposedly Silicon Valley does not.  More traditional culture.  But my point was not so much that,  it's just that let's not,  here's what I think the risk of what Warren is proposing  is that we will create an environment much like Europe  where it's harder to create a giant, we discourage it,  but then there are countries who don't discourage it  like China, and all of a sudden,  Alibaba dominates world commerce.  And all of a sudden, Baidu becomes the world's  search engine slash advertising engine  because they don't stop their capitalistic enterprises,  oddly enough, even though they're a communist country.  I mean, isn't that a risk that we could,  and then of course, a lot of very wealthy people will say,  and also disincentes us to create big successful companies  because we know you're just going to take it away from us  if we get too big.

Transcript:  I mean, I suppose it is a risk.  Go ahead, Paris.  Oh, continue.  I mean, I suppose that it is a risk,  but there is, these arguments were also made  when the breakup of standard oil was under consideration,  which of course did set off a large chain reaction  of increasing antitrust legislation  and company breaking up decisions from the Supreme Court,  which eventually created the backlash of deregulation  that led to these tech giants.  If you guys haven't, or if listeners haven't listened to it,  Planet Money, NPR's podcast did a really great  three-part podcast special on antitrust  that goes from standard oil to the backlash  to the tech giants of today that is so fantastic.  And it covers all of this in depth,  which is really aptly timed  for the Elizabeth Warren announcement.  But I think that we're at a point  where current antitrust legislation  and the mindset among these regulators  is less about actively kind of policing  these kinds of collections of power  that previously we would have thought of  as needing regulation.  And it's more about, is there any physical sign  that this is negatively impacting consumers in a way like,  oh, can we look at it and see we're getting worse prices  on goods that we buy because Amazon exists,  but that doesn't take into account the kind of new reality  where these things are not as easily,  they're not as transparent.  We can't see what competition would be like  if we didn't have Amazon because Amazon is the reality.  And I guess in the same in regards to search engines  and Google or Facebook and Microsoft,  it's kind of just created a bubble that we live in  where there's really no argument otherwise.

Transcript:  I think there's this conversation,  I mean, Paris seems the most convinced  that maybe it would be beneficial to break them up.  I think Mike and I are maybe on the fence,  maybe you too, Leo.  But I think this conversation is a conversation  that can happen.  Most people that would say,  oh, this would be absolutely terrible  and this party saying this or that party  is not looking at the situation as it is.  There are big companies and then there are companies  that are literally, we have a saying in French,  they're doing the rain and nice weather.  Basically they're controlling the world.  They are not just big companies, they are gigantic  and they have influences in every aspect of the economy,  our lives, the political life, everything.  And I think if you look at this  and don't even stop to think about that question,  should we break them up,  then your reasoning is not motivated  by a cold look at the situation,  it might be motivated by some political dogma.  The conversation is and the question are valid  to ask and to discuss.  Whether or not the answer is absolutely yes  or absolutely no, I don't know,  but we're in a situation where this is something  that should be discussed.

Transcript:  And Patrick's right, I am on the fence,  I'm both against it and in favor of it  and I'm not really, it's a complicated issue,  but let me put on a tinfoil hat for a second  and just ask a rhetorical question.  Let's say we are in 2020, we have a Republican  who's dead set against breaking up the social networks  and we have a Democratic candidate who says,  when I'm president, I am going to break them up.  What would it take for Facebook to tweak their algorithm  to make sure the Republican was elected?  And would we know?

My only concern is actually the political concern,  whether it's too fast, too far for the American people.  I feel like the Democrats are emboldened,  progressives are emboldened by Trump's presidency  and hoping that a reaction, there'll be such a reaction  against Trump that they can finally get through  a bunch of progressive legislation that's been stalled  for decades.  I think that's right.  And it may be a mistake.  It might actually be the wrong thing to do.  And I just don't know.

I have a feed on my silly 27 column tweet deck thing  of people on kind of the right wing conspiracy  watching world and a lot of them were at CPAC.  And we're talking about, I don't know if you saw,  there was one CPAC panel that was called like blocked,  a conversation on center.  This panel has been blocked by Facebook  or something like that, a conversation about censorship.  And this outrage is no more present than it is  in these conservative circles when it comes to the power  of big tech, this is the largest boogeyman.

Transcript:  This idea of regulation and an overbearing government  as it faces corporations is kind of a 20th century argument  to what's actually happening in real life,  whether we like it or not.  And regardless of which side of the political spectrum  anyone is on, there's a huge balance of power being shifted  from governments and the public to corporations  and a bunch of billionaires who individually  have and wield enormous power.  Jeff Bezos has the Washington Post and a space program.  The individuals have more power now  than we ever even imagined  and it's just gonna continue and continue.  So I think this is one of the first examples  of a clumsy attempt to deal with the fact  that corporations are becoming more powerful than government.  And I think from a big picture perspective,  we have to deal with the really larger issue.  It's not just tech companies,  it's corporations in general running the government  and having more power than the government.  And what does that mean for the power of the people  if we believe in democracy?

In other words, they just said,  look, we don't think it's safe, so you can't use it.  The ban prevents us from serving our US customers,  says Huawei, damages our reputation, true,  and deprives us of an opportunity to serve customers  outside the United States.  It violates separation of power principles,  breaks US legal traditions,  and goes against the very nature of the US Constitution.

There's a lot of conversation about how it's unfair  and how there's no evidence,  and everything they say is complete BS,  and here's why.  They say, oh, we wouldn't do such a thing,  we haven't done such a thing, it doesn't matter.  The Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese government  wants to take control of whatever they're doing  with their 5G networks, they will, and they can.  This is a country that builds islands  in order to steal territorial waters.  We all know that routers and network equipment  like 5G, whatever they call them.  Switches and routers, yeah.  These things are constantly being software updated.  Software updates can have any sort of payload.  If those are coming from Beijing and the Chinese government  were in a conflict with them in the future,  they could just have access to all internet traffic,  they could shut anything down,  they could do any of these things.  I think every, I personally support the US government  on this score, simply because I don't trust  the Chinese government, and I think they're a little too eager  to own all the 5G equipment in the future.  That's just such a choke point  on the whole world's information infrastructure,  and I just don't like them having that kind of access.

Speaking of Monopoly, Amazon is teaming up with the Yankees,  Sinclair Broadcasting, and others,  to buy the Yankees Sports Network  from 20th century Fox.  In fact, somebody has said, and I think it's probably true,  I think it was on MacBreak Weekly,  it was Alex Lindsay who said,  "'You ain't seen nothing yet when the NFL,  "'Major League Baseball, and NBA contracts run out.  "'Broadcasters are going to face outsized bids  "'from Netflix, Amazon, Google, and others.'"  Facebook, that could buy television rights.  They're all gonna go to tech companies.  Yeah.

You know, I feel bad for Elon because  here SpaceX did this great thing with the Dragon Crew rocket.  They successfully got it to the space station.  It's gonna be coming down.  That should have been the headline.  Instead, it's Elon getting fined by the SEC again.

Transcript:  The funniest part of this is that I think,  what was it, in Jack's Twitter thread or something,  maybe it was the one that he did with Kara Swisher.  Maybe it was a different interview.  Somebody asked him,  who's your ideal of the best Twitter user?  And he said, Elon Musk.  Elon Musk.  Musk is the per-I-am ideal of a good Twitter user.  I'm like, what are you thinking about your platform, Jack?  I mean, I guess he-  It's good for Jack.  He's got a lot of headlines.  It's good for Jack.  Is it good for anyone else?  It's not good for Elon.  It's not good for Tesla.  Not good for us and our sanity.

Transcript:  Yeah.  The SEC asked a judge to fine him in contempt  for violating the settlement  by failing to clear a February tweet  with the attorney appointed to be his Twitter sitter.  What does this guy do?  You know what's ironic?  That Elon has a Twitter sitter,  but nobody can stop the president from tweeting.  Nobody.  Maybe he needs a Twitter sitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They are.  But I think the quote you're talking about,  about Elon Musk came from Sam Harris,  if I'm not mistaken.  And they also talk about Trump's tweeting  and how he violates terms of service, et cetera.  And the argument was that,  well, we take into account newsworthiness.  Everything the president of the United States says in public  is newsworthy and therefore that Trump's.

Start time: 8280.62
End time: 8302.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and it should, honestly.  If you want to talk about weaseling out of something.  Their responsibilities.  Yes, sure, it is newsworthiness.  But the reality is you can't get away with  banning the president of the United States from Twitter.  That's the problem.  It's not about newsworthiness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, honestly, the Twitter sitter should come from.  To protect. Trump's own people.  Exactly.  Because he's, well, anyway.  Yeah, anyway.  Let's not get political.  I think we can wrap this up.  You guys are a great panel,  and I brought the biggest stories,  I think in some respects of the year,  and you handled them with aplomb and intelligence,  and I always count on that.  It's so great to have you.  Paris Martineau is a staff writer at Wired.  Her byline is always worth reading at wired.com.  I paid for my subscription just for you, Paris.

Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I think the thing I'd want to plug  is probably my Twitter handle,  at Paris Martineau, which is on the screen.  I've been tweeting a little bit less than usual,  as of late, mostly because I've been working  on this big investigation for the past two months  that I can't exactly say too much about,  except for that you'll probably hear about it  when it comes out,  and it will hopefully be next week or this week,  and I'll tweet about it, so follow me there,  and we can talk about it more when that's online.

Transcript:  I am grateful to Wired,  and now it makes me happy that I paid for the subscription,  that they're willing to put the money into assigning people  to something that's going to take months to develop.  I think that's the kind of news gathering we need  from the big news gathering organizations.  I'm glad to see that Wired has that resolve.

You can find it there, and we talk about tech every week.  But if you speak English, I have a couple of shows.  Pixels is, if you're a gamer,  go check out Pixels, really fun show.  And if you enjoy talking people from different backgrounds,  different cultures, the Phileas Club,  go to Frenchspin.com for the spelling,  is a show where I get people from different countries,  different, well, different cultures, as I said,  to sit together every month  and different people every time.  And we talk about the state of the world,  and sometimes it's depressing,  and we try to have fun anyway.  We don't always manage,  but we really try to have people  from all sides of discussions.  And that includes people with whom I disagree vehemently  very often, but I still listen to and respect.

Transcript:  Can I plug one other thing?  Yeah.  So my son, Kevin Elgin, is in the house.  I see Kevin.  He's a smart one in the family.  He's an entrepreneur.  And he's creating a revolution  in technology education for kids.  You've got a smart speaker that doesn't track kids,  that they build themselves physically.  It's a cardboard thing.  And then they teach it to talk.  It demystifies AI.  Oh, that's great.  It teaches social skills  because they have to understand what is clear speech  and so on.  It's a brilliant product.  Go to hellochatterbox.com, sign up for his newsletter.  He's got a Kickstarter coming out pretty soon.  And the list will keep you informed about the newsletter.  So I wanna plug that  because this is really important for the future of the world.  We gotta educate kids about technology.  And this is the first generation.  23% of American households  now have a smart speaker in the house.  Kids are learning that there's this AI presence  and they're being taught to respect it,  which they shouldn't.  They're being taught to obey it, which they shouldn't.  His technology will teach them that it's just an appliance  that they control.  And it's a very healthy thing.  So anyway, hellochatterbox.com.  Hello, Learn a Little Tech on the side.
