Transcript:  There seem to be suddenly a lot of gaming laptops,  Lenovo's Legion, that, I see a lot of companies  that aren't normally known for, I mean,  you don't think of Lenovo and gaming,  but a lot of gaming laptops coming out now all of a sudden.

Start time: 346.26
End time: 351.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They've been doing that for a while,  but I don't think anybody's paying attention.  Oh, maybe that's it.  Everyone's trying, it's the hot market, yeah.

Start time: 351.48
End time: 420.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it couldn't be a hotter market.  Everybody's stuck at home, what are you going to do?  Meanwhile, I'm playing Animal Crossing.  Anybody wants to visit my island,  I'll give you my dream code.  So depressing, so sad.  Speaking of gaming, oh, Stadia, Stadia,  more coming out about Google's streaming gaming surface.  Couple of weeks ago, they closed down  their own independent game laboratory,  laying off hundreds, including Jade Raymond,  who is a legendary game designer.  She was running the Toronto Ubisoft studio.  She went over to Google one year later, she's gone.  This is the article at Bloomberg by Jason Schreier,  Google Stadia problem, a video game unit  that's not Google-y enough.  He talks about, I mean, just Google doesn't do content,  really, and didn't really understand the idea  of creating gaming content.  I mean, seriously, if you buy an independent gaming studio  and you expect a game in a year, you're not...  You're smoking something.

Start time: 421.00

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh my gosh, no.

Start time: 422.40
End time: 443.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think they're also really bad  at consumer products in general.  I feel like I've brought this up so many times on this show,  but Google does not have enough faith in its products  to keep them around, even something like Google Reader,  which was kind of niche, but you can look at a whole bunch  of things, everything that happened at Nest,  which kind of fell apart, but I guess is kind of  hung together now.  They're not great for consumer products.

Start time: 443.70
End time: 450.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hung together is not like what you call  a prosperous company.  Yeah, we're hanging together, it's okay.  We're not...  It's a little shaky.

Start time: 451.96
End time: 492.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they do okay with some consumer hardware, but...  The Pixel phones are okay, right?  They're okay.  I mean, I think that there is a commitment issue.  There's a commitment issue that sometimes,  but I think they're still committed to sort of Pixel phones,  but I think the point you made about the gaming software,  just the game, this is years.  I mean, literally we've heard of games being developed  for over a decade.  So, I don't know what their expectations were there,  but the competition's too strong in the gaming space  and if they weren't fully committed,  and clearly they weren't.  And Google, by the way, is really good  at pulling the plug on things.  I mean, how many things do they shutter a year?

Start time: 494.24
End time: 528.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's sad because I think that they were...  The independent division under Stadia  was trying to develop stuff, not as every other game company  is doing developing stuff for consoles and PCs  and every platform, but specifically for a cloud platform  where you could use AI, you could say,  I want several servers.  You had a lot more opportunities  to do different kinds of games.  Unfortunately, this Bloomberg story only describes one.  One prototype was described as a cross  between a Google Assistant and a Tamagotchi pet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  when you were a kid, didn't you?  I did for a moment.

Start time: 539.78
End time: 555.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But what I think is interesting is that they don't take  advantage of their ecosystem.  So if you're gonna launch a gaming system,  why not take advantage of YouTube games  and all your stars playing gamers?  Well, that was the plan, wasn't it?  I mean, there is...  You're not getting enough time to even go there,  which it just doesn't make sense.

Start time: 555.76
End time: 568.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There is a feature that allows you to pick up a game  where your superstar YouTuber left off, right, Devendra?  So he could say, okay, I've got you up to this point.  Take it away.  That's cool.  They promised a lot.

Start time: 568.60
End time: 607.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's cool.  Like in theory, Stadia was a really cool concept  and we had seen cloud gaming before  and they had so many ideas.  Like, oh, we have solved all the issues with cloud gaming.  The latency, don't have to worry about it, right?  Cause your controller connects over Wi-Fi,  which goes directly to the server.  It seemed like they had a good pitch,  but it's not just the games you do.  I think Google just fundamentally didn't know  what to do with Stadia, right?  It launched in a weird beta.  It wasn't quite ready.  That feature, the pickup from somebody else's  stream feature isn't here.  So I don't know why Stadia exists.  And it's a fundamental problem of, right,  you have to buy these games.  You have to buy these games from Google.

Start time: 607.70
End time: 617.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you don't really own them,  cause if Stadia goes under, and who knows if you will,  then Assassin's Creed is gone.  Even though you spent 60 bucks,  just like you would if you bought a disc.

Start time: 619.28
End time: 624.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Amazon's lunatic thing is the subscription,  and that's the way I think everybody expects.

Start time: 625.10
End time: 659.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I just wonder if Google took a look  at what Microsoft's doing and just realized  that they couldn't compete.  It can be not just with X-Club,  but the number of how many different game developers  has Microsoft bought up?  I mean, it's pulled so much in-house.  It has so much raw power on the development side  and on the cloud side.  And I think that maybe Google was making  a really smart business decision,  although they haven't shuttered Stadia,  but I think we should maybe take bets  on whether or not Stadia's around a year or two from now.

Start time: 659.98
End time: 680.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It feels like they plucked defeat from the jaws of victory.  Because when Cyberpunk 2077 came out,  it was bugged on consoles,  unless you had the latest generation.  People couldn't play it on PC,  but it actually played fine on Stadia streaming.  It was the one place where you could  experience that game.

Start time: 681.78
End time: 686.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the PC side played pretty well too.  Did it? Was it okay?  So it was really just the older generation consoles

Start time: 686.38

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that were, they were given refunds.

Transcript:  It's still not on the PlayStation Store.  It's ridiculous.  It's crazy.

Start time: 694.10
End time: 705.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it was an opportunity.  I mean, people like me, I was playing it on Stadia.  It was an opportunity to get to an audience  and then, you know,  and they could have won Shira over with Tamagotchis.

Start time: 706.00
End time: 710.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Come on.  You had me at Tamagotchis.  I deserve a shot.  They're so cute.

Start time: 711.06
End time: 721.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I have no grounds.  I just admitted I play Animal Crossing.  I have no grounds at all to mock anything.  I had a Tamagotchi when they were,  cause my kids had one.  I had one.  We all did.

Start time: 721.94
End time: 724.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh my God, he's got one.  Oh my God.  Are you for real?

Start time: 725.06
End time: 730.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So are you for real, Lance Uelina?  What did you have that on your shelf?  You just pulled it right off.

Start time: 730.90
End time: 761.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did.  It's been sitting, cause we had a couple.  My kids had them.  The kids had them.  My kids had them.  The batteries are long dead, right?  I have not fed this guy in a while  and done anything with him.  Oh, he's still alive.  Oh, he's so sad looking.  Yeah, I know.  I know he's inside.  What do you put new batteries in every couple of years?  Just to make him suffer?  Probably, look, you know, when you're trapped at home,  you start going through drawers and pulling stuff out  and you start putting batteries and things  and it's been sitting.  So basically it's been sitting there on my shelf ever since.

Start time: 762.00
End time: 773.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh my God.  Yeah.  That's impressive.  So for those, and I think it's probably the vast majority  of our listeners who have no idea we're talking about Shira,  what is a Tamagotchi?

Start time: 774.04
End time: 786.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like a little virtual animal  that you have to take care of.  So for people who are like debating  whether they'll be good parents, get a Tamagotchi.  And already I knew when I was like 10  that I would be a late bloomer as a parent.

Start time: 788.08
End time: 804.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's already the worst of both worlds.  You don't get the cuddling or the affection  or the love of an animal,  but you do have to feed them on a regular basis.  Shake them to play with them.  Yeah.  I guess it's still around.  Now an iPad.  They poop, do Tamagotchis poop?

Start time: 804.82
End time: 818.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah, I think they do.  I kind of forget, honestly, like it's,  my memory is not very good around the Tamagotchi.  I just remembered it was like in a cute little egg type  of accessory and you could put it on your key chain.

Transcript:  When you're listening to Twit,  you never know what's gonna happen.  It's because partly early in the year like this,  it's not a lot of news really.  Should we talk about Twitter?  I think you guys are all, tell you what,  you all in on the Twitter, prepare your Twitter thoughts.  There's some stuff going on, including Jack says,  we've found a way we're gonna have subscribers.  We've found a way to make people pay for Twitter,  to which Lance Yulianoff says, never.  We'll get to that in just a second.  It's gonna be a fun time.  Great panel, Lance Yulianoff, Shira Lazar,  the vendor Hardwar.  Our show today brought to you by something  I know you guys know all about, Udacity,  is an amazing story.  Sebastian Thrun was actually at Google,  and he realized, this back in the early part of the decade,  2011 I think, 2012,  he realized that the companies like Google, Microsoft,  Amazon needed technical workers, people with real skills,  but these skills weren't being taught in schools.  He said, there's gotta be a way  to prepare the modern workforce, and he created Udacity.  It's like audacity without the A.  Udacity is the world's fastest, most efficient way  to master the skills tech companies want.  I think actually it was right at the beginning  they did the first nano degree, and it was with Google.  The nano degree program is a unique  online educational offering designed to bridge the gap  between learning and your career goals.  You're gonna get a suite of skills  that are guaranteed employable because they're created  by the companies who need people to do these things.  Udacity partners with industry leaders and experts  who understand the in-demand skills  that are applicable to the job market they really need.  Once you enroll as a student in a specific course,  you'll be prompted to view the online course,  see the videos, and they're well produced, very clear,  taught by real experts who are excellent teachers,  but, and I think this is super important,  you don't just sit and watch,  you have to complete a series of projects.  Don't be scared off.  This is honestly the way to learn this stuff.  You know, I've done all kinds of online courses,  and the ones where I just sit and watch,  I think I feel like, oh, I know how to do that,  and then when I really have to sit down and do it, I can't.  I love the ones like the Udacity courses  where you actually have to learn by doing.  And what's great about Udacity is with your project,  you're gonna be reviewed by qualified professionals.  If you need help, and you will,  because you're learning, you get real human help,  personalized code reviews if it's a programming course,  and access to qualified mentors,  and it's really important 24-7,  because people are taking these courses,  many of them have day jobs, it's all over the world,  160 countries, 13 million registered users.  And so it's gotta work with your schedule, and it does.  It does.  They've completed 1.3 million plus projects,  150,000 nanodegrees,  just to give you some idea of the scale of this.  It's the most, I think the most successful  online learning you can get.  It's incredible.  They even have free courses  that'll help you build your portfolio on GitHub.  Very important if you're a programmer or LinkedIn.  They do have non-programming classes in marketing,  product management, tech-adjacent roles.  They, of course, have classes in the most in-demand skills,  like AI and cloud computing.  You wanna develop self-driving vehicles?  They've got autonomous systems classes.  They've got data science classes.  These are industry-leading programs  built and recognized by top companies worldwide.  IBM works with them.  Microsoft, Google, of course, AWS.  All over the world, people are getting great jobs.  They're learning great skills.  I did, you know what?  I'm not looking for work.  I still took the courses,  because it's so much fun.  I've taken their Python.  In fact, I'm looking at their second level,  their intermediate Python course now.  The projects, you know, I hate to say you have to do a project  because I know sometimes that scares people,  but seriously, it's fun,  and it's the only way to learn it, to be honest with you.  And there's some great Udacity free courses, too,  if you just wanna get some sense of what they do.  Flexible payment options.  You can learn at your own pace and schedule.  I always like to use some examples,  like this guy, Francisco Gutierrez.  Couldn't afford a four-year degree.  He was a technical, he was interested in technology,  and he wanted a better life for his family.  He took programming classes at the community college,  but they never really translated into getting a job.  He participated in a program Udacity has,  the Grow with Google Udacity Challenge.  Got a full scholarship  for the mobile web specialist nano degree.  Mobile web specialist.  It took him step by step.  Got an internship at Microsoft.  He is now a full-time software engineer at Microsoft.  They offered him a full-time job, all because of Udacity.  It's a great story.  There are lots of them on the page.  If you go to udacity,  U-D-A-C-I-T-Y.com slash twit today.  Technology is disrupting enterprises  across every industry.  Check out Udacity for Enterprise  and upskill your workforce too.

Transcript:  Yeah, look, I get it.  That Twitter has to grow.  It has to, they have plans to get more people  using the service and they want to make more money.  They want to increase revenues by a lot.  And they also want to compete  in this new sort of creator game.  If you notice on all the platforms,  including TikTok,  they now are sort of identifying so-called creators,  which gives them an opportunity  to make money on the platform.  So it's very exciting.  You really don't have that opportunity.  I mean, it's really not that kind of space.  And I've been on it, I don't know, 2007,  so however many years that is.  And it's still my favorite social media.  Now, super follows would give me the idea  to create sort of a supra version of my Twitter content.

So this, again, when you look at subscribers  and so when we talk about something like Substack,  with people doing newsletters  and now getting people to pay a yearly subscription fee  for this special information.  So imagine on Twitter, you've got specialized tweets  or you've got your private concerts  or you've got special photos.  Or maybe I charge you for doodles  that I was trying to put with my original experience.

Transcript:  Yeah, a little bit.  It's all in that sort of same mix.  And I guess I feel like, look,  and I'm also not that guy.  I don't have enough followers  to really monetize what I'm doing there.  I mean, you need a scale.  There's a bigger conversation to have here.  We have a ton of people flooding to Substack,  all these journalists saying,  I'm starting my own newsletter.  You're gonna pay for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's interesting is I've been on Review for years.  Oh, really?  I have a newsletter on Review.  Yeah, I mean, it's small, but I've been doing it.  It's a place where I just kind of talk.  My newsletter is sort of free form.  But yeah, all of this is moving in direction  of finding a way to have a section of Twitter  be sort of this special premium area  where you can pay to get more.  If you like Steve Martin's tweets,  Steve Martin to go on Twitter, he's funny, right?  But he's gonna be even funnier in the Super Bowl.  If you pay him money.  Right, right.  I guess I feel, look, I'm very lucky to have.

Transcript:  Do we know anybody who is doing it?  It's in my head.  It's too soon.  No, no, I think I've not seen anything.  I'm checking to see if there's something in my Twitter  that would say, hey, you have this opportunity.  By the way, they integrated Review fast.  I already had a pop-up that said,  oh, because if you do a Twitter thread,  they know that you like to write.  So they're like, oh, we have a newsletter product now.  How about you do that?  So Twitter's getting more proactive about this stuff.  I just think that for most people,  super followers, it's not gonna be a thing  because most people don't have enough followers  to really monetize in a way that makes sense  unless you charge a whole lot for premium Tweet  or Twitter content and then it better be great.  So I made a so-called promise yesterday, I believe,  where I said, I will never charge you for my tweets.  And then if you beat all the way to the end,  I said, probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's something I'm thinking about a lot.  I watched the ABC News documentary about OnlyFans  and I think it is fascinating, these platforms  are allowing you just the freedom to do this.  The thing is, what's that extra thing  that you're gonna do and how do you scale it?  And is the platform the right platform to do that  for discovery and everything?  And so I do think, Twitter is actually  one of my favorite platforms still  because I feel like they're not hiding your tweets.  There's no algorithm.  It's easy to get in front of people  which other platforms have lost.  That's really true.  And yeah, that's what I wish other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I feel like it's the one place I feel  like I still have engagement  and I know that people will see it  and if you add the right hashtags,  it gets grouped in there for discovery.  So it's like, but then what would that thing be?  That would be the extra thing like Lance said  that would get people to pay for that.  Like it would need to be above and beyond what you do  and then that's also more work.  And then you're putting in the effort hoping for more back.  And so it's always the thing that you need to think about  and I think every platform you're gonna see that,  Clubhouse, you're gonna see a monetization capability.  Obviously we have it on Twitter.  We have it on YouTube.  Like you have tips or you could also do subscription.  It's like, how much more can you do and create?  How many hours do you have in the day?  You just need to be smart about and strategize  and it really depends on your brand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is.  I think that we need to be able to scale what we do  without it being every hour, right?  Like how is it?  Yes.  Like right now for me, I need to be there to create.  How can you put in two hours and get six hours from that?  Right.  That's the question.  It's like so, and that's where I see like building products.  Like, you know, if you build a product in e-commerce  but then you also have to upfront like a startup,  you need to upfront to develop that product,  to produce it, to put Facebook ads  or Instagram ads against it.  It's like $50,000.

You know, you do that clubhouse, you go all in,  you build a few thousand people listening to  or even just a thousand.  You go to Substack and then you're selling them  on Substack and it was just like,  in my head it all makes sense,  but then it's just like, oh my God.  When does it end?

It's like, it feels like everybody's expected to be creator  and everybody's expected to bust their ass.  And they're just, I think everybody under 30 is,  maybe I'm wrong, but I feel like it's feeling  this intense pressure to produce.

Start time: 1718.18
End time: 1740.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but then there's always new crops  and generations of talent who are young.  I mean, it's the same thing for the acting industry  or Hollywood.  The reason why it's a young industry  is because you still have that energy  and you still have that naivete to go into things  that are, when you're a bit older,  you see the writing on the wall  and then you start thinking about family  and sustainability and your energy.  It's just a bit of a different mentality.

Start time: 1741.70
End time: 1788.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think the danger here, by the way,  is that a lot of this stuff just looks easy.  Being an Insta celebrity,  just like I'm just taking some photos,  just chilling with my friends,  just like taking photos of my food.  But you watch people, especially my younger family,  who, oh, they wanna frame their Instagram photos perfectly.  So we order something when we used to go to restaurants  and it would be five minutes before they could  actually eat it because they would spend all the time  perfectly framing everything  and adding some lighting and whatnot.  And as a slightly older millennial,  I'm on these platforms, but I'm not driven for that.  I'm driven for other reasons,  but I am worried about this.  I know it's so easy.  It used to be stardom.  People assumed, oh, this requires a lot of work.  I have to get to Hollywood.  I have to do other things.  You have to be driven in one way to do that.  I feel like it's a-  Now it's just simple.

They're busy working their ass off in an Amazon warehouse.  I mean, but I think it's a larger symptom  of a real economic problem in this country for sure,  and maybe even globally, where you have to have  two jobs to survive.  You have to have that side hustle just to survive.  And I just feel like we're gonna hit a wall.  This is not a positive thing.

Transcript:  What I was gonna say is I was wondering  if it was just America, because I feel like here,  it's like how many followers you have.  You could have any type of business  and it's not even a creator anymore.  It's like how many followers does your business have?  And I feel like it is a North America phenomenon.  Other places, of course, this is a global network,  but in other places, your worth isn't based  around that necessarily.  If you are in Italy and you're like,  hey, I have 10,000 Instagram followers,  I'm gonna be like, f-  Like, f-  Who cares?  I find cool.  Like in France, you know?  But there is something to be said about Canada and the US,  our obsession with this type of notoriety.

Start time: 1896.96
End time: 1929.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that is, it goes back to,  because in Canada, we are so close to America  where it was like the American dream, right?  And so the new dream is the social media DIY dream.  And it also goes back to being your own boss,  getting into the crypto space.  It's all connected,  and then it's also connected to Silicon Valley.  Like if you look at all of it,  it's creating it on your own, right?  Being your own boss.  It's the hustle.  It is the hustle.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, and I think like,  and Gary says it's not just about the hustle,  it's like really you gotta love it.  And sometimes-  I blame Gary a little bit.

Start time: 1929.68
End time: 1946.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I know Gary well and I love Gary,  but I blame him a little because this guy is a ball  of energy, and for 10, maybe 15 years now,  he's been preaching this, you know,  you gotta do this, you gotta do this,  you gotta do this, you gotta do this.  And I think that that's unrealistic for most people.  That's-

Start time: 1947.48
End time: 1967.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah, most definitely.  Now he's teaching it a different way  where he's saying like, it's about if you enjoy it.  So he goes, for me, this is who I am, I enjoy it.  Nobody can be Gary Vaynerchuk.  Like, there's a bit of guilt.  Like, why can't I be like that, right?  What's wrong with me?  Why don't I have the energy?  And if I don't have the energy like that,  does that mean I'm gonna fail?  Yeah.

Like the overwork and the also assuming nature  of being a creative, you know, in the world today.  But I do, I like the super follow feature as a way  for people who genuinely create value  on that social network to get some money,  to get paid for it.  I won't be doing it as a reporter  just because of the way it work.  You can't.  You probably can't.  Yeah, news, I don't know.  News organ that we don't know.  These are all-

But for me to say, we don't need the gatekeepers anymore.  We can do it ourselves.  So you're right, it is positive in that respect, for sure.

Start time: 2032.94

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think like, hey, I look at people on Twitter,  I look at the people creating dozen long tweet threads,  where after certain points,  you are making this network better,  and people may want to pay you for this.  Who's benefiting?  Yeah, who's benefiting?  Twitter.  And not everybody needs to do a newsletter.  I think a simple way to pay people for things is good.

Start time: 2053.18
End time: 2065.93

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It would be great if there weren't so many people  doing something like that.  But yeah, I think that's exactly what we're hoping to see.  And by the way, I feel like this is,  because maybe I sound a little negative about all this,  and I'm not at all, of course.  I'm very positive about everything digital,  but this is sort of the second stage.  The first stage of the transformation of content  was everybody's ability.  They're no longer gatekeepers.  Everybody's ability to deliver content directly  to an audience no matter what.  You could just do it.  And that has been a fundamental shift  in the way people have consumed content.  And now the second stage is, well, great,  how do we get paid for this?  And that does make a lot of sense.  And I understand that we're in that  sort of evolutionary stage.  It's just a question of,  is Twitter really the right place for this?

Start time: 2132.14
End time: 2185.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, I'll tell you guys,  we at the Slash Film Cast, my movie podcast,  we started at Patreon recently, it's done pretty good.  We've had a paypal account for a decade.  We've been asking people for donations,  but having these platforms where people are already following  you can add more money.  That ended up being a beneficial thing.  So yeah, I don't wanna be too negative on this.  It's not for me, super followers,  but I'm sure for a lot of people it could be,  and that's good.  That is a good thing, ultimately.  Like I think of the end of the great,  what's it, the Brad Pitt movie?  The one where he is an assassin,  and basically it ends with, you know,  this is America, pay me.  And I feel like that's it, that's the goal.  And even though that's part of the evil nature  of capitalism and everything,  if you're contributing,  if you're actually generating content,  like at a certain degree, you should be paid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  Mixed, it's a mashup, it's a mashup.  It's America.  So yeah, I mean, part of this is stimulated  by the fact that Twitter, which has been a success  in the minds of the tech industry  and tech pundits and journalists,  the rest of America doesn't even know what it is,  but is desperately trying to figure out how to make money.  And apparently ads is not it.  They need a model, right?  Is that kind of what this is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they need a better growth.  I mean, it has to have a better growth trajectory.  I mean, they're kind of flat, their growth is flat,  because it's like the Twitter audience,  a certain group of people.  It's not America at large, it's-  No, it's not, it's not.  Even though what happens on Twitter  becomes national and international news.  Thanks to our former president, yes.  Right, and even before then, quite honestly,  before he got on, now he's gone, it still happens,  but I think that he has given it  sort of this outsized reputation,  as if it is some representation of the broader America,  and it's simply not.  And Facebook is a better representation  of people everywhere.  I mean, you look at almost 3 billion people use it,  and about what, monthly 311 million people,  something like that with Twitter.

Start time: 2321.28
End time: 2384.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a gross mismatch, and yet I think you're right.  In fact, for a long time, it's stopped now,  but for a long time, you'd watch shows like American Idol,  and they'd have a little blue bird,  and they'd say, you know, Twitter was very much part of that.  That seems to have kind of stopped.  I don't see that as much as I used to.  But Facebook's definitely still a part  of the American psyche, for sure.  It's gonna be interesting.  I'm not rooting against Twitter.  I have very mixed feelings about Twitter.  I think its value in our society  has been highly overvalued by the fact  that the media uses it,  and anything that happens on Twitter is considered news.  And for me, it looks like, well,  that's just the outrage of the moment on Twitter constantly.  And I think it's really fostered that kind of dialogue.  Gotcha journalism, outrages.  I think the smallest thing gets blown up  to the biggest thing on Twitter,  and then suddenly it's a big story in our world.

Start time: 2386.96
End time: 2426.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is why Twitter added context to some of their trends  because without context, people are just like,  oh, someone died, or something.  They had no idea what the words meant.  It's really true.  When you see a person's name in trending,  you know he's dead, right?  It's like, oh, my god, he died?  You see Denzel Washington get jiff, right?  You see Denzel Washington do the,  oh, I'm so glad it wasn't that that person was dead.  But by the way, I should say that,  I think I mentioned before,  Twitter remains my favorite social media platform  because it's the one place where I feel like  I can sort of create a reflection of my psyche,  of my mind, the way my mind works.  It's always been that way.

Every six months, it's a new way of doing it or using it.  And so for me, it feels like  the best energy exchange social network.  I'm most at peace with Twitter.  Even though it could be annoying, as you said,  for some things like trolling,  for obviously there's misinformation on every platform,  but I feel like you can grow your brand the most on Twitter.  Really?  It's not, I feel like it's the easiest way to grow it.  Interesting.  If you're clear about what you do and who you are,  and it's so easy to connect with people on it.  I just feel like with Instagram and YouTube,  they made it so hard, and even Facebook.

Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, totally agree.  For me, I think I've mentioned this before on Twitter.  My fascination with the internet started when I hit up AOL  in the mid-90s and Prodigy and everything.  And it's like all this information from all over the world,  and I could talk with all these people,  and it's all so seamless,  and it's right there in front of me.  And Twitter, to me, is the best representation of that idea,  of all the information in the world.  Sort of like you have the characters in the Matrix  just falling down in front of you.  And it is overwhelming.  It can be too much, and I think things can get overblown,  but as a representation of the power of the internet  and the value of getting so much information out there,  I think it's genuinely the best social network.  Facebook kind of does it too,  but gets bogged down in the interconnectedness  and a lot of different things.  Just for me and the way I use the internet,  Twitter is the best.  I'm surprised they're not focusing more on the people like us  who really love it and would pay.  I would gladly pay for some more features, better software.  I don't know why TweetDeck is still such a piece of crap.  But we would pay for that too.  That's like money waiting for them  if they ever decide to pick it up.  And what about-

Transcript:  And what about the last big thing Twitter announced, fleets?  Is that, which looks to me just like Instagram stories,  which was a copy of Snapchat stories, is-  Yeah, it's not.  Nothing, that's not going.  And now they're turning that into spaces,  which is a copy of Clubhouse,  which is the current hotness, at least in Silicon Valley.  Clubhouse is still invite only.  That's an audio only chat room that you can listen in on,  which feels very retro when I describe it.

Start time: 2581.76
End time: 2603.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which is powered entirely by hype, I'd say.  I don't know what happens to Clubhouse when it's less  exclusive, when everybody can go on there.  It's not a small social network right now,  but I don't know what the value is beyond you being part  of the special thing and occasionally Elon Musk shows up.  Well, that's pretty good.  I think that's, yeah, that's a good call.

Transcript:  Mark Zuckerberg has shown up.  Yeah, there's all these people who've walked  into these rooms that I find remarkable.  Also, it's Paul Davidson.  Davidson's one of the people who founded it,  was original Highlight founder.  Another sort of South by Southwest.  Oh yeah, Highlight was the same idea, yeah.  Well, that was sort of near me technology,  but it was very, very hyped until people realized  it was also a little creepy.  And yeah, and so this is his next truly big thing.  I mean, the biggest thing he's done since then,  but I don't know, this feels like it might  have more staying power.

Transcript:  You're right, this is exactly the kind of thing  that would have gone big at South by.  Like everybody's on Clubhouse.  It's like Meerkat, didn't that happen with the Meerkat?  Oh yeah.  You couldn't go five feet in Austin without somebody saying,  I'm streaming in a Meerkat.  We had a guy, we had an employee.  We finally had to put up a sign that says,  Jeff stop Meerkatting.

Transcript:  Stop, just stop.  What would you do if South by was around  and then you're also on Clubhouse?  Like you're seeing people in person,  you're like join our Clubhouse too.  Or I guess you might have a,  maybe you have like a room like where we are,  like the hot spots, and so everyone would be like on it  to find out where everyone is.

Transcript:  You won't be able to hear anybody.  Yeah, you wouldn't hear anything.  Actually, I think Clubhouse would work  as sort of an after hours thing.  So after everybody's done, they've done those parts,  then they go back to the rooms and then they all,  Paul said everybody joints together in the middle of the night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, do you think that this would have had any chance  if it weren't for the pandemic?  I mean, the fact that we can't get together in person  seems like it's just the perfect accelerant for Clubhouse.  I mean, we're like, suddenly we're back in the room again,  but we're, you know, with dozens of people or more,  but we're safe.

Transcript:  True.  It's easier to get them as guests.  Yeah.  So I think we were already moving into the audio space,  as we all know through podcasting.  And I feel like there was going to be this merger  of the live streaming and the podcasting.  And this was it.  And also radio, right?  And with Spotify getting into like possibly live audio,  I feel like it was going to happen  and then it got accelerated because of the pandemic.

I think, I didn't even think of that,  but a lot of this probably is because of the quarantine.  We're just bored.  We're just bored to tears.  So what happens, I mean, let's best case scenario.  People are getting vaccinated.  It's starting to speed up.  I mean, everybody's saying, oh, don't get on.  Don't take it.  You know where it's going.  We got variants.  We got mutants.  You don't know what's going to, but you know what?  By the summertime, 99%, it's just going to be back to normal.  We'll all be a little gun shy,  but we can't wait to get out in the real world.  Does all this stuff just go down the toilet?  Oh, most definitely.  I hope so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not at the level.  I mean, because you either need to be,  and I'm not like, I'm sorry to say this,  but you need to be single, unemployed,  and childless to really spend hours there.  I don't get people to spend like six hours a day  there on Clubhouse.  I think that we'll still be using it,  but it will be like, yeah,  people are walking outside or at the park.  They'll have, just like they were catching up  on their podcasts, they're going to be on Clubhouse perhaps.

Transcript:  On my group conference call, I, hmm.  It is everything bad about, do you,  first of all, throwing a party and hoping,  the anxiety of people may not show up,  but also the idea of going into a room,  being like, should I go here?  Is this a private conversation?  Am I intruding on what these people are doing?  It is all these levels of social anxiety  that I go through when I just open up Clubhouse.  So yeah, I don't know.  I don't know if it'll stick around.

Like, is it going to be the roaring 20s?  We talked about this before,  is it going to be the roaring 20s?  Where it's just like, bleh!  Or are people going to be gun shy and PTSD  and walking around with masks?  Should I shake your hand or fist bump?  I don't know.  What's it going to be like?  And by the way, every company,  Salesforce just did it, Spotify did it,  it says you don't have to come back to work.  You're fine, stay home.

Transcript:  I think that somebody's going to develop an app  where you can set up hugfests.  Like basically, you're going to register,  you can say, I've been vaccinated,  let's meet at this spot, this public spot,  and everybody's going to hug.  Touch me, touch me, please.  It's like, right, it's like,  people are literally going to be desperate  for physical contact,  but they're going to have to be smart about it,  so they're going to use an app to schedule it  and ensure they're doing it safely.  But I swear this is going to happen.  And by the way, if anybody creates this app,  they better talk to you.  Aren't there were their cuddle parties before this?

Twitter, it's funny because we've watched Twitter change  over the years.  They still seem to be chasing active users.  They still seem to be chasing money or monetizing.  They're constantly coming up with new stuff.  I feel like somewhat, I feel like,  and I've heard people say this, Jack Dorsey, the CEO,  is kind of a part-time CEO.  Right.

Transcript:  One thing we've noticed, especially like just having  covered Twitter in many different ways,  I don't know how many Twitter people actually use Twitter.  And that's the thing.  They have a fundamentally different idea  of what the network can be compared to us actually  who are there constantly swinging,  reloading our feeds every day.

Start time: 3280.76

Start time: 3296.94
End time: 3374.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go ahead.  They sometimes don't seem to want to play to that audience.  Like, Dabindra and I, we're that hardcore audience,  but over the years, all they've talked about  is making Twitter more accessible to people  who are not into Twitter.  So, tweet deck is a side thing to them.  They've never, they've always sort of deprecated it.  I had conversations.  They bought it and never did anything.  Yeah.  Yeah, because they didn't kill it,  which had been my original concern,  but they're not going to throw lots of money into it  because they can't spend all their time on the power users  when, as you said, growth remains so important.  Oh, that's interesting.  And by the way, growth is not simply a matter  of adding people.  Any service has incredible churn.  The churn means you are constantly losing people  and they lose people.  They have to clear out bots.  So, it's like this roller coaster ride for them.  You know, a dip down, they got to push back up harder.  So, you know, it's a very difficult thing to grow.  They don't, you know, they're not marching into countries  and then suddenly just growing like the next big thing.  And somehow Facebook, you know,  keeps marching through the world  and making sure that people are connected  so they can continue to grow at that scale.  That's simply not possible for Twitter at this point.

Start time: 3377.83
End time: 3379.32

Start time: 3391.60
End time: 3402.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  like Mark Zuckerberg did.  The reason, the thing that makes Twitter appealing  is these power users like you guys  that are putting content on it.  I mean, without-

Start time: 3402.54
End time: 3437.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's the problem is because monetization.  So, like what's trending?  My company was monetizing on video  and just like their monetization is just so,  yeah, like for a company like that,  we've gotten kicked out of the program so many times.  Like we're brought in the program  and then we have one video that someone monetizes  when it shouldn't be and they're like, you're out.  And you're like, that doesn't make sense  for someone who's creating all the time.  Like it's just so, and then even with,  if you were doing paid on Twitter,  you literally email someone like,  like that their manager said  that I could do paid on their tweets.  Like that's how janky the program is.  It's pretty janky.

Start time: 3438.04
End time: 3451.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think people know how janky the backend is  on Twitter.  It's very much like very ad hoc.  Then there's YouTube, which is a powerhouse, right?  Yeah.  YouTube seems to know what it's doing.  Is your experience with YouTube better, Shira?

Start time: 3453.02
End time: 3487.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, no, like YouTube took out  their social functionality years ago.  Like when I started before Watch Trending,  I started this thing called Partners Project  and we were interviewing YouTube stars.  The reason why we grew is because if we covered someone,  if they liked it and commented on the video,  it would appear in their feed.  YouTube took that out.  There was no social element to it.  There was no way for someone to discover the content  unless they tweeted it or Instagrammed it.  So I would have to be on another platform to promote it,  which would defeat the purpose.  Like why would you then push your talent,  the influencers off the platform to promote it?

And I don't even know why YouTube hasn't generated  something like that because that would be amazing,  but it also works better for shorter video.  It's harder when you've got something like  a five to 10 minute video, but yeah.  Well, ironically, YouTube is creating a TikTok

And I put part one and part two on theirs  and we could both, it's like the views go to both  and it doesn't feel like it's two different sources.  And then we're both monetizing,  we're sharing the monetization.  That could have been like the modern day collaboration.  Right?  There was just so many things.  And even just keeping the like and the comment button  where my feed would see what I'm liking and commenting on,  then it would be a great way for discovery.

Transcript:  to how well designed the platform is.  Just like we just talked about the duets, the sharing,  how easy it is to create a TikTok.  All of that is why so many people post.  And of course, the brilliant thing is you create a platform  that encourages and makes it easy to create.  You get millions of people submitting videos,  then you let the algorithm pick the hits.  And it's a good algorithm.  It's profit.  So that's clear.  We know that works, but how do you become that person?  I don't know.

And I'm somebody who's on TikTok  and terrible, terrible, terrible at it.  But I spend a lot of time watching TikToks  and seeing how people are trying to tease apart  the algorithm, tease apart.

And because I was putting so much effort in Musical.ly,  I had to start figuring out something else  because I wasn't monetizing, right?  And so I took like a year, not off,  but then of course, as I took the year off, TikTok blew up.  And now I have like 600,000 followers.  Oh, that you brought with you from Musical.ly.

Transcript:  There's a couple of guys on TikTok  who their whole thing is they take somebody's questionable  or sort of like something that they've done  and they say, you'll be amazed, this works.  And they actually say, does it work?  Like every single TikTok is, does this work?  And that works.  They've actually, they've really found a way  of digging into the platform  in a way that feels really intrinsic to it  and build their own brand on top of it.  But you have to be, it's going back to what we were saying  at the beginning of this whole talk is that,  you have to have this level of commitment.  You have to work really hard at it.  You have to do it multiple times, a week or a day.  And you also have to put up with the fact  that often you're going to fail.

Start time: 3912.54
End time: 3931.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  It feels like it's a part-time job or full-time job.  And then I would say with the celebrities,  I mean, I think some celebrities just join it  and there are some that TikTok knows are joining, right?  They've been trying to get them on for the past year  and then they join and they kind of like give them  a little boost or discovery.  Like, I know that's happening.  If I go to the front-  Washington Post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

End time: 3968.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Our show today brought to you by Extra Hop.  Extra Hop, we were talking about the solar winds attack.  I'm gonna actually, when we come back,  I wanna talk about, there's a funny story with that.  This sunburst attack scared the bejesus out of  big companies, governments, little companies.  It was a wake up call, frankly.  Because it was using a trusted service.  It was a supply chain attack.  How do you prepare?  Cyber attacks are getting more advanced, harder to detect.  And frankly, the most advanced threat actors  are the ones already inside the environment.  The APTs, they've been there for a long time  without our knowledge or they're the trusted providers  who are, we give them complete access  because well, that's our security software.  But the problem is when cyber criminals  get past your defenses, they're in.  You need a way to detect them and respond to them.  And the old model of just putting up a big wall  is not enough.  Extra Hop Reveal X, this is an amazing solution  that shows you not just where intruders are going,  but where they've been.  You know, when a bad guy gets in your network,  they spend a lot of time trying to cover up their traces.  They can't with Extra Hop.  You can investigate incidents and prevent them  from turning into full blown breaches.  The question every security team has to answer every day  is are we okay?  Have we been compromised?  Extra Hop Reveal X makes it super simple  to answer that question.  You've got 90 days of record look back,  complete network visibility across the data center,  but not just in your on-prem data center,  but in the cloud, even all the way to the device edge,  which allows security teams to get to real answers  in a post-compromise world,  your greatest chance at stopping advanced threats  is with Extra Hop Network Detection and Response, NDR.  You want to know more?  See this website.  If you're watching the video,  you do extrahop.com slash twit.  If you're not, you can see the demo.  You can see what it can do.  You could try it for yourself.  Learn how Extra Hop stops breaches 84% faster  and explore this interactive demo.  I think once you try it, once you see,  you're going to want this on your desktop.  Every network needs Extra Hop, extrahop.com slash twit,  extrahop.com slash twit.  We had a very fun week this week on the network.  We're going to have a great time next week.

But Tuesday, Mary Jo gave me a little insight.  She said, you should abs-  We weren't gonna do it,  but she said you should absolutely stream  the Satya Nadella keynote from Ignite, part two.  That's 8.30 a.m. Pacific, 11.30 Eastern time.  This coming Tuesday, I will be here.  We expect, because Alex Kipman is really the keynoter.  Nadella, the CEO, is gonna introduce Kipman.  Kipman's responsible for HoloLens.  And I'm starting to hear the rumor mill  that there's gonna be a big HoloLens announcement  or some sort of big AR mixed reality VR.  This is, we keep hoping that somebody's gonna come up  with something that lives up to the hype for AR  and mixed reality.  The HoloLens, I don't think, quite it.  We'll see.  That's Tuesday on Twitch.  We'll be streaming that live.  Okay, now what?  We did Twitter.  We did Clubhouse, we did TikTok.  Let's talk about the SolarWinds hack.  There's really only one hysterical story.  Ex-CEO of SolarWinds testifying in front of Congress.  It turns out that, and I don't know if this was  the whole story behind the SolarWinds hack,  but it was a big part of it.  Back in 2017, for reasons unknown,  they let an intern set the password  for their GitHub repository  for all the source code for their updates.  In 2017, the intern set the password,  SolarWinds123,  which to paraphrase Spaceballs,  might be a good password for your luggage,  but not for your update facility.  The worst part is, it had to have been used by employees  and passed around for years.  It wasn't, quote, discovered till 2019.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Listen, I work for Verizon technically, so.  Okay, it's a good policy.  Whatever the company says, I think it's a good idea.  But maybe 5G was a questionable upgrade  for a lot of folks, and no comment, no further comment.

Start time: 4464.36
End time: 4491.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, there is, to be fair,  because there are fewer 5G cells, right?  There are fewer 5G towers.  Your phone will work harder if you aren't 5G.  And when it's seeking, you're draining more battery.  So it's not necessarily the act of being on 5G.  It could be the act of garbage 5G.  I, for example, live in a garbage 5G area  where it's basically the tiny-

Transcript:  Right, as long as I'm not standing next to a big building  that's blocking the direct line.  If you were 150th, the line would be there.  Right, I mean, that's the thing about 5G,  that there are these issues  about just keeping connected to it.  Once you have it, it's amazing.  But getting it, keeping it, and distress it,  might put on the battery for your new phone,  that can be an issue.

Transcript:  Yeah, even within New York,  I think we, in our testing gadget,  we got good 5G at Bryant Park, maybe?  In the park, where you have a lot of space.  Open space, open space, you can see the antenna.  But once you go into any street or anything,  then it's like, you're blocked.  And this relies so much on line of sight,  it is, yeah, you got nothing beyond that.  Like, me and 4G LTE.

Start time: 4559.36
End time: 4621.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I see 5G on my phones,  but most of the 5G most people are getting  is the low bands, 800 or 700 megahertz 5G,  not the ultra millimeter wave super fast 5G.  And low band 5G is, right, Devinder,  pretty much the same as LTE.  It's a little faster.  It's not much different, yeah.  So in fact,  You have to pay for that, I don't know.  And you're paying for it, and you had to get it,  I mean, this iPhone cost more,  and had to have a special little window on the side,  so that the millimeter wave,  which I will never in my life encounter, could get in.  So it's not unreasonable for Verizon to say,  this is actually, they don't say turn off 5G.  They're not that dumb.  They say, are you noticing your battery life  is draining faster than normal?  This was on Twitter this morning.  One way to help conserve battery life is to turn on LTE,  which turns off 5G.  But keep 5G in your plan.  Keeps 5G in your plan.  You keep paying for it.  Yeah, keep it there.  Yeah, that's it.  Yeah.  Oh, Lord.  Do you have 5G, Shira?  Are you enjoying it?

I don't know if this is gonna happen,  but a court has ordered,  in the epic Apple dispute,  a court has ordered Steam,  which is completely unrelated,  to hand over aggregate historical sales,  price and other information on 436 games  hosted on the Steam store on Apple.

Transcript:  I'd be furious.  This is ridiculous.  The US magistrate Judge Thomas Hickson,  who's hearing the case,  ordered that Apple's asked for it,  ordered that Apple's subpoena for the data was valid,  however said, I love this,  and this is a direct quote,  Apple has salted the earth with subpoenas.  Tell Valve, don't worry, it's not just you.  Wait, we're going after everybody.  They're gonna get everybody.  They're probably coming after us.  Tell us how many people are listening to your show, Leo.

I don't know what Valve's cut is,  but I'm sure that's why they're subpoenaing this.  By the way, Apple's lawyer said,  hey, we could have asked for data on all 30,000 games.  We're just asking for 436.  It's nothing.  Valve says, we're a small company.  We don't have time to do this.  What are you, nuts?  They would have to dedicate  multiple employees working full-time.  This epic Apple battle has gotten uglier and uglier.  Let's see, that was the Apple story.  How about the new Echo Show 10  with the rotating follow you camera?

This is a time lapse of the I7  attempting to return to clean base.  The Roomba is supposed to vacuum  and it's supposed to vacuum in such a way  that it gets every spot and then before it dies,  go back to the charger.  This is what his Roomba was doing.  This is a time lapse, obviously.  It's just, it's confused.  It's easy.  No, no.  Maybe you gotta take it over by a ghost,  to the Russians, the Russian hack.  Oh, I can't get to the base.  Oh, oh.

And then it would start vacuuming  and then invariably it would get stuck.  It couldn't get under something  and it would start going boom, boom, boom, boom.  So I would get up, it's three in the morning  because we don't want the Roomba to do it  when we're walking around.  So I'd get up at three in the morning,  take it, take, okay, little Roomba,  put it back on its charger next night.

Oh yeah, that's why the stock doubled.  Sure.  Sure.  That's what it was.  Had nothing to do with those guys on Reddit.  No.  Actually, I guess the Reddit guys might have gotten excited  because he was being forced out by Ryan Cohen,  who is the guy who's been pushing GameStop to go online  to be a download company instead of a brick and mortar store.  So maybe there is some, maybe there's some legit there.  There's also some evidence, according to Reuters,  that bots hyped up GameStop on social media platforms.

Oh my God.  And they've decided not to pay.  They're, I mean, yeah, yeah, they're not paying.

There are certainly like legit criticisms  over how empty and dead this world feels in this game,  but I do think there's a lot of,  there's great writing in there.

And all those people, including my own,  my kids here, my daughter were hyped.  She got the game.  She was like, I can't wait to play it on my Xbox One.  And as she was getting it, all the stories were hitting.  And so she made the executive decision  to not play it until the patches come.  So she won't touch the game.  She refuses to have that experience.  So, but I think that's a terrible thing  that they didn't prepare people for that.  That it was like, surprise.

And then I went to the GameStop developers conference,  or not developers, GameStop managers conference.  And that was really interesting  because all of them knew us  because this is all they watch in store.  All the time.  You're a celebrity.  Yeah, that was interesting.  You're a celebrity.  I got into the gaming world  and then I got more into pop culture and all that.  And I follow what's happening,  but I don't necessarily game.  I'm a complete noob.  I'm really bad at it.

Start time: 5959.98
End time: 5982.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a good sweet spot,  because before gaming laptops were all like either 1080p,  which is the original HD standard,  and they were getting faster and faster  in terms of refresh rate,  or they could be 4K, which was hell on your GPU.  Just really hard to actually render a game  at that resolution.  It's too much.  So 1440p, slightly sharper, with a high refresh rate.  It's great.  It's like a great middle ground.

Start time: 5982.50

Transcript:  Let me talk about the game of getting insurance.  Car or home insurance.  Nice.  You like that?  You like that segue?  Very good.  Very good.  Actually, there's a story behind this.  It's a true story.  Lisa, about months ago,  said, ah!  I said, what?  She said, they just raised our house insurance, $8,000.  This is because we live in the forest,  you know, wildfire territory, I guess.  I don't know, that was their excuse.  So I said, no, no, no problem.  I've got a computer.  I can do this.  We're going to shop.  After about three sites, it's like, oh my God,  because you're entering the same stuff  over and over and over again.  Then I saw that ad with Hano saying,  Guy, I'm getting Gabby insurance,  so you don't have to do that.  It was like he was talking to me.  So I heard it, and I think I probably saw it  a couple of times.  And I finally said, all right, I'm getting Gabby.  G-A-B-I, it's an app you put on your phone.  And what they do, and actually it's kind of cool,  I think geeks will appreciate this.  They basically, there's something nobody else does.  They convince insurance companies,  and they've got 40 of the biggest insurance providers,  progressive, nationwide travelers, home and auto.  They convince them to create a API.  That's the last thing insurance companies ever wanted to do.  They want you to go to their website and type things in.  Gabby says it's about 1,100 characters on average  that you have to type per site.  They don't want you to shop.  You give them the credentials for your existing insurance,  so you don't even have to type that in once.  They get all the data from your insurance company,  and then they shop it to these 40 different companies.  All you do is you link in your current insurance.  In most cases, you'll receive quotes in a few minutes  for the same coverage you have, and that's the whole point.  They want to match that coverage.  That's exactly what we did.  If you want to move forward, by the way,  no obligation at this point.  You haven't agreed to anything.  If you want to move forward with one of the quotes,  the insurance company you selected  will of course have to underwrite it,  so they'll review all the details  and confirm the final price.  And on average, they save their customers  an extra $961 a year in their pocket.  That's how much Gabby customers save per year  on average car and home insurance.  Now, I put in the car insurance,  and I put in the home insurance,  and it came back within a couple of minutes.  This wasn't type in a lot of stuff.  This was very quick, very simple.  I just gave them the credentials to log in.  I won't say the names of the insurance companies,  but to log into our car insurance  and our home, separate companies.  They came back and said, you know what?  You're getting the best deal  you could get on our car insurance.  We can't find anything better.  That's a great deal.  That actually made me feel pretty good.  None of this is costing me anything at this point,  by the way.  They said, but we think we could save you  a couple of thousand dollars on that home insurance.  Oh, okay.  Then they said, okay, if you want to move forward  with the quote, still I've paid nothing,  I've committed to nothing.  They say, okay, we're gonna give your information  to this insurance company.  They haven't done that yet.  Sometimes the insurance company,  it depends on how old-fashioned they are.  Sometimes they'll call you.  Sometimes it's automatic.  Sometimes a Gabi agent will call you,  but they have to review the details,  do the real underwriting, and then confirm the price.  You still have paid nothing,  you still have committed to nothing.  Sometimes there'll be an adjustment there.  There was.  It was originally a little more,  went down a little bit when they realized where we lived.  We saved almost $2,000.  We got the insurance policy the other day.  It's done.  And it cost us nothing.  It was an incredible thing.  I just wanted to tell you about it.  It's a great way, and it's so simple and so easy,  you could do it while you're watching the Gabi ad on TV.  Save on home and auto insurance today.  On average, $961.  We saved more.  We saved more.  It was an amazing experience.  It's fast, it's easy.  And by the way, don't worry,  they never sell your info.  I'm always so nervous when I sign up for these things.  I use a phony, a real phone number,  but not my real phone number.  You know what I mean?  I use a dummy number and a dummy email address.  Since we did this, no spam, nothing.  I always check, nothing.  They don't sell your info, no.  Robo calls, no spam.  It's all very private.  But boy, it really works.  Gabi, I want you to try it.  You may be overpaying.  You probably are on your car and home insurance.  Most people are,  because it's too much of a pain to shop it.  Let Gabi do the work using their technology.  See how much Gabi can save you.  It's free to check.  Again, no obligation, no commitment.  You don't have to push that button until the very end.  Go to gabi.com slash twit.  Go to gabi.com slash twit.  G-A-B-I dot com slash twit.  Gabi, thank you.  You saved us big.  Really appreciate it.  Oh, these are creepy.  And I don't know if this is a good thing or not.  Have you seen this?  My heritage.

Transcript:  It's getting better.  And I don't know.  I feel like, have you guys seen the movie called  The Congress, which is something I referenced quite a bit,  directed by Ari Fullman, but it's a movie starring  Robin Wright about a world where actors can digitize  themselves, choose to capture their likeness  and sell that off to a studio.  And then they can't act personally anymore,  but their likeness can go on.  Because they've licensed it.  Yes.  And I think we can get there.  Oh, you told me about this.

You don't own your music anymore.  That's completely credible.  Completely credible.  Bad news, if you're crossing the border,  when you go home to Montreal, Shira,  I mean, I always thought the Mounties  were tough going into Canada.  But now, according to a new court ruling,  when you come back in the United States,  border agents can search your phone  with absolutely no limit, without probable cause.  Oh, wow.  US appeals court, this was actually overturned.  This was actually prevented,  and Judge Sandra Lynch has overturned an earlier ruling  that customs and border protection agents  can conduct in-depth searches of phones and laptops.  That's both basic and quote advanced searches,  which include reviewing and copying data  from your device without a warrant.  It's fully constitutional according to this judge.  I don't know if, I know, I don't know if this will be appealed.  Appealed?  No kidding.  Well.

Transcript:  Yeah, I know, that must be awful.  Yeah.  The ruling that overturned this said,  there's no, you don't have to,  you have to have reasonable suspicion.  Lynch disagreed.  And this is the quote that really pissed me off.  The judge said,  electronic device searches do not fit neatly  into other categories of property searches.  But the bottom line is,  basic border searches of electronic devices  do not involve an intrusive search of a person.  So that's ridiculous.

Transcript:  Yeah, that's incredible.  And I don't think that's going to hold up.  If that keeps making its way through the courts,  that's going to get appealed  and go all the way to the Supreme Court.  That's not going to hold up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We shall see.  The judge said, you know,  Congress should establish clearer rules.  Congress could say there is more protection,  but she says the Constitution does not.  ACLU said, warrantless and suspicionless  electronic device searches  can give border officers unfettered access  to vast amounts of private information about our lives.  We're disappointed with the ruling  and evaluating all options to ensure  we don't lose our privacy rights when we travel.  So that sounds like the ACLU might want to pursue this.  It was an EFF and an ACLU lawsuit.  So yeah, you know what?  They're going to appeal it.  They got to appeal it.  Not that I have any confidence the Supreme Court  will understand how smartphones work  any better than anybody else.  So, there is some good news.  I'll give you some of the good news.  You saw it on the promo.  The president has ordered a broad supply chain review  to address chip shortages.  The aim is eventually to increase domestic production  of these chips, which I think everybody would support, right?  I don't know if there's anything  you could do in the short term, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it's hard to build these factories, these labs.  Oh, they take years,  and they're billions and billions of dollars.  It takes years.  It takes training of the workforce.  It also, how are we competitive?  Foxconn and these companies that have employees  that they pay so little.  That's the thing that really,  we have to be competitive to do this.  So, they got to figure that out.

Start time: 7112.32
End time: 7226.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I think probably that's the point of this is,  look, this isn't going to happen overnight,  but it's clear now because of this shortage.  This is a problem.  Ford had to cut production of the F-150 pickup.  General Motors has shut down some North American plants  into next month because the car makers can't get the chips.  So, maybe you can't fix it today,  but you got to start sometime.  Now's the time.  And send companies to build fabs in the United States.  The Intel is about ready, I suspect,  to close down its fabs in Oregon  and start outsourcing fabs.  We got to do something about that.  California can finally enforce its net neutrality law.  You remember when the FCC overturned net neutrality?  That was a couple of years ago.  The state of California in 2017 passed a law  to restore net neutrality.  The Department of Justice under Trump sued.  The telecom industry sued.  But the DOJ under Biden has dropped that suit  and the Judge John Mendez declined  to grant the telecom industry a preliminary injunction.  So, the law can go into effect now.  There'll still be a trial.  It's not over.  But at least for now, net neutrality survives  in the great state of California.  Current temporary interim chair of the FCC,  Jessica Rosenworcel, tweeted,  when the FCC, over my objection,  rolled back net neutrality policies,  states like California sought to fill the void  with their own laws.  Tonight, a court in California decided  the state law can go into effect.  This is big news for open internet.  What the big news is that the chairman of the FCC  is supporting it is fantastic.

Transcript:  Well, in fact, I almost referenced it earlier  when we were talking about how people were working  so hard to make ends meet.  The movie was based on an article  in Harper's Magazine many years ago, I think 2011,  about how many retirees had so little retirement funds  and social security was so low, they had to keep working.  They never ending retirement.  And that was the basis for a book,  which then became the film with Frances McDormand.  But it's a funny film because you can't really say  there's a plot, but it's so moving and beautiful.  And it's really about people.  It's just wonderful.

Transcript:  Wow, now that I know that, I don't wanna watch it.  Yeah.  I loved it.  I loved it.  The latest episode 607, the slash film cast,  highly recommend it.  Our show today brought to you by Ryan Reynolds.  Mint Mobile is, it's my favorite.  It's what it's called an MVNO,  Mobile Virtual Network Operator.  So you know the big guys, T-Mobile and Sprint,  I guess together, Verizon, AT&T, Devendra's boss.  Those guys, they float along charging 80, 90,  100 bucks a month for data plus phone calls plus text.  Along comes this little guy, Mint Mobile, no stores.  Ryan Reynolds probably plunging a lot of his fortune  into that.  They offer premium wireless, not 80, 90 bucks a month,  $15 a month.  And that's unlimited talk, unlimited text,  and high speed data.  And it's on the nation's largest 5G network, it's T-Mobile.  So if you've got good T-Mobile service,  you're gonna get the same service  for a fraction of the price.  It's just amazing.  I loved it so much, I did the $15 deal,  and they said, I want the unlimited deal,  30 bucks a month.  That's amazing.  For 300 bucks, I paid a year ahead of time,  which is 25 bucks a month.  I got 12 gigabytes, that's effectively unlimited for me.  And always unlimited talk and text on a great 5G network.  You can bring your own phone, they'll send you the SIM,  there's no charge for the SIM, port your number over,  and it's painless.  They actually, cell phones, I got an iPhone SE,  very inexpensive, it was 15 bucks a month,  plus the 15 bucks a month.  For 30 bucks a month, you get a phone and coverage.  It's incredible.  Mint Mobile, switch now,  and you'll get premium wireless service.  And of course, if you get it and it doesn't work  or whatever in your neighborhood,  you're always covered with your seven day money back  guarantee, so there's no risk.  To get your new wireless plan, just $15 a month,  and get the plan shipped to your door free,  mintmobile.com slash twit, mintmobile.com slash twit.  Cut your wireless bill to as low as $15 a month,  mintmobile.com slash twit.  You're gonna love Mint Mobile.  Great service at a great price.  I don't know why anybody would pay more.  Plus, Ryan Reynolds.  I love this story.  Mississippi, Gulfport and Biloxi.  You don't hear a lot of great stories  about the internet in this country.  When the COVID relief package came out in March,  the state of Mississippi decided to dedicate  about $150 million of it to improving broadband,  especially in poorly served rural areas of Mississippi,  like Gulfport and Biloxi.  But they said there's a catch.  You can get the money, you have to match it  to these internet service providers,  and you have to roll it out by the end of 2020.  They did.  We're getting, people are getting,  going from 10 megabits to 300 megabits.  It's just a great story, and it shows what you can do.  I really believe municipal Wi-Fi and government run Wi-Fi  is probably the best way to go, but the telecoms hate that.  So maybe this is the next best thing.  Good going, Mississippi, well done.  FCC has approved a $50 high speed internet subsidy.  So if you have a low income household,  and as you know, this is a big problem during the pandemic  because the kids need to zoom,  you need to zoom if you've got a job.  So the Federal Communications Commission,  thank you Jessica Rosenworcel,  approved a $50 a month to low income households  up to $75 a month to Native American households  for broadband service.  So a couple of good stories about the internet.

Because blockchain, the magic of blockchain.  And this is not, I've seen this with collectibles.  Do you know who, one of the people who got in on this early?  William Shatner with Materium.

Ran down, I got a baseball, ran down,  got an autographed, ran down, got an autographed.  We get on the plane, he says, look at this.  And it was signed three times by,  it looked like Barry Bonds.  It's B, B.  I thought you got, he said,  I just kept going back to him and he kept signing.  Said, that's awesome.  And I'm showing it around to other people on the plane,  and the guy looks at it and says,  it's not Barry Bonds, it's Booth Bonser.  By the way, never did get called up,  but we have a baseball, anybody wants it,  with three Booth Bonser autographs.  Oh my God.  Looked just like Barry Bonds.  Booth, you gotta change, you gotta do something.  You gotta put a Zer in there or something.  So that's the problem, authentication.  But NFTs is not even material goods.

Transcript:  We do Twitter every Sunday afternoon  after the radio show about 2.30 Pacific,  5.30 Eastern time, 22.30 UTC.  I mentioned the time we do it because,  in fact, I would suggest tuning in earlier  because we start the stream.  We just don't stop it, I guess.  We continue it.  And so you can watch live as we're doing it  and see the stuff before, see the stuff after.  It's all on the website,  twit.tv slash live.  There's audio and video.  If you're watching live or listening live, chat live,  we have a great chat room.  It runs 24 seven,  but it's most active when we're doing live shows.  Some great people in there, a lot of fun.  IRC.twit.tv.  That's our little chat community.  We also have a forum for people who aren't watching live.  Great place to go, twit.community.  And you can sign up there.  There's no charge, obviously.  And the only thing I,  I have to approve every sign on  just to make sure we don't get spammers.  We've been having spam problems lately,  so I will approve you.  But I'll do that within the 24 hours  because I want you to be in there.  We also have a Twitter clone called Mastodon,  our own Mastodon instance at twit.social.  I don't do Twitter anymore.  I just do Mastodon.  It's so fun.  It's so great.  I love it.  Again, you have to say why you want to join.  Just mention, oh, Leo sent me or something like that.  You'd be amazed.  I'm approving these people.  So many people come in to say things like,  because I'd like to market my Viagra business.  Or it's like, okay, okay, no.  There are people, spammers sometimes they go,  I want to sell stuff.  And then, or they say, I want to meet people.  And their handle is,  buy usedrealestate.com.  And it's like, well, I think I know what you're here for.  Used real estate.  Never buy new.  Always buy used real estate.  That's my tip to you.  Something you can take away after this long show.  Where was I?  On-demand versions of the show available  at the website for everything we do, twit.tv.  Of course, there's a YouTube channel.  You can watch there if you want.  You can subscribe there.  As the kids say, mash this bell  and hit the button or whatever that is.  Smash that like button.  Smash that like button.  Subscribe.  Smash that like button.  Okay, guys.  And actually, the more civilized way to subscribe  is to get a podcast application.  There are many.  And subscribe there and you'll get either the audio  or the video the minute it's available of a Sunday evening.  Thank you so much for being here.  We really appreciate it.  We'll see you next time.  Another twit is in the can.
