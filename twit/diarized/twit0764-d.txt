Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, that was one thing that really is started to bug me a little bit.  We had somebody in the chat room from Prague in the Czech Republic.  And unlike here in the US where we were told, oh, masks don't help in Prague, they told  everybody masks do help.  All the grandmas in Prague started homemaking masks so much so that they and unlike Asia,  there was no tradition of wearing masks in public.  But all the influencers started posting pictures of themselves in masks.  And now it's pretty much 100% in the Czech Republic.  They put masks on trees outside.  So people if they didn't have a mask, they were making them out of T-shirts.  They weren't the N95 masks that the hospital technicians use.  But apparently any mask is helpful.  Take it home at night, wash it and make it out of a T-shirt and wear it the next day.  And it's it's made a huge difference in the Czech Republic.  And it makes me a little mad that they said they were so anxious to keep these masks for  medical personnel who do obviously need them.  And there's a shortage that they kind of misrepresented the fact that masks can help whether you're  sick or not.

Start time: 407.70
End time: 427.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, no doubt like the big story coming out of this is going to be the utter failure  of all levels of government in the in at least in the US to effectively communicate what  needs to be done to prevent people from getting sick, how to prevent people who might be sick  from spreading it to others and how to treat the people who are sick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The good news is there's not to be a downer.  Thanks a lot, Seth.  It does seem and I'll give you the up the upside of it.  It does. Social distancing does seem to work.  And I know it's tough in New Orleans and in New York City and Brooklyn, you know, still  hard in Seattle, Florida, but in areas like this in northern California, where we've been  social, we were the first to social distance in the US.  The sickness rates are way low.  And this is we know this thanks to a Internet connected thermometer from a company called  Kinza Health.  Kinza.  I ordered one early on, and so I have it.  I take my temperature every day and their their temperature map is not reliant on tests  for covid or anything like that.  It just shows areas where people's temperatures are higher.  Since they've been handing these out for six years to schools and so forth, they have  more than a million out in the United States.  And I think it's very interesting.  I think this is one area where you're seeing a technology that's been kind of very helpful.  Additional information.  You see observed illness and atypical illness on their map, which is at US Health.  Actually, it's health weather dot US.  And you can see where hot spots are, atypical trends and observed.  And all of this comes from the map data.  But this is the graph I think is most interesting.  This is for the whole US, but you can do this county by county.  You see the blue line is what you'd expect from flu season.  Typical illness.  The orange line is observed illness, which was until late February following that blue  line, but then started to go up.  When you see it red, that's where it's higher than average.  But look at the precipitous drop, starting with general social distancing in March 19th,  March 20th last week.  We're actually now well below what you'd expect for this time of year for flu season.  I think that people aren't getting the flu.

Start time: 567.71
End time: 656.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Or cold or anything else.  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  Right.  I think that's good.  You know, Zeynep Tufceki has been doing some really excellent work the last couple of  months, the last couple of days and weeks in particular.  And she's been really beating the drum on the need for people in the United States to  get it together and start wearing masks when you go outside.  And the odd thing is that, you know, if you look at the data, the countries that have  been using masks across the board consistently and universally are among the most successful  at managing the spread of the virus.  And one of the things that we did here, you know, one of the many things that we did  wrong here was to sort of stigmatize the use of masks so that somebody who goes out wearing  a mask is presumed to be sick and therefore can be, I mean, you're going to be shunned,  which isn't a bad thing.  And, you know, today we all want to be shunned now.  Right.  But you run the risk of being harassed or even assaulted if someone thinks that you're  carrying germs, carrying viruses into the environment.  So the sooner we can get to the point where it's nearly universal use of masks here, the  better off we'll be.

Start time: 657.16
End time: 698.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I understand the Surgeon General saying don't get, don't buy masks, folks, they don't  help because they wanted to preserve these, you know, medical grade masks for the people  who really need them, are hardworking medical and EMT folks and the first responders who  are exposed every day.  And boy, the statistics you see now about police officers and nurses and EMTs come down  with COVID because they don't have enough protective gear are tragic.  So I understand their motivation, but maybe it would have been better to be a little bit  more honest because as they've done in the Czech Republic, you can make masks out of  an old T-shirt.  It doesn't have to be a medical grade mask.  And even that will help keep you from touching your face.  At the very least.

Start time: 699.30
End time: 775.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Certainly the advice for the early advice for medical professionals to only wear a mask  if you showed symptoms has been shown to be a real error in judgment, because if you can  still spread it, if you're asymptomatic and that's the problem, people don't know if  they're sick.  And I want to quickly circle back to what you said about whether or not we're doing the  right thing in here in Northern California, where we were the earliest municipality in  the country to adopt a shelter in place regulation.  We're going to what medical professionals were saying and public health officials were  saying earlier this at the end of last week is that this coming week is going to be the real  point where we're going to be able to tell because this is the two week mark from the  shelter in place.  We should see people who were asymptomatic two weeks ago start to develop symptoms and  they're predicting a huge spike in positive COVID-19 infections and all of the difficulties  that will come with that.  So I would love to think that here in the Bay Area, we're doing better than others.  But I'm not convinced that's where we are yet.

Start time: 777.69
End time: 822.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Then there's the issue of using so there's some benefits to things like Kinza Health.  There's some additional information you can get from these Bluetooth and internet  connected thermometers.  But then there's some disturbing news.  Jeffrey Fowler wrote about it in the Washington Post today that some companies, including I  think the CDC and other health authorities, are using advertisements to track us.  So they're buying ads which send back geolocation information.  And as a result, they are knowing where people are congregating, not congregating.

Start time: 824.54
End time: 830.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Does that worry anybody, the idea that perhaps we're entering a surveillance system?

Start time: 831.24
End time: 855.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you know, this is what happens when you have a crisis is, you know, as it happened  with 9-11 and the Patriot Act, you suspend, you know, our traditional rights to solve  a crisis.  But does it concern you that all of a sudden this cell phone location information, which  we've been battling over for the last few years anyway, is being used in this way?  What about you, Lexi?  Is this something that concerns you?

Start time: 856.96
End time: 897.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I think anyone who has been following this for any time in terms of all  the implications that this might have, as you just said, with enacting anything in the  Patriot Act kind of way or just in the time of an emergency to think that what will happen  when this is all over and be able to roll back the things that have been implemented in  terms of tracking.  I mean, I've been thinking about this a lot and, you know, the ways to kind of circumvent  it, obviously, like, you know, if you have to go outside, if you are going to be flagrantly  going against regulations, like you would leave your phone at home, you know, turn on  airplane mode, things like that.  But I, you know, I just.

Start time: 897.50
End time: 901.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But this information is useful and we kind of want to help, right?

Start time: 902.44
End time: 932.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So apparently the government has been in talks with Facebook and Google and other  companies about how they can use location data to combat the virus.  Then they're buying ads because it turns out, oh, what a surprise.  Those ads tell you where tell the buyer where their viewers are and they're aggregating  this. On the one hand, I think it's great if it can if it helps us beat the virus.  Is it a bad precedent?  So you're saying, Lexi, are you turning off your location information when you go out?

Start time: 933.50
End time: 994.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I'm not going out.  That's the thing.  Good. Good.  Good.  Yeah, no, absolutely not.  I don't want to be misinterpreted.  I'm definitely not leaving the house without an absolute necessity.  But just just thinking about the ways that like this is going to have implications if  this continues to happen after the crisis is over.  And, you know, as has, you know, as you say, you want anything, any data that we have  access to now to help stop the spread of this.  But, you know, once this is said and done to continue to have this, you know, monitoring  this tracking through advertising, through whatever it might be, through data from, you  know, cellular providers or even from, you know, the phone manufacturers to there's a  lot to think about in terms of, you know, the tradeoffs that have to be made here.  And, you know, it's scary enough thinking about the situation that we are all currently  facing with the virus, let alone, you know, the data protection stuff that we also have  to add on top of it.

Start time: 994.86
End time: 996.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Seth, you're a security guru.  Does it worry you?

Start time: 999.56
End time: 1085.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think I think it's a lot of smoke and mirrors at this point.  Fewer than 50 percent of the states in the US have shelter in place orders or similar  at this point.  Certainly municipalities have been better about it, but not all of them have.  And I can't remember which state, but one of them, even the governor decided to declare  that municipalities couldn't enforce shelter in place laws that were regulations that were  stricter than the ones that the state had.  I think it was Tennessee, I think.  Yeah, it was some place with a lot of gun stores, I think.  And I mean, oh, was that on to on the point there?  So I feel I feel like, you know, like, sure, if we are struggling to prevent people from  going out, yes, location data could be helpful, but we're not even we're trying to  that. That's running.  That's running. We're not even crawling at this point.  And I think that this is going to be just seeing the patterns of how people got infected  in China, in Italy, in other places where it was really severe.  Suddenly, what we're doing in the US is nothing.  I mean, we have more cases in the more positive coronavirus cases in the US than China  has, has had this entire time.

Start time: 1086.14
End time: 1087.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although who knows what China's numbers?

Start time: 1088.10
End time: 1093.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Sure, sure. Even if even if even if China is suppressing their numbers, it's a very bad

Start time: 1094.34
End time: 1098.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  exponential increase here in the US.  As an example, South Korea is scary.

Start time: 1099.06
End time: 1109.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, China's used it.  South Korea's used it.  Apparently, with great effect, they had an app to attract people and would alert  authorities if they left home.  You know, you're well.

Start time: 1109.30
End time: 1171.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And and that's what it and and that's what you really I mean, if you're going to use  location data as a way to manage public behavior, then be transparent about it.  One of the things that that the countries that have been successful with this have been  doing, as you mentioned there, is that the big thing they've been doing is contact  tracing so that if you can use that location data to say this person was very near a person  who was infected, then then you can you can quarantine those people until it's clear  that they either are infected or aren't.  And, you know, you can stop the spread that way.  So that mean that's what but this this weird ass idea that you can sneak in and grab a  bunch of location data from advertising that's, you know, that's going to be blocked by a  bunch of people anyway.

Start time: 1172.50
End time: 1179.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's that would be my concern is that people's knee jerk reaction might be to shut this  stuff down to leave their phones at home and so forth.

Start time: 1180.40
End time: 1204.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So the idea that this is going to do any good, I mean, I think it's it's it has a whiff of  desperation to it.  Maybe let's gather this information and see if we can use it for something later.  Maybe the data will be useful.  And that's kind of been the way that online advertising has worked for the last few years.  Let's collect everything because maybe we don't know how much of it's going to be useful.

Start time: 1205.20
End time: 1251.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a company called Unicast.  They get location data from games, social media apps, five thousand different apps people  install and they actually have a location data toolkit and a social distancing scoreboard  so that organ is so that you can get a score about how well you're doing in social distancing  in the country.  Session ended by server.  I guess I'm going to get a new a new a new session here.  The top states, according to this, are D.C., Alaska, Nevada, New Jersey and New York.  The bottom states are Idaho, North Dakota, South Dakota.  You don't need to do social distancing in Montana and Wyoming.  There's nobody there.

Start time: 1252.32
End time: 1284.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So so what is that?  I mean, what part of the problem is, is that the data here has doesn't seem to appear to  have a lot of connection to positive cases.  New York, we know, has the highest number of positive coronavirus cases in the country.  And yet they're also excelling at social distancing.  So it would seem to imply that social distancing doesn't work.  But we know that it works because we've seen it work in other places.  So this kind of of of data flim flammery, I think, is is really bad for people.  Yeah. Is that a technical term?

Start time: 1284.90
End time: 1357.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a good term. I like flim flammery.  Of course, when this is going to really be useful and important and maybe even we'll  all give permission to do this, since we're not going to have herd immunity or a  vaccine for another year, at least what's going to happen when social distancing  works and ends in some number of months.  The only thing you can do is what what South Korea is doing at this point, which is  now you've got to track positive tests, you got to test all the time, track positive  tests and be very aggressive with those.  Go back to the containment strategy that we never pursued here in the U.S.  That's what we're going to have to do for the next year.  Once once we can get this thing under control.  And that's when these apps are going to really be useful.  My guess is companies like Unicast, which is they've long been selling this  information for other reasons.  The real reason they're doing this is is they see a opportunity in the coming  months. And I'm not sure it's a bad thing.  Shouldn't we use technology to to save us to solve?  Transparently.  I like you. I like that.  You're right. You got to let people know you're doing it and why.

Start time: 1357.86
End time: 1392.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. And, you know, disclose up front.  Here's what we're doing. Here's why it's important for you to opt in to it.  And here's where your data is.  And here's how and here are the the judgments and activities that we've taken  in response to that data.  If you have that kind of transparency, I think you can go a long ways towards  getting rid of people's trepidation about it.

Start time: 1393.42

Start time: 1394.64

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is it's interesting because, of course, we're this all happened in the  middle of this debate over how big tech is, you know, is getting too big and  privacy and security concerns.  This is a big debate that's been going on for the last couple of years.  Some say companies like Amazon are jumping on the bandwagon.  They're taking advantage of this to consolidate power.  Others say and I'm not sure which camp I fall in.  I'm curious what you all think.  Others say, no, the tech companies are stepping forward to help.  Apple's making a covid-19 site.  Amazon's hired 100,000 people to help deliver products.  In fact, many of us are relying on Amazon just to keep stuff we need in stock.  Walmart's hired 150,000 people.  Maybe these aren't the best jobs in the world, but they're jobs.  And there's so many people out of work in the restaurant industry and the  service industries.  It is our tech companies are saviors or are they taking advantage of this  opportunity or both?  Definitely both.

Start time: 1462.66
End time: 1465.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, you know, up until this point, there, you know, if you looked at the

Start time: 1468.86
End time: 1496.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  surveys of people's attitudes towards big tech, it was, you know, they were  generally getting more and more negative.  I think right now.  I think we feel better about them now, don't we?  Well, we feel better about them right now because it's one of the because it's  all we can do.  It's the only part of the economy that is still functioning.  The physical economy, you know, restaurants are shut down.  Non-essential businesses are shut down.

Transcript:  Yeah, but if it weren't for DoorTash, I wouldn't have had takeout last night.  And I want to get takeout because I want to support my local restaurants, right?  So, yes.  And those DoorDashers, by the way, Monday, they're all going on strike.  Is it DoorDash or Instacart?  Instacart is going on strike.

Start time: 1515.10

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, if they don't have coronavirus yet, they will soon.  I mean, I think this is one of the massive problems that faces a lot of, you  know, capitalist-based societies in the world, but certainly here in the U.S.  where we have a federal reserve to back up the banking system, which is fine.  And it's actually worked fairly well over the past, you know, however long, 80 years or  so without, you know, I don't want to trigger too many of our libertarian friends, but  it has worked.  We don't have something similar for health care.

Start time: 1548.97

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  In the U.S., you need to be working for, I think it's two years before you qualify for  unemployment insurance.  And these days, who does that?  Who, for one thing, who has an employer, a single employer for two years straight?  Very few of us relatively.  And then how many of us are with the same one for two years straight is, you know, is  another nail in the coffin.  So you're going to find a ton of people with no money, no way to support themselves, no  way to pay for their, even their rent.  And while in California and a few other places, they've, they've announced a moratorium on  evictions that, you know, that shit is going to come due as soon as the moratorium gets  lifted.  How are people going to get that money going to come from?  You even talked about at the top of the show that you had to do five layoffs.  I mean, right.  Or whatever it was.  It's brutal.  It's really, really brutal.  And without the proper safety nets, people, I don't know what people are going to do.  And we need the health insurance safety net.  We need to have some sort of publicly funded health care for all kind of thing where, especially  when there is a disaster like this going forward, people can get the care they need.  You don't want people who have symptoms or asymptomatic, but infected wandering around  and infecting others.  That's what God is here.

You can drive over it day after day and it might even have some cracks in it.  But there admit there's an earthquake.  Then you know if that bridge is solid.  We even you and I, Ed, who are a little older than these youngsters on the right there,  have never lived through anything like this.  It's our parents and grandparents who lived through World War II.  Perhaps they were the last people who really lived through it.  Great national crisis.  You could say 9-11 was, it was certainly an emotional crisis for us.  But except for New York City, it wasn't something that impacted us directly.  It was an indirect thing.  This has been our great come to Jesus moment.  And I think it was, we're going to be very different coming out of this whenever we do  in six months, three months a year, whatever it takes.  It's going to be a different, if it's going to be a different society, is it not?

Transcript:  Can I offer one slight amendment to what you said there?  The, you said we, you know, we didn't see the cracks in the system until it was under  stress.  There are a whole bunch of people who have been feeling and seeing and experiencing that  stress in the system for many years.  No, that's true.  But they are from groups of people that don't have any political power, that are, you know,  they're economically disadvantaged, politically disadvantaged, socially disadvantaged.  They might as well be invisible.  And what's happening now is that the things that were happening to those groups of people  are now bubbling up into the middle class to everyday working people.  And now we're worried.  And now we're pissed.  And so there's a whole bunch of people who are going, I've been trying to tell you this  for years.  Yeah.  And here we are.

And in a situation like what we have, we can't, as much as we on the left side of the political  spectrum would like to blame only Trump, we clearly can't.  It's clearly been a failure of political will up and down the board.  You know, when cases were spreading, why did Washington state not have a shelter in place  order?  Why was Mayor de Blasio in New York City encouraging people to go out in the middle of February  and do social activities when they knew that coronavirus cases were happening and spreading?

And we've seen, you know, iPad, MacBook, Huawei P40, all those products launched in the past  week and a half.  And, you know, these have been in the works for months and months and months.  I was reading an interview with Huawei CEO who said that, you know, manufacturing was  basically started in the end of 2019, like in quarter four.  So, you know, what do you do in that situation?  So I do understand from the sense that, yes, these products are just sitting there, they're  operating. So why not launch a product?  But then it also does seem kind of tone deaf to especially launch a product that is incredibly  expensive. And, you know, none of the things that we've seen in the past couple of weeks  have been particularly affordable.  People are losing jobs. People are just, you know, struggling to work out just what we  were talking about before, what we're going to do in terms of health care, you know,  and unemployment benefits and then have a big ritzy product launch.

I mean, I'm an optimist in the sense that I hope that we can take  the situation and what we learn from it and use things going forward to  not just have a collective memory that just forgets what's happened.  I mean, I think this is really going to have I think the next week, two weeks,  three weeks month is really going to have the biggest impact into how we  collectively remember and how we also are able to go forward.  And, you know, are we going to be able to go back to life as normal?  Are people going to handshake?  Are people going to go to big conferences?  I was just thinking like, how do we, you know, tech conferences,  thousands and thousands of people often at many of them.  Are they going to continue as is?  Or are we going to transition to something that is more a hybrid online  slash maybe a smaller event in person product briefings?  How is this all going to happen?  I don't know. I would hope that we take some learnings and go.  Maybe we don't need a conference where five hundred thousand people  from all around the world converge into one space.  Maybe we don't need that anymore.  Maybe there's a smarter way to do it, not just because we don't want to,  you know, we obviously don't want to have the risk of a virus or another  infectious disease transmitting, but also maybe there's an environmental  cost of flying in 500,000 people from all around the world.  Maybe, you know, there's an there's another aspect to it as well.  So I am really interested to see what happens.  I just hope that we can also, you know, it doesn't end up being  we just forget what happened in life goes back to normal.

Transcript:  So what I've been reading about best case scenarios  are that whenever areas decide to leave to lift their shelter in place orders,  it'll be because there's been a drop in the number of positive coronavirus cases.  But what's going to wind up happening is those cases are going to come back  because the actual period of time it's going to take us to develop  some kind of vaccine or preventative  is going to, you know, and have it approved and run through tests  and not kill people. You don't want the thalatomide babies.  I mean, there are real concerns here.  So we're probably looking at 18 months, right?  Twelve to 18 months of rolling shelter in place orders.  I mean, I think that anyone who sounds any kind of optimistic tone  regarding when this is going to end is better.  They better be an epidemiologist and have access to a lot of research  because I don't think anybody knows.  And we just saw in San Francisco, the schools announced that they are  staying closed until May 1st.  Yeah. Beyond the shelter in place order.  What's going to happen to their parents?  They have to stay home.  I think this is going to be this is going to take us a real long time.  I hope things change.

And I just I think those of us who've been doing this for some time,  those are the highlights, the highlights of any show.

And so you had to be thrifty and you had to be frugal.  And so I'm not sure what I am positive.  There will be something similar in our in the generation that is living  through this now.

So he was happy about that.  But he provided a forehead thermometers.  So I did. I checked my temperature three times a day.  There were plenty of face masks, because as the coronavirus  pandemic spread, he came up with a series of different things to do  before people started dropping out entirely.  So one of them was to provide multiple masks for every attendee,  which he told me he would donate all the leftovers to local hospitals in Vancouver.  There were more hand sanitizer stations than there were people on hand.  He had about a half.  It was him in a in less than a half dozen other people  making sure the streams were all working and these three attendees and myself.  But, you know, I asked him, I said, why?  You know, like, this is all great, but you could be doing this from your  from the comfort of your home.  Why are you doing this in in person at all?  And he said, you know, we have relationships and also keep in mind,  this is a week and a half ago.  So things had certainly gone a lot worse elsewhere since then.  But he said, you know, we have relationships with the hotel,  with caterers, with people.  And he wanted to make sure that he maintained that community.  That's reasonable.  And that's reasonable.  And I think that because there were so few people in person,  that was actually, you know,  I don't know that that was the call I personally would make.  But I can see why he made that call.

Transcript:  We we think also we thank very much our sponsors, the people who  make make this week in tech possible and especially want to thank  LastPass, which I know you guys all are well aware of.  LastPass is the password manager I've been using for a decade now  and good friends of the network.  Thank you for sponsoring the LastPass Studio and thank you for  keeping the lights on here at this week in tech.  And if you are a business and you've got people working from home,  if you aren't using LastPass, you're probably wondering, oh, boy, oh, boy,  what are we going to do now?  LastPass protects your remote workforce.  And more importantly, maybe from your point of view, protects your business.  Very important to keep security top of mind.  And also, I would say as important without impending on employee productivity,  transitioning to a full work from home environment  can be a lot less complicated with LastPass.  They can make that transition much simpler, much cleaner, much faster  without reducing security.  For one thing, we've got to be aware of an uptick in phishing attacks.  This is going crazy right now.  Coronavirus websites, I just saw a stat, something like 60,000 new fake  websites created with phishing attacks,  you know, built in attacks on those websites, email phishing, email  spear phishing, email LastPass reduces the risk of phishing schemes  because it won't auto fill passwords on a suspicious website.  And you can set up LastPass.  We do it so that your employees don't actually have the password.  So if they accidentally open an email, it says fill in the log  into the bank account, they don't know they can't.  And LastPass won't fill that in.  If you've got remote employees accessing your corporate VPN,  LastPass adds a critical additional layer of security directly to your VPN  through biometric multi-factor authentication.  It's biometric because of course, face ID or touch ID,  but they also use additional authentication factors,  IP address, geo location, things like that, to make sure that the right people  are logging into your bank account, not the wrong people,  regardless of when or how your employees need access.  LastPass ensures your employees have secure access to the work  applications they need.  They've got single sign on which employees love.  It's better than a password.  It's easier, but it's more secure from your point of view.  Of course, LastPass is the best password manager out there,  and they offer an offline mode for both password management  and multi-factor authentication.  So even if your employees are not able to get online,  they haven't lost access to their resources.  Seamless collaboration, of course, is important.  And that's one of the things LastPass does in the enterprise.  We use it here. We'll have a folder for each part of the business.  So there's a folder for the business operation, for sales, for network operations.  Those passwords are there.  If you're on that team, you have access.  If you're not, you don't.  So it really is a great way to keep everybody online, keeping things done.  It's great for the admins.  We have 100 plus policies we can enforce.  We enforce things like two factor.  You got to use two factor.  We you don't have to, but we turn it on because we want to make sure  every one of our employees is using it.  We have a pretty smart band of employees here.  So they're happy to do that.  We also turn on minimum requirements for their master password.  That's really important.  We know on the dashboard exactly who's accessing what resource,  no matter where they're working.  That's important, too, because they may not be on site, but we still know.  Oh, yeah, that's Robin.

We gave our longstanding clients our direct clients  bonus ads because we want to keep them happy.  And we know they're going through tight times just as we are.  So, yeah, and our stuff, I would never call remnant.  But we absolutely did give them bonus bonus advertising.  Instacart hiring three hundred thousand new shoppers.  That'll break the logjam.  Although Instacart shoppers are planning to strike on Monday  because they say their company isn't protecting them.  As many as 200,000 Instacart employees could walk off the job.  They're hoping for hazard pay.  Instacart says, well, you guys are working more.  And you should be happy to have a job.  They're all independent contractors.  On average, they shop fewer than 10 hours a week.  Costco, CVS, Petco, Target, Wegmans.  They used to be Instacart used to be Whole Foods.  Amazon took it over, took it internal.  The plan strike comes as more and more people stay home  and are relying on Instacart.  But in an announcement with the Gig Workers Collective,  which is an activist group for, I guess, gig workers,  Instacart employees said the company's, quote,  mistreatment of shoppers has shoppers as them has stooped to an all time low.  They are again with the quote, profiting astronomically off of us,  literally risking our lives while refusing to provide us  with effective protection, meaningful pay and meaningful benefits.

Transcript:  So there were a couple of stories I heard this week.  There was one company, a travel related company,  and a member of the team reported on Monday morning.  They there was a there was a big zoom meeting, big company wide zoom meeting.  A hundred people signed on.  Everyone was chatting excitedly at the beginning of the thing.  You know, geez, you know, is this going to be some kind of big team building thing?  The CEO comes on  and rattles off a prepared speech about coronavirus  and the economy and then says, and everyone on this call is fired.  Laid off immediately.  It was just ghastly.  I went to the company's website and looked at their their HR page.  And it was it was definitely a mismatch between the happy talk  on their HR page and what they did there.  There was another story that I heard this week of people,  a completely different company, but it was double digit number of employees  were given a were emailed a zoom link and they clicked the link.  And that took them to a pre-recorded message telling them they had been laid off.

I mean, you look at the airlines, they squandered all their cash  from all the money they made over the last few years on stock buybacks.  I don't have a lot of sympathy for them.  But but but most most companies like ours,  it's not like we have a year's payroll in the bank,  you know, so that we can keep if we could, I would keep paying everybody.  What we're trying to do is save the company by laying a few people off,  hoping to keep the rest employed.  I don't know. It's I have sympathy on both sides.  You're right. That seems very callous.

It's unsimly.  I mean, it's it's worse than unseemly because people are literally dying.  People are going to be dying a lot more.  And it's not from something random and it's not from something  unstoppable.  It is from something that we know exactly how to deal with,  who know exactly how to stop it.  And I wouldn't mind seeing this behavior is I'll tell you one thing.  One thing that really impressed me for all of for all of those screw ups  in the UK regarding their response to coronavirus and their  their idiotic interpretation of herd immunity.  And that is a technical definition of idiotic.  They came back and they said, we're going to pay everybody  who gets laid off 80 percent of their wages,  because they know that if you can't support people  who are living in your country,  then you're not going to be able to prevent this virus from spreading  because they're going to be on the street.  There's going to be significant societal problems.  And here in the US, we have this attitude of and you can just run  the censor beep right now because there's a lot of profanity.  I have to say about this.  People are going to be dying.  People are not going to have money in their accounts.  Twelve hundred dollars per person.  Are you kidding me?  Like in San Francisco, that that that, you know, that'll get you food  that won't get you that won't get you rent.  And if you have a family, you get 2400.  I mean, this is nuts. This is all nuts.

One of the things I didn't mention about about  Jai Gos Rui and Konsek West was that he actually discovered the hard way that,  you know, because he had to,  that the Zoom conferencing for the cybersecurity training sessions  that he runs before the conference, sort of like these pre-conference,  you know, cyber dojo things.  He said was he was actually very pleased with the turnout. And  in fact, one class had the devices that the students were hacking  had already been shipped to Vancouver from Israel.  The instructor couldn't leave Israel to come to to Vancouver.  So he was stuck there.  And then the students were moated into these devices from all over the world.  And, you know, and Jai Gos told me that he was very pleased with the turnout.  The class had a dozen students in it.  And he realized that there might be an opportunity for him  to continue to run cybersecurity education throughout the year.  The benefit being that people who are very eager to learn these skills  but can't afford to travel to where the classes are physically can,  you know, can remote in and can do things.  You know, it doesn't quite have a one to one.  It's not quite a one to one system.  You don't have the teacher looking over your shoulder,  you know, to help you out when you make a mistake.  But he said that he thinks that he's far more optimistic about  his ability and the ability of other small conference organizers  to do what they need to do in order to survive digitally.  The big ones I have no idea about.  I don't know how you replicate the insanity of walking down,  you know, the Las Vegas Convention Center or whatever.

Start time: 4001.12
End time: 4024.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think I think what they did was so a little a little bit more background  on Pwn to Own.  It's quite challenging because as the hackers are developing the exploits  and creating the exploit chains that are needed,  you now need a lot more than just one exploit to to.  A lot of these exploits were like six different exploits,

Start time: 4024.94
End time: 4035.08

End time: 4094.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  By getting Shell or getting root on the device.  And, you know, usually what happens is it's sort of this ongoing  race between the hackers and the device makers to patch their systems.  And in fact, you know, there's been multiple cases where,  you know, an organization that, you know, makes, say,  you know, Google Chrome or another device  will send out a patch the day before Pwn to Own.  And it's not unheard of.  It's actually quite common for those patches to kill an exploit in that chain.  And so there's sort of this race between the hackers and the companies to  to see who can get get it first.  But it's this year, I believe that they emailed them into  the organization, ZDI, which which runs Pwn to Own.

Mark Rogers, who is a VP at Okta,  and he's a he's well known in the cybersecurity and info  set communities, is one of the four people who's organizing this.  But they said that they're seeing phishing attacks in every language  known to man.  I don't know how you send a phishing attack in cuneiform, but  I presume every all the other ones are being represented.

And it's it's, you know, these messages are being used to get people  to cough up passwords, other sensitive information,  which almost always comes back to finances. Right.  And if you can, if you can own some company's corporate network  because they get inside the end. Yeah.  You know, why not?  So, you know, Rogers didn't give Joe Men a lot of specifics,  but he did say that they had already dismantled one campaign  that used a software vulnerability to spread malicious software.  I mean, it's not really clear how much they're stopping.  Certainly, I can say that I've personally seen an uptick in coronavirus spam  and not just pitches from, you know, desperate marketers.

Transcript:  It's a little weird, according to the New York Post, consider the source.  South Africa is banning walking dogs.  Meanwhile, in Spain, they're cracking down on pet rentals.  Saying it's illegal to walk someone else's dog.  I don't know why they're trying to keep South Africans from walking their dogs.  That's that's one of the big things around here in Northern California.  If you go out on a walk or go to a park, all you see is dog lovers walking their dog.  I don't know how they could ban it in South Africa.  It's strange.  Every country is reacting to this somewhat differently.  If you are hiring and I hope you are, there are a lot of people looking for work right now.  And I want to mention our sponsor is ZipRecruiter, which is the absolute  best way, the easiest way to hire. If you've got job openings, man, you're golden.  But you want to get the right person because every single person you hire  can make or break your company. And that's why we use ZipRecruiter.  We've done a lot of our hiring through ZipRecruiter. We've been very happy with it.  According to their own research, nearly 75% of employers are having a hard time filling open positions.  68% raising their wages, 23% raising their benefits.  There are still jobs out there.  So if you're a job hunter, go to ZipRecruiter.com.  And if you are looking to fill a position, go to ZipRecruiter.com.  They post your job on 100 plus job boards.  They have many, many resumes already on file.  And one of the things they do, which is really cool, they use their matching technology to look at those resumes,  look at your job and then invite people who have the right qualifications to apply.

It was actually very popular when it was launched,  probably because Yale students saw it as a gut. Easy, eh?  But maybe they really wanted to be happy.  They've now released it for free. You're not going for a grade.  So this is what Yale says.  The Professor Santos reveals misconceptions about happiness,  annoying features of the mind that lead us to think the way we do  and the research that can help us change.

They just it's there's just so much information and just my entire feeds  are just covered 19.  And so there's parts of that I want to know about.  And then there's other parts that just becomes so overwhelming  that I I need to just turn it off and actually have the the mental space  to be like, OK, I need to concentrate on what I have to do.  Otherwise, I feel like I would fall into the great Twitter vortex,  which is probably OK in normal times.  But now I think I need that space.  So I don't think I can really judge whether or not it's a better place right now.  It's just a lot of information.

There's there's a lot of challenges.  I follow a couple of epidemiologists.  I follow more politicians now than I really feel comfortable doing.  But, you know, you have to hear and see what people are saying,  because a lot of it needs to be debunked or even is accurate  at the time of posting and then is incorrect 24 hours later  or has changed 24 hours later.

Transcript:  I'm curious what you think about this.  China, according to the Financial Times, has unveiled a new  proposal for reinventing the Internet.  They've proposed this to the ITU, the International  Telecommunications Union.  It's being spearheaded by Huawei, Chinese company, and in fact, Futureway,  which is a Silicon Valley based think tank and a research arm of Huawei.  They they made this proposal together with China Unicom and China Telecom,  the country's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.  The Financial Times got the PowerPoint presentation  for something China calls New IP.  I don't know if we need a new IP to replace TCP.  They said that the infrastructure is unstable, vastly insufficient,  and they suggested that the ITU should take the long term view  and shoulder the responsibility for a top down design of the future network.  One of the reasons they want to do this, there's a new feature in New IP  that the Chinese call shut up.  Which would be it's aptly named.  It would be useful on Twitter.  It allows it's a top down, by the way, governmental run Internet.  It would allow whoever's running the Internet in that country to take anybody  offline to restrict communications between two different IP addresses  or just to say, hey, you you're not on the Internet anymore.  And I have the feeling this is the main reason.  What could possibly go wrong?

Start time: 6248.08
End time: 6301.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I mean, so two different things, two different things here.  Number one, the statement of problem there is 100 percent accurate.  The Internet was never designed to be what it has become today.  DNS was never designed to be a directory.  And and so, you know, the Internet is just a god awful mess today.  But it's but a top down government  imposed solution that gives a central authority  the ability to arbitrarily cut off access  to a single node on the Internet with with with surgical precision.  They are the basically an online drone strike is not the answer.  Absolutely. You can see why.

Start time: 6302.40
End time: 6320.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  China would love this, though, right?  The ability to shut down dissent on the Internet.  And you could also see why other countries might kind of fall for it,  because for a variety of reasons.  Well, we could.  You know, this is why the Earn It Act is rushing through Congress  so that we can control child abuse online.

Start time: 6321.74
End time: 6359.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think one of the original, one of the most important statements  about the Internet as it exists today is the the aphorism that is absolutely true.  The Internet interprets censorship as damage and routes around it.  Right. That's the real problem.  And and that's yeah, that's the good part about the Internet.  But there's so many bad parts that go with it.  But honestly, the idea that somebody is going to,  you know, come in top down and invent a better Internet,  especially in China.  No. Yeah.  Yeah.

Start time: 6359.36
End time: 6449.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No. One of the scary things I can I can totally foresee quite easily  is China creating this, you know, Internet, which for all we know  is the Internet that their Internet is based on,  or at least what they're trying to achieve with their implementation  of the Internet already.  And then mandates that if you want to do trade with China  or if you want Chinese dollars for whatever infrastructure project  you have going on, you're going to have to use this Internet as well.  I don't think that is terribly hard to imagine happening.  I do think, however, that we are underestimating the coronavirus impact  and we don't know what's going to come out.  And, you know, when when when we have gotten through this globally.  So it worries me that China is talking about this,  but it also worries me that, you know, we're seeing  government organizations trying to do an end run on Section 230  with the Internet Act.  So I'm I'm this is highly concerning, but also we don't  we don't know how things are going to be in China  when coronavirus returns there, if they will be as successful as before  in tamping down on it.  We don't know, as we mentioned, if they've been misleading about their  numbers, their infection rates.  So it sounds like a really bad idea.  And I could see China making it a thing, but

Like a billion dollars or something.  Yeah. Yeah. That was that was obviously a bad idea.  So how did how that happened in the first place is, you know,  that doesn't give me any confidence in China proposing a government run Internet.

Transcript:  Well, and that happened not to get too lost in the weeds there,  but that happened because of financial pressures at ICANN. Right. Right.  I mean, right. That's right. That's.  And if they, you know, I mean, it's sort of  ICANN is the the is to the Internet as the postal services to the  United States to, you know, and and they're both.  In theory, not pure capitalist  institutions, but in practice, they have to act like them  because otherwise they go bankrupt and can't do their jobs  and pay their people and and deliver the bits or the envelopes  and magazines, depending on which side you're talking about.  And and, you know, so it's it's back to what you said, Seth, at the beginning.  You know, is it you know, once you get into a capitalist system here,  especially in a time of stress like this, a lot of  a lot of flaws in the underlying infrastructure become really obvious.  There is at the Sands Internet Storm Center, a COVID-19

Start time: 6553.68

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  domain classifier,  partly because there's so many malicious sites.  What they're asking people to do is to log in to a site.  There's a whole database of sites you can help them out with  and determine whether it's a malicious site, whether it's  a site full of misinformation and then report back.  So if you want to help the the Sands folks  in Sands Internet Storm Center, you can you go to ISC.sands.edu  and help them with their COVID-19 domain classifier.  That's really interesting.  I guess so many domains have been registered.  They're trying to figure out which are for scams, which are for illegal.  They're trying to enlist volunteers.  Now, they say as part of this task, you'll need to visit possibly malicious websites.  Currently, I don't know who I is, whoever's writing this says,  I haven't seen any outright malicious content malware,  but there are a few thousand domains on the list.  It's likely that a couple of them will carry malware.  So take precaution.  Use a separate system, a virtual machine or a mobile device that can be reset  and has no personal information may work well.  So use a safe computer, classify it and go to the next one.  This is kind of an interesting community effort to weed out misinformation  and actively malicious sites being put together by the Sands Institute.  If anything comes out of all of this, I hope it's a safe site.  I mean, that's what the promise of all this technology is about

We've seen ventilator widgets being 3D printed  and those are getting shared.

I want to take a break and then I will talk about a couple of fights  going on in the open source area, ARENA.  Our sponsor for this segment of this week in tech  is a life insurance agency that specializes in getting insurance  for people who are healthy.  You might say, well, yeah, but you can really save a lot of money  if you are doing everything right for your health.  If you exercise regularly, if you get a minimum of eight hours of sleep,  I know that's hard these days, maybe you're eating right.  Basically, you're insuring a longer life.  That means you should get a better deal on life insurance.  But a lot of life insurance companies, you're just a number to them.  And so they don't know that you're a healthy person.  That's where Health IQ comes in.  A life insurance agency that uses science and data  to get lower life insurance rates for healthy people like you.  You can get a million dollars, as an example,  a million dollars policy from 36 bucks a month.  See, what's happened all along is the people who are healthy  subsidize unhealthy people.  It's not a conspiracy.  It's statistics.  It's actuarial science.  That's how life insurance works.  You might be healthy, but your life insurance company doesn't know.

Transcript:  Let's see here.  The Library of Congress, I think this is nice,  has opened up its collection of open access books.  I think it's 1.7 million volumes of open access books.  There's actually a lot of collections.  There's Project Gutenberg out there.  But some of the Library of Congress stuff  is more recent, Cory Doctorow's Little Brother,  which is a great young adult story  about the surveillance economy.  A book I would highly recommend,  Bankler's Wealth of Networks is fascinating.  Pop City, Korean Popular Culture and the Selling of Place,  all of this from the Library of Congress website.  And this is all legal.  There is some dispute over the Internet Archive  doing something similar.  Did you follow this?  The Internet Archive has been, first of all, disclaimer.  Love the Internet Archive.  I support them.  They are preserving our internet history, downloading.  I don't know how much they do every day,  but terabytes of data which they store,  otherwise would be lost.  Every GeoCity site ever is there.  If you've ever used the Wayback Machine,  you've used the Internet Archive.  They also scan books.  Now this has been very controversial.  Remember when Google did this, the Authors Guild sued.  There was a legal opinion some time ago  that said that a digital copy could be put online  for every print copy any library owned.  But you had to do it like a library.  You could only lend out one per copy you owned,  so there wouldn't be more,  a thousand copies of one book out there.  And you had to have an expiration, a due date and all of that.  Because of COVID, starting March 24th,  the Internet Archive suspended the wait lists  for its 1.4 million book library.  They created what they called  the National Emergency Library  to serve the nation's displaced learners.  They say the suspension of rules  will run through June 30th of this year  or the end of the emergency, whichever is later.  During the wait list suspension,  users will be able to borrow books from the Internet Archive  without joining a wait list, ensuring, sounds good.  Students will have access to assigned readings  and library materials that the Internet Archive  has digitized for the remainder of the U.S. academic year.  People who cannot physically access their local libraries  because of closure or self-quarantine  continue to read and thrive.  The authors are pissed.

They're lost.  This is what Google was trying to do with the scanning effort.  In fact, there were even proposals  that, well, how about this?  How about we say, if we think it's an orphan work,  if the author wants us not to do this, send us a dollar,  $1, and we won't do it, proving the ownership  and putting a little bit of a speed bump over just saying,  yeah, don't do it.

It's just not.  The books that are here, the people who are downloading  these books would not have paid to buy these books  and sent their 10% or 15% or whatever the royalty  percentage is off to the authors.

Transcript:  Well, this is why I recommend Mutville.  So my first dog was a Pit Bull mix from Mutville, Athena.  I had to rename the dogs because everything is great  about Mutville, but they give the worst shelter names.  And so Athena was great.  She, you know, was in her twilight years  and we had a good year and a half plus together.  And, you know, Pit Bull mix, not a small dog.  And then I adopted Zero and Zero is a Black Lab mix,  probably Border Collie is the other half of her.

And she's 11 and a half.  And for over a year, we do five miles a day  in Golden Gate Park and I'm just blown away.  You're in great shape, yeah.  I'm getting there, I'm getting there.

Transcript:  One last story, I thought we should end with a happy story.  The Elizabeth Warren for President campaign is over,  but I think this is great.  They're open sourcing all the 2020 campaign tech  they created.  Public, they're gonna make public all the apps,  all the digital tools.  They used a lot of open source technology  and they're re, and they're re, you know,  contributing that open source technology back.  There was a nice medium post by members of the team,  including Chief Technology Strategist Mike Conlo  and CTO Nikki Sutton.  And they talked about all of the software  they're gonna make available to any campaign  they want to use it.  I think this is exactly the idea behind open source  and I'm really, I think that's a really great thing to do.  They have Spoke, a peer-to-peer texting platform  originally developed by MoveOn, Polaris,  a polling location lookup tool,  Caucus app to help Caucus captains calculate,  they could have used that in Iowa,  to calculate the votes, switchboard.  But it's really interesting.  There's a lot of these days campaigns are very high tech.  There's a lot of software out there, Red Hook.  Ladies and gentlemen, I think it's time for everybody  to go home, find a dog, cuddle up, watch Tiger King.  Any of you watching Tiger King on Netflix?  Not yet, not yet.  It's all the rage.  Gary.

And that was the problem with Picard.  The camera has never met a view of Patrick Stewart  that it didn't like.
