Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Feel so bad. I was all excited. I thought we I thought you were bringing a bolt, which is the new one  They announced to CES. Yes, and and I start the interview and say let's take a look at the new Chevy Bolt  Has to say  It's actually the volt  Yeah, the bolt won't be out to like December ish. I should have known it wouldn't be it's not gonna be out  I'm not that cool. I got a thank you though. You started this you didn't finish it  But before you move to engage it the last time we talked you were at Popular Science wired  And also from slate I believe he's still at slate  Wired right why he's still at slate ladies and gentlemen, I bring you  Will Oremis I got it right salon  It's a Chevy Volt  You guys all three of you well, I bet you maybe Peter you managed to dodge having to write about the Apple story  Oh, yes, I did with a nick in the nick of time  But I know both will and Roberto has been spending a lot of ink you guys use ink still. Yeah  Okay, just pour right into the USB port to writing about the Apple story  And I know we have spent a lot of video and audio tape on the subject as well  Talked about it for an hour last week on all over shows, but this is one of those stories that evolves  I have a feeling this is gonna be like Microsoft versus a DOJ. This may go on for years  Yeah, so  The story so far you already know the story so far. I have to say and we've on Friday. We got  Apple's response to the Department of Justice which Neelay Patel at  The virtue is an attorney, you know, you know, it is where IV speaks says is a very unlawyerly  Document he was kind of surprised by it says this is almost as much a PR document as it is a pleading  This is for instance. Normally you would start with your strongest argument  That's the one that the judge is probably gonna read before he she falls asleep  In this case, they started with the easiest to understand argument and moved to the more complicated arguments  And he I think kind of implied that this may have been more of a PR

Start time: 394.12
End time: 424.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  the Apple was very forthcoming during a a  Conference call that this document was written so that the average person could read it not the judge not that they're like  This is written for like, you know, your average Joe. They're going to the court of public opinion  Yeah, which you know the FBI, you know, they  Did the same thing two motions they didn't need to do two motions one motion would have been  Appropriate but they decided to do two so then so now it's just been a war of a PR war between the FBI actually went

Start time: 424.22
End time: 480.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To and it said to the victims of the shooter and got them to you know  Plead for help from Apple and you know  I think people who watch this show are technically savvy and so they know that it is not really about this particular phone  No, no, and yet I I think we have to point out  The things that I feel like I have learned in this process don't reflect all that well on Apple either  I feel like both sides are now playing a PR game for instance  It's become apparent. We you I should have known this before and it was obvious before but now it is absolutely apparent that  Apple has always had access to the contents of your iCloud backup and would willingly give this to any law enforcement  Dooley, you know  Law enforcement agency that had in a court order. In fact, they even told the FBI  Well, just wait till it backs up bring it to a cat of Wi-Fi. It'll back up

Start time: 481.54
End time: 486.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They've been like well we have if we have the data there they're saying well if we have the data  We will give it to you. Did we have it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, sorry  I'm just second. Yeah

Start time: 497.14
End time: 560.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apple's iCloud backup  Is not encrypted or it is but Apple has the key that so  They have every now the only reason this phone is different and the FBI knew that too obviously because they made sure that the case  Was about a phone that hadn't backed up in six weeks and oh and by the way, they changed the password  Just in case they changed the password so it couldn't back up. They say no. No, we weren't doing that  We just didn't want it. I don't know what they why they changed the password, but they changed the password  Maybe they were trying to read the backup, but Apple said hey just come to us. We'll give you that stuff. So that's one  Apple Tim Cook in his interview with ABC kind of implied well if we write this it's like creating a cancer  But it's pretty clear that in fact the way Apple signs firmware updates  This would be specific to this phone and no other that that particular piece of software that Apple  Doesn't want to write wouldn't be usable on other phones. The real point here is it would be a precedent, right? Yes

Start time: 561.41
End time: 567.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's a precedent  so I like that if that software gets out still gonna be tough for someone to sign it and put it on another phone it doesn't  mean it's impossible because

End time: 575.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Apple has has the keys and I'm sure Apple  Does everything it can to protect those keys?

Start time: 575.52
End time: 591.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, but the press once the precedent is sent then you know, the New York DA say we have over a hundred  I got a bunch of phones in New York and they're just ready to as soon as this precedent is sent to say Apple we need you  To you know bypass the encryption that's on these phones as well

Start time: 591.84
End time: 600.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you a lot of people say Facebook Microsoft and Google are supporting Apple in this you say that Google wants you to think that  But they're not

Start time: 601.50
End time: 721.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's changed a little bit. So their initial  Response which was glossed as support for Apple really wasn't it was as tepid as you could get  Pitches tweets. Yeah  It was tweeted from his personal account and he phrased everything in a very general way so that it sounded like he was really supporting Apple  But in fact, he wasn't saying anything  he was saying, you know if this is a backdoor then you know, then that's wrong and and we don't support that and  You know, we don't support the idea of forcing companies to hack their customers iPhones  But that's that's you know that he didn't say whether he thinks that was actually the case here or not  And that's what really the whole question turns on me  There's is you know, is this a backdoor does it amount to a backdoor or does it not amount to a backdoor?  That's the very dispute that's in question. So  It was it was interesting  It was interesting to see because the tech companies that are Apple's rivals were under immediate pressure  Twitter, you know people on Twitter made sure that they were under immediate pressure to respond to this and to weigh in and  It was interesting to watch  You know, you could almost you could almost hear the the the backroom meetings with lawyers going on  At each of those companies headquarters where they're saying well, what can we say?  What can't we say and there was no response at all for the first 24 hours or so and then and then yes  And our PGI had his tweets which were again not really saying anything  It was designed to sound like it was saying something without saying something but Google has since  backed Apple in a much more substantive way and  Other other tech companies are now coming around as well some more than others  I thought it was interesting the one other tech CEO one other high-profile tech CEO  That really weighed in strongly right away and said Apple is right. I stand with Apple  It was actually the CEO of whatsapp, which is which is owned by Facebook  You know, maybe maybe because his company's owned by Facebook  He doesn't have to back up what he says because he doesn't have the authority to decide what whatsapp does  You know probably has to go through his boss Mark Zuckerberg

Start time: 721.96
End time: 731.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He must frankly he must fear what Apple fears  Which is that he would be a private he was certainly be approached and they do use encryption  But they would be approached immediately to hand over whatever they could hand over

Start time: 732.64
End time: 802.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  well, yeah, and whatsapp has built its business to a large extent on on privacy and  An Apple, you know, that's that's appropriate because that's what Apple is trying to do now as well  My immediate response when this case went public was this doesn't surprise me because Apple has been spoiling for this fight  You know ever since the Snowden revelations and there was the backlash against the tech companies for sort of standing by and letting everybody's data  Be be hoovered up  Apple  Tim Cook and Apple executives got together  I'm sure and they said look we should be the company that's out front on this  We you know, look at our rivals look at look at Google look at Facebook  Look at the other big tech companies out there their businesses are built on harvesting their users personal data  Our business isn't built on that, you know, we sell phones our customers are our customers  They're not our product and that gives Apple the ability to try to take the high ground and be the company  That will fight for your privacy the company that cares about your you know  Protecting your data rather than packaging your data for targeted advertisements  And I think it has really become genuinely a part of Apple's strategy ever since then and I think that they they were  Looking for a fight like this just as much as the DOJ was

Start time: 803.66
End time: 873.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  At the same time again  Apple would like everybody to think this is all private  But in fact they have your backup and if you do back up to iCloud they will give it to the law and for the law enforcement  So I don't I think that's as much marketing hype as it is anything else  What's interesting is there have been stories that Apple is now working on an uncrackable phone?  One that they can't you know, we're by the way  You know and I know it's not a backdoor  It's not about undoing the encryption what it is is about helping the FBI unlock the front door the very weak four-digit passcode  On this iPhone 5c, but Apple even calls it a backdoor. This is in their in their response to the court  They say this is not a case about one isolated phone  This is about the Department of Justice and the FBI seeking through the courts a dangerous power  That Congress and the American people withheld  The ability to force companies like Apple to undermine the basic security and privacy interests of hundreds of millions of individuals around the globe  That I might agree with but then it then it says the government demands that Apple create a backdoor to defeat encryption on the iPhone  Again, this is not written very precisely because it isn't a backdoor, but this is really for public

Start time: 873.78
End time: 876.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  opinion right like the CTO RSA calls it a backdoor

Start time: 877.66
End time: 994.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But there's a difference  Golden key right that we would give you a key that would allow you to unencrypt other iPhones  That's the implication Apple wants to give you and it isn't that at all  They modify the firmware so that the FBI could brute force  This phone and that's a very specific situation that wouldn't work  in fact on the sick but not very well anyway on the six digit code that they now use and  Will not work. In fact, I as an exercise and you and you mocked me Roberto, but as an exercise  I took my iPhone and I thought well  What if I wanted to lock this down if I'm a bad guy and I wanted to lock this down  Well, first thing you do is turn off iCloud backups  You're not gonna do that  The second thing you would do is turn off the four or six digit pin and turn on a long password, which I did  So I have a 16 character mixed case  Mixed numbers case alphanumeric plus punctuation password  That's a real pain by the way to type in and I turned off fingerprint unlocking because we don't really know how secure the fingerprint is  You know  So now this phone is encrypted you would need to brute force a much longer  Virtually uncrackable password unless you have some magic, but then I realized here's the interesting irony and this was brought up on ours, Tecnica  by leaf RIG  Most software already has a golden key  Even when I've done all that to my iPhone  Apple could push an update to this phone that would unlock it  Because all they have to do is wait till I unlock the phone the data is now unencrypted and available and  Upload it to the server without telling me and they've got it  That's basically what the FBI wants and that's sort of like what out but the point is that's just for one phone  That's true for everything. That's true for a Google phone. That's true for Windows. That's true for Macintosh  If there is a system update  Proceed that's true for Debian. That's true for things. We think of is secure if there's a system update  mechanism  Every system has a golden key backdoor

Transcript:  Especially if you put a little on right there's a there is an auto update  To  Adobe Creative Cloud that recently happened about a week ago. I think you know about that one Peter don't you?  Got a front row seat on that one thanks to my new gig at backblaze it started deleting  arbitrarily deleting  the first hidden directory on  Mac hard drives which  in the case of black backblaze users happened to be a  Directory a user writable directory that was there because of the app  So it started causing problems for our customers, but also for a lot of other people who had  their  information put in in these kinds of  Accounts and it's something that I got bit in my because I'm a creative cloud user and I had still like an idiot left  On auto update so I got the auto update pushed out and blam all of a sudden stuff start stops stops working, right?  Something else happened with the Mac last week the  Ethernet ports  on on some Macs  Stopped working and it turned out to be some kind of  weird  Software push that Apple fixed itself  But people had to delete plist files  In order to to resurrect the the Ethernet ports on their devices very strange stuff  But this is what happens with software updates right if creative cloud is well-behaved

Start time: 1090.16
End time: 1107.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you don't have auto update turned on while you're safe, but I think that  You it's probably the case isn't it that?  Creative cloud or Microsoft or am I could ignore?  Your auto update settings. I know Apple silently updates  Macintoshes all the time with malware

End time: 1181.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's the thing here's the thing that the the the the the the part of the the whole Apple  FBI saying that I  Guess I find so very interesting is that Apple has really positioned privacy as as this major important cornerstone of  How it likes to do business with its customers and how it differentiates itself from its competition  Here's the inherent problem that I've got and I have this perspective from having  Sold these devices to people for the for the past two years while I was working at I'm where I was also working at an Apple retailer  and  What I found is that people think it's BS  People think it's BS  You know  Muggles don't believe that Apple is any better at privacy, but you know what they're right. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't know. I wouldn't use an Android phone  Well, well, no my Android phone is safer than your iPhone. I don't know you're so  I'll tell you why first of all, there's no mass backup of the Android phone. You can turn off  I don't have a mass backup of my stuff. Well, you turn off iCloud, but most people it's it's on and they leave it on  So I'm not and you just could turn off backups to Google. You can use a strong password  Not all Android phones, but all Google Android phones and and many others are encrypted by default  strong encryption with a strong password  That the back door exists for this as it does everything including all of Apple's products that you could update behind the scenes and you know  leak information out

Start time: 1228.32
End time: 1232.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 1232.62
End time: 1271.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The I guess my point is and I'll let you finish sure. My point is this is theater on Apple's part  The they aren't protecting our privacy any better than anybody else is everybody is vulnerable to exactly the same thing  They're all behold beholden to law enforcement  Court orders and have always been doing this. In fact Apple's first request to the FBI is can we keep this on the lowdown?  Let's seal this. It was the FBI said no, let's make this public  Apple wanted to say you know what if you had the iCloud backup we could get that up and for you  They didn't want to have this public conversation. I think it's theater on all parts. I don't think Apple's any better than anybody else

Start time: 1271.56
End time: 1295.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry. Go ahead. No, you know, I was gonna say frequent frequent guest of the show Renee Richie  likes to talk about how there's this constant tug-of-war between  Security and convenience, you know and everything that we do and you know touch ID is great, right?  You know, but touch ID, you know, essentially is is it's just an overlay for the passcode system that you've you know

Start time: 1295.46
End time: 1327.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Already got on your phone and most people are not gonna do what I did  In fact, as soon as this shows over I'm turning it off because it's a big P ITA  Because you don't you want convenience so real but yeah, but I guess the point is there's two points  You can you can if you're a bad guy you can do things because you're willing to be inconvenienced because you want to hide your stuff  That the normal person isn't gonna do but my larger point is even if you do that  If you're using a smartphone  You can be compromised at will anytime

Start time: 1327.96
End time: 1368.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and yeah, I mean we've seen so many celebrity hacks. We've seen so many, you know the other  Incidences where people's devices have been compromised  I  you know don't dispute what you're saying Leo, but I think that  it's interesting to see Apple craft the the conversation or try to direct the narrative in the way that they're trying to direct it because  it is very telling, you know that they're trying to position themselves as the absolute arbiters of  personal privacy  When it comes to consumer products and quite frankly great advertising  It's it's great marketing and it's a message that they're way out in front of compared to any of their

Start time: 1368.78
End time: 1375.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But who is more evil the company that pretends to be?  Privates protecting your privacy when they're not or the company that says oh you don't have any privacy

Start time: 1375.96
End time: 1392.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wait on what grounds are you saying that it's all pretense?  I mean certainly they're theatrics here that certainly there's grant grandstanding and this fits in with Apple's, you know marketing push  But but on what grounds are you saying that that you know, somebody can hack your smartphone at will at any point  I mean if that were the case, why would we be having this fight?

Start time: 1393.84
End time: 1401.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, first of all, we as I said  We already know that if your phone is backed up to the iCloud which is almost everybody in Apple really strongly

Start time: 1401.68
End time: 1432.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't know if that's true because you know, that's five gigabits is nothing five gigabytes of backup of your iPhone is that's I mean  If you unless you have like that tiny little eight gigabyte or 16 gigabyte five gigabytes doesn't do anything  So you have to like pay extra to have the most people don't use iCloud backup  I don't think well unless because they're like why would I have to pay for that guy did obviously? Yeah  Well, there was this that was his work phone, right?  So we don't know what he asked so his private phone probably had all the information the work phone  And that's the thing we don't know anything that's you know, we don't know anything on this phone

Start time: 1434.00
End time: 1441.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, that's a good point but  As anybody's sputing my my thesis that Apple does have access to that they have the key

Start time: 1441.86
End time: 1458.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, they've they've and they've said they've said they have the keys  They said if we have the data we will hand it over to the and we will give it to law enforcement  If if they but if we don't have it and it's your personal stuff, right and you don't want it backed up for whatever reason  We're not gonna give that to you because of privacy so on and so forth and whether or not this is theater and it's theater on

Start time: 1458.94
End time: 1479.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Both ends. I think I'll say the very legitimately doesn't want this precedent because they just don't want the trouble of being asked to do this  I mean Cyrus Vance jr. New York State AG has 70 phones. He's ready and willing to go. Yeah. Oh good  So I don't blame Apple from a pure business point of view  But I think it's market speak to say oh you're the we're the privacy company

Start time: 1479.40
End time: 1524.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, but but there's a I think there's a key point you're missing here  Which is that Apple intentionally put this stuff out of its own reach with the with the security updates in iOS 8  Apple could have kept you know  The system as it was and it would be able to comply with these types of requests at any point  Apple just made a conscious decision after the Snowden affair in 2013  That it was going to put your data if you had a passcode on your phone and you had the data encrypted  It was going to build iOS 8 in the way that even Apple could not get into it  So that when the FBI came calling or when the local police department came calling  Apple would have to throw up its hands and say we can't get in here and that's that was on purpose on their part  We'll find out it's not working

Start time: 1524.70
End time: 1572.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, we'll find out because they did a couple things they put a very weak front door on it, which is the passcode  You know  I understand they did it because customers wanted to be convenience exactly what you're taking talking about Peter the trade-off between convenience and security so Apple  You you know in order to be secure on an iPhone you have to do a lot of things  That nobody's gonna do because they're a pain in the ass because I tried them and they are a pain in the ass  But at the same time I furthermore believe that one has to really  Understand that any company and maybe that's why Apple wanted to have this conversation. Mm-hmm any company can push an update  That would then just make everything move that they they'd be over  I mean, I'm not talking about update that the FBI can try as many passcodes as they want a simple update that says look  While the data is decrypted just send it up to the cloud done

Start time: 1573.98
End time: 1592.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's what they don't want to do  Cuz that vile that that means that that's probably what the FBI wants defeating the decryption  So and then it's not just Apple that's gonna have this if this if Apple loses it's not just everybody  No, I agree with you every device  It's worthless the only people encryption is gonna work for are the bad guys

Transcript:  But but I guess my point is it it's dopey to think that you have privacy on this and I you know  We the conversation should be this this week in law. We have a show this week in law Denise  Howell said what the conversation needs to be the public conversation needs to be with Congress and is do you want these to be private?  Or not do the the concerns of law enforcement and national security over?  Ride our desire for privacy given that this is a treasure trove of your personal information including GPS locations  Microphone camera this thing this phone in your pocket is the best spy device ever  That's why law enforcement is drooling over it  And it's but the question is can Apple make it secure and do we have the national will and will Congress make a law to?  Make it secure. I suspect what FBI thinks is either we're gonna go all the way to Supreme Court and we're gonna win this one  That would be okay, but better yet we'd lose it then we can go to Congress and say we need Kalia to  We need a law that says that they have to cooperate that they have to help that there is no privacy on a smartphone

Transcript:  Yeah, I think I mean I think you've nailed what the what the big idea is here  Which is the question of should a company have the right to create a device that can't be opened  They can't be unlocked that can't be tapped for spying purposes  You know in the past phone systems obviously the the government won that battle they they require the phone carriers to allow them to place  A wire tab there was the pen register

Transcript:  And now we have so much more information on our personal devices not and it's not just our smartphone as as  You know a number of people have pointed out recently  It's also you know the growing number of devices that we have in our home whether it's the nest thermostat or or a  Security camera or it's you have the Amazon echo and it's listening to everything you say all the time  More and more of our personal data and more and more sensitive stuff is on these devices and that's sort of a two-edged sword  I mean on the one hand that is why law enforcement is terrified of the idea that companies can create  Unlockable devices because all of a sudden the power that the government has always had to tap into your phone or to  To bust down your door if necessary if they have a warrant  That becomes moot in the face of of all the digital devices where we now  You know we now live so much of our lives on these devices and online on the other hand  You know we now have so much data on there that if the government could just tap into it at any time  That would be more horrifying in a lot of ways then then just being able to wire tap your phone or to or to show up

You know, so  Employ as much security as you need to given your circumstances  You know whether that means two-factor authentication whether that means file encryption whether that means  You know tokenizing everything that you're using whether that means putting yourself in a big panic room like Jodie Foster  I don't know. I don't care not my circus not my monkeys  Bottom line is though your data is your problem, right?  So whether it's in the cloud on or on your phone or on your device keep track of it  Understand how it's being used and and do what you have to to make sure that it's secure as possible under the circumstances

I didn't see the TV show. I read the article. I didn't see the TV show  He says I dared two expert hackers to destroy my life. You won't believe what happens next  Actually doesn't say that but he should have he really missed an opportunity  Really blew it. It's pretty bad. So there's he went to two different  Security pen testing companies  So these are white hat but apparently very accomplished hackers who?  Do this for companies, you know, they test their security and one of the so so one of the companies  specializes in social engineering a  Hacker named Chris had Nagi  So and this is something really companies need to be trained in because they don't hack your computer  They hack customer service reps and the problem with customer service reps is the first two words customer service if they think you're a customer  They're gonna try to give you service. So all you have to do is is give them a sob story  So here's what happened his company called social engineer  By the way, Kevin said the rules are you have two weeks to hack me as hard as you can  Using using any tool you want but you may not steal money  You may not steal data and you you may not cause any permanent damage or fallout. You can't tweet in my name or whatever  Before he began Kevin says Chris emailed me may God have mercy on you  Okay, I'm scared already right so first thing they did is he doxxed he doxxed Kevin and Kevin's a public guy  So he got his you know email address his employer  Social media accounts that was easy  And they did things that are interesting he for instance he got his home address by  Finding a picture that Kevin had tweeted of his dog. They zoomed in on the collar of the dog and that's was his home address  God when I think about the stuff I've tweeted  Once he had personal information they tried to find somebody he was a customer of so they called Time Warner and Comcast  Pretending to be his girlfriend  To see if he had an account he didn't they called his local utility company see if he had an account he didn't well  It's not under his name  They found this is interesting. They were able to find his social security number on a special-purpose search engine  They had a 13 page dossier on the guy and they finally figured out ah, here's what we're gonna  Do they had one of his one of their social engineers a woman and you can see this on the video  call his cell phone company and  And  Say I need access to his account and to make it more convincing they played a YouTube video of a crying baby in the background  She said I'm his wife. He's not married. He's left the country on business, and I just need to get an account because there's information  I need to apply for a loan. We really need to do it right now  Of course the customer service a rep said yeah, of course well let me give you all you poor woman  Let me give you access to his account  So that now they have access to his cell phone account they change his password  And  Of course it goes on from there because they were good actors. There was no hack really it was social engineering  Next guy next guy is even worse Dan tentler. He's with Phobos group  So tentler sends him a spear phishing attack an email  He figured out he was on Squarespace. He had Squarespace website  He said an email that looked like it came from Squarespace to Kevin saying hey Kevin in light of recent security issues surrounding SSL  We're taking the initiative to make our services more secure  We've made a number of changes that will require changes to your local SSL certificates  Just go to Squarespace comm slash certificates  And you can take advantage of our strongest security offering effort now even though Kevin knew he was being hacked that he was that he was  The target he was so convincing he believed it  Of course it wasn't Squarespace. It was one letter away from Squarespace. He clicked the link didn't notice the change in the URL  He didn't download a certificate. He in fact installed a Trojan and he was owned  Dan had a shell into his computer. He could execute commands. He got into everything  He got his OS  He put an OS 10 pop-up asking for his administrator password Kevin dutifully typed it  he installed a keystroke logger and used that to get his  Credentials for one password which meant he had every password now. It's over. He had his drop cam credentials  So he used the camera in his house to spy on him  He installed a remote access Trojan or a rat that snapped photos  Every two minutes from his laptop's camera and took a picture of his screen  And and of course the hack culminates and it's the lead of the story with a robotic voice Kevin sitting his computer kind of sleepy  The robotic voice saying Kevin you look bored coming out of his computer  He was owned and I  Guess the point of this article is this is a smart guy who's using reasonable protections  If you're a target you're basically there's nothing you can do and if you're a target by anyone with any sort of like  Even low-level resources you're in trouble.

Oh, okay. Yeah, that sounds great  And here's like all I can't remember my password, but I know the last four digits of my credit card card number  And they're like, oh that's good.

Well, not really said Kevin, but you're aware they exist  That you probably couldn't do anything about it if one of them wanted to beat you up in the street, right  He says people it's the same thing  The danger isn't the trained martial artist attacking you  Because that's your target at that point you're screwed anyway  It's it's it's doing dumb things like leaving your your car unlocked so that somebody can just walk in so some basic stuff  Obviously VPN on an open Wi-Fi network two-factor authentication don't click on suspicious links be a little more suspicious about phishing  emails  Change your passwords regularly  But but really the upshot of this article is your fuck.

We're okay with search warrants  We're okay with the idea that yeah, if you're a target then your data is not going to be secure whether it's a criminal hacker  Or whether it's the government or or spies or whoever  I think what what spooks me at least is that we now know that the government was actually involved in programs  Where they were just sucking up everybody's data on mass and then you can write software programs to comb through it  You can find people who haven't been accused of anything, you know  Who are are mentioning the wrong word in their private email?  You know that that's what gets me is the idea that it's you know  It's not going to be a case-by-case basis that it that if the government has a way to get into your devices  That there will be you know Palantir maybe will help them out  There will be ways to analyze all the data from everybody and run algorithms and target people based on that  Even if you're not the subject of a terror investigation  Yeah, I

Nobody has one  I mean, you know Microsoft missed out on the whole game and and they're probably not gonna catch up  But there's a real idea behind Windows  Windows 10 devices, which is that the future is  different devices same operating system same experience all of our devices whether you call it a phone or a tablet or a  Fablet or a laptop they they're all just basically different size screens  With different size, you know different input devices and different slightly different ui's for the same information  And and to me Microsoft was the first company to really see that and go all in on the idea that there should be  One operating system for all these devices and that it's it's stupid to have a different OS  Depending on what device you happen to be using

Transcript:  You know, it's interesting to compare what Microsoft is doing with Windows and the devices that run Windows compared to  where Apple is  when it comes to the development of its workflow because Apple is taking a very  workflow centric  Perspective on this where and Johnny I've has talked about this a number of times where his goal their goal at Apple is to make  the user interface  Invisible just to make the work  the key thing  But they understand intrinsically that when you're using an iPad or when you're using an iPhone or when you're using a Mac  You're using a different device in your you've got a fundamentally different user experience  for each device because of the way that data is input because of the way that you interact with it because of the screen because  Of the you know the weight because of the operating system that's running on it because the applications whatever  None of that stuff is important  What's important is getting the work done that you want to get done and then getting out of your way as quickly as possible

Transcript:  So what's what makes it so interesting is yeah, I mean, you know, it's it's whole  Strategy  The narrative that we hear it sort of promoting with with Windows mobile is  You know, it doesn't matter what devices in your hand. The work is is going to be the same  Yeah, but all the best apps they're writing are for the iPhone  Yeah, and it's interesting isn't it but now we're seeing Microsoft take a much more  Service centric view  Towards the way it does business as well. I mean, you know office 365 is is a pretty good  Corporate citizen on the Mac side of things sure. We don't get access  The yeah, that's fine

We'll get to that in just a little bit  I'm really glad to hear this is good news that somebody finally realized that slide to unlock shouldn't really be a patentable  technology Apple sued Samsung  Claiming that they had violated  Apple's patent by putting slide to unlock on a Samsung phone a  Jury found Samsung guilty three of Apple's patents and awarded  Apple 119 million dollars  It's not the 2.2 billion Apple was watch asking for but it's you know 119 million  something  Well a judge has thrown it out. In fact thrown out two of the patents including slide to unlock  And the judgment is is reversed  Which I think is right  Auto-correcting text and auto-correcting text and slide to unlock really can you pet them?

Transcript:  Yeah, there was a  There was some lawyers I believe of some Switzerland  But but I'm sure somebody will will correct this if I've got it wrong  There were some lawyers who sat down with me when this whole  Apple Samsung stuff was going on a couple years ago  And they said look the reason that you're having all these crazy frivolous lawsuits is because you guys let a jury of regular people  Decide IP cases that's insane, right?  You know the average, you know, it's great that you guys have this jury system  So that the you know, if you or I get accused of murder, then we get a jury of our peers  But if if Samsung gets accused of ripping off certain technical elements of of Apple's phone  Why on earth should it be a jury of average Americans who are deciding that case?  And if that weren't the case, then you wouldn't have all this insanity  And and so in in that country they have you know, it's like a panel of experts who decide those cases  It's not a matter. It's not a matter for a jury trial. We got corporations or people friend. Oh, yeah

Start time: 5921.54
End time: 5994.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is this is what what I wrote about when this happened  Which is that you know Facebook was really shrewd about how they pitched this to the public  The whole thing grew out of some of those Mark Zuckerberg town halls where he opens it up to questions from anybody around the world  And at two different town halls Zuckerberg was asked by somebody what about that, you know  Shouldn't we have a dislike button and he always sort of deflected it but it gave Facebook it started that conversation  He was always very coy about it and it would start this conversation about  Should Facebook have a dislike button?  and I think that Facebook really has been wanting to do this all along because if you look at Facebook's algorithm the like button is one of  The biggest signals that Facebook has as to how people are interacting with the content on the social network  So, you know the like button if something gets liked a thousand times to Facebook's algorithm that says oh, this is a great post  Let's show that to more people  But the problem is that the like button doesn't tell you very much all it really tells you is that like, you know  This post was somehow framed in a way that got people to hit like on it  There even posts, you know people a lot of people will like a post without actually reading the whole thing just to you know  Just to say oh, yeah  I saw that or to you know to send a signal to the of acknowledgement to the friend

Start time: 6010.68
End time: 6034.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because that is that that you know  It's algorithm is all they're always looking for more and finer grained data on how people are behaving on the site  And so as long as the like button was crucial to the algorithm  Then Facebook's algorithm would end up sending these posts viral that people were just hitting like on because the post was somehow  You know  The foot post was somehow framed to make you hit like or to trick you into hitting so they're gonna know the difference now

Start time: 6034.18

Start time: 6036.40
End time: 6046.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah  If they can get people to start using these alternatives to the like button  They will have all sorts of new data that they didn't have before on what exactly how exactly a given post is resonating

End time: 6054.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But don't they really want dislike? I mean, that's the I don't know how you treat like different  I thought they were gonna treat it all like a like as I don't know how you treat sad

Start time: 6056.16
End time: 6139.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Different so they haven't said yet. I talked to them about this. They haven't said yet  Exactly how they're gonna do it. They've said that for now all six to the algorithm will just register as a light, right?  That's what I thought. Yeah sad it'll just show up as a like to the algorithm, but that's not gonna be the case forever  They're gonna start the algorithm is gonna start finding ways to incorporate this  I push them I talked to the product manager and I pushed them a little bit  On how it might do this and they were really hesitant to say that oh  We just you know  Just we want to get a feel for how people are using it and we really just want to make the experience the best for  the users, you know, I'm sure that's all true, but but I  Speculated a little bit about some ways that they could use this data to improve the algorithm  So one idea is you know when you have a newscast on TV  or or a  Show like this we can tech you don't want to have every single segment be really heavy, right?  You want to mix in some some funny stuff some human interest story cats on Roombas?  Yeah, cats on Roombas exactly. So maybe Facebook uses this data to try to fine-tune your feed  It can do some experiments and figure out what's the optimal mix of stories that make you happy versus stories that make you sad versus  Stories that make you angry. Maybe they learn about you over time that you don't like stories that make you angry  it makes you you know, you just end up closing Facebook and not coming back and  Facebook's algorithm reacts to that and then then doesn't give you stories that make you angry and it does make sense

End time: 6209.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I didn't know about the confused. Yeah, I should have read Casey's story  Yeah, they had a yay button in some of the early tests  They told me they actually did a bunch of different tests with different configurations. Nobody used the yay button  I guess particularly outside the United States people didn't know what the heck

Transcript:  Raining and that's kind of a yay, isn't it? And nobody can agree on it whether it's called raise hands or praise hands  I've seen it both ways and it doesn't make sense either way. It's an inscrutable emoji and it's popular

Start time: 6229.02
End time: 6231.56

Transcript:  So why wouldn't they people use a yay button? It seems like that

Start time: 6232.64
End time: 6277.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, if you're if you're looking at my theory, which is that this is that this is not just about the user experience on Facebook  But it's also about Facebook gathering more data and inscrutable is not good, right?  The opposite of inscrutable I guess you want as  Scrutable. Yeah, and so that they want these to be very clear because you know who else might like this  It's not just not just the the newsfeed algorithm  But advertisers would love to know when they're advertising on Facebook how people are reacting to those ads  I mean that you know  famously the problem with advertising is  That you don't know whether it's doing any good or you don't know how people are responding to it  And there are all these ways that you try to measure it  This could be a way for Facebook to be able to tell give advertisers access to some more data about how their ads are

Start time: 6277.74
End time: 6283.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This seems like maybe we shouldn't have ads with but don't you remember dig used to have you couldn't sum up or thumbs down an ad  And they said advertisers wanted that because they don't want to show you an ad that makes you unhappy  So that was useful signal for the advertisers a thumbs down is a value

End time: 6323.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, you know and they love it and they're sharing right every little bit of information  they can throw into the giant machine and machine mix it I know why they didn't have a confused button because  Everybody on Facebook would use that all the time. Yeah, like half the half the posts I see are confused and on Twitter  They're all confusing like here's the thing about Donald Trump. I'm just gonna put anger watch boom angry

Start time: 6380.34
End time: 6480.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love I love that because it's to me. It's it's this people don't even realize it. It's one of the most  Complex and influential machine learning algorithms out there in the world  They have these artificial intelligence experts working on how to extract the maximum possible  insight from these these crude little actions that you take on Facebook whether it's hitting like or whether it's how long you spend  Viewing a given post on your mobile phone before you scroll past it  They look at you know  They look at more and more all the time and the reason is because they want to keep that algorithm from being gameable  You know if it's if it's just clicks and likes then you end up with a Facebook  That's very much like the one we had I'd say around 2012 2013 where everybody is forced to  To write their posts in such a way that they're tricking you into either clicking or liking and that is in fact what happened  Direct result of the fact that Facebook's algorithm used such crude data sources  So the more different data sources Facebook can incorporate into that algorithm  the more difficult it becomes to game and the closer your newsfeed becomes to  Your own ideal newsfeed of what you would like to see when you open Facebook every day and that's different for different people  Some people want nothing but cats on Roomba's chasing ducks and other people want nothing  But you know serious discussion of power they claim they want a lot of see a lot of serious discussion of politics and news or  That sort of thing other people just want to see their friends photos  And you know why shouldn't they be able to have a Facebook?  That's just their friends photos so Facebook's working on that all the time in these in these minute ways  And it's just it's just amazing the level of sophistication that they've that they've already achieved in terms of doing that

I put my stories on there. I feel like the reason people follow me on Twitter  I don't think anybody  Really cares what I have to say about this or that  I mean, I assume they're following me because they want to see my stories and so  If not if they were if they were coming they're hoping to see the real  Will Remus and and get an insight into you know, what kind of guy and they're gonna be there probably they've probably unfollowed me right now

Oh, yeah, just endorsed, you know, that's racist. Yeah  Why did you call little black Sambo true and yeah, and that's a powerful  I mean, I know people get frustrated about about people calling each other out for politically incorrect things on Twitter  but I think it's honestly a force for good because  95% of the racism the sexism that's in this world is is it's unthinking right?  It's not people aren't trying to be racist  They don't realize and Twitter is a place where when people say stuff that's racist or sexist it gets noticed  It gets called out it gets publicized and all of a sudden we can have an open conversation  About set that stuff and maybe you know, maybe people can learn from it  So I think I think Twitter is a force for good in that respect

So the folks on the board said oh, no, no, no, it's not that  It's just gonna be a search engine that will lead people to Wikipedia be a better search for Wikipedia  Many in the community were furious according to this article in motherboard that the details of such a large project had been withheld  by an organization that prides itself on radical transparency  Their public story that they weren't working on a search engine was directly contradicted by a grant proposal. They made to the Knight Foundation  And now the director is gone, it's I love I give them money every month I love Wikipedia  I'm very grateful. I think it's a perfect example of what the Internet can do when people get together kind of  You know pro bono to do great work, but little trouble there in paradise  YouTube has now a team to to protect to minimize copyright  violations actually really what it is to prevent copyright violations  Violations actually really what it is to prevent content ID from  Incorrectly penalizing their their best content creators  They've been getting complaints a lot of complaints from some of the top channels on YouTube that they've been losing money  They've been losing revenue.
