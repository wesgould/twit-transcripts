Start time: 238.76
End time: 247.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean that's a matter of debate. When Pi is in the millions and billions it's not really  a joke. It's cute that it's Pi but it's still serious money. And then the Google Council

Start time: 252.42
End time: 277.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  did a blog post. David Drummond. Saying that these companies are banding together in an  anti-android stance. That essentially they want to litigate not innovate. Yes and they  want to pass on a charge to consumers so essentially you're paying Microsoft 15, like people like  Samson are paying Microsoft stuff like 15 bucks. We don't know but it's thought that

Start time: 277.82
End time: 282.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 282.62
End time: 300.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that are licensing Linux from Microsoft. So it's like these companies are starting a kind  of anti-innovation anti-android cabal and then Microsoft, Frank Shaw came back at them  with a tweet saying but yeah you guys were, we gave you the opportunity to be in on the

Start time: 300.50
End time: 304.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 311.38
End time: 320.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  patenting up. Yeah and if they're trying to say otherwise it's a complete PR war of words  that means nothing to the reality of the situation. But doesn't Google have to do that to defend

Start time: 320.26
End time: 327.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  themselves? I mean maybe they don't believe in litigating. If you talk to a patent lawyer  yeah they do. But Google's not litigating at this point. They're just getting patents.

Start time: 328.12
End time: 332.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they can counter sue when they're confronted with more patent litigation. As defense. Right.

Start time: 332.76
End time: 336.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

End time: 341.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

End time: 356.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm just saying they're trying to keep us. They should lie down. That's why they lost.

Start time: 357.54
End time: 386.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They were too passive. It's a bad situation to be in because even like the whole teaming  up of companies like with Sony teaming up with Apple and stuff like that like all these  smaller companies come together as one. I'm like Sony if you didn't have Android you wouldn't  sell any handsets. Sony would not sell one single phone right now if it wasn't for Android.  And even their Android phones suck. I'm sorry Sony. I love most of your products but your  phones are garbage. The Xperia. Yeah they try to put their own thing on top of Android  and then you want to go and try and work with Apple because Apple's never going to do anything

Start time: 386.90
End time: 398.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  for you. But I agree with Drummond when he says the problem is that these companies who  are getting steam-rollered by our superior product instead of innovating. Instead of

Start time: 398.46
End time: 403.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  competing on a product level. Are suing. Well Microsoft is involved and they're trying to

Start time: 403.44
End time: 407.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  compete on a product level. And failing miserably by the way. Are they? I think they are. They

Start time: 408.38
End time: 411.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  are. The numbers. They're not selling well but the phones look good and it's pretty.

Start time: 412.18
End time: 419.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're not selling well is it pretty good? Look through this way. I'd rather have a selling.  One at a time. This is going to be great. I'd rather have something that looked horrible

Start time: 419.62
End time: 423.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  that sold hand over fist and something that looks good and nobody wants to buy. I don't

Start time: 423.38
End time: 431.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  think anybody disagrees that Windows Phone 7 is actually aesthetically superior to Android  right? It is. It is. It's not as functional. Maybe they need more marketing. Maybe they

Start time: 431.96
End time: 435.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  need a bigger push. Maybe they can give everyone a phone for free. I think they did a pretty

Start time: 435.82
End time: 440.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  damn good marketing push and I just think people were happy with the phones they had.

Start time: 440.26
End time: 443.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think the race was over when they entered the race. Unfortunately. They can't be happy

Start time: 443.92
End time: 464.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  with the phone they had because Android keeps on phones hand over fist. People are trading  in phones left and right to get new phones and upgrading phones. The numbers are skyrocketing  so the market is available out there to them so their marketing can't be that great if  they can't be pulling in the numbers that Android is growing in. Android is doubling  triple. There are people buying these phones. But isn't Android most popular among first

Start time: 465.70
End time: 484.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  time smartphone owners? That's what I'm talking about. The marketing of Microsoft. I am recalling  a hazy version of the statistic from a while ago but I do recall writing actually about  this that people who had bought smartphones within the past six months or were considering  buying smartphones for the first time were looking toward Android. Is that because of

Start time: 485.14
End time: 489.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  all the ads Motorola did for Droid and all of that? No, I think it's because it's available

Start time: 489.14
End time: 504.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  on more networks and there are some of them that are really f'n cheap too. You could walk  in and have a new contract and get an Android phone for what, 99 dollars? Let me just make  a wild guess. iPhone? iPhone? iPhone? Android. Android? Android. iPhone. You see what kind

End time: 508.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 515.58
End time: 520.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  like every time people start talking about Apple I put headphones on. I have far preferred

Start time: 520.60
End time: 525.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apple armor on. And everybody watching at home knows I far prefer Android to the iPhone

Start time: 525.64
End time: 564.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  and I carry an Android phone as well. Well let's put it this way. Sony makes an air-like  laptop. It's lighter than this. It is sexy. It comes with a... But it runs Windows. Besides  that I'm just talking about the aesthetics of it and the way it feels. But that's an  issue. The way it feels. No forget the operating system. Just the way it feels. You know Apple  makes things that are pretty right? But I'm running Windows on this air so I can do this  and I was... Would you stop and listen to me before I come and take that big chair from  you? I'm trying to tell you something. You want my Dr. Evil chair? Sony makes a really  nice thin light beautiful laptop and it's awesome. The problem is that it costs $3,000.  And I'm like it looks so sexy and that's what everybody buys that for. Because Apple does  pretty. And this is pretty but it's three grand. I'm like I can buy two of these for

Start time: 565.02
End time: 582.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  three grand. You know what? We're going to have a test of your theory because Intel has  announced these ultra mobile PCs that will run less than $1,000 that look just like a  MacBook Air. This is coming in early 2012 or maybe late 2011. So this will be a test.  I don't think they're going to outsell these. Then I'll buy two of them and give you one.

Start time: 582.98
End time: 596.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well that's because people attach so much emotion to the glass and plastic and ones  and zeros behind hardware to the point that it doesn't have anything to do with the hardware  itself. You know Apple people are not going to buy that product. If I had known that you

Start time: 598.50
End time: 604.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  were going to be sensible I would never have invited you to this. You're absolutely right.

Start time: 604.54
End time: 608.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Of course you're right. It's a religious war. I would buy that Sony laptop if it didn't

Start time: 608.34
End time: 612.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  cost $3,000. I just want something light. This is going to be the test. I have Mac and PC

Start time: 612.66
End time: 616.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  at home. I'm just like when I travel I want something light. Would you buy the Intel Ultrabook?

Start time: 617.88
End time: 636.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wouldn't even consider it. I'd rather pay $300 more for something that's adorable. That's  not even useful. That's beautiful. It's $710. What are MacBook Airs at this point? $999.  What's $300? I mean it's a lot of money sure. What's money? We have to support America.

Start time: 637.08
End time: 642.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The children man. To get back to the phones. Do you think that's why they buy Android? Because

Start time: 643.60
End time: 648.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it's cheaper? For a lot of people yeah. Or because you're a T-Mobile or a Sprint user and you

Start time: 648.60
End time: 673.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  don't have a choice. Windows is just as cheap. Again that marketing thing and the bad taste in  the mouth. I had Windows smartphones forever. I've got a phone that's this tall, that wide at home,  that still runs and it runs Windows but I would never buy another Windows phone because of that  experience from moving to new smartphones. So Microsoft has a bad marketing. They haven't  gotten in people's brains. This is awesome because when you pick one of those phones up I'm like  this is sexy. I'm not giving them my iPhone for it but I picked that over Android but they're

Start time: 673.74
End time: 686.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  not getting that across to the masses. To underscore what Jolie O'Dell said. This is like politics  now. It's like red states and blue states although Android is the yellow state, iOS is the blue state,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  agency I've never had Blackberry. It's girls with nails. You can't type without a keyboard. Dang,

Start time: 710.46
End time: 729.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  what? Girls, every woman I know in New York won't touch a smartphone. They're like look I can't click  anything. I have nails. I have an iPhone. I just said Northeast. We're on the west coast right now.  I said at home. On Northeast. I'm just telling you. This is the girls with nails theory. Let's vote  this out. Somebody back me up.

Transcript:  iPhone. So I'm very surprised at how successful Android is. And yes it's like a cumulative across  all the OEMs but 40% of the market according to com score with Apple at 26%. Can I note one thing?

Start time: 742.88
End time: 747.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know how boring patents are? We talked about patents for 30 seconds and just went on. No. Okay,

Start time: 749.78
End time: 761.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  let's get back to patents. You know what? Before the show began we were talking about evil in this  context. I think this actually is an interesting topic because the issue was that Google is evil.

Start time: 762.46
End time: 783.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No. Yes. You said so. No, I said it's a corporation. You said it's amoral. That's different. It's amoral  which is not evil. My problem with Google right now is they're doing this whole all these poor  people doing the Android platform are getting persecuted by these big bad corporations and their  big bad patent lawsuits. Hey IBM can we have some of those patents? Yeah this sucks. Patent law is stupid.

Start time: 784.22
End time: 790.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a little ridiculous for a corporate lawyer to say oh they're bad because they're suing us.

Start time: 790.70
End time: 804.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah they're only bad because they're suing Google. And when Google has the power to counter sue I  think that we'll see a lot of this rhetoric go down the toilet. You won't hear anything about it once  they have patents. Exactly. It'll be back where patent law belongs. Off the box. So do we agree

Start time: 805.28
End time: 809.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that software patents are the real problem here? No. Or is it corporate behavior that's the real

Start time: 809.78
End time: 826.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  problem? Corporate behavior surrounding software patents. Together. It's an evil nexus. It's the  evil act the axis of evil. Well it's like everyone has to roll around in this patent mud because the  system's so broken. Because you have to. We have no other alternative. You cannot not participate. It's

Transcript:  gonna work itself out. We shouldn't be talking about it. If Microsoft wasn't tweeting that Google  was trying to screw them on deals then it wouldn't even matter. Well I mean money's gonna change hands and it's all gonna be you know water

Start time: 835.04
End time: 851.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  under the bridge in a matter of weeks or months. Exactly. But then don't you ever wonder okay so when it comes  to like Oracle and Google how do patents on something like Java work? You know it's supposed  to be open source software and Android is too. Look at this. That's another huge lawsuit. Open source

Start time: 852.26
End time: 909.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  oh boy. Yeah Sun and I guess Oracle now. Yeah. And Java. Here's the funny thing I don't think we would have seen  a lawsuit if Oracle hadn't bought Sun. No of course not. No. In fact some may make the case that that's why Oracle  bought Sun. Yeah you said. We can sue Google now. We've been waiting for that. I am thrilled. This is a great panel. I'm so glad we brought you  all the way up here from San Francisco Alexia Sotsis of techcrunch.com. Jolie O'Dell now of venturebeat.com. Great to have you.  Congratulations once again.

Transcript:  I have to say that this story came out before we did Twitter last week.  I wasn't so much that I looked into it, I researched it, and I saw that it was patent nonsense.  It was that I don't like survey results anyway.  But you know who fell for this? BBC fell for it. CNN fell for it.

Start time: 1383.72

Start time: 1390.48
End time: 1401.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And the problem too is like in this world, everything's viral.  So if someone sees it, they want to post it because other people are posting it.  So they piggyback off each other like, oh, somebody else wrote about it, it must be true.  And then next thing you know, everybody's pulling retractions.

Start time: 1403.00
End time: 1454.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the site that posted it has on its own site, ten or five or eight telltale signs  that this was a hoax that you should have uncovered.  The domain was registered a month ago.  The test mentioned a test that is copyrighted and can't be given online.  The phone number, if you tried to call it, and the press release refers back to the phone  number of his other websites.  I don't know if that's going to work.  The address doesn't exist.  All the material was, he stole stuff, including images from another site.  Now this one I think you probably might take exception to, Alexia.  He says the website is made in WordPress.  Come on now.  I think TechCrunch also is made in WordPress.  And so is VentureBeat.  And so is my blog.

Start time: 1454.54
End time: 1456.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It would have been made on Blogger.

Start time: 1456.54

Start time: 1462.34

Transcript:  It's very typical of media these days.  Everybody's in a hurry.  Very short news cycle.  It's a great headline.  And what's the stat?  97% of all stats are false or something.

Start time: 1504.76
End time: 1515.00

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, there was a hacker news post that's like, don't do stupid shit.  And that's the only way that you get successful is to stop doing stupid shit.  But that's a long term point of view.  Stop making dumb mistakes.  I mean, this is a dumb mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like for serious blogging.  Like for serious, bro.  Actually, that's not true because all we ever do is rehash your guys' stories.  We let you do the reporting, but this is opinion, right?  So opinion is based on original reporting, but not necessarily doing original reporting.  This is all emotion.  Do you think that's taking emotion out of us?  That shows a lack of enterprise on our part?

Start time: 1577.62

End time: 1594.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's your angle?  Right.  Well, the angle, ask her what the angle is.  The angle is that's not true.  The angle is too emotional in preposition.

Start time: 1594.28
End time: 1599.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Most of the things people talk about don't solve problems.  We just talked about patent law.  We have nothing really to do with it until the end result comes out.  I mean, but we talk about it.  We get emotional.  Well, we can rail about it.  But I mean, again, emotion comes into it with people who aren't really involved.  So some people like Apple or they like Windows and they'll say, you suck.  And I'm like, really, dude?  It's a computer.  I use it.  You use it.  You don't have to dislike me, dislike them, but people get so crazy about everything.  We can talk about anything and have an opinion about it.

End time: 1706.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is something that will both get you upset and angry and maybe something we can  do about.  This comes from Jolie Odell's article this week on Venture Beat.  How widespread is this?  A UC Berkeley research group said that some Internet service providers, when they see  a search word, will redirect you instead of to the Google page for that search word, for  instance, to the site that you're looking for.  So if you look for Apple, they'll take you to Apple's site.  Do they get paid by Apple for that?

Start time: 1707.95
End time: 1714.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it advertising?  I didn't know it's affiliate marketing, which has always been to me kind of a little gray.

Start time: 1715.22
End time: 1717.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they could make the excuse, well, if you typed Apple in this.

Start time: 1718.16
End time: 1727.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now Apple would pay somebody at some point, but there's such a long chain between the  people who are doing this kind of marketing and Apple.

Start time: 1728.14
End time: 1730.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The company that does this is called Paxfire?

Start time: 1731.14
End time: 1764.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One of the companies that does this.  Oh, there's more than one.  Okay, so the thing about these researchers at Berkeley, they completely stumbled upon  this.  They were doing some really esoteric DNS behavior research and they were like, whoa,  we're seeing all these weird redirects.  I wonder what that's all about.  And so they poked the hornet's nest and they found this collection of ISPs that were working  with Paxfire that's doing this.  And then I got an email from a reader who said that Time Warner is doing the same thing.  Now I haven't substantiated that because it's a weekend and I'm trying to relax.  Well, thank you for coming.  Thanks for coming here.

Start time: 1765.14
End time: 1776.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the rationale is that I'm sure the ISPs say, well, if you're looking for, if you search  for the word Bloomingdale's, you want to go to the Bloomingdale site.  So we're doing you a favor.

Start time: 1776.18
End time: 1779.04

Transcript:  You know, when you assume that's a mistake, you get taken to court.

Start time: 1779.76
End time: 1783.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Apple, certainly you could be thinking about something besides computers.  I could be thinking about Apple's.

Start time: 1785.42
End time: 1797.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I mean, I think it's one of the EFF attorneys made the really great point.  You have certain expectations as a user of how your computer and the Internet are supposed

Start time: 1798.00
End time: 1803.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to behave and your Internet service provider should not change that behavior for money.

Start time: 1803.71
End time: 1832.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Exactly.  Because the one thing I'm tired of is, you know, Facebook knowing that I want to look  at women with large breasts at two o'clock in the morning.  Everybody knows that.  That's what I say to people.  Like, how do they know what I want?  Did I click that?  Everybody knows that.  You know, and they, when certain things you expect like that, or like we were talking  about Gmail and the advertisement Gmail, I've never once in my life clicked one of  those advertisements and I probably never will.  But they scan my email and they have something very relevant.  There's nothing wrong with that.  No, there's not.  I'm saying those are.  What is something very relevant?

Start time: 1832.24
End time: 1833.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, here's the thing.

Start time: 1833.24
End time: 1848.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what you expect to happen, right?  I'm using a service for free.  I use a service for free.  I expect that to happen.  And the ISP thing, that's different because I'm paying you.  So I don't want you coming in telling me what I want to look for when I'm paying for your  service to give me.

Start time: 1848.44
End time: 1857.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's a very salient point about free versus paid.  If your service is free, you are the product.  Yes.  And you just have to resign yourself for that.  You deal with it.

Start time: 1858.14
End time: 1859.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Like I said, Facebook, I know what you like that I like, you know.

Start time: 1860.14
End time: 1866.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a rephrase of, I can't remember who said it.  If you don't know who the product is, you're the product, right?  If you don't know what they're selling, then they're selling you.

Start time: 1867.57
End time: 1871.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Two advertisers.  Two advertisers.  And that's a neutral fact of internet life.

Start time: 1871.32
End time: 1876.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's double-dipping for an internet service provider who's taking money for a service  to also sell you to advertisers.

Start time: 1877.90
End time: 1891.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, why do you think they need to work with marketing companies to do affiliate marketing  when they're already collecting money from a bunch of other people?  Because there's not enough money in it or they're greedy.  Well, raise your prices then, dude.  Get a better business model.  Don't screw around with shady internet marketing companies.

Start time: 1891.90
End time: 1916.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this started before with, they used to do this with DNS error traffic.  So you would type in a website that was wrong.  And instead of getting a Google or a 404 error that you would normally expect,  you'd get one from your internet service provider that would say, perhaps you meant.  And they'd make money on that.  They'd get clicks and links.

Start time: 1917.14
End time: 1920.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't they still do that, like rerouting their assets to advertising pages?  They do.

Start time: 1921.87
End time: 1925.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Transcript:  Julie, so why is Apple, this is what I didn't understand about the story.  Apple's got like $70 billion in surplus.  Why would they do this?  Why are they doing this?

Start time: 1933.52
End time: 1949.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is Apple doing this though?  Like, I am not clear that Apple or Bloomingdale's or any of the other  keyword companies mentioned know that this is happening.  Then again, I'm not sure that they don't know what's happening.  How far down that rabbit hole do you want to go?  Because you could make...

Start time: 1950.36
End time: 1959.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm sure they're happy it's happening once they find out.  And if they didn't have anything to do with it, thanks.  We'll keep paying because you brought someone here.  Regardless.  They don't care.

Start time: 1959.18
End time: 1966.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it a fruitless endeavor to advertise something that isn't actually  involved and isn't paying any money to reroute to the site?  Think of how many times...

Start time: 1967.18
End time: 1981.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, what if you went to eBay and bought an Apple computer because the  shopping result was right there in the Google search, then Apple loses revenue.  So it is in their best interest, especially when Google is showing shopping  results at the very top of the page to get you away from Google as quickly as possible.

Start time: 1981.45
End time: 2005.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Exactly.  Especially when you cash in on that result.  Now, normally, whatever the percentage is, people just get by it.  But there have been times when I've clicked through something like that, I've  gone to the wrong page and I stop and I'm like, oh, that's interesting.  And it happens to be something relevant to what I was looking for.  It isn't what I wanted, but I stopped to check it out before I went where I wanted.  Now, if that percentage is 5% of those people they can cash in on, that's good money.  Why not try and do it and get away with it?

Transcript:  And Google told me they've been very aggressive about it too because Google  loses when people don't look at their search results in their ads.  So unless we think that Google cares about internet neutrality, it's taking their money away.  So once again, we see this pattern of Google PR trying to make it out like they're  the white hats when really they just are losing money because they're not evil enough or something.  So they're being pushy with the ISPs that are doing this.  And some users are saying, yeah, this doesn't happen with my Google searches anymore.

That should be illegal. Yes.  Or you make a law.  I think that should be a law that you can't redirect search traffic because you feel like it and because you make money from it.

Transcript:  It's okay.  I don't mind.  The court, this is a very interesting court decision that really impacts free speech.  And I'm it's complicated.  So I'm going to see if I can explain this.  You remember the ICE, the Immigrations and Custom Enforcement arm of the Department of Homeland Security closed down some sites because of copyright violation.  They actually took the domain name.  That's how they closed it down.  The Spanish company Puerto 80 lost rojadirecta.com and rojadirecta.org.  Those names no longer redirect to their sites.  Basically it was a copyright violation asserted by probably American companies, I would guess.  The court decided, the Supreme Court, I think that's the Supreme Court.  I think that's the highest court in the land, is it not?  Actually, let me check who this was that did this.  All this fine print is confusing me.  Which court was it?  The court that decided this, I think it was the Supreme Court, said, no it wasn't the Supreme Court.

Start time: 2340.14
End time: 2377.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Supreme Court has some other issues.  But the court that ruled this said it is not a violation of their free speech.  They can simply redirect to another site.  They can say, no, you can still do that.  Just buy a new domain name.  We took your domain name.  But because you have other ways to publish, we aren't blocking your free speech.  This is where some other Supreme Court decisions get involved.  A 1939 case in which the Supreme Court said, just because you can exercise your free speech elsewhere  doesn't mean that anybody has the right to abridge your free speech in one place.

But what's funny is this company has, in fact, created new sites with slightly different domain names,  but they have no way of telling their viewers, oh, you go to rohadirecto1.com and you'll be able to watch this.

Somebody will complain from the movie industry or the record industry or the television industry,  and ICE will say, no problem, because in the U.S. we'll just make sure that they don't have that domain name  and it doesn't work in the U.S. anymore.  That takes them off the air, problem solved.  They're doing it a lot.  It's actually very scary.  The fact that a court upheld their ability to do that is even more terrifying.

And they got in and took a ride.  Now, there's two conferences.  The Black Hat conference is the more serious conference.  The Black Hat conference, Suit and Ties, a lot of Feds there, a lot of white hat hackers.  And then there's DEFCON, which is definitely a little more dark side.  Shady.  Apparently, according to CBS News, the Feds hang around after Black Hat and they go to DEFCON to recruit.

And maybe we should ask Alexia and Jolie because they're probably more at risk of this.  But Google did have in their Google goggles capability, they took out the face recognition capability because they said it would be dangerous.  Now, nobody's going to walk down the street and take a picture of Odokta and say, oh, that's Odokta.  I'm following them home.  But I think women are very legitimately concerned about stalkers taking their pictures in tools like this or using Facebook and tools like this to get personal information.  Isn't that a real concern?

And this might be extremely naive.  And go ahead, call me out on it.  But who's going to snap a picture of me and then use facial recognition software to find out that this is my Facebook page and like, I don't know, hack into my Facebook, pretend to be my friend and then find my address and show up?

When I talk to girls about Facebook or I mean, Foursquare, I say check in on your way out.  Don't check in on your way in and don't check in the same place every day.  Like, I go to the gym on Tuesdays, the Starbucks on Wednesdays, because that's a stalker's dream.  It's like, hey, I'm a chloroformer at 3 o'clock on Wednesdays.  No, no, I'm saying in general.

The computer concludes that you should turn right.  It says turn right for your pants or whatever.  You park.  You walk into the store.  The system understands you've walked into the store.  The store person brings out the correct size pants for you.  You take your phone.  You tap and pay.  They hand you the pants and you walk out the store.  Again, all opt-in.  You've chosen this.

And then he goes into saying this crazy pants stuff.  And I love the idea.

Transcript:  That was a lot of words to say.  So I did interview her for an hour.  It took me that entire time to get her name right.  Arianna Stasinopoulos Huffington.  See, I still know how to do it.  We're going to take a break, come back with more.  And just a little bit of reminder, though, that if you are looking for a place to make  your website, we mention WordPress.  Everybody uses WordPress, but there are some negatives to WordPress.  First of all, either you've got to find a host or use WordPress.com and then they're  going to put their ads on your site.  And once you find the host, then you've got to install WordPress.  And here's the big burden for me.  I have to check almost daily to make sure that it's up to date, that it's secure, because  there's constant patches.  I've got to tell you, simple, simple, simple.  You're looking for hosting, you're looking for great software, a great content management  system, Squarespace.com.  It's the secret behind exceptional websites.  They host really good hosting that never goes down, because Squarespace has this very sophisticated  virtual server technology that's tightly integrated with the software to give you really, really  good performance.  The software, there's none better.  They've got the great iPhone and iPad app.  Importing and exporting, that's important.  You're never trapped from the big four blog APIs, movable type WordPress, type pad and  blogger.  By the way, when they say seamless, I mean it.  All the links are preserved, all the images, all the SEO.  If you're a photographer or you want to have a photo gallery on your site, I know a lot  of you do, there are amazing tools for that.  And everything on Squarespace is simple.  Point and click, drag and drop.  If you are sophisticated, you're not limited.  You can use, of course, CSS and you can use JavaScript, but you don't have to to create  an amazing looking site that is unique.  And that's important.  The great developer templates from the best designers in the world make it very, very  easy.  Look, do yourself a favor.  Try this free.  It couldn't be easier to try Squarespace.  If you're in the market for somewhere for your next website, go to squarespace.com,  see that big green try it free button, click that.  No credit card, nothing.  No commitment.  You get it for free.  Full access to everything they offer.  For two weeks, all you need is the name of the site, the password and the email address  and you're in.  Now, after two weeks, I think you're going to love it.  You're going to have a chance to sign up.  Now, this is no ads, nothing.  It's not free.  You have to pay for it.  But that's why there's no ads on it.  And it's very affordable.  In fact, the longer you sign up for, the less expensive it is.  As little as 10 bucks and 67 cents a month.  But I'm going to add an additional kind of sweetener here.  If you use the offer code TWIT8, T-W-I-T, the number eight, no spaces, you'll get an additional  for the first six months of your site.  So many of my friends use Squarespace.  We use it for our inside TWIT blog.  Very robust, very reliable, really great software.  Squarespace.com.  They're friends and I invite you to give them a try.  At least include them in your comparison shopping.

They have everything built in right now where you can just drop things in and it just works.  So you can have a little map pop up.  Like if I was driving here and you want to know where I was, you could follow me along,  boom, you'd see it.  So check out Squarespace.  So you use it?  I have an upside on it, yeah.

That's one of the things where you say, I use Xbox and PlayStation.  I always say, oh, the PlayStation's free for people who aren't really into gaming.  But Lord knows, if I have to pay for security, then let me pay.  Because if that's what free gets me, then I don't want to be on free.  And oh, nobody's credit card.  I don't care.  That's a huge problem for that size of corporation with millions of people's information on hand.  You can't have that happen.  It just can't.  There's other things that could happen.

I sit there and I haven't turned them off because I wait.  200 prints for a dollar.  Boom, I'm on that.  100 prints for $5, that's not a good deal.  But they just run these things and they get me to buy them.  I buy them because they're cheap and it's nice to have pictures.  But if they weren't so cheap, I wouldn't do it.

Timmy West, one of the designers at Flickr,  wrote a blog post saying,  this is how I wanted to innovate,  adding social features, cleaning up the interface.  And no one, sadly,  those plans were discarded.  So one of your key designers is writing on her own personal blog  that this is how I would change our product  and you don't implement this stuff.  I mean, I'm surprised that Timmy is not at Facebook  or even at Google or somewhere that's not Yahoo.  I'm sure that's what she was hoping.

Amazon is founded,  going right up against Goodreads,  speaking of social, I know you guys are dumb  with social and blah, blah, blah.  No, the Amazon thing is really interesting.  This is very interesting.  If you sign on, it's kindle.amazon.com.  If you sign into your Amazon account,  it will automatically populate.  Let me sign in right now and I'll show you.  It automatically populates  with all the books you have on your Kindle.  But also, so if I go to your books,  I haven't done anything on this site.  I'm going to show you my Amazon.com account.  Not only all the books I've ever bought on the Kindle,  but also if you say put everything in there,  see it's Kindle only,  it will show all the books you've ever bought on Amazon.  If you, as most people do,  I think these days buy all your books from Amazon,  this is a pre-populated Goodreads  and it's very similar to Goodreads.  You can rate it, you can show your reading status,  you can make that public,  you can add public notes.  Why do you think this is interesting, Alexia?  Because of something like Quora.

The stereotype is that they're dorky,  that they don't get with girls,  they don't go to the gym.  So these programmer dudes,  they're trying to tip the stereotype on its head.

Why did you rate it five stars?  Tell me a passage of the book  that's awesome and makes me go out and buy it right now.  No, but that's what you do on sites like this.

Stephen Hawking's on Amazon,  and he's saying what physics books are good to read.  That I care about.  That I care about.  And that's something I'm not going to normally have in real life, right?

You're not getting any more money.  That's horrible.  Well, it's an interesting thing.  This happened a few weeks ago.  I pay...  Legally, you're supposed to pay sales tax  even if the vendor doesn't collect it, right?  They call it use tax in California.  So they ask you on your California income tax form,  you know, did you buy a bunch of stuff online?  Well, give us the use tax.  I paid last year $6,000 in use tax on Amazon.com,  but I also made about $20,000 on Amazon Associates.  So, OK, now Amazon has to collect that $6,000.  No longer gives me the $20,000 benefit for them,  but the state of California loses the income tax  I paid on the $20,000.  I'll start ordering...

Transcript:  And then long run,  I think California will actually cost them money,  but what they're really doing  is they're listening to the brick and mortar businesses  that bookstore down the street  who's saying, don't buy on Amazon,  and we don't want Amazon to exist  because people buy there because they save sales tax.  And then we're in a high sales tax state.  It's 89%.  So, I mean, I wouldn't go somewhere  just to save 89%, but some people do, I guess.

So it all depends on what you're purchasing.  Like I said, for you to lose $20,000,  that's a nice chunk of change.  And then on top of it,  you're going to have to put money out.  I'd be...

Transcript:  We asked everybody  who was watching Twitter  to follow her last week  and her numbers went way up.  See, they didn't stop following her.  We doubled her numbers to 3,484  but I also said stop following her.  But she's great.  I follow her.  She's real.  We heard from her.  She's a nice person.  She's a wife, a mother,  a grandmother and a NASCAR junkie.  So what could be wrong with that?  We do this show every Sunday afternoon  3 p.m. Pacific.  That's 6 p.m. Eastern Time  and 2200 UTC.  You can watch it live.  All the expletives will be in the live version  at live.twit.tv.  And then if you don't want it,  if you want the expletive deleted version,  you can always get that anytime after the fact  at twit.tv or just go to iTunes,  the Zune Marketplace or anywhere.  Better netcasts are served  and download a copy.  In fact, do me a favor, subscribe.  We make audio and video versions available.  Thanks for joining me.  I'm Leo Laporte.  Another twit is in the can.
