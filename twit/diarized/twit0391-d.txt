Transcript:  It's time for TWiT This Week in Tech.  It's the show where we take the tech news of the week and rummage through it like a man going through an old couch looking for enough change to buy the G4 TV network.  I'm Father Robert Balasar, the digital Jesuit in for Leo Laporte, the tech guy who was currently at some super bowl shaped sporting event that I cannot describe without the exception of the G4 TV network.  We've got a great panel starting with our very own Mr. Tom Merritt, ace to tech.  Tom coming from a studio in Los Angeles. How are things down in Lala world?  They are lovely. Thanks. Thanks for having me on Father Robert. This is good. This is awesome. I'm excited about this panel.

Transcript:  And we all know that Tom Merritt is in front of a green screen, so he really could be anywhere right now. Right, there's the best darn green screen. He could be right behind you.  In fact, Tom is in the back room. We're just projecting him into the set. That's again, that's how Twit rolls. Magic. Fantastic.  Let's get to it. We've got the first story about the big game, about that SuperBully type thing. But we're not talking about football.  Remember, I promised you it wasn't going to be about the Super Bowl, but rather about the Super Bowl tech.  We've got a story coming out of Ars Technica talking about how the SuperDome is being wired to be wireless.  They're hoping to serve up to 30,000 simultaneous connections with 700 access points on the inside of the SuperDome and 250 access points on the outside of the SuperDome.  Now, what strikes me about this is it's a lot like we saw going on with the Olympics, where they're going to have sort of the Wi-Fi police roaming the SuperDome looking for, quote unquote, rogue wireless devices.  They don't want you turning on your Wi-Fi. They don't want you turning on your phone to create a hotspot because it will interrupt the Wi-Fi experience of the people around them.  I want to throw this to you, Veronica, first. When you're talking about this many people in that small of a space, we've just come to expect Wi-Fi won't work, right?

Start time: 369.04
End time: 404.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, pretty much. I mean, that's how it goes at big events like this. The local towers can only, at least for LTE or 4G coverage, can only handle so many connections at one time.  But if they're doing Wi-Fi, I mean, how many people? 73,208 fans. That's a very specific number of people, by the way, that they posted in this article.  So it might be enough, but it always comes down to the day of to really see how well this kind of thing works out.  But even very tech savvy events like South by Southwest and CES have yet to have a very successful, totally online internet connection for users.

Start time: 404.24
End time: 417.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Yes. Yes. Yes. It's usually disaster. This year, I think, was better than most.  But each year they bring in the trucks and the extra antennas and get everything set up so that you can have more connectivity.  But each year something goes down. And I don't know, this sounds like a big bowl of fail to me. I can't imagine this is going to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is there any comment on the level of service that they're promising to everyone? Are you going to like a half megabit or just just barely dial up speeds out of this?

Start time: 430.38
End time: 466.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I mean, they're hoping to provide enough connectivity so that you can tweet and send out pictures.  I mean, that's really what you'd like in an event like this, right? You want to generate the buzz. You want people to be excited about the event.  And you could possibly do that. But I mean, you're definitely not going to get enough bandwidth to stream anything for a consistent amount of time.  Now, what you can do if you're dealing with 700 access points, you turn the power on those access points way, way, way down so that each one only serves a very small area.  But even so, when you're dealing with that many people in that in that small of a space, there's really no technology that can get around the laws of physics.

Start time: 468.72
End time: 483.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why wouldn't they just why provide this at all? Why not have everyone rely on their own data connections with their cellular providers?  Is this is this something that is AT&T working with them on this?  Or what's what's the upside for them outside of giving a good experience like anyone cares about that?

Start time: 485.00
End time: 514.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I mean, the upside is they look like a Ford looking organization.  I mean, you want to provide people Wi-Fi and theoretically, if people are using the five gigahertz Wi-Fi range, you can get much, much better service because there's three channels in the 2.4 gigahertz range.  There's 23 channels in the five gigahertz range that, you know, and because it's unlicensed spectrum, you can do a lot more creative use of micro cells to actually increase the amount of throughput people can get.

Start time: 515.00
End time: 543.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what I find really interesting is how this is exactly the opposite of what they wanted to do at the inauguration, because at the inauguration they were trying to prevent people really from sending a lot of photos and doing a lot of text messaging because they were trying to save bandwidth for actual phone calls and emergencies and things like that.  So it's interesting that now they're like, we're going to provide Wi-Fi so you guys can share as much media as you possibly want.  But I'm wondering how that's going to either free up more space for phone call communications or if it's just going to be if that part of the deal will be bad.

Start time: 544.60
End time: 619.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I wonder if that's part of it because I know the Ars Technica article says they were testing at 20 meg down 20 meg up synchronous.  They knew that that was going to go down once you get started to get people turning on their phones.  But their guess was if 100% of the people didn't have gadgets going at the same time that they were going to be able to handle it.  They were confident. It'll be interesting to see if they are.  But the other thing here is they're they're trying to reduce interference, right?  So if you allow everybody to just run their own cameras, run their own data points, all of a sudden it doesn't work for anybody because you have no control over the system.  And what they're trying to attempt here is say, let's say no other interference going on except the interference we're providing through Wi-Fi.  Give everybody who has a ticket free access.  There's no there's no password. You just log on.  You get Wi-Fi instantaneously.  And that means that they can at least try to control the experience and make sure they have good bandwidth, not just for the folks in the seats, but for the folks in the press area, for the for the people who are actually running the game and need to communicate with each other clears up that air for emergency signals and all of that.  Father Robert, you're saying that you can't get around the laws of physics.  I'm curious. Like, let's say it all goes well and they keep people from turning on their wireless cameras and their Wi-Fi hotspots and their iPhones because they get good Wi-Fi.  What else could go wrong?

Start time: 620.78
End time: 674.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, unfortunately, when you're dealing with unlicensed spectrum, it only takes one device.  Well, let's be realistic.  It takes a half dozen devices to really screw up the air.  If you've got a phone that has been hacked to operate in frequencies that it's not supposed to operate and it doesn't have the proper frequency filters, the cut filters, what will happen is it essentially acts like a signal jammer.  If you remember back to the early days of Wi-Fi when geeks like me were hacking access points and you found software switches where you could suddenly turn up the power of the output to like 100 milliwatts and it sounded great.  But all you were really doing was jamming the airwaves.  Well, that's that's the problem with physics that you can't get around, which is it's a shared spectrum.  It's not like everyone has a direct connection to the outbound router.  You're using the same wireless space.  So, you know, if you have people who are not playing well, it destroys experience for everyone in the area.

Start time: 675.74
End time: 712.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So here's what I think is interesting is you're talking about the technological achievement, which I think is interesting to see how far it's developed.  But also you mentioned that one of the biggest problems you're looking at is they hope that not everyone will be using their devices at the same time.  And in that regard, you almost have a sociological experiment happening.  And I wonder how far the science has advanced on monitoring the way people tend to use their devices.  Is there a particular point during every football game that you're like, oh, this happens is when everyone gets on.  And are they I wonder if they're making any decisions about the program to mitigate how basically shaping the human traffic in addition to the network traffic.

Start time: 713.86
End time: 726.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry, I was going to say, I think their best guess is probably that not everybody has a cell phone.  Not everybody carries a cell phone, even though maybe the majority do.  So that alone would probably keep you from having 100 percent usage.

Start time: 728.07
End time: 771.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like the bathroom on an airplane.  The one time that you don't want to be using the Internet in a stadium is when a timeout gets called or when there's a foul on the play.  Because at that moment, if you think about it, a football game is really only a couple of minutes of activity surrounded by a lot of waiting.  And in that waiting, people are going to naturally like they've become prone to do pull out their phones and check their email, check their tweets, see if the last tweet got any traction was retweeted.  It's sort of human nature now. Right.  So I'm done with Brian. I think this is this is a sociological experiment that they can look at later on.  They can actually filter through this data to find out where the spikes were in usage.  And I'm betting it's going to be at halftime when everyone's going to want to send pictures.

Start time: 772.36
End time: 788.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like go big or go home. If you're going to do 30,000 simultaneous connections, just do seventy three thousand two hundred and eight simultaneous connections.  Just see how that goes. Exactly.  They just cover your bases. Sorry. I know that's a that's a baseball metaphor.  We're talking about football. Well, I like the baseball metaphor would be because we're also this.

Start time: 789.24
End time: 833.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're in zone. This is going to help us bust up the laws of physics here.  This is something that I brought in a while back for this week in Enterprise Tech.  This is actually an access point, but it's not a regular one.  It's it's 24 radios that has a specially designed RF reflector inside of it that divides the area around it into different parts.  So it's physically separating the beams of RF that, of course, that go into into different devices.  The cool thing about a solution like this is these have been specifically designed for environments like a stadium where you have a lot of people in a very small area.  So I talked to the people at Zerus and they were saying how they have set up stadiums in the past.  And whereas the Superdome is using between 700 to 950 access points, this could do the same job with about 50.

Transcript:  Now they're using they're using Cisco series switches and wireless controllers. Are you familiar with those at all, Father Robert?

Start time: 858.66
End time: 902.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes. So basically all of the wireless gear from Cisco and HP, Avaya, the big players, they work the same way in that the AP itself is kind of it's a dumb device.  They need to be plugged into a controller, which looks like a big switch.  And then the switch will actually communicate with the various nodes that are plugged into it to find out how to optimally set itself.  It's a fascinating part of the process. They speak about it very briefly when they say that they're going to be doing spectrum real time spectrum analysis of the superdome,  where they can have people walking around with these little scopes looking at what areas are congested.  And then the controller can adjust each access point to either increase or decrease the power to sort of optimize the number of people it can serve.

Start time: 902.10
End time: 906.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then after the game, is this all getting ripped out? I mean, is this just temporary for Sunday?

Start time: 907.02
End time: 918.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I would not be surprised if this was a huge sponsorship sponsorship thing.  And so these access points are probably very visible areas around the superdome, which means if they leave them there, they're going to get stolen.

Start time: 918.64
End time: 923.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Verizon apparently paid for the installation, a lot of this stuff. So I don't know if that means they'll leave it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm actually more excited about the wife, how well the Wi-Fi is going to do if this like big gargantuan attempt is going to work or not.  I'm cheering for it. I really am. I'm like, I hope I hope it works really well. I can't wait to hear the report.  We've got Leo's there. So, you know, we're going to find out from him whether it worked or not.

Start time: 948.58
End time: 963.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. Well, I'm just thinking we're going to be pushing up to the time that Leo would be in the superdome.  I'm wondering if our incredibly talented producer might be able to contact him and see if we could get a video stream at some point.  Lovely and talented. Lovely and talented. I kind of figured they're shutting that down though.

Start time: 964.10
End time: 967.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, they can't be letting people just stream the video, can they, from the Super Bowl?

Start time: 968.28
End time: 972.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're going to be restricting that. Oh, you're assuming they're doing proper security policy.

Start time: 972.30
End time: 975.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, no, well, they did say they were going to be wandering around. So who knows?

Start time: 976.06
End time: 984.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. One way to find out. We'll try it. We'll try it.  So everyone, please right now tweet to at Leo Laporte and tell them that we need him on the stream.

Start time: 993.04
End time: 1065.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right. Let's move on. Let's move on because we've actually got a big, a much bigger story than the big game.  And that is maybe the possible kind of hopeful, probably not resurgence of research in motion now BlackBerry.  There's hope. There's hope now.  And so we heard this announcement last week. It was sort of weighted on with bated breath.  We had heard some things about BlackBerry 10, about the operating system, how much it had advanced,  that the devices that they were going to release actually looked decent.  I'll even say sexy. Now we know.  We know that BlackBerry OS 10 has a few key features, including BlackBerry Flow, which allows multitasking on the device.  It has BlackBerry Balance, which does profile switching.  So you can have one device that switches between, say, business use and personal use.  It offers BlackBerry Messenger, an upgraded version that adds video messaging as well as screen sharing.  So you can now show someone else what you're doing on your phone, which I think there's a lot of promise there.  And BlackBerry, remember, which is note taking, which should be compatible with Evernote and Outlook and some of the more usable note suites.  We've got pricing and availability, $200 with contract, $599 unsubsidized.

Start time: 1068.38
End time: 1078.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's not exactly finalized, actually. Carriers have not made their individual announcements yet.  So we may see some variation, but it should be $200 at all on major carriers in the US.  Of course, $149 with a three-year contract in Canada because Canada is weird. I said it there.

Start time: 1082.06
End time: 1102.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Canada's pretty cool, though, despite being weird.  I just lost Canada. And available February 5th in the US, February 10th in Canada. Carried on all four carriers, right?  ATT, Sprint, Verizon and T-Mobile. Now, the big deal here is the hardware.  And we've brought in some, what is this? Sexy, sexiness?

Start time: 1103.26
End time: 1253.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know if I'd call it exactly sexy, but it's pretty nice looking, I would say.  It's certainly a big step up, I think, from what we've got before. So I've got it here in my hand.  I think I'm holding it in the appropriate position. Here we go.  We're ready for this. Coming out of the sleeve.  Bada-bing, OK. So this is the Z10. Yeah.  Lovely.  So I can give you a couple of the gestures quickly. So this is basically the multitasking feature, effectively.  So it doesn't matter where you are. You can be in the browser, let's say.  And you swipe up, and it brings any application to this minimized window like that.  So if I launch something else, stocks to go.  And then minimize that. So now I can pop back and forth pretty quickly, which is nice.  And these apps keep running in the background. So this is true multitasking.  But the big thing they're talking about is called peak and flow.  So if you swipe up and hold it, in theory. Great. Now it's not going to work.  There you go. On the left, you can see these listings of notifications, effectively, saying,  I've got 251 unread tweets, four Facebook messages, so on and so forth.  And if I want to see them, I go to the right. And bada-bing, we're now in the hub.  So this is the all-seeing, all-conquering portal for every bit of messaging  that you could possibly ever consume on this phone.  So I've brought in here Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, BBM, email, text messages.  Even system updates will pop in here as a message.  Which meant for me, this thing was just like a spinning wheel, just constantly, constantly going.  A little bit too noisy. But you can filter. You can go on the left and pick whatever you want.  Two text messages or BBMs or whatever you like.  So that's pretty much it.  I'll give you a little bit more. So on the background, we've got this kind of plasticky background that comes off.  Ultimately, it's a nice piece of hardware. It's a big, big step up over what we've seen before.  BB10 is a huge step forward over BB7.  Here you are, sir.  I'm touching it. I feel the power.  It's just not exactly a revolution in any way.  The gestures are nice, for sure. And I think BlackBerry Hub would be a great tool  for somebody who gets a small number of messages over a lot of different services.  But for someone like me who gets a lot of messages on a lot of services,  it was just very quickly impossible to keep up with everything that's going on in there, unfortunately.  But app selection is a little bit limited, but for a new OS, it's pretty good.  They're lacking Netflix and Hulu and a couple of big ones.  But they've got Dropbox, they've got Box, they've got Hockey Night in Canada as well.  So again, for the Canadians, you can be very happy about that.  So it's a bit of a mixed bag, for sure.  It's certainly not the amazing return to form that we might have hoped that Rim, now BlackBerry, would be able to deliver to us.  But I think it's a really good step.  And I think it's enough to keep the BlackBerry faithful, faithful for a little bit longer.

Despite the fact that she has an iOS exclusive app, and despite the fact that she sang next to Steve Jobs for the iTunes launch,  Alicia Keys is now the creative officer?  Creative director.  Creative director, right.  Global creative director for BlackBerry.  Thank you, thank you.  You never want to leave off a global in someone's title.  So she and also Neil Gaiman are going to be helping out to kind of raise the street cred of BlackBerry a little bit,  which I think ultimately, you know, couldn't hurt.  Neil Gaiman? I didn't hear about that.  Neil Gaiman has signed on.  He sold his soul to Rim, now BlackBerry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so I can do a little bit of typing here if you want.  Basically, let's see if I can create a note or a document.  Go in this crash log here that I had to create before.  So, edit.  Give me a keyboard.  There we go.  So it's got this great predictive text that is a lot like SwiftKey on Android, if you've ever used that.  So I can type H.  Flicking, right?  It does make a clicking noise if you turn it on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It took me about a little over 10 seconds on this to type that out, which isn't too bad.  I was a little bit quicker in SwiftKey. I did back to back.  I think it was just under 10 seconds SwiftKey, but it's pretty good.  The thing is, if you use SwiftKey, you can just kind of hit the space bar and the word, the suggested word that it thinks you're going to use is always right in the middle, which is nice.  So you can kind of get used to looking there.  Here you have to actually look down and follow your thumbs, which takes a little bit of, you know, a different way of thinking.  So if you're used to touch typing, not looking down, you actually have to look down here a little bit more, which takes a little bit of getting used to.  So I still like SwiftKey better, but this is by far the best dock keyboard in any mobile operating system, in my opinion.

Transcript:  Let me ask you this.  I mean, there's going to be a lot of buzz about the hardware because it's actually, we were talking about this before the show.  It's not that it leapfrogs all the competition out there, but it does look a lot better than anything BlackBerry has ever put out before.  Yeah, certainly.  You know, up to date anyway, they're current now.

Transcript:  They didn't go ahead by any means.  But the one thing lacking, of course, was a QWERTY keyboard.  I think a lot of people were really hoping that there would be a QWERTY device.  And RIM was kind of being a little cagey that we would see the new QWERTY device, but they didn't say when we would actually get to buy it.  So now we know the Q10 is coming, but probably not until April.  That will be basically this device with a keyboard.  We still don't know all the details of the internals on that guy, but a 3.1-inch display and sort of the 4.2 on here.  But that'll have the traditional, you know, clicky keyboard that you've come to experience, a lot like the one in the Bold 9900.  It feels like a really nice device.  In fact, the metal bars that go across the display are actually integrated to the chassis, so it's got a really good rigidity, too, for twisting.  I think it'll be a nice phone, but again, you've got to wait another two months at this point.  All right.

Transcript:  Let me ask an open question to the panel, and that is, does this save BlackBerry?  I mean, does this hold on to the people who are still using BlackBerrys?  Might this even get a few people back in the enterprise who want a more secure platform for communications?  Or does this just get them to a level playing field with, say, Windows, phone, Android, and iOS?

Transcript:  I'll get up there and get up there and go back up.  I'll go first.  I think this stems the tide.  It doesn't turn the tide.  So it may keep BlackBerry from just, like, continuing to slide downhill.  I think it will, actually, because Tim said it already.  This is going to appeal to current BlackBerry fans.  They're going to be very excited about this.  And it may even bring a few more Alicia Keys back into the fold.  But I don't think anyone looks at Samsung Galaxy S and then looks at the BlackBerry and says, oh, I want that more.  You know, the iPhone users, the Samsung users, there's not enough here to turn their heads yet, I don't think.  So what would it take?

Start time: 1547.00
End time: 1564.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it speaks volumes.  Like, Roger Chang, of course, our friend and my producer on Tekzilla, he was a BlackBerry user for years, and he recently went over to Android.  So I don't know if this is enough to bring him back.  He just signed another two year contract.  So but I don't think the hopes of something better on BlackBerry was enough to keep him there even.

Start time: 1566.28

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think some people might come back when the Q10 comes out, because I think a lot of people left, you know, around the time of the bold and they went to the iPhone or something like that.  And they just have been swearing at the virtual keyboard for the past, you know, a couple of months.  I think when the Q10 comes out, we'll see some people kind of making the transition back to BlackBerry.  But yeah, I don't think it's going to be a flood.

Transcript:  I'm just I don't understand this nostalgia for physical keys, because it's like you literally the great the best advancement from the iPhone is the fact that it corrects that it encourages sloppy writing.  As long as you pretty much get it right.  It does for the most part a pretty good job of getting out what you want.  And it does it astonishingly fast.  You don't have to go back and fix it most of the times.  And you're not.  There's the occasional hilarious.  I do not agree with that statement.  I'm telling you, man, like like physical keys.  I try to use them as BlackBerry's like I you mean I have to hit every single key and I have to do it right every time.  Screw that, man.  I hate physical keyboards.  I want I want auto corrective predictive text for my for these physical keyboards.  So on my desktop, I can just sort of mash the keys and get it pretty much right.  And there it is.

Start time: 1645.19

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have to say, so I understand the enjoyment of a physical keyboard.  Although I think my iPhone is getting dumber over time, not smarter with guessing what I want to say.  I've had much better luck with actually dictating text to it rather than trying to type in very quickly.  So maybe it's just I'm getting lazy, but it has not been good for me lately.  And of course, without that, we wouldn't have damn you auto correct, which is hilarious.

I thought in fact, I actually could see a future where it gets so good at reading your general movements where it's like you don't even see a keyboard anymore.  Instead, you just visualize the keyboard and start moving your thumbs where you think the keys ought to be and then it gets so good at tracking your personal quirks that it gets it right.

All right, let's move on. We've got, well, it's a message that you've heard a few times,  but maybe it's happening this time, and that is we are in a post-PC era.  Maybe, probably, not really, but good tagline.  This comes from GigaOM talking about the IDC and their report that 52.5 million tablets shipped  in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to 89.8 million PCs,  and that means for the first time that tablet sales are over half of PC sales.  Tim, how do you break this down? Is this just the holiday burst? Is this going to be a trend?  Are we eventually going to see parity here?  How quickly are we going to see the quote-unquote end of the PC era?

Start time: 2195.06
End time: 2238.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's definitely a trend. I don't think that you can deny it any longer.  Exactly what that trend looks like through the rest of 2013, I don't know.  I mean, definitely we've seen some acceleration of tablet sales and mobile device sales because of the holidays.  So I think things will temper out a little bit throughout the rest of the year,  but ultimately it is a trend that's going to continue. I don't think there's any doubt.  I mean, we look at our traffic patterns, and we definitely see the shift from the desktop to the mobile device.  For us, it's a very real thing. We've been dealing with this for over a year now, effectively,  in terms of the post-PC era, quote-unquote, in terms of content consumption anyway.  So I definitely think it's a real thing, and it has a lot of strong implications for the industry.  Tablets are a lot cheaper than your average PC and your average laptop,  and how exactly your company is going to continue to show the growth that they need to.  Obviously, Apple is doing okay, but others maybe not so much.

Start time: 2240.08
End time: 2275.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just always wonder about these kind of numbers because there's always a question of how much are they playing with the figures here,  because yes, tablet sales are really accelerating. They're growing way more than PC sales are growing,  but that's just because PC sales are so mature. We sell between, what, 360 to 400 million PCs a year.  Tablet sales are actually starting to catch up with that, but at the same time,  there are many more people without tablets than are without PCs.  That doesn't necessarily mean that we're in a post-PC era.  It just means that more people who may need a PC already have a PC.  Yeah, the question... Go ahead.

Start time: 2276.92
End time: 2327.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And you're right. The term post-PC implies that we are done with the PC, and now we've moved on to tablets,  which just simply isn't the case. You think of everyone who has a tablet, they all, and I'm going to say 90%,  they all have it in addition to a PC.  What we're seeing is an opportunity for increased fidelity with your interactions with your online data  and the way you communicate with the world. There are some things that the PC will always be superior for.  I mean, right now, for doing this live Skyping in with the live switching on here, Photoshop, video editing, video games,  I mean, all of these things, we're not going to lose these things, and the very nature of the term post-PC implies that,  which is a bit annoying. But if you think about it in terms of we're just seeing more options and people taking advantage.  People like to interact with their data so much that they're buying a second and a third way to do so at all times.  Right.

Start time: 2328.00
End time: 2359.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I definitely agree with the idea that the idea of running everything in the cloud is probably what we're moving towards  more than anything else, and keeping the PC, keeping the keyboard, the mouse, the monitor as an interface method for that,  it's still going to be more comfortable for most people than just having a tablet in your hand.  So I think these two things go hand in hand together. I don't think we're at a point where people are just using tablets.  I think it's a point where people, like you said, are starting to have them as secondary devices that they use to interact with the data  that they primarily input via a desktop environment.

Start time: 2361.46
End time: 2385.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I really like that. I like that point of view that we're more than anything about which devices we're using.  This is about where we're actually storing the information that we're manipulating.  It used to be that everything was stored on your local device and you had control over it.  We're getting far more accustomed to being able to put it into a place that is accessible by multiple devices at the same time from multiple locations.  So if anything, it's the post-local storage era.

Transcript:  Which is still disconcerting to me.  I've got a raid at home and I've got a lot of stuff on there going all the way back to my early days of computing.  The idea that at some point that's going to live on someone else's box that I don't get to manage is disconcerting to me.  Maybe that makes me an old fuddy-duddy. I don't know.

Transcript:  I don't think so.  Which is greater, your fear of the information living somewhere else or, for example, my fear that if this house burns down,  there's an awful lot of data that's just on one or two hard drives in this house.  Imagine all your photos, all your videos wiped out.  I think conservatively, I have three or four terabytes of video data spanning over the last four years.  It's just on one or two drives.  I don't see any way to migrate that to the cloud yet.  If there was, affordably, I would do it in a heartbeat.

Transcript:  Well, you can send a drive, I believe, to a lot of the services to actually get that data uploaded from their end.  I think some of them still do that, which is great.  But I think it's all about having your data in multiple locations because having three or four redundant drives in your house  is fine except for the fact that if your house burns down, then suddenly you're SOL.  So it's about having a physical drive somewhere outside of your primary location, having a cloud backup just in case,  and then having the stuff at home that you are accessing most frequently.

Transcript:  Yeah, and I think we're moving towards a situation where it's all about form factor, right?  And data does become ubiquitous.  And whether you're a Tim Stevens up there in New England who runs his own home cloud server and doesn't trust the man with his data,  I think that's fine.  Cross me old man.  Wait, are we talking about Patrick Norton?  Get off my lawn!  Get off my internet, kids.  But there's safe ways to do that and reasonable ways to do that.  But you still want to be able to access that on devices.  And I still think back to this article I read back in the late 90s about how the future of computing was  form factor over function.  So you have the device that works for the situation you're in,  whether it's you need a keyboard and a screen or whether you need a portable keyboard and a screen  or you just need a screen with a touch interface or a smaller device.  And we're almost there.  So I don't think it's a post PC era.  It's just an entirely different era of computing.

Transcript:  Now, this is not on the docks.  I'm kind of going off the rails as if the show was on the rails previously.  But interesting point brought up here,  which is a big explosion of mobile devices was in a way, a very big way enabled by the use of what we're calling cloud storage,  private cloud or public cloud.  There are stories right now.  There are a few issues that are before the Supreme Court debating whether or not data put into the cloud can really be private,  whether or not law enforcement needs a warrant to actually look at that data after 180 days,  whether or not they can look at email that you have quote unquote abandoned on Google's or Yahoo's or Microsoft's server.  If we don't sort that out, if we don't figure out a privacy policy that makes sense,  that protects the rights of people who have put their data in the cloud,  does that put the kibosh on the explosion of mobile devices?

Transcript:  I suspect that, you know, the science fiction author and friend of mine, Andrew Main,  said a quote that really transformed my thinking and it's kind of changed my life.  He said that technology outpaces legislation.  So when you ask a question like this, you know, you think in terms of like, what can we do to protect the rights of people?  Whatever it is you could do, whatever law you're thinking about writing, whatever action you're thinking your Congress should take,  by the time it gets done, there will already be encryption services that that take care of it faster.  And so I it's I mean, I agree that this is an issue.  I agree that we need to we have evolving attitudes about what it means to own your data.  But I don't know that it just seems like whatever happens by the time whatever laws passed will already be onto something else.  It'll be a new set of problems.

I mean, if indeed security was concerned, then Sony should have nobody playing a PlayStation 3 game online right now.  But yet, you know, they rebounded very quickly.  And I don't think anybody's really thought about that over the past couple of weeks, months, years.  So I think that people are very willing to forget about those sorts of concerns, which is, you know, I think that is a concern in itself.

Transcript:  Well, it's interesting to see what people are willing and not willing to allow.  Like, for example, if you're going to be gaming online, you just know that your credit card information is now online somewhere.  And maybe it's taken care of properly. Maybe it's not.  I mean, we've had a breach in various online gaming vendors and that has exposed consumer information.  That seems to be OK. I'm willing to expose my financial information.  However, people get really, really upset if you even suggest that law enforcement has the right to go into, say, a Yahoo account that you haven't opened in a year and just go through all your email, all your email.  That's actually in law. They have that power. They have that right.  But people don't seem to be up in arms about that.  So I'm always puzzled by what sets people off and what doesn't.

People are challenging it.  And different judges are approaching it with different ways.  So it's far from settled, but it's important how they end up settling it.  It's something that's going to have to go to the Supreme Court.  I love the Supreme Court.

Transcript:  It doesn't.  Let's get back on the rails just for a while.  A tangent to this is Michael Dell deciding that maybe he wants to take Dell back.  There's a story in Bloomberg about how Michael Dell would combine his 15.7 percent stake in Dell,  along with one billion dollars of his own personal funds and perhaps investment from, say, Microsoft in order to take control of Dell.  This is a very early on story. It's a very speculative story.  Tim, I know you've been following this a little bit. What would he do with it?  If he were to take Dell back in a post PC world, what exactly would he do with this?

Start time: 2756.63
End time: 2805.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, obviously, that's the big question.  I mean, this is a great time to buy Dell. If you want to buy Dell, I mean, presumably the board of Dell is thinking,  wow, things are not looking too good for this industry.  Maybe we should have an exit strategy. And this could be their exit strategy.  But the question, yeah, what would Michael do with it?  Because at this point, Dell has basically said we're not going to make a smartphone.  They tried and they didn't do very good there.  We haven't seen them really making a strong push onto the Windows RT style tablet front, really.  So they don't really have a strong direction when it comes to capitalizing on the shift toward tablets either.  So really, they're a desktop and laptop enterprise consumer sort of mix of sales at this point.  And yet I don't see any strong direction to move into this mobile frontier we've been discussing for the past couple of minutes.  So that's a good question.  I mean, presumably he would have to launch some amazing tablet and or some amazing smartphone and try to recapture some of their lost prestige.

Transcript:  I mean, it sounds like he's trying to buy it back and give the money back to the shareholders, ironically.  But it seems weird to invest a billion dollars of your own, a billion dollars plus, because it's a billion dollars plus stock into something that is not a growth industry.

Transcript:  Didn't the dude get a Dell guy want to also help them rebrand and fix the company?  So I guess they're taking all comers at this point.  But, you know, I would much rather see what would happen if John McCaffey decided to take over.  That would be an interesting story.  Amazing.

Transcript:  Personally, I don't know.  Do you think the ghost of Steve Jobs is just cackling at this right now?  Because if you remember, Michael Dell was the one who said that Apple should just dissolve and give the shareholders back the money.

Start time: 2857.00
End time: 2888.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's basically what he's doing.  I mean, he's not dissolving the company, but he's going to be he's buying it back.  He's essentially taking it semi-private so that he has control over its destiny.  Now, you know, there's a lot of backroom murmurs that are saying the only reason only way this makes sense is if he's he thinks that the fundamentals are still strong, that he still thinks that enterprise are going to is going to buy PCs for the foreseeable future.  And he's concerned that the current setup of the company and the board is panicking.  But but still, I mean, that seems to be an awful lot of money to hedge against the panic.

Start time: 2889.12
End time: 2913.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, he's got to be thinking enterprise because there's really no direction that Dell can quickly move into right now without some major, major infusion of cash, which, you know, which is what we're talking about.  But even then, it's going to take them years to really move to a point where they can be like Lenovo of releasing phones and tablets and laptops and everything else.  Yeah, it seems like it's an interesting move.  But maybe they become like a white label brand for Microsoft or something like that.  Maybe they make the next surface.  You know, who knows?

Start time: 2913.58
End time: 2927.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because that's an interesting thought, because Microsoft is putting some money behind this.  And I think it's significant also that the argument that Dell is Michael Dell is making is that he needs the flexibility of not being publicly owned to compete and win in the marketplace.  True, true.

Start time: 2929.18

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it should be noted that at this point, Apple does have enough cash reserves to buy Dell, give the money back to the shareholders and wear it as a hat.  Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, dude, you're getting a hat.  All right. But continuing with our post PC theme, we're talking about how 52 point sorry, 52.5 million tablets were sold in quarter four versus 29.9 million in quarter four 2011.  That's 73, 75.3 percent growth year over year.  Healthy.  It's an incredibly healthy growth.  Again, we won't see that in the years to come because the tablet market is slowly slowly maturing.  But there are some numbers out of the IDC that came in a Next Web article that point out that there are some clear trends in the industry.  First, iPad share right now is 53.6 percent with 22.9 million units sold in quarter four 2011.  That was above 50.  In 2012, that's 50 percent above where they were last year.  Samsung has 15.1 percent of the market with seven point nine million sold.  That's a 263 percent growth year over year.  Amazon is at eleven point five percent with six million units sold.  That's 15.9 percent with four point seven million sold in quarter four 2004.  That's a 26.8 percent growth.  And as soon as takes the fourth spot with three point one million million units sold from one point nine percent.  That was really hard to get the right Bravo.  Bravo to eight numbers.  Numbers suck.  But so what we're seeing is there is a Apple is not quite as dominant in the tablet market.  But I mean, you can't say that.  What was it?  Twenty two point nine million units is disappointing.  Right.

Start time: 3037.00
End time: 3053.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Samsung kind of stepped up in the fourth quarter to take the lead in that sales quarter.  But overall, you know, looking at the year overall, Apple is definitely the dominant player.  So everybody had a really, really good year for sure.  And the big question now is what happens in 2013?  Can they maintain this level of growth?  I think it'll be pretty difficult to do personally.

Start time: 3054.40
End time: 3111.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know who doesn't have a level of growth?  Microsoft.  Microsoft.  So we've got surface R.T. sales.  They're really, really cagey about how they're they're phrasing it.  They're talking about channel sales.  They're saying that they sold one point two million units to the channel, which already doesn't sound great for a brand new product that was supposed to change the world that they spent one point six billion dollars on on advertising.  And the word is that only about half of that is actually making it out of the channels only actually is making it into the hands of consumers.  It's got a high return rate.  There's no noticeable movement to restock right now.  So it's not like Microsoft saying, oh, we sold so many of these that we need to get the orders out there in order to be able to replenish our supplies, especially as we get into February.  We're heading towards the Lunar New Year.  This is where manufacturing in Asia shuts down.  And so typically, if you were going to have a bump, the orders would have been in in January.  There are no orders from Microsoft.

Transcript:  The RT has always struck me as a problematic device because it almost promised a win, a true windows experience in a tablet form.  But it just it sounded like a half measure and half measures rarely do well when you got outside of the clock radio virtually no middle mushy middle device has ever survived.  And meanwhile, like I'm actually genuinely excited about the full what do they call the surface pro, which is a full PC in a form factor.  In fact, my mom, who is not very technical at all, she said, you know what I want?  I just want a really small, full computer that I could take with me.  I have an iPad. I don't take it with me. I don't use it.  I just want something small like an iPad, but a full computer.  And I was like, well, guess what, mom, wait a few weeks and you're in luck.  I wonder if there's not an opportunity for a big surprise.  You know, I don't know how good it is because of course I haven't seen one.  But as far as what the market, I suspect there might maybe a significant amount of untapped demand for a quote unquote real for as much as we're talking about the post PC era.  I suspect that there are a lot of people who want a real PC in a tablet form.

Start time: 3192.32

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I'm guessing your mom means the RT.  Well, or at least what the RT can do, because it does Microsoft Office, it does email, and it also has all the tablet stuff and it's keyboard and it does real multitasking on the desktop.  So what the pro is better at is like, OK, somebody who wants to download and install their own apps and actually run Windows and take full advantage of Windows.  I think you hit on it, Brian.  The first part of what you're saying is Microsoft has a messaging problem because it would almost be better if it didn't have the desktop office part in RT.  And it was just competing directly with Apple and Android on being a tablet.  But because it has a little bit of the desktop, people start to get critical and say, well, I want the full desktop experience.

Transcript:  I don't think it's quite that bad.  Not yet.  I mean, so if you look back, I always like to liken it back to when Microsoft got into console gaming, the original Xbox.  Everybody hated it when it came out.  Didn't sell particularly well, wasn't well received.  Everybody picked on it for being too big and having it wasn't what they wanted from a console gaming system.  But then Microsoft learned a lot of lessons from that.  It came back with the 360 and it's now the dominant sales console in the U.S. and in the world right now.  So they learned a lot there and presumably they could be on the same path for surface.  This was the first step.  I think I think we can all agree it wasn't exactly very successful.  First step.  Certainly these sales figures tend to point in that direction.  But maybe this was the investment.  Maybe this is just putting their toe in the water to see what Rev 2 looks like.  And I'm kind of consuming or putting surface and surface pro together is the first step.  Maybe generation two of the hardware will be significantly different and improved and everything that we want it to be.

Now, let's actually go to revision 2.0 because we've got the Microsoft Surface Pro heading into users hands in just a while.  Now, this is interesting because it really I think again, you're right.  Microsoft has a messaging problem here because people think, oh, surface pro.  It's just like the surface RT except a little bit better.  It's really an entirely different product.  It's a laptop.  It's a laptop without the keyboard built into it.  And there's there's a kerfuffle right now because as the verge reports, the surface pro is more like a laptop in that.  Yeah, when you have a laptop, part of the storage is going to be used by the operating system and all the bloatware that you load onto it.  And so people are complaining already, even though it hasn't hit stores, that the 64 gigabyte version will only have 23 gigabytes of usable storage.  Half of that's used by the operating system.  A large part of it is used by a recovery partition that you can delete.  But people are saying, wait a minute, if I buy a 32 gigabyte iPad, I get 32 gigabytes.  Why isn't the surface pro the same?

Start time: 3413.30
End time: 3447.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And even if you compare it to the MacBook Air, the 11 inch or the 64 gig MacBook Air, that you lose about 20 gigs for system storage there.  So you still get about 40 gigs of available space here with the 64 gig pro.  You'll get 23 gigs available space, which is pretty poor.  Why Microsoft didn't opt to put that recovery partition on a thumb drive or something like that to give you the option to if you need to use it, it's there separately.  I don't know, but to lose 40 odd gigs, I think it's about 46 gigs for the 128 gig version.  I think it's 41 gigs, something like that for the 64 gig version.  That is a significant chunk of space that you are giving up right out of the box.

Start time: 3448.54
End time: 3464.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's a huge amount, like even for the average consumer who doesn't really think about things like partitions and the amount of space that the apps that come built in are taking up.  That's going to be noticeable for them.  I think it's enough of a number that it's going to be noticeable for the average user.  And that's going to be a major problem for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK, so this this average user, though, is this is this an animal that we encounter as much nowadays as we did, say, 10 years ago?  It just seems to me that the Internet has built made possible this dissemination of information where I feel like maybe I'm totally wrong in this, but I feel like most consumers are much more educated and they know what they're getting into.  I mean, maybe in the early 90s, the marketing message held a lot of sway because that was your only point of data.  But nowadays we all know we all check Yelp ratings before we go out.  We all check reviews before we buy products.  And I feel like if it's a problem that there's only 20 gigs or whatever free, then then people will know it and word will get out.  Well, what about your proportion?  Yeah, my mom always with your mom jokes.

I think it still is an issue because I mean, it annoys me and I wouldn't exactly call myself like a typical consumer, but I think it's enough of a difference.  If you have to jump through hoops to get more storage, the storage that you rightfully deserve, then I think that's going to be an issue.

Father Robert and Tom Veronica.  So nice to see you.  How come you never come in when I'm around?  But I do have to mention one of our fine sponsors, and because I use it every single day, they thought it'd be great if I told you about Sharefile.com.  This is a Citrix product, and it is the simply put, the best way to share files in business.  You all know the problem.  You want to share file first instinct, attach it to email.  Wrong.  Because anything, you know, there's still people with 10 megabyte email inboxes.  Am I right?  So, you know, you're going to send even one image from my my Canon camera is 21 megabytes.  I can't even.  So and it's also bad form to attach files.  It wastes bandwidth.  It's frankly not secure.  It's not a good thing to do.  So this is what I recommend.  Sharefile.com more than recommend is what I use.  I, for instance, I had to record a bunch of the radio show ahead of time because I wasn't going to be there today.  What did I do?  I put it on in a folder that a designated folder on my hard drive.  Sharefile syncs it automatically to a shared folder.  Now, I already gave permission for the radio stations to access it.  But if I hadn't, it's very simple to send them an email and says here is that says here's the file.  There's an outlook attachment.  You're not giving them a file.  You're giving a link, right?  Sharefile stores that it's encrypted.  No one can get its HDB, TBS.  No one can get access to it.  And you fully control the file.  You could say who can download it, how long they can have it, how many times they can download it, when they can download it.  You get an email if you want notification that they have downloaded it.  I have tried other file sharing systems and frankly it didn't work, especially some of the radio stations.  Just they were confused by it with Sharefile.  It's very simple.  They see my logo.  By the way, it's a beautifully designed logo page.  They have a link to click.  If it's a folder, they can download the whole file zip to whole folder zipped or they can go into the folder and look at it.  It couldn't be simpler.  Very professional.  It's worked really well for me.  And I want you to try it.  If you are sending drawings, attachments of any kind, if you're sharing files with clients, if you're sharing files with colleagues, Sharefile is a great solution.  By the way, it's also cloud storage.  They don't talk about this as that much.  But it's just like any other cloud storage solution with your Sharefile account.  Those files are synced automatically.  You can see them anytime.  You can log on to your Sharefile account on any computer.  You could synchronize onto another computer if you want.  They have Windows and Mac synchronizing, background synchronizers.  You can even access it from a smartphone and there's your stuff.  So it's cloud storage plus the best way to share files.  30 days free.  You can try it right now.  I recommend you do.  If you go to Sharefile.com and use our offer code TWIT.  Sharefile.  See at the top it says radio listeners.  Click here.  That's the way to do it.  Because then you can start your free 30 day trial.  Just make sure you use the offer code TWIT if you would so they know where you heard about it.  And I thank you for your support.  I thank them for their support.  And now we continue with this week in tech.  Sorry I couldn't be here guys.

Transcript:  Thanks Leo.  You're here in spirit.  Speaking of the spirit of things.  We've got the spirit of the Grinch going on in Europe right now.  I don't know if you guys have heard this.  This article from Macworld where Apple is discontinuing the Mac Pro.  At least in Europe.  The reason for this is that there is a new safety legislation that has passed that would require Apple to shroud all the fans inside the computer.  Now I'll picture that the fans inside the case need to be shrouded from people who might be stupid enough to open it and stick something into the fan.  So I don't really understand why.  But Apple is basically saying look we're not going to make this change to the lineup just to meet up with this ticky tacky legislation.  You've got until February 18 to order a new Mac Pro if you are in one of the affected European countries and then it will be delivered by March 1st which is the cutoff date.  So a lot of people are saying look this is just because of the legislation.  But there are some other voices that are looking at this as the next step in a gradual removal of the Mac Pro line.  We haven't seen that much of an update over the last couple of years.  Basically nothing major since 2010.  And so little of their profit is actually derived from the desktops that it almost makes sense for Apple to say this is not worth our time.  Now open question to the panel.  Is that something Apple can afford to do?  I mean again tying back into the post PC story.  If the desktop is becoming less important can Apple now say look if you want a Mac just get a laptop it will be the same thing?

Transcript:  We've actually been waiting for them to make some kind of an announcement.  Either to completely redesign the thing or to basically discontinue it.  And they did of course just make the announcement that they're going to be bringing Mac production to the US for an unknown brand of Mac.  We presumed it would be this one because the cost would be so much lower for bringing any other Mac production here.  But yeah I mean that's largely standard componentry in that device versus the iMac and the other things that are much more bespoke.  And so they can charge more for it and have a higher premium for it.  So yeah if they were going to kill something that's making them less money that would be the way to do it.  And if they wanted to it probably wouldn't cost them more than a couple of bucks to actually update the thing to put in the shroud to keep little Timmy from getting his fingers cut off when he tries to take the back of the case off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know. This seems like a very Apple way to enact legislation to affect the laws overseas.  Especially let's say it's one of their less profitable items.  The problem is what Apple really sells is an ecosystem.  And when you sell an ecosystem you have to sell the whole ecosystem.  So I would be shocked if this is part of their play to actually shut down this whole division.  But it does seem like a very Apple thing for them to stuff it in the face of some BS legislation that they don't approve of.

Transcript:  Back in June Connie Guglielmo told 9to5Mac that new designs of the Mac Pro are in the works and will likely be released in 2013.  David Pogue was told by an executive that new models and new designs were underway.  Tim Cook emailed a reader and said we didn't have a chance to talk about a new Mac Pro today.  Talking about WWDC last year.  But don't worry we're working on something really great for later next year.  So I don't know what else Apple can do to like rest the fears that they're going to get rid of the Mac Pro except for come out with a new Mac Pro.  And what it looks to me happened in Europe is they're not ready to release the new design yet.  And the current Mac Pros don't conform to European law.  So they've got to pull them off the shelves until they come out with the new Mac Pro.  My guess is by the end of 2013 there'll be new Mac Pros.  They'll have the shroud.  They'll go on sale in Europe.

Start time: 4051.06
End time: 4098.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But what about that?  I mean if you look at the Mac rumors reporting on the quarter sales, the Q4 2012, Mac Pro sales are flat.  And that's just in revenue.  In profits it's actually infinitesimal.  Someone told me it's something like 1 percent, maybe even below 1 percent of the total profits that Apple gets.  They get far more off of the iPhone and even the iPad than anything else.  I mean the iOS devices essentially account for something like 90 percent of Apple's profits.  Well it would kind of make sense for them to focus on the things that make them profit, right?  And I know the ecosystem argument, but you could argue that the ecosystem is the laptop.  A MacBook Pro, a properly configured MacBook Pro, 17 inch with a Retina display,  will get you within a hair of the performance that most people would expect out of a desktop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just don't believe it because who are the people that made Apple?  The people who for 15 years, 20 years now, it's been the artsy types, it's been the graphic desktop,  it's been the graphic desktop designers, it's been the video editors.  And to turn your back on those people would be insane. I just don't see it.

Start time: 4120.12
End time: 4138.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the sales are flat because they haven't significantly updated it in so long.  So it isn't as compelling as it used to be.  We'll see if they do follow up on these promises from last summer and come out with new Mac Pros by the end of 2013.  Maybe those profit margins are a little better. Maybe they've figured out how to make more money off of them.

Start time: 4138.42
End time: 4158.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe it's just, you know, it also could be a very saturated market at this point for people who are using a Mac Pro  because, you know, you've got a certain number of people who are doing that kind of work that requires that amount of power.  People who are buying laptops can be, you know, it runs the gamut of all different sorts of people.  So I don't know, maybe that's why we've seen flat numbers in recent years.  They're just waiting for the next device to upgrade to.

Transcript:  Now we're going to a very different place altogether.

Start time: 4202.52
End time: 4309.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It just got dark. But you know, look, Apple is not known for bending to, you know, suit itself to every little legislative change and every consumer demand.  But you know what company does bend over backwards to give the consumers exactly what they want?  What company is that? Facebook.  It's true. Not really.  But but we do have an article here about how Facebook beat the estimates.  Money. Revenue was up 40 percent year over year up to one point five nine billion.  Whereas we like to call it one and a half Instagrams.  That means that they're also accounting for one point six point zero six billion monthly active users.  Six hundred and eighteen million daily active users.  And more importantly, six hundred and eighty million monthly active users on mobile.  Now the the the understory here reported on by the Verge is that mobile activity has now passed desktop activity on Facebook,  which is actually not as big of a blessing as it may sound like because anyone who's sold ads knows that, well, mobile makes you a lot less money than a desktop ad.  In fact, in some instances, it can make something like 10 percent of what you would make if that ad had actually displayed on a desktop.  So we're in this weird, weird realm where Facebook is continuing to increase the number of users they have.  But it but just to maintain revenue.  In other words, for every mobile desktop loser user you lose, you have to add 10 mobile users just to stay flat on revenue.  And of course, they don't need to stay flat. They need to grow it.  So my question to the panel is looking at these numbers, looking at Facebook's revenue, looking at them, hoping to beat estimates into the next quarter.  What do they have to do in order to increase the number of mobile users and desktop users?

Start time: 4312.28
End time: 4373.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think they need to increase the number of desktop users.  And the reason I say that is not because you're wrong about the current state of ad revenue, but the money is going towards mobile.  And that's why everyone is thinking, you know what, Facebook better get on the mobile because if they're behind the game, they're going to get lost.  They're going to lose out when people move to mobile.  Everybody knows usage is going to mobile. You can't change that.  You can't stop user behavior. What you need to do is lean into it.  And what Facebook's doing to my mind is very smart, which is making sure that they're gussying up their actual mobile applications so they're usable, which they weren't for a while.  And now the next step is to come up with compelling apps that make people want to use Facebook more, which gives them more of an opportunity to sell ads.  I think the amount of money you can make off mobile is going to rise, just like the amount of money you can make off the internet, off of websites, has risen over time.  This is kind of a normal pattern for new ways of getting advertising.  It's always a lower money game at the beginning until you get that critical mass moving over there.

Start time: 4374.00
End time: 4405.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they also are looking into new ways of making money.  We've seen them launching the ability to buy actual presents on Facebook now.  And we've seen some other developments like that where it's clear they're trying to find new ways of generating revenue beyond simple insertions of ads and highlighted posts and sponsored posts and things like that.  I think they'll continue to do that.  And I think that that's something that we'll be seeing a lot of different websites doing throughout the course of this year and next year because Facebook isn't the only one suffering from this problem.  We certainly see the same trend on our end as well.  And if you are a website that's heavily dependent on desktop revenue, if you don't have a plan for this, you're in trouble.

Start time: 4406.52
End time: 4414.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, Tim, let me ask you that because you might have some unique insight.  And that is, why is it that a mobile eyeball is worth so much less than a desktop eyeball?

Start time: 4414.30
End time: 4439.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not so much that an eyeball is worth less.  On one thing, there's less space.  You can put three or four banner ads on a page on a desktop.  You can't necessarily do that on a mobile page without making it completely obtrusive and ugly.  So you go from maybe three or four banner spaces to only one banner space.  And then the engagement is much, much lower on mobile in general as well.  You can click and open a tab on a desktop and kind of forget about it.  So people are more likely to click.  But if you tap on something, it kind of takes over your mobile experience.  And so people are much more.

Start time: 4440.18
End time: 4486.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Think about also, Tim, the fact that where do you make your purchases when you buy stuff from Amazon?  Think about how often you do it at a desktop versus on a mobile device.  So if the goal of advertisement is to get people to buy stuff, then structurally, there are deep problems with the mobile.  Now, they can win if what they're doing is investing in a lot of R&D to make the mobile ads exquisitely targeted for very specific.  Granted, you only get one banner ad instead of three, but it is precisely exactly what you want.  And you have the fewest number of clicks possible between the claim that they have a solution for you and you actually placing that order.  I think they can win with that.  And I think this is I think you're right.  This is the time to be investing in the in the infrastructure to make that possible on mobile.

End time: 4506.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It certainly can't get much worse whenever I'm shopping for something and I'll buy that something.  Then I'll see banner ads for that something for the next month on Facebook.  Oh, my God.  I've already been after the fact.  In the worst cases, when I donate to the SPCA, I see sad puppies on Facebook for weeks.  And it's the worst thing ever.  It's like I don't want to give money to the SPCA because then I see sad puppies on Facebook for a month.  Negative reinforcement.

Transcript:  Well, speaking of Facebook guiding us to buying things, have you all heard about Facebook's new gift card?  So let me let me run down the specs on this.  You buy it on Facebook in the gift store, but you can't use it in the gift store.  It can actually only be used at four retailers.  That's Sephora, which I just found out is cosmetics, Target, Jamba Juice and Olive Garden.  It's a good mix.

Start time: 4549.55
End time: 4552.33

Start time: 4553.00
End time: 4567.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, a lot of people are sort of scratching their head at this.  I think we know where Facebook wants to go.  I mean, they would like a piece of the financial pie that they're pushing people to.  But this seems like a really, really block handed way to do it.  It's a stretch.

Start time: 4568.00
End time: 4578.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's definitely a stretch.  I think the idea of selling someone a birthday present through Facebook is actually pretty smart.  I mean, when you send somebody, you know, you say happy birthday, it says, hey, would you like to send them an actual gift?  I think that makes sense.  But yes, a gift card, not so much.

Start time: 4580.02
End time: 4594.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is this is the next level, right?  Because if you're reminding someone that so and so has a birthday, it will also say, oh, by the way, these people are so smart.  By the way, these people like this, this, this and this.  Maybe you want to send them a gift.  They've got the data in there and they might as well use the graph search for something.  Oh, and they will.

And without even having I mean, it's shocking how many business decisions get made because something sounded good in a brainstorming session once and inertia takes it all the way through it.  It could be that the value of this to Facebook is just to figure out, you know what?  People expect gift cards to have a specific value for a specific thing.  We learned something today.  And if that's the case, then good on you, Facebook.  Congratulations.

Start time: 4644.35

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you know what?  Learning is half the battle.  Sure.  Let's go to a juicier story.  We've got Judge Lucy Ko.  Everyone remember her?  She is everyone's favorite Korean judge in San Jose who ruled that Samsung.  Wow.  Did I just say that?  You did.  You sure did.  That was an out loud thought, right?  Dang.  OK.  She ruled that Samsung did not willingly infringe Apple patents.  This is on top of Apple going back to her last year and saying that they wanted damages.  They wanted to triple the damages on the award because of course Samsung knew that these  patents were there and that they had infringed them.  Essentially, her ruling was that Samsung reasonably expected the patents to be overturned,  to be invalidated.  And so therefore, since they expected them to be invalidated, they could not be held  liable of, what is it, willful infringement.  This means that while Samsung is still on the hook for the $1 billion judgments against  them, those damages cannot be tripled.  And furthermore, this is on top of several key Apple patents being overturned and invalidated  by the USPTO.  The biggest one being the rubber banding patent that was part of the trade dress.  Everyone calls it patent 381.  That was the single patent that was applied across Samsung's line and that jurors voted  on as the largest component of the damage.  So my question is, and again this is a question we've heard a couple of times, what does  this do for the damages?  Obviously they're going to get reduced.  If patent 381 is no longer invalid and if Samsung does not have to pay those damages,  we're talking about half of the judgment.  And if it goes further and says that Samsung did not willingly infringe Apple patents,  it helps Samsung in their appeal of the decision, does it not?

Start time: 4753.52
End time: 4763.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but then Apple can still appeal this ruling as well, I think.  I think it can just go back and forth indefinitely, right?  True.  I don't know how the law works.

Start time: 4764.28
End time: 4797.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I actually spoke to Evan Brown about this and I listened to him about 10 minutes  and then my brain exploded.  But he also mentioned that our USPTO has a very interesting component to it where the  company applying for the patent or the individual applying for the patent is actually responsible  for doing the due diligence to make sure that the patent will be valid.  So if that's true, Apple can be held liable for Samsung's court costs to defend themselves  against the invalid patent 318.  Nothing?

Reminder, spoiler alert, I'm an idiot who eats fire for a living.  But I don't know that it's the craziest defense I've ever heard the idea that somebody can  say, yes, it was illegal while we were doing it, but we thought it wouldn't be illegal  by the time we got it done.  Like, that sounds crazy.  But I, to be honest, I've accelerated in anticipation of a speed limit increase.  And sometimes that speed limit increase wasn't there.

Transcript:  Okay.  You know what's not funny?  What's not funny is Netflix getting creative.  Now, I know that you've covered this on frame rate, so I'm going to lean on the two of you  to talk about Netflix's $100 million bet on House of Cards.  Now, this is an interesting story for many reasons.  First of all, because it seems to be a very interesting show.  You've got Kevin Spacey.  You've got a well-funded production, high production values.  It's a show on the Internet, yes, but at the same time, there's a lot of rustling about  this being the future of content, that this model could redefine how we look at shows  in the future.  We've got Netflix CTO, the Chief Content Officer, looking at a $300 million budget  for original programming.  He wants five shows a year.  And his quote is, the goal is to become HBO faster than HBO, for Netflix to become HBO  faster than HBO can become Netflix.

Transcript:  Now, I 100% believe this.  This will happen.  I guarantee it.  But it's not like you had something else.  What was that?

Start time: 5079.10
End time: 5140.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, what I like about this is it's a new way of dealing with content.  So in the typical development cycle that you would get on a network, you would create  a pilot.  The pilot would go out.  They'd see how well it does, how many people watched it, what was the audience response.  Are advertisers willing to buy it?  And that is why sometimes you'll have a pilot that does really well that dies, because it  may be popular with the audience, but if no one's willing to pay for advertising, it  dies in the crib.  Netflix's new scheme works like this.  You make a show, a single first episode, to determine if the concept is valid.  Will people watch it?  Is it watchable?  If that is, that's the only question you have to go with.  You make the whole season, because Netflix realizes their delivery system is not the  same as the networks.  They are not bound by the time schedule.  In other words, to run one program, it does not mean you have to remove another.  With the internet, all they need is content.  They put the content there.  People will watch it, and they get paid in subscriptions.  It's a totally different way of thinking about what we watch.

Start time: 5141.52
End time: 5165.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We are all really bingers at the end of the day when it comes to this kind of stuff.  So if I find a show that I like to watch on Netflix or on Hulu or something like that,  I will just watch the entire thing in one go.  So I think this really speaks to that model being successful going forward, because I  feel like that's a lot of the reason that people are so into watching internet content  and into watching stuff that's on Netflix, because you have that accessibility to the  entire catalog right away.

Start time: 5166.70

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now, I got to be honest, Father Robert, that I had not even considered.  I mean, I think what you just came across is an extremely important and significant  idea, the idea that the types of stories that can be told now are fundamentally  different because for the first time, they are not catering to advertisers.  They're catering to the people who buy it.  Imagine if all your favorite books were not written just for what they thought the  reader would like to hear, but instead were written, what do advertisers think would  be a good book that they want to put their money behind?  And taking that out of the equation makes possible a totally different form of  storytelling.  And that's why my co-host on NSFW, Justin Robert Young, and I have argued on screen  for hours at a time.  He's under the impression that Netflix should be releasing these episodes weekly so  that they can maximize their relevance culturally, like every week, every Monday,  you talk about the latest episode of such and such.  But now that House of Cards is out, dude, that model is dead and stupid and buried  and I want it gone forever.  What they're doing is brilliant because even if they were releasing it week over  week, I would just wait three more weeks until they'd run their course.  So then I could watch them all straight through at once.  Watching a story with a deep, fascinating narrative like House of Cards, watching it  straight through, and I'm only like six episodes in, is phenomenal.  And there's so many, it's as good as any narrative I've seen on HBO.  There's, I think the last time I felt this way about a series was the, maybe not the  Wire, but the Shield.  I love what they're doing with this thing, directed by David Fincher.  It's amazing.  And the fact that they're releasing it all at once is they're taking narratives, long  form episodic narratives, and releasing them and treating them more like 13 to 18 hour  long single narrative arcs is amazing.  I think it's a brilliant, brilliant move on their part.

Start time: 5283.20
End time: 5351.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a lot of interesting things about what's going on here and you can make arguments  about whether HBO is doing what Netflix was doing for a long time and that they would  make quality programming without having to be beholden to advertisers.  But they still followed the clock.  They still required their shows to fit in that 60 minute time slot or 30 minute time  slot because they had a schedule to keep.  Netflix doesn't have a schedule.  Netflix doesn't have a schedule.  So one of the more interesting things about House of Cards, I feel like, is that each  episode is a different length because they were allowed to just make the episode as long  as they felt it needed to be to tell the story.  But I think the most important question to me about this is, are people going to be walking  around talking about House of Cards to each other to the point where people feel like,  oh, I have to go check that out or I want to put that on my list of things to see the  way that Sex and the City, The Wire, Game of Thrones, etc., Game of Thrones have been  in the past, whether you've seen them or not, they're definitely, you know someone at least  who's told you, you've got to watch this.  And House of Cards needs to build up that momentum.  If it does, if it has that kind of conversation out there, huge win for Netflix.  And that's what they want to keep doing.  Well, here's the thing, Tom.

Start time: 5363.63
End time: 5368.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's exactly right, because I hate cord cutting.  I limited myself to only watching one episode.

Start time: 5370.17
End time: 5421.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But here's the important thing is that people don't talk about those other shows because  they're released weekly.  They talk about them because they're exceptional and they're really good.  And House of Cards is like that.  Again, if the success of television is not based on weekly episodic content, it's based  on good stories.  And again, all you have to do is look to novels.  What we are doing is we're taking television shows and we're enjoying them the way we enjoy  novels.  Novel comes out on a Friday.  You meet with them on Monday.  You say, how far in are you?  I'm up to page 150.  How you like?  Oh, it's great.  And you know where you are because you don't want to spoil something that comes ahead.  You still have these conversations and it still lasts a long time.  Nothing is being ruined by releasing everything at once.  Instead, all you're doing is allowing the end user to regulate his own consumption  experience.  And that's nothing but pure rad.

Transcript:  Let me ask you this.  What changes when we move away from the network format?  What I mean by this is imagine all the things that happen within a typical network TV show  or even cable TV show that you don't have to do on the Internet.  So episode length 30 minutes or 60 minutes long.  You have to craft the story so that there are regular periods at which you can take  a break to do advertising.  There are certain things that you have to do in order to lend itself to an episodic  development of characters that you won't have to do if your episode length can be anything  it needs to be.  What changes about the storytelling if we free ourselves from the constraints that we  put on ourselves in the past 30 years of television?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was just going to drag out my dusty old book analogy.  Novels used to be written in serial.  Charles Dickens wrote a bunch of his novels in serial first and then they were put out  as books later.  And I think it's sort of the same evolution, which is, yes, the form changes, but the form  changes anyway.  So it's hard to distinguish like what changed because we stopped putting out serials and  started putting out books fully formed and what changed just because the culture changed.  But I think we will see some stories get told that wouldn't get told otherwise.  And I think of things like Lost where they had to struggle hard to get the network to  let them end the show when they wanted to end it because they had a definite end.  You can argue whether you like that end or not, but they had it in mind.  And that is unusual in network television, in broadcast television, cable television  even.  So now Netflix can say, yeah, you just have two seasons of story.  That's great.  We'll take it.

Start time: 5530.36
End time: 5547.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And also, you know, maybe it'll make it so that good shows that don't have a huge strong  audience right out of the gate don't have to get canceled, that they can actually kind  of live up to their potential without having to force that, you know, that massive initial  audience that will keep them on the air.

Transcript:  Is this the direct video moment for television?  Just as Hollywood found out that there was a significant amount of money to be made in  pushing certain content direct to DVD, could now television studios realize that we can  make series that aren't immediately popular because we know we're going to make it on  the back end when we put it up on a service like Amazon or Netflix?

Start time: 5570.89
End time: 5610.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm uncomfortable with that parallel altogether.  I mean, direct to DVD is the home of crap cash grabs to squeeze a little more money out  of existing franchises.  So it's hard for me to get excited about that.  You know, I'm much more intrigued by the ability for independent filmmakers, for documentarians  to tell stories that have no business being in movie theaters just because nobody would  go see them.  But they're so esoteric that they by finding their voice in digital, they can create these  as we talk about on frame rate, these micro networks, these these three, four man operations  that are able to hit profitability because of the economy of scale.

Start time: 5611.36
End time: 5646.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the direct to DVD thing is very interesting because I was talking to a guy who worked  in Hollywood for years recently and he said that all the money is gone because they lost  direct to DVD sales.  And in my mind, I feel like we're seeing this big fight against so-called piracy because  of the direct to DVD sales going away, people stopping buying those.  This may provide an avenue and an outlet not only for television shows, but for movies  to be made specifically for Amazon, for Hulu, for Netflix.  And I'm interested to see what explorations start happening in that arena.  All right.  So I do want to ask this.

Start time: 5647.44
End time: 5677.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that is I love the concept of independent filmmakers and independent content makers  coming in to Netflix or to Hulu or to Amazon and actually getting a forum to voice their  stories.  But how many of us are actually going there for that content?  I am a Netflix subscriber.  I watch seasons of Archer.  I watch seasons of Stargate Universe.  I watch television shows.  I have never watched Lillahammer or House of Cards.  Oh, well, you're an idiot and you're dumb.  Plus you have a silly face.

Start time: 5678.04
End time: 5749.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Naturally, yes.  You got to watch those.  But more importantly, the independent content.  What I love about the all you can eat, you know, welcome to our arcade, have whatever  you want attitude that Netflix has is I am somebody who is very gun shy about committing  to going to a movie, spending my $10 to get in and sit down and spend two hours looking  at something.  The stakes are too high.  If it sucks and I feel 30 minutes in and I'm watching something I hate, then all of a  sudden I instantly regret the decision.  But what Netflix has done is they've taken away that I can leave at any time.  I've not paid any entrance fee.  I can stop any time I want.  And as a result, there's a number of crazy independent documentaries.  Some of them have been exquisite.  Some of them I would have rolled my eyes at when I saw them, you know, who killed the  electric car or the business of being born.  And I found points that I that that I really would never have heard otherwise because I  knew I could quit at any time.  And I did not.  I actually couldn't finish the business of being born.  But I'm really glad I watched that first half up until I saw Ricky Lake naked giving birth  in a tub.  Wow.  Well, that happened in these eyes written on this brain.  No backsies on that.  Sorry.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We can get rid of that for you.  All right.  So I do want to move on, but I want to stay with that theme because we are talking about  the new form of content distribution.  This story comes from Wired and it's all about Amazon taking one from Netflix.  They have scored Downton Abbey or as I like to call it, Downtown Arby's from Netflix.  I know.  I know.  Don't do that.  This this is another show which I will admit up front that I have never watched.  I want to watch it.  I want to wait until I have enough of the series where I could sit down and have a big  cry fest.  But starting in mid-June, Amazon Prime members will be able to see it and they'll be the  only ones able to see the legal streams of season three of Downton Abbey.  Now, an unspecified while later, seasons one and two will also be only available on Amazon.  And when season four premieres, it will be available again only on Amazon.  So they've they've really put a big bet.  We don't know exactly how much money, but a big bet into drawing people into Prime because  of the content that you can get for stream.  My question to you is, is this the future of content where we're going to have these  distributors, Amazon, Netflix, maybe you could even throw Hulu in there, who are going to  be vying for these these these hot spots of content, hoping that that's going to be the  franchise that they can build on?

Start time: 5841.61
End time: 5883.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, it's great.  I think it's great that these networks are picking up these these IPs.  But the fact of the matter is, it's making it more difficult.  I mean, we've got all these set top boxes that have like certain certain services on them.  They've either got Amazon streaming, they've got Netflix, they've got, you know, whatever is out  there. And it's frustrating for the consumer because you feel like you have to make a choice.  And maybe we've had to make these kinds of choices all along.  But at the end of the day, it's getting harder and harder to decide what you're going to be paying  money for. Right now, I'm a prime member.  I'm a Hulu Plus member.  You know, I never buy stuff on iTunes, but, you know, it's it's getting harder to choose.  And I think it does.  It feels like it does the consumer a disservice.  But maybe that's always how it's going to be.

Transcript:  Well, we again, spoiler, we talked about this on framerate.  And if you're not watching framerate, you really should.  It's a fine show on the network live every Monday night with me and Tom Merritt.  One of the things as much as as we don't like to see and I empathize with where you're coming from,  where it's like subscribing to all these different services, the balkanization of the content and  new media.  But on the flip side, there's another part of me where I would rather I don't care at this point.  This is going to sound crazy coming from someone like me.  I don't care if they divvy up all the content and make it available on like an oligarchy of four networks  that I have to pay subscription to all four of those as long as they get all the content and I no longer  have to pay for cable.  I would much, much rather pay an HBO ghost subscription and Amazon Prime subscription, Netflix subscription  and Hulu subscription, pay all four of these guys and not give one more cent to time worn a cable.  That would be amazing.  But I would be amazing.  I would go for that.

Transcript:  So when I see stuff like this, it makes me happy to see more players in the environment.  And Father Robert, you're right.  They're like Hulu's kind of the redheaded stepchild.  I mean, Amazon Prime has been the the laggard of the big three.  It's been Netflix, Hulu and then Amazon Prime.  And the fact that we're seeing these move.  This is this is great news that they're securing the fact that they're securing these exclusives means this is a robust  market and people recognize that there's a lot of opportunity there.  So this is something while it's not exciting, we shouldn't be happy that there's only one place for you to get it now.  We should be happy that people perceive this as a important enough space that they want to be the only person that you could get X, Y and Z.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I remember something that I heard from Dr.  Brushwood on an episode of Framerate not too long ago that people really don't give a crap where they're getting it from Netflix, Hulu, Amazon.  But the problem is that with exclusives, we're making it more complicated.  We're essentially putting another barrier in the way for people to cut the cords.  Do you no longer subscribe to that theory?

Start time: 6011.00
End time: 6040.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know who that person is that you're talking about, but he sounds like an idiot.  This guy, however, thinks that I mean, as long as there certainly should be as few barriers as possible and exclusives and windowing  makes things complicated for us.  But there's no reason that we can't see other services provide kind of a concierge service that make it to where you don't even know who it is.  You're paying to get your content.  You just know you want Downton Abbey and now it's on your screen like that's what I'm in favor of.  You know, that's kind of what my Tivo does now.

You know, I can search for shows and then it'll give me the options about where online I can view those shows on my TV.  So I can either choose from Amazon Prime or Hulu Plus or Netflix.  So that's good.  But then at the same time, I have to pay for all of those services.  I don't know why I pay for Hulu Plus.  It's terrible.  Put it on pause.

Transcript:  You know, I've been thinking for a long time, Father Robert, of starting a website  that just gives some of the things I've learned about doing segues  and maybe pointing to some of the people that I've learned from out there.  And one of the easy ways for me to do that would be with our sponsor, Squarespace.com,  the fast and easy way to create a high quality website or blog.  We use it for sword laser, Veronica and I.  It's a super simple way to get not only a great looking website,  but a website where you can concentrate just on the content that you're putting in there.  So you can go and just write your headlines, write your posts, put up your photos,  make a gallery, a couple clicks.  What you see is what you get in the new Squarespace 6,  and it takes care of the reliability, making sure everything's served,  making sure that your site has a mobile responsive design that looks right on a phone,  that looks right on a tablet, that auto plays music sometimes if you want it to.  All of that taken care of. You don't have to think about it.  Brian, you had a great story about putting together that website about pandas.

So she comes home and like, Dad, I want to make a website.  And I was like, I don't even know where my copy of Dreamweaver is.  I remember half of this crap.  And so I just went and I hooked her up with a trial account at Squarespace.  And then she, before I knew it, I turned around and she had already registered.  She set it all up.  Panda-save.org is now my eight-year-old daughter.  So easy an eight-year-old could do it.  And it probably looks better than your website.  In your face, person I'm talking to.

Transcript:  Was that too soon?  That was too soon.  All right.  Let's get into the home stretch where we're going to get super, super geeky.  Thankfully, we've got the right panel for this.  I'm calling it Hacker Alley, starting with the crazy, nasty, scary vulnerability in UPNP.  That's universal plug and play.  This is a feature that has been incorporated into network devices,  usually consumer slash small business network devices, for the last 12 years.  What it allows you to do is it allows you to have a router  and have devices behind it that are pinged by a discovery packet,  which the router will then say, hey, what do you need?  So, for example, you can have an Xbox Live that says,  I need these ports open so that I can play games.  You've got a Skype phone that says, I need these ports open  so that I can establish a direct line to another Skype device.  You've got toasters and refrigerators that say,  I need these ports open so that someone can ping me  to find out whether or not I need service.  That's the kind of thing that UPNP does.  Well, the problem that has been discovered by H.D. Moore,  the man of Metasploit fame, and reported on by our very own Steve Gibson,  is that this UPNP service is, well, it's insecure.  In fact, pros have been turning it off for years  because it requires no authentication.  Basically, any device in the network can configure a router.  That's not necessarily the best thing to do.  Well, now imagine that I give that power to reconfigure my router  to everything outside of my router.  That's the vulnerability that we're talking about.  This UPNP feature, which should only be accessible from inside the LAN,  has been found to be available on the WAN port, the outside,  the Internet-facing port, on over 81 million devices.  H.D. Moore did a scan of the Internet, a complete scan,  using enough servers so that he could scan every address  in the IPv4 space once a week, and he did this for five and a half months.  What he found was that there were 81 million devices  that have UPNP turned on on the WAN port.  Now, let me stress, there's absolutely no good reason to have it on in the WAN port.  That should never be turned on to the outside world.  What this allows people to do, who are, say, like me,  is they can send a discovery packet, a UDP packet, to your router,  find out exactly what operating system it's running,  and then reconfigure it so that it can start looking at all the devices  on the other side of your firewall.  It's a horrible, horrible exploit, and, well, it's something that we've seen coming,  because we knew that UPNP was insecure.  We knew that it should be turned off, and yet it turns out  that these manufacturers have not just left it on, but they've improperly used it.  My question to the panel is this.  We're seeing more and more situations in which dumb consumer-level devices,  things that we thought, oh, I just buy it and it works, are no longer that way.  When I go to Fry's or Best Buy, I expect that if I buy a name-brand router  and I plug it in, it's just going to work out of the box.  It looks like we're actually expecting more understanding  and more knowledge out of end users than we used to.  What kind of trends do you guys see here?

Transcript:  You know what? It's tough to say, because, look, I ain't in the business  of telling other people what they think or what they're good at  or what they'll be smart about doing, but it does seem like,  look, if there's a sin, it's making too many options here.  And it seems like a lot of this stuff self-corrects.  For example, I'm looking at the story right now.  In the chat room, somebody says, well, my router just passed the test.  I said, what test? Instantly forward me a link over to Gibson Research Corporation, of course,  and to check for the vulnerability on this exact thing.  Here, let me see if I can actually show it to you right here.  Shields up. I've got it on my screen, Chad.

I just have to know that I'm safe.  And I do now. So it's like, I don't know.  It's like, this is one of those things where it's because we have people like Steve Gibson out there  who are so passionate about finding these exploits and security holes and exposing them.  And as a result, I can remain completely dumb.  And I'm thrilled to remain as ignorant and as stupid as I possibly can.

Transcript:  Which has to be informed enough to actually know that you have to run the test, which is the thing.  How do we get people to know that they need to run this test?  Right. I mean, obviously, we're doing it right now. Public service, everybody. You're welcome.  But those people who are unfortunate enough to not be watching right now, who might be, I don't know,  tuned into a certain football game taking place in a large container of some sort, you know, how do we how do we educate them?

Start time: 6707.17
End time: 6769.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's that's always been the question, because we want to make these devices dead simple.  And so everything is always plug and play. I mean, that's that's the catchphrase.  Even though pros kind of wince every time we hear plug and play, because plug and play normally means incredibly insecure.  That's how you sell the device. You don't want to tell someone, oh, we're going to sell you this gaming console.  And all you have to do is open up port 2120 in order to get an outbound connection to work properly with another.  No, you can't do that. It's got to be as long as you have this router and this device and you turn it on, it will work.  Well, but that doesn't lend itself to security. So, yeah, these are always going to be at odds.  So the question here really isn't, well, should everyone just start learning about network security?  Because that's not going to happen. The question becomes, what do manufacturers have to do to include the same level of drop dead,  easy to use, along with at least the modicum of network security?  Anyone want to argue against network security here?  No, they should do it out there. Veronica, I really like to hear your devil's advocate of you.

I understand why people would think it should be the manufacturer's responsibility.  But, you know, at the end, like I said, at the end of the day, it's our responsibility to to understand what we're purchasing  and how we're using it and the consequences of using it incorrectly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll strike the middle. And I'll say it is your right.  It is your responsibility to secure your machines.  But there is also responsibility on the device makers to not knowingly provide insecure products.  And when they do know about something, as in this case, to work to secure them and inform their consumers,  hey, you know, we're the experts on building this stuff and we just found this out.  You know, here's the solution. Here's the fix.

Start time: 6827.00
End time: 6856.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not for this. I think I think this is a big opportunity.  I mean, routers are a weird device because people tend to buy them and then they're never supported because they are a dumb device.  Because typically you plug it in and you'll never see it again.  They don't get a lot of support.  The ones that you buy, unless it's really expensive, they don't do automatic updates.  So most people are running a router with 10 year old code.  Not cool. You know, that's not supposed to.  You would not hook up a Windows computer that has not been patched for 10 years.  Why would you do that with your router? Oh, yeah.

I am universally on the side of whenever whatever the question is,  I'm always in favor of more options and more power to the person buying it,  which means even if you want to do something stupid, something idiotic like it's the it's the Linux defense, right?  If you know, you can type a single command in Linux that will utterly destroy everything and it won't even bother to ask you,  are you sure you want to do this?  And it's like, I'm OK with that. That's that's it's there should exist operating systems where you can do that.  Now, is that the operating system for everyone? No.  Do I do I strongly want that to be available to everyone? Yes.  And so as a result, if what you want to do is run an insecure network on your router and not bother to update it, well, you might go nuts, man.

Transcript:  And we have bacon pancakes. Let's move on.  All right. So back into hackers alley. We're in the homestretch.  Let's talk a little bit about China, because China hackers are all in the news this last week with the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal both admitting that they have been hacked.  The New York Times has been attacked for the last four months, whereas the Wall Street Journal has said that they've been getting attacked for the last couple of years.  Now, it's interesting to note that it looks as if the hackers were not trying to get access to any customer data.  They weren't looking for credit cards. They weren't looking for personalized information.  They were looking for sources of stories that were running in each news source, which, again, that's that's one of the reasons why people think it was China.  It was a state-sponsored effort to find out who was behind various stories.  In the New York Times case, it was the story behind the minister of I cannot remember his name or his position, but that makes it so much more fun.  And they were trying to find out exactly who leaked the information about the investigation.  In the case of the Wall Street Journal, the attacks originated from IPs within Russia, but were traced back to methods used by Chinese cybersecurity.  And again, it seemed to be focused on finding sources of leaks about hiring processes that were going on in factories.  Now, what's interesting about this is they're using zero-day exploits along with botnets of computers that have been compromised within the United States.  In the case of the New York Times stories, they took over campus networks at various universities across the country and used it to brute force their way into various computers connected to the internet.  And they were also connected to the New York Times Network.  Now, I bring all this up because there is a great story about Google's Eric Schmidt blasting China as the Internet menace.  He has a new book coming out called The Digital Age, and he calls China the world's most active and enthusiastic filterer of information,  as well as saying that the reason why they have such an advanced cyber warfare effort is because there is a very close relationship between the tech industry and the government.  And we have to do the same thing in order to, A, head off the type of attacks that hit the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, but also to build up our own capability to do the same.  My question to all of you is, I mean, the cyber pro-harbors is gone and past, right?  I mean, we're already in the middle of it.

Obviously, there's a lot of emotion going back and forth because it seems to be a bit of a nationalistic geekery here.  But there is something to be said about the fact that China has used some of the best and brightest engineers it can find in order to pull off these attacks, allegedly.  Whereas here in the United States, we tend to take those same people and put them in jail.  Yeah.  Okay, crickets, crickets.  All right.  You know what?  This whole hack rally thing was kind of a bust.  I think it's the wrong time for this because we're all dreaming of sporting events.

So you have to go back into application support to delete the history.  That makes it easy.  Yeah, and the theory running around the internet is that this is a bug in the spell checker.  And so any time that Apple runs its spell check service on a capital F file,  slash, slash, slash, it crashes the app.  And so here's another dead, you know, dead app.

And almost six months after it had come out, I was at my brother's office.  He's like, yeah, we got a problem.  I was like, what?  He's like, watch this.  And he's in a multiplayer map and he's like, you stand here and put on the binoculars.  Now hit this so you tilt to the side.  And then he just starts hitting G and unlimited grenades start coming out.  Like, who would have thought to do this exactly?  I was like, do people know?  He's like, apparently it's everywhere now.  So it's like, it's amazing to me that you can discover these things years and years  and years after the vulnerability occurs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the thing is it was hard to I wrote a tweet about it and it was hard to get it out to people  because you have to type, you know, capital F file, call it slash and hit space.  And so what I found that I could do is I could copy it from another article and the spell checker in  Mountain Lion, if you copy and paste something, it won't spell check your paste.  So you can copy and paste as long as you don't go back and actually like leave your cursor on the thing.  But yeah, that was the only way that I could get it.

Transcript:  Thank you, Tom and Tom and Tom and Chad.  So here we are at the end of an episode of TWIT, slightly derailed by the Super Bowl, definitely derailed by hackers, Ali.  I do want to thank all the panelists here for sacrificing a Sunday, for coming on to talk to me about pretty much everything.  Brian Brushwood, you know, I've always been a big fan of yours.  I love the program that you do on the TWIT Network and off the TWIT Network.  Tell me, what are the things that you're working on right now that people need to know about?

Transcript:  First of all, you should watch Framerate with me and Tom Merritt.  It's a lot of fun.  Also, we're doing a I'm trying something that we've never done on Scam School before.  A bunch of people are asking me to teach more advanced magic tricks, stuff that would be too complicated for us to do on Scam School.  So tomorrow, this will probably be like today if you're listening to it on Monday, we should have it available at Scam Stuff dot com.  Scam Stuff dot com, our first extra credit episode.  It's like a 23 minute episode where I teach one of the most versatile magic tricks you could do.  It's something there's no special skill required.  It's just a little bit of process.  It's something a little more in depth than a Scam School episode.  I want to start teaching better magic to folks.  And also, we're doing a bunch more stuff from this studio.  Thanks to our friends over at Doghouse Systems who hooked me up with the Max Trollbox.  There he is right there.  That's a webcam pointed at the side of my computer.  They even set up like a promo code.  I don't know if you remember, but Doghouse, they were one of the big promoters of Game On.  They did the Double Your Memory promotion and helped keep that show going as long as it did.  They're setting up another code, Shwood, and you can get the Max Trollbox art on the side of your game rig.  I got a bunch of loot for you as well.  Details are online.
