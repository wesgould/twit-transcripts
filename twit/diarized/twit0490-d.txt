Transcript:  What's happening in Gamergate is a conflation of gamers, like original hardcore gamers,  who see that as their identity, being mad at the criticism leveled at games for being  sexist and too violent and not including women and being targeted at white men, being mad  at that criticism and then targeting their anger at that criticism towards the older  problem of graft and corruption in gaming.  Because the reality, and this is true, the reality is if I wanted to be corrupt about  an independent games developer, like honestly, I would make no money.  Right. Like it would not be worth it to me to stake my publications credibility on that.  It wouldn't be. And I know that Polyon again, my sister publication, I know the people who  work there, not worth it to Chris Grant, the editor in chief of Polygon, to stake his credibility,  his career, his publication on pushing forward depression quest.

Transcript:  All right. So this contention that the game press is biased or there's conflict of interest  is probably bogus, but it has gone so beyond that that the hashtag Gamergate means a whole  lot more. And at this point, it seems to be frankly aimed at women.

Start time: 240.68
End time: 344.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_26
Transcript:  It is absolutely aimed at women now. And it is aimed at the idea that women who are criticizing  games or people or anything or just standing up and saying hello or being alive are somehow  complicit in a massive conspiracy to shut down any number of crazy arguments.  And most of those arguments have to do with things like men's rights. Most of those arguments have  to do with things like where like it basically boils down. Like let me just give you a small  sample of things that we dealt with this week at The Verge. We dealt with our writers being  harassed on Twitter. We dealt with a massive harassment, literally. And I'm not kidding.  And a neo-Nazi site writing about one of our writers' haircuts and saying her father should  have beaten her with the back of her hand until her hair grew out. This did not have anything to  do with video games. It just has to do with like what they thought about her, right? And some  things she'd written about race and Ebola. What we are dealing with is basically the idea that  people on the internet should not have standards about how they talk to other people.  And what they're doing now is Gamergate as a movement has decided that the way that they will  further their goals is by attacking our advertisers, which is fair because if you  attack my economic interests, maybe I'll change my mind. But if your argument is that we don't  have journalistic ethics, right? Maybe. But if your argument is that I don't have journalistic  ethics and then your strategy is to attack my advertisers until I do what they want,  then you have completely obviated your argument. And that's the circle that we're in.

Transcript:  You're assuming there's any logic in this kind of trolling at all. It has nothing to do with logic.  It's whatever you can get away with. I feel sorry for Brianna Wu, a game developer who has  literally been chased from her house with horrific threats. The police are investigating and I suspect  that the nature of these threats gives the police a foothold in pursuing it. Almost always it's  coming from Twitter. And I have to point out that Twitter has become a true cesspool. And one of the  problems that's happening is that Twitter has to continue its 25% monthly growth or the stock  market price will tumble. The whole house of cards will collapse. So they have zero incentive  to take care of this stuff by say banning IP addresses, looking up the names.

Transcript:  Oh, I'm not buying that. Oh, no, no, I promise you.  You got you got you track the people down that were giving you like two, three years ago.  Didn't you find some guy in Fresno that was like somebody?

Start time: 399.52
End time: 421.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I did. He was in Chicago as a kid. Yeah, but we needed we needed warrants,  subpoenas in Petaluma and Chicago. We needed the cooperation of local police here and in Chicago.  By the way, because there's death threats here, this will happen with this particular situation.  We hope so. Well, one hopes because the police  also seem to be you have to find cooperative police. I saw a great tweet today. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_26
Transcript:  where it came from, but it it was basically this. It was if you torrent a movie from Warner Brothers,  there's a good chance you'll be much more likely. Right. If you tell a woman on the  internet that you will kill her or rape her, not like Twitter will tell you there's nothing

Start time: 436.30
End time: 464.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  you can do. Right. And I really I think Costello is a nice guy, blah, blah, blah. But I think  Twitter and its board are at this point really culpable because they will not shut these accounts  down. They don't make it hard. Counts all the time. It's so easy to create a new account.  Well, that's the point. It's that you can create a new account and they don't they don't shut it  down effectively, which they could technologically, but they have no desire to do. In fact, they want  people to create new accounts because that shows their growth. But I think I agree with you, Leo.

Start time: 465.98
End time: 485.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_26
Transcript:  I think Twitter is deeply culpable. I think all these platforms by which people can harass other  people, we have to take a hard look in the mirror and decide, OK, well, the internet is interwoven  into our lives. Like how should we treat each other and how should we punish people for treating  each other badly or deal with people that treating treating each other badly in these platforms?

Start time: 485.62

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, but here's a lob at this point. I mean, I think men have to stand up and say this is not  acceptable. How about can I ask a question here? Because I've kind of triggered this thought. I

Start time: 494.46
End time: 504.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  don't want to ask you what specifically triggered this craziness. It just sounds like a non story  that just blew up for some unknown reason. I don't know what the reason is. It's been blown up for

Start time: 504.66
End time: 509.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  over three months. I mean, it's been three months. OK, it's been three months. But what triggered it?

Start time: 509.60
End time: 553.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  In my opinion, because there has been a downwards, really ugly downward trend over the last year or  two. And I think primarily thanks to Twitter and the fact that you cannot stop this stuff on  Twitter, you can stop it on Google+. You could stop it on Facebook. You cannot stop it on Twitter.  That's where it lives. And and I have to say that the quality of conversation in the in the general  internet world is really deteriorating. It's always been crap. Well, but but it's I agree,  it's never been great, but it's gotten worse and worse. And the ugly voices that can you get for a  long time. I really thought that the publicity would would promote civility, that the ugly voices  would get pushed out. And it's going in the other direction at this point. Let me answer John's

Start time: 553.48
End time: 646.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_26
Transcript:  question. Where it came from is basically two people and two things that two pieces of content  of media that were created. One is Anita Sarkeesian's Trips vs. Women on YouTube,  where she literally just analyzed video games like mass market video games from a feminist  perspective, which is her perspective, and pointed out that women in games are often used as sex  objects or the male gaze, which is when the author of a piece of work tends to look at women the way  a man would look is prevalent in video games. And you can watch these things that you could  disagree with them. And I disagree with some of them in the same way that I read Jezebel every day.  And I disagree with Jezebel sometimes, right? You can they are worth their topics worth discussing.  And she presents them in a particularly strong way, which I think is great. So that is a thing  that exists. The next thing is Zoe Quinn, the variety of games she's made that have nothing to  do with being video games, right? They have everything to do about telling stories in an  interactive way. And the Games Press took both of these things and thought they were interesting.  And the Games Press, I think over the past few years, and again, because I work at a company that  runs Polygon, I think Polygon's mission is to take video games and turn and talk about them as their  art, right? Like the whole business model for Polygon is everybody plays video games now.  Let's run a site for everybody. And so if you look at the way they talk about video games,  they talk about them in a broad, encompassing way. And I think that's great. Again, I'm biased,

Start time: 646.94
End time: 650.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  right? They're my friends. All I learned from that was that you read Jezebel every day.

Start time: 651.94
End time: 666.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_26
Transcript:  Well, it's entertaining, I get to say. I disagree with Jezebel all the time. But  it's interesting to me as a person who wants to be disagreed with. Like I loved I'm a lawyer,  right? I like to be argued. What kind of a lawyer was this? Well, one apparently like sexual

Start time: 666.22
End time: 679.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  intercourse. I don't know. Yes. Sorry. All right. No, I just I think it's gone so far beyond gaming  and the gaming press. I think it's crazy. It is an eruption of trolling that is appalling.

Start time: 680.46
End time: 816.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_26
Transcript:  Let me finish this. What you were seeing is that stuff compounded in the gaming press started to  threaten an identity, an identity of being a gamer, an identity of being a young person who maybe felt  that they existed in this other subculture. And identity politics is something that our culture  understands, right? It's something that's easy to attack other people for not understanding your  identity. It's easy to attack other people for being outside your identity. And what has actually  happened in Gamergate is that the language and the tactics of the culture war and the identity  politics that are toxic to our society have been foisted onto video games. So now what we're talking  about is feminism. Now what we're talking about is straight up like, are you a gamer? Do you believe  in what you believe in? And so the angry tweets I get are about things like you're just supplicating  yourself to the feminist agenda when really what the verge is talking about is should women be  better represented in video games? And so you can have these arguments. They are worth having. What  should our art look like? Should our art include the category of things we traditionally call video  games? I would argue that they should. But if you want to disagree with Roger Ebert, if you want to  win the argument that video games should be considered art, you necessarily have to let other  artists into the mix. You necessarily have to let other kinds of criticism into the mix. So when  feminists critique Michael Bay movies, you don't get Gamergate. What you get is people being like,  it's happening again. And then lots of people watching Michael Bay movies. When feminists  critique Grand Theft Auto V, what you get is Gamergate. And that is actually the problem.  That's the whole circle of the problem is that the people who believe that this is their identity  and these publications belong to them are refusing to understand and they're refusing to accept  that that circle should get wider. And again, I feel very strongly about this because it has  been personally affecting to me over these past few weeks and for my friends who work in video  game journalism for the past three months. But I will tell you that this is the right side of the  argument and there is a wrong side and the wrong side is being a dick to people on the internet.

Start time: 843.26
End time: 874.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_26
Transcript:  Walk across the door and just open the door and then walk through the door and close the door and  never look back. I'm telling you, this is a thing that we don't understand as people who talk about  consumer technology because what we're actually talking about is fashion and personal expression.  And those things are, they work on different levels than how we assume. What you are saying  is I hate people who wear baggy jeans. What you're saying is I hate people who wear NFL  t-shirts to the bar. That's bullsh- nobody's saying that.  It is absolutely the same. No, it's not.  Yes, it is. No, it's not.

Start time: 875.22
End time: 884.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  And if you don't see it- I wear noise canceling headsets. I just don't like these big giant cans.  This doesn't mean I don't like baggy pants or I do like baggy pants. I resent that.

Start time: 884.78
End time: 903.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_26
Transcript:  But no, you're saying it's the same category. You're wearing jeans or hats.  I didn't say anything about categories. You're full of sh-  No, you're saying I like this kind. I wear this thing and I think those-  No, no, no, no, no.  Because they have this function, but these other people who are wearing-  You're stereotyping.  Actually though-  I'm not stereotyping at all.  You're stereotyping.  You are saying I hate these people who wear cans in the airport.

Start time: 903.32
End time: 913.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I never said- I said I don't like going in the air-  On an airplane and seeing a bunch of people with big cans. Why?  Do you like people who wear saggy pants?  I just think-  That's ridiculous.  I love saggy pants. Especially on you, Leo.

Start time: 915.02
End time: 924.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_26
Transcript:  That's all I'm saying. You are looking at people who are making stylistic decisions  and fashion decisions-  And so I can't say I don't like that. I have to agree that-

Start time: 924.14
End time: 926.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  No, he's making a fashion decision. But what you are-

Start time: 926.92
End time: 930.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Are you kidding me?  But you're making a decision. But the point- I think Neal-I makes a good point, which is-

Start time: 930.54
End time: 934.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  He's making a good point. He's calling me a racist.  No, he's not calling you anything.

Start time: 935.78
End time: 940.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_26
Transcript:  He's pointing out. And I think this is-  See, here's what I said. I said walk through the door, close it, and don't look back.

Start time: 942.26
End time: 946.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Why? Because I'm a racist?  Just keep looking at it.  You have a lot of nerve.

Start time: 947.06
End time: 952.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_26
Transcript:  I do have a lot of nerve because I'm right and you're wrong.  Okay. That ends it.  It's the argument for me to win.

Start time: 953.78
End time: 973.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I do think though that's very interesting to watch companies-  And Apple really is at the forefront of this. Technology companies realize that marketing is  a very different business in the 2010s and that it isn't really about speeds and feeds, bits and  bytes. It's about style and fashion and something that really has nothing to do with technology.  Is that what you're saying, Neal-I?

Start time: 974.38
End time: 978.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_26
Transcript:  Absolutely. I think the technology is evaporated.

Start time: 978.76
End time: 982.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And John and I come from the speed and feed side of the fence.

Start time: 984.20
End time: 1006.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I don't even know what that means.  I think the challenge right now, to go back to what you were saying before, Neal-I, is if  they can't deliver. Jennifer Lawrence is not going like, boy, I can't wait to use Ipay.  No, that's right.  There's a whole lot of people that are looking at Apple and being like, okay, I downloaded iOS 8.  My phone stopped.

Start time: 1006.64
End time: 1024.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean really, that's the thing that style insulates you from, is broken, bad technology.  Nobody's asserted that Beats headphones are great headphones. You wear them because they are Beats.  That's the advantage of this, is it insulates you a little bit from crappy technology.

Start time: 1024.50
End time: 1056.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Nobody ever bought a pair of Beats and then two days later, we're not able to make a phone call  because they updated the firmware out their Beats. Nobody took a bunch of selfies and then found out  their selfies were selling up on 4chan. Nobody's looking at Beats and thinking like, gosh, can I  trust my credit card here? Maybe nobody who bought an iPhone 6 is thinking that, but I suspect a lot  of people are. If your technology fails in a way that cuts you off from your friends, your family,  your business, then it becomes, may not be speeds and feeds, but it's bad for the fashion.  Nobody wants to buy a pair of-

Start time: 1056.24
End time: 1083.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_26
Transcript:  You guys are way away from the real issue here. You know what Beats are better than?  Absolutely better than?  What?  The headphones that came with your phone.  Well, that's true.  They are. Without question, they are light years better than that. Do you know what they also do?  They prove that you have money to spend on a fashionable, well-marketed, and quite frankly,  cool-looking brand. They look cool to a lot of people and they mean something to a lot of people.  Here's one thing I would bet. I bet Jennifer Lawrence is still using an iPhone.

Start time: 1085.07
End time: 1090.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm sure she is.  I would almost guarantee you that. She certainly didn't switch to Android because of this.

Start time: 1091.42
End time: 1159.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_26
Transcript:  You're collapsing a lot of things here. What I'm saying about the privacy issues of iCloud  and cloud services and Apple versus Google are deep. They are way deep into how people-  They're not too technical. Let me put it to you this way. I run a big website. 31 million people  a month read my website every single month. We do not put specs in our reviews. We don't put  charts of performance in our reviews. We tell people what it's like to own this stuff and to  be alive and to live in a culture of rapid technological change. That's all we do. That's  our thesis at The Verge. Everybody likes it. Our site is growing. All that means is that we have  to understand technology not as speeds and feeds and privacy issues and very granular issues about  how we're coding the stuff and where our passwords are going. We have to understand it as part of  everyone's lifestyle. To understand technology as part of a lifestyle means that we have to  start accepting other people's choices in technology. It's not being objective, but as being very,

Start time: 1159.64
End time: 1174.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  very subjective. Let's stop being objective. This is the most arrogant thing you've said today.  Actually, it's not, John. He's the one who said to stop being objective. You don't like the idea of  having performance numbers or anything? Is that you, Patrick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You know, at some point, unless you're buying a 4K monitor or a WQHD monitor,  it really doesn't matter at this point if you're spending much more than $200 on a GPU.  A lot of the people that are watching The Verge, The Verge is creating an audience for people who  are hungry for technology but are not looking for what Engadget or Gizmodo or Boy Genius support or  a lot of the traditional sites were. It's like they're going to talk about, okay, how many  milliamp hours is on this? Is it going to last that long? What they are saying is, hey, we took  this product, we went out, we tested it, and this is what it's did. How do you do that without some

Start time: 1209.18
End time: 1217.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_26
Transcript:  information? Just pointing out, I did run Engadget for four years. I have been in that crowd.  You've got the jobs. And you don't like that anymore.

Start time: 1217.30
End time: 1258.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, no, but wait a minute. I think Neelai is saying something very apt. And it's not Neelai's  fault, but the world has moved on from this notion of that it even matters. It's more about the  feeling, the emotional connection you have to technology than whether it even works, which is,  of course, to you and me, Patrick, and to John. It's stunning because we spent our entire careers  talking about does this better than that? Does this work better than that? And I think, Neelai,  I think you probably got your finger on the pulse of people as opposed to just, you know, I mean,  I noticed The Verge has gotten very much, no, it's very much more of a lifestyle brand than a  technology brand. Is it not? I think he will see us move very hard towards

Start time: 1259.06
End time: 1335.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_26
Transcript:  being a lifestyle brand. And the reason you will see that, the thesis of our site, and it has been  the thesis since we launched, is that we spent four years at Engadget, the core senior team that  launched the site, we spent four years there covering the explosion of mobile. What's the  screen going to look like? Are we going to do resistive or capacitive for touch? Are we going  to do IPS LCD? Or are we going to do TFT LCD? Are we going to do LTE? Or are we going to keep upgrading  4G? I have been in those arguments. I've had at every level of depth with those conversations  when we ran Engadget. And we arrived at a number of conclusions. And now all of us have a supercomputer  in our pocket that's going to do a broadband network. And what is more interesting to think  about is what happens now. Like, how will the world change around the fact that all of us have a  supercomputer in our pocket and not so much what is the best supercomputer? And the people who  focus deeply on what is the next supercomputer or how big should the screen be or what should the  touch technology look like, they're going to fall behind and they will always fall behind. And that  is the conversation about should you wear Bose nose-canceling headphones or Beats? Because what  you're really seeing is what people want to wear is good headphones that look cool. And I completely

Start time: 1336.34
End time: 1371.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  understand that. I agree with you. I've had the same conversation with myself. We are not going  to change. We're going to continue to do speeds and feeds and which technology is better. That's  fine. We've never aimed for a mass audience. And for the audience that wants that kind of stuff,  I think it's appropriate that such a thing exists. You're probably going to, you're already doing 10  times better. You'll do a thousand times better by targeting lifestyle. I'm not arguing with that.  I think that's a sensible thing. If I were in a business, I would be doing that. But I'm not.  This is what I want to do. It's too shallow. I don't think it should be encouraged.

Transcript:  Wow. That's called starting things off with a bang. John C. Dvorak,  Neelay Patel, and Patrick Norton. Twitter is often fiery, but it's always fun. And I think it's always  a great place to learn and to see what's happening. We've got more great clips from this year on This  Week in Tech. But first, a word from our friends at FreshBooks, the cloud accounting software  designed from the ground up for entrepreneurs and small businesses. In fact, I can say with some  certainty that FreshBooks is awesome because I used it for years. First discovered it about 10  years ago. In the intervening 10 years, more than 5 million people have used FreshBooks to run their  business. I was running up to Canada, as you might remember, once a week or once a month for a week.  And I had to bill the folks up in Canada for my time and my expenses. I used to do it by hand  with Microsoft Word and Excel. And it was just the biggest pain, so much so that many a month I  just would forget and not invoice them. And they started to get angry when they'd get three or four  months invoices all at once. So Amber MacArthur, in fact, told me about FreshBooks, and it saved  my life. It started with FreshBooks invoicing. You set up an invoice, got your company logo,  looks super pro. You can invoice by regular mail or email or both. That's what I would do.  They handled the currency transition no problem. In fact, that's one of the great things about  FreshBooks, multiple currencies makes it very easy for you to invoice in the currency of your  client. Of course, sending them by email meant I could put a pay me now button. And FreshBooks  has set up payment services with all the big payers. So it's very simple for your client to  pay. That means they're more likely to pay right away. It's just easier for them. That's why I  think FreshBooks users get paid on average of five days faster. They also, this one blows me away,  double on average, they double their revenue in the first 24 months of using FreshBooks.  It kind of makes sense. FreshBooks means you are doing a better job running your business  because you don't have to worry about the accounting. You don't have to worry about  the expenses. You can actually take a picture of receipts with the FreshBooks apps on Android and  iOS will make it very easy to do that. They'll even do time and hours. So if you bill for hours,  there's a little button on the app. You just start the timer and stop the timer.  If you've got a client that's slow to pay, they have automated late payment reminders. That  really saves on the awkward emails and phone conversations, I got to tell you.  I'm a big fan of FreshBooks. If you would like to try it, we've arranged a 30 day  no obligation trial. Go to FreshBooks.com slash twit, FreshBooks.com slash twit. It is so simple.  Your accountant will love you too because you can instantly access complete financial reports.  It integrates beautifully with all your apps, including Google apps, PayPal, Stripe, MailChimp,  Funbox, Zen Payroll. And if you ever need help, you'll talk to a real person every time.  FreshBooks award winning support is ready to help. Support is free forever. I love FreshBooks.  So does Anthony Taylor. He's the CEO and chief strategist at SME Strategy. He says, quote,  I'm loving FreshBooks right now. I've been tracking all my time and costing our projects  to track my productivity. You'll be a better business person when you use FreshBooks. I know  I was. Try it for you for 30 days with no obligation. Just go to FreshBooks.com slash  twit. Just do me a favor. When they ask, how did you hear about us? Would you please write  in this week in tech? And I will say thank you for doing that. FreshBooks.com slash twit.  All right. Continuing on with our best of 2014. Kevin Rose joined us along with Liz Gaines of  Recode. Patrick Béjar, French, favorite French podcaster. But Kevin was here the day or the week  after he'd been picketed by folks who said that Google was responsible for raising rents and  evictions in San Francisco. This is what Kevin thought about it.  I was so pissed off when I saw your Instagram post this morning. I couldn't believe it. This

Transcript:  So everybody probably knows there have been these protests in San Francisco. This week a  protester vomited on the Google or the Yahoo bus on it. Not a rider, a protester. There have been  all sorts of stuff. The feeling is, I guess, that the cost of living in San Francisco has  just gone through the roof, particularly the cost of housing, because of rich yuppies from the  Silicon Valley moving in, taking their fancy leather-clad Wi-Fi-enabled buses back and forth.  It's making it hard for San Franciscans to live. I got to point out the real reason for that is  because San Francisco is landlocked, it's actually waterlocked, and it's a small region.  The rules the city has created on creating new housing are so  prohibitive that just nobody's building housing. That's what puts pressure on prices.  Nevertheless, there have been these protests. I'm sad to say Kevin specifically is now being  targeted. Can I show this? You put it up on- Yeah, go for it. Share whatever you like.  TechCrunch had an article about it, but I saw it first on Instagram. Parasite! Happy face.  Already I'm starting to think this guy's nuts, whoever put this up. What's with the happy face?

Transcript:  Oh my God. Anyway, let me read this and I want to know what your take is on this. I'm so saddened.  Greetings, your neighbor, and then it gives you your address. So they're publishing your address  here. A man named Kevin Rose is a parasite. Perhaps not of you, but of us. This is why we  are here to reveal him for what he is as a partner venture capitalist at Google Ventures. Kevin,  you bad man, you, directs the flow of capital from Google into the tech startup bubble  that is destroying San Francisco. The startups that he funds bring the swarms of young entrepreneurs  that have ravaged. My God, you think they're like, what are they, eating the trees that have  ravaged the landscapes of San Francisco and Oakland like locusts. There's no more corn in  San Francisco and I ask you why? With each new tech corporation comes a wave of fresh techies  who on average earn four times more than a normal service worker. We are the ones who  serve them coffee, deliver them food, watch, I'll skip the next one, watch their kids and mop their

And she opened the door and they handed her a flyer and she's like, what is this? And they  start chanting and yelling and she just kind of like closes the door and locks it. And then  calls me up and I was down the street helping some buddies build a skate ramp actually. And  you see ravaging San Francisco. It was a skate ramp for a non-profit too actually, which was  like kind of screwed up. I knew you were raw bad man. So I came home and I, and I, you know,  walked out and they, they recognized me and they walked up to me and they were like,  hi, Tester. Tester's got home. They, they basically, you know, walked up to me and they were just like,  started throwing, you know, first it was like a lot of insults and then it was just like,  how can you live with yourself and what you're doing? All this, this bad for our city and,  you know, the entire thing on an Android phone. I'm like, you guys realize you're on the Android  phone. Like that's probably have an iPhone or something that's Google stuff. And I asked them  where they were going to post and they said YouTube. And I'm like, do you not see the ironing  all this? Like I'm serious. They did. They told me they were going to post that YouTube. Well,  YouTube, cause it's free bandwidth man. And the thing is like the thing that really gets,  it gets me at the core is like, I understand their frustrations. You know, I, you tweeted,

And it doesn't  even make sense. It's like, are they, there are certainly issues, but their issues are, don't  go back to Google or even startups or any of this. And I know you're sympathetic to that.  I wonder if these people are crazy. Are they genuine? You think, you know, it's, I think that

Start time: 2079.08
End time: 2131.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  they're, their complaints are certainly, uh, found in reality. Like there are some really shady things  going on here. Like landlords are kicking out, um, long time tenants and then instantly jacking up  the prices because they know they can get it with some of the tech folks that are making more.  And so people are getting displaced. So that's frustrating. You know, it's frustrating to a lot  of people. Um, so there are complaints to be had here, um, and, and a conversation to be had, but  I certainly don't think that, um, Google and some of these other tech companies are, are necessarily  at fault. I mean, yes, they are bringing in more tech workers, but I think that there's a lot of  good being done here as well. I mean, I certainly know what we do at Google Ventures and funding  tech companies and, uh, you know, we foundation medicine is one of our big companies that is  working on cures for cancer. And like we're, we're trying to like, it's not just funding companies  for the sake of funding companies. Like there's a kind of a bigger, bigger mission here. Absolutely.

Um, but you know,  there's no real concern here. My house is pretty locked down. I have cameras all over the place and,  you know, kind of created a little bunker here. So I'm not too worried about that, but it is,  um, obviously, you know, it gets your like stomach grumbling and your little tense and you're shaking.  Of course, my wife, Daria was, was spooked out by the whole thing. And it's, um, you just don't know  how, how far it's going to go. You know, right now, yes, I was able to sit down outside and actually  have a conversation with these folks and it wasn't aggressive. Like they weren't here to throw rocks.  They were upset and visibly upset, but they, they weren't like, I didn't feel at all like they were  going to start a fight.

So, uh, you know, I think there's a lot of  really positive, awesome things that are happening here in, in a bunch of different sectors. So I  think that, um, you know, this is certainly for me, it's just something to pay attention to. And  it's something that I think that, you know, I saw Ron Conway at the crunchies give a long talk about  how the tech community in general has to come together to solve some of these problems. And  I certainly believe that's the case. So, um, you know, I would like to take part in that conversation  and sit down with some folks that are willing to have a conversation, um, that isn't aggressive and,  and hopefully that, that will happen. But, um, yeah, this is home. So we, we don't plan on moving

Twitter is always an interesting stew, an interesting combination.  We try really hard to make that special recipe, that special combination. Coming up, one of my  favorite semi-regular guests, Jerry Pornell, the great science fiction author, along with Father  Robert and Jason Heiner. But first I want to mention one of our great sponsors, a company  that's been with us for many years. In fact, I think we started working with Squarespace  practically when they had just started out. Anthony Casalena had written Squarespace's  software in his dorm room to solve his own need for a great web platform. Today, they are the place  to host your website. The best web hosting. It never goes down. You cannot bring it down.  Combined with the best software to make really the best way, the best place for your presence on the  web. You've got to take a look at Squarespace 7. Their new templates are gorgeous, and it makes  getting started with your unique web presence so much easier. It's got a completely redesigned  interface, easier to navigate and operate. In fact, there's no more toggling between site manager  and preview mode with Squarespace 7. You actually are live editing on a single screen. You can even  preview to your designs. All of Squarespace's templates are mobile responsive. That means they  look great on any size screen, but you can actually see what your site's going to look like on a  smaller device, on a smaller screen in their preview mode. So you'll see how your site will look on  tablets or your mobile phone. They also include instant access to professional stock photography  from Getty, instant branded email setup with Google Apps, and templates. This is new, designed  for specific professions. For instance, architects, musicians, bands, chefs. If you're a band, take a  look at the Horizon template. The Horizon template includes features that bands really appreciate  like tour dates, music player, and a merchandise store. They also have a great developer platform.  Now, you don't have to be a JavaScript or CSS monkey to use Squarespace. That's the whole point,  is anybody can use it. But if you are a developer, you're going to love the developer platform.  It's the same tools that Squarespace uses for its own site design and code control. So this is  incredibly well designed. They have e-commerce on every subscription plan, on every template.  That means you have the ability not only to sell stuff online, but you can accept donations  if you're a non-profit or for a wedding registry or a school fund drive. Squarespace Help is live  24-7 right from their offices that they don't outsource. It's for people who actually work at  Squarespace, plus their self-help articles and video workshops too.

Our own father Robert Balliser and I discussed  the right to personal data on the internet. It all came out when Amazon let us know that  their Silk browser kept everything. Amazon has a browser, of course, in the fire, the Silk browser.  And he points out, Mike again, we should have had Mike on the show today actually. He points out that  the browser is governed by Amazon's privacy policies, which are pretty upfront saying, quote,  we receive and store any information you enter on our website or give us in any other way. And they  say, if you don't like it, exit the browser and do not install user access, Amazon Silk. In other  words, we're going to keep track of everything you do. And that's the way it is.

Transcript:  It's a different society. 20 years ago, if someone had had a case where they said, look, I have a  right to have all these companies erase their data about me, we'd probably say, oh yeah, yeah, that  makes sense. If it's your personal data, they have no right to it. We just had that right to be  forgotten case. And people are looking at it going, you don't have that right. If you're on  the internet, you're in a public space, you don't have the right to tell companies to get rid of the  data that you left behind. And it just shows you, we will accept this. As long as you give me  something, something shiny, Gmail, a better shopping experience, I will take invasion of  privacy as long as I don't think it's too invasive. And that two part shifts. What's too invasive will

End time: 2928.92

Transcript:  shift over the years. I mean, it's funny because we have this conversation on nearly every Twitter,  no matter who the panelists are. There's this clear sense that privacy does no longer exist.  As Scott McNeely was right, he said privacy is over. There is no privacy. Get over it.  And yet there is also this strong feeling we should try to fight for some semblance of privacy.  And I don't know what the answer is. I generally come down on the side of, I don't care. So what  if Google or Amazon knows everything I do? What's the harm in that?

I don't want to go this way, but I do have to point out that one  of the, in the, in the Facebook world, the post Facebook world, but you know, notice we have a  president who admitted to inhaling that the standards are changing. You're not going to be  able to elect a president who hasn't smoked pot or hasn't served porn. You're not going to,  you're not going to be able to hire an employee who hasn't got pictures of him drinking heavily  on Facebook because these, everybody, what will become apparent is everybody, except with the  exception of father Robert Bowser. Everybody does this. And so, so is that a bad thing? Maybe  you know, Javorak always brings up the, the, I think it's the,  the, the boogeyman of insurance companies finding out I'm eating too many donuts and refusing to  insure me.

That's true. And it happened low and behold, it happened by 1995.  Thanks. Thanks to Google. I see that. And Western civilization changed in 1990,  about 1990 when the wall came down. So it's now, except for China and North Korea and a few places  that don't have any internet things, anybody in the world can get almost any answer to,  get answered almost any question that has an answer. Well, questions like when was Leo born  and what did he have for dinner last night are questions that have an answer. But when, but when  did Leo, anybody who wants to know what you had for dinner last night could find out if they really

Transcript:  LO, okay. Well, here's the pitch. LO is ad free. They wanted to make an anti-Facebook,  a social network where they will never sell ads and they will never sell your information  to advertisers. And the idea is that they'll monetize. And by the way, some people were upset  when they found out, and it's not really clear in the LO manifesto, that they do in fact have  almost half a million dollars in angel funding from a Vermont venture capital.

Start time: 3376.48
End time: 3377.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Vermont. So that's whole lot.

Start time: 3377.58
End time: 3413.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, it's Vermont. They're probably wearing earth shoes.  But as somebody pointed out, hey, if you get venture funding, somebody's going to want an  exit. They're going to want you to monetize. The plan is that they will charge you small amounts  of money, a couple of bucks here, a couple of bucks there to add special features.  And that purchases basically.  I would prefer, I would love a Facebook that I paid $5 a month or whatever that didn't have ads.  One of the things that's great about LO, they don't have edge rank. They don't  decide what you see of your friends posts. You see all of your friends posts.  I think this is a good idea.

If you just look  at the newsfeed or the, or the discover tab, when you look at the comp, the at replies,  it's literally like, it's just the comment threads on a news article. It's it. That's  what sucks about Twitter.

Start time: 3439.82
End time: 3450.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, there's other issues too. 140 characters means people are, tend to be kind of cryptic.  So you spend a lot of energy trying to understand what the hell is he talking about?  And then you feel great.  It's like reading license plates. What?

Start time: 3487.80
End time: 3516.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_23
Transcript:  But I also know, but I'm not defending Twitter. I actually think that Twitter  does have its issues. I think the at replies are literally the worst aspect of the platform.  You cannot have a conversation in a one to many situation with 10 people or tens of thousands of  people. And I think that aspect of it is completely and utterly broken. But I do still think that the  140 character sharing content, you know, the real time information and the reason real time  works is because it's 140 characters. I think that that is still completely Twitter turned

Start time: 3522.88
End time: 3593.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to do L.O. then or then what up?  Oh, is the new L.O. apparently  my reaction to the L.O. thing, a friend of mine on Facebook was talking about it.  And I was just like, I hate new stuff. I'm just at that stage.  Well, that's because he's old.  And my tech adoption was like, oh, it's new. It's probably dumb. I don't I don't need it.  I'm going to hate because it's not what I know. But I think the reaction that it grew out of the  sort of spirit of L.O. is important. And this idea of their manifesto that users own their data,  that they're trying to position you as be making you aware, like reminding you  that you are being productized by the platform companies that you could give all this stuff to.  I think that's an important idea contribution to the space. And they don't need to take down  Facebook forty thousand an hour, forty thousand over a year for those people.  It might end up being very meaningful. And the idea that we have all sort of opted into by default,  not all, but so many, a billion into Facebook that defines what a social network is.  I like from a creative perspective that there's some other people out there saying,  no, it can also be this. So it doesn't need to be about taking down Facebook.  There is some value to creating something different from Facebook for people for whom that

Start time: 3594.08
End time: 3602.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_23

Start time: 3605.66
End time: 3615.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I do think that when new social networks start, they have one advantage, which is  that only us, only the insiders use it and we like each other. And then the real world comes and then

Start time: 3621.16
End time: 3672.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_23
Transcript:  No, here's the thing. I think I totally get it. But the reality is we like we have we make a  choice every single day to log into our Gmail and to all of these things and to our iPhone and to  and to Instagram. And because we enjoy them and we have fun, even though we know we're being  tracked, we're no ads are being put against the things that we're writing. But yet we still do  it. And I think that like, do I truly believe that the privacy problem on the Internet with  without a doubt, I have no question I've written a thousand articles on it. But I also think that  the kind of fact is already what's that? A thousand articles really, really? I'm privacy  probably. Go ahead, keep going. But I actually do believe that the ship has sailed. And I think that  you know, they're so part of the reason that L.O. grew out of Facebook was because there were people  that were transgender that weren't able to use their. That's why it got a lot of attention lately

Start time: 3672.26
End time: 3684.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  is that Facebook has been with its real names policy, making it very hard for LGBT people  to have a place on Facebook, because they have many cases real reasons not to use their real names.

Start time: 3684.76
End time: 3689.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_23

Start time: 3695.94
End time: 3720.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_23
Transcript:  So I completely agree. And that's so that's what happened. And then what happened after that was  a bunch of people went over there and people from the LGBT society, like the groups that went over  there, there's no way to block people. So what started happening is you had all these haters  that came on, started saying really negative and mean things. And they couldn't use L.O. because  there's no system to block people on there. So it kind of all backfired. Oh, that's interesting.

Start time: 3720.22
End time: 3743.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That point in particular, that's that's another thing I'd love to get to. When you start, I think  there's something that as much as Leo, your gripes and even mine about Facebook, like they  are mature enough to be experimenting at a whole nother level. Yeah, of course. And so like even  the idea of a managed newsfeed, like if they actually showed you everything, if you have a  thousand friends, say you have like friended people a lot over the years, it would be a horrible

Start time: 3743.18
End time: 3752.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Start time: 3752.70
End time: 3771.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So for a company like L.O. to enter this late into the game, what social networking mean?  But we've all been trained that it comes with these features. There's a reporting mechanism,  that there's a way to filter and to not have that from ground zero. Like the starting line,  I feel like has been moved forward. And we all think game. Are we really at the beginning of the

End time: 3807.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_23

It's hard to do an index of something that's growing  as fast as. Okay, so I think social networking, look how fast MySpace got disintermediated.  And look how much people hate Facebook.

I'm not saying they'll be gone,  but I'd be very surprised if Facebook is the dominant incumbent that it is today.  All right. Let's continue on with our best of in just a second.

Geo news came out just this week in the United  States that the Canadian Supreme Court had ruled that it was okay for Canadian police  during a traffic stop, during an arrest to look at your cell phone without a warrant.  Fortunately, that's not the case in the United States. We discussed it with legal expert Denise  Howell on this segment from this year's twit. I think this is very good news for privacy in  this country. Even if you have been arrested, the police still must seek in most cases a warrant  before they can search your cell phone. We know law enforcement actually has boxes they can plug  into your phone and dump all the data off of it. They do often routinely do that. But the Supreme  Court ruled Wednesday that you got to get a warrant. Is that good, Denise?

But yes, here we have the court actually really showing  good grasp of what new technologies mean and how they impact people's lives and the difference  between being able to search someone's pocket for a weapon or something else that might hurt  an officer during an arrest or something else that might be informationally important to the arrest  evidence that you could gather just by, you know, finding a joint. It's all on my phone.  Exactly. No, you're going to find lots of evidence on somebody's phone, but it's going to be stuff  that not only could convict them, that is going to be a lot of other stuff too. So the case was a guy

Start time: 4212.14
End time: 4278.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  who was stopped for a traffic violation. They, I guess, must have given the probable cause seen  weapons. He was arrested on weapons charges. The officer searching him seized a phone from his  pants pocket. The officer accessed information on the phone, noticed the repeated use of a term  associated with a street gang. At the police station two hours later, a detective specializing  in gangs further examined the phone's contents. Based on photographs and videos, the detective  found the state charged the petitioner in connection with a shooting that had occurred  a few weeks earlier and sought an enhanced sentence based on gang membership. He was convicted  then appealed. California court of appeals affirmed, but the supreme California supreme court  and the California supreme court, but not the United States supreme court unanimously. They said  that was unlawful search and seizure. So what do we need to do now as  citizens? If we are stopped by the police and they say, can I have your phone?

And then they throw the  whole thing out of court. Just Chief Justice Roberts wrote modern cell phones. I love this,  are not just another technological convenience with all they contain and all they may reveal.  They hold for many Americans, the privacies of life. The fact that technology now allows  an individual to carry this in his hand does not make the information any less worthy of protection.

And also like how he said that the term cell phone itself is pretty  much outdated and these are effectively cameras or journals or, you know, any sort of thing that  should and is normally protected by law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, so they are allowed to, they were.  It's just not the same as a pocket. Yeah. And they can, they can still, you know, the seat of your car,  your pocket, they can pat you down. You know, if the safety concern of the officers is always been  behind, you can go ahead and do a search incident to arrest. But if you're going to search a cell  phone, this decision says, you're going to need to get a warrant. And law enforcement was  not wild about this decision and fought it because they said, well, particularly in today's day and  age, getting a warrant is not going to be effective because what if someone just, you know, you've got  Apple, they've got this great remote wipe, Android does it too. We're going to have our evidence  destroyed. And the court, you know, really showed a nice grasp, not only of the nature of the cell  phone, but of how these things work in the decision. It talks about as to remote wiping,  there are means to address that. First of all, you could turn the phone off, then it can't be wiped.  Bear that in mind, law enforcement officers. And also you could use a Faraday bag. Would you ever  have expected to see the word Faraday bag in a US Supreme court decision? The fact that they know such a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  devices are commonly called Faraday bags after the English scientist, Michael Faraday. They are  essentially sandwich bags made of aluminum foil, cheap, lightweight and easy to use. And it's show  you then they cite the brief of the criminal law professors that was filed as an amicus brief. So  they're reading their briefs and they know what this stuff is. Or a clerk is. Yes. Yes. This may  not be a complete answer to the problem, but at least for now they provide a reasonable response  and they talk about that not only that law enforcement agencies know what Faraday bags are  and use them and encourage officers to use them, but they talk about the fact that a  warrant is a lot easier to get than it used to be too. And that unfortunately,  and that a lot of law enforcement officers can talk about, you know, can rely on like a 15 minute  electronic email response to a request for a warrant. So we're not talking about a whole  lot of hoops that need to be jumped through here. The daily dot says in answer to the question,

Transcript:  inadmissible. I got a good question from someone on Twitter along these lines. His name was Mark  Jones and he was sort of keying into the fact that not only do we keep everything on our cell  phones, but we have things like boarding passes. And in his particular case, I guess his insurance  card for showing that he has auto insurance on his cell phone and asking if you show that to an  officer on your phone, are you giving up your privacy rights to anything else on the phone?  I certainly do not think so. First of all, you have to be, if you are under arrest is the only  way that there could even be an issue about an officer's ability to search your phone without a  warrant. And just handing an officer an unlocked phone to show a particular item on there, I do not  think is communicating consent to search the phone. But again, you might want to say when you are  handing the phone over, hey, I do not consent to you searching the whole phone.

Transcript:  thanks to this most recent decision. And also a PDF of tips when confronted by the police.  The thing I want to emphasize, this is not designed to somehow get gang members off  because the police do have the ability to ask for a warrant, to put the thing in a  Faraday box. If there really is a crime, the police can pursue it. This is to protect  our privacy against an overreaching police state. And this is good. Tips for talking to the police.  I hope it's, there's a great long YouTube video by you should never ever talk to the police  that I refer you to without recommending it. I refer you to if you want to know more.  I certainly made sure my kids knew it. So good news, privacy rights are protected. What do you  think in the light of these two decisions? A lot of people were mocking the Supreme Court  in the Areo case saying, oh, they're clearly technologically out of touch. I actually thought  in the oral arguments, most of them, not all of them, but most of them were pretty in touch. Sotomayor  showed a real understanding of how this stuff works. I think she knew about Roku boxes in Netflix.  So I think that in this privacy thing, they seem very much in touch with what a cell phone is and  and why it's important to protect. They seem like they are in touch. Yes, Denise?

Start time: 4715.54
End time: 4768.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think they're more in touch than people give them credit for. I do think, you know,  you're talking about people in an older demographic who are still, you know, incorporating  these tools in their own life and trying to grasp what, how they work and what they mean and  and doing their best with it. And they have really smart clerks, as you pointed out,  Leo. So I think they do a pretty darn good job. You know, the copy shop with the library card,  is something a cable company when it's clearly not. They've got some hurdles to overcome still.  And it would be wonderful if we could get someone, you know, truly versed in what technology means  and how it works and the legal considerations around it on the court.

So at the beginning of the week,  you said on a scale of one to ten, Heartbleed is an 11, a very serious flaw. It's funny. We thought  this would be the week we'd be talking about XP exploits. No. Well, it turns out you never know,

Start time: 4793.56
End time: 4820.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_31
Transcript:  right? These things happen kind of at random. Heartbleed, you know, it was real interesting  because for a whole lot of reasons. One, it was potentially catastrophic. It affected  an enormous number of servers out there. And you can weaponize it with like three lines of shell  scripts. I had colleagues who were up and running and scanning and attacking systems within 10 minutes  of learning about it. Wow. So it was a big deal. It still is a big deal.

Transcript:  You were able to send a packet using this heartbeat technique built into OpenSSL a couple of years ago.  You're able to send a malformed packet that requests data up to 64K from memory of the  server, right? It's what it but you can't be specific. It's whatever's there. Yeah, it has

Start time: 4843.36
End time: 4883.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_31
Transcript:  to do with how the heap's working. And it's kind of random what you get, but you can query that  64K multiple times and you get different data. You don't always get the same. So if you're looking to  get everything on the computer, you just do it again and again. It turns out you actually  can't get everything. There are some weird reasons why some data comes and some data doesn't. We're  still exploring that. But potentially when we heard about this, you could basically grab everything  and it left no trace. There's nothing in an audit log that said that you were attacked,  which made it really scary and we had to fix it quick. Yeah, the fact that this has been around

Start time: 4883.10
End time: 4893.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  for two years, it's conceivable that somebody knew about it two years ago and has been just  pinging servers. How rapidly can you do this? I guess every second or faster. Yeah, you can do

Start time: 4893.96
End time: 4929.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_31
Transcript:  it as fast as you can. And it turns out you can ping the entire internet and see who's vulnerable  in about 15, 20 minutes, depending on your setup. Wow. So a bunch of researchers have been doing  that. And so we can watch the decay of sites that are vulnerable. We do know that we have good  evidence that before the announcement, nobody was doing a sweep of the internet looking to see who's  vulnerable. So we have data from servers, from honeypots that we've been able to comb through.  And I've seen no one use Heartbleed at a global basis before that. We have no idea if they were

Start time: 4930.06
End time: 4946.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  targeted attacks. But that's very good news. That means it seems unlikely that this is a  vulnerability known in the hacker community. They'd be scanning sites looking for vulnerabilities.  A targeted attack, well, you know, at least it's unlikely that you and I were a target.

Start time: 4947.18
End time: 4973.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_31
Transcript:  Indeed. Right. The good news is the hacker community did not know about this, it seems.  We started seeing scans within minutes of the announcement, but before that we saw nothing.  So that's the good news. The other good news is that subsequent research over the week has shown  that while it's possible in theory and has been done in practice to retrieve the private SSL key,  the master keys you're worried about, it's actually a lot harder than we originally thought.

Start time: 4973.94
End time: 4982.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's very good news. Because the concern was that all of these secure servers,  certificates have been compromised, allowing massive man-in-the-middle attacks.

Start time: 4983.08
End time: 5075.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_31
Transcript:  You're saying that seems unlikely. That seems unlikely. It's certainly possible.  Cloudflare is the company that's been leading this research. They've put up challenges.  One of the challenges was met. So someone did manage to extract the keys, but it's not easy.  It's not a slam dunk. So for the most part, what do you get? Passwords, logins? What are you getting  in these 64K chunks? You get the random cruft of what the server is doing. So yes, you get  password changes, you get web pages served. If there are credentials in the URLs, you get those.  You get random stuff. You get a lot of nothing, but occasionally you get something good.  And what we're seeing, and it's the obvious tactic from a criminal who'll be using this,  is you just scan everything constantly, hoping you get lucky.  Now, there's some good news on our side. Some of this stuff is hard to parse.  So it's sort of interesting to watch, and we don't know really what the effects are in terms of  enabling crime. And of course, it's now being patched. A lot of the sites are no longer  vulnerable. Now, vulnerable to the ping. There are any number of universities who are basically  auditing the net every hour and watching as sites patch their open SSL. Now, that doesn't mean if  they were compromised before the patch, they're not still vulnerable. They had to change their  key and their certificate. There's no way to check that. No easy way to check that.

Start time: 5075.88
End time: 5087.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right. So the initial estimate was about two-thirds of the servers would be vulnerable to this.  Is that accurate? And what is the number now?

Start time: 5088.86
End time: 5178.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_31
Transcript:  That is accurate. The number is probably 10% that, and it's skewed because all of the big,  popular, well-run servers have updated. A lot of the stuff that's left. I see a top 1,000 sites  that are vulnerable list that some university publishes, and the sites are getting more obscure  every hour that are still vulnerable. Are there any big companies,  though, that should have fixed it that haven't? I didn't see any, but I'm not going to  guarantee there aren't. It's an easy fix.  Like all of these patches, it's an easy fix. You install the patch. But closing the vulnerability  is a multi-step process. This is one of the reasons it was so nasty, is that installing the  patch is just step one. Regenerating your public-private keys are step two. Revoking your  old key is step three. Getting a new key is step four. I guess you can switch three and four.  Then every user on that site who could have had their credentials exposed needs to update  their password, which is steps five through a million. All of those things have to happen  in sequence. I updated my own website and had to go through all those steps, but for me it was  pretty easy. If you're a banking site, at a minimum, any customer who logged on between when the  vulnerability became public and when the site was patched needs to update their password.  And it might be nothing, but that's just prudent.

Start time: 5179.18
End time: 5182.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's prudent. And the good news is it's not a bad thing to do once in a while anyway.

Start time: 5183.12
End time: 5207.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_31
Transcript:  It isn't. But you know, we all have passwords that we rarely use and we remember. We don't  like doing this. But I think it's safe that if you didn't log into the server between when the  vulnerability was announced on Monday and when your server patched a few days later, you're okay.  So those obscure sites you haven't been to in a week or two, I think you're fine at this point.

Start time: 5207.48
End time: 5210.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And second factor authentication hasn't been compromised. Is that right?

Start time: 5212.06
End time: 5233.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_31
Transcript:  No. I mean, what's been compromised is the public key, potentially, although it seems unlikely,  and stuff that happened to happen on the server when someone did the ping. So if you got unlucky  and your data was in the heap at the time the bad guys did the scan, it was compromised potentially.

Start time: 5234.00
End time: 5238.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's pretty random though. And it seems unlikely that there have been mass compromises as a result.

Start time: 5238.88
End time: 5273.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_31
Transcript:  It's extraordinarily random. Mass is definitely unlikely. And it'll be individual. I haven't seen  yet anybody with any estimates on what sorts of crime has been a result. We know the hackers  started pinging this vulnerability as soon as it was public. So they didn't waste time. And it's  actually triply easy. What's interesting, some of these other vulnerabilities,  they're not in a computer to write to run arbitrary code. This one you can't. But this one,  you could really weaponize within a couple of minutes of learning about it. It's just so easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_31
Transcript:  So we're all debating this right now. There was a Bloomberg article that said two anonymous  sources said the NSA knew this for two years. NSA came out with actually the director of national  intelligence on his blog came out with a very strong denial. This is untrue.  Uh, you know, answer is we don't know. It seems unlikely. This vulnerability is so big and so  nasty. And I, the United States and other democratic countries, I think are so vulnerable  that it would make a lot of sense to the NSA if they found this to alert the community and get  this closed. I mean, it's, it's a bigger risk to us than it is value. Certainly the NSA probably  got a, an advanced notice of a week or so, like some of the big companies. I mean, they, I hope  they took it and ran with it and attacked everybody they could during that week.  Right. Might as well. Who knows what you're going to get. But that's what you do. Right.  They're good at fishing expeditions notice of, of Microsoft bugs that are being fixed the next  patch Tuesday. Right. And they just roll with them for the week and two they have that that  makes perfect sense. We want them to do that. I'm curious. I saw Google said that honey,

They're  not built with the same care. Then they don't. They're not as robust. So they're built as throw  away devices, yet they have these enormous vulnerabilities. And in the mid nineties,  we got a whole community to embrace quick patching and open vulnerability disclosure and all of these  things that made us safer. It's really hard to imagine the same systems working on these  on your refrigerator just because nobody cares very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_31
Transcript:  there's a commit log. And he's been interviewed and he's been, you know, he's, you know, I'm sure  really embarrassed about this. You know, it's not an indictment of open source software. It's an  indictment of software that isn't independently analyzed. And this could have easily happened  in closed source and proprietary software could easily have been thrown out there.  The problem was nobody was doing the analysis and any software open or closed needs to be analyzed.  Open software is more secure because it can be looked at by more people because it's harder  to slip in something of this unnoticed. But open source doesn't magically mean someone's going to  look at it. Right. Right. And this seemed to have fallen through the cracks. It was incredibly  pivotal, important, critical piece of code that's just being maintained by a few guys in their  spare time. Now, good for them.

But you could put that jar in an elevator and send it to space.  Send it to the moon. Send it to the moon.  A lot of science fiction has posited that instead of this, you know, the whole problem with space  travel is the Earth's gravity well.

The router is from a company called Media Link.  Media Bridge Products took umbrage at the negative review.  They do that.  Threatened to sue the guy for libel.  Got him to change the review.  Then Amazon weighed in and said, we are not selling Media Bridge products anymore.  Good for them.

Some negative review in an online forum like the Amazon reviews.  They get so thin-skinned, they sue you.  This is not a company that you want to do business with.  It's not killing them.  I don't know that negative reviews have that much impact.  But here's the thing.

Start time: 6259.88
End time: 6283.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Now I'm going to add the other side of this story.  What the Media Bridge company said is the review is libelous because he  refers to two facts that are not true.  One, he asserts that we are posting reviews, fallacious reviews of our own.

Start time: 6283.24

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But they are libelous.  So they actually have a case for libel.  And this is one thing that I thought was kind of interesting.  If you're a reviewer, you might actually be libeling a company if you say something  that is demonstrably untrue in the review.  I've always believed that too.  Be careful.  Because in fact, lawyers, when queried by Ars Technica about this,  said you know what, they actually have a case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Here is an interesting thing.  First of all, you have to apply...  It's invitation only.  That's obviously a marketing thing.  What a crap.  Yeah, crap.  But if you're an Amazon Prime member, $99.  And that kind of confirms what you're thinking, John, that it's really...  It's aimed at the...  Just as the Fire Phone was, the most avid Amazon users, the Prime.  So it's aimed at nobody.  I like that feature, by the way, the little Fire Phone.  Well, I don't know, Devendra.  I don't know about you, but I'm a Prime member.  Aren't you a Prime member?

Start time: 7685.20
End time: 7744.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  I'm a Prime member and I really like it,  but I think the failure of the Fire Phone was creating this thing  that basically was just to keep you in the Amazon ecosystem.  The Firefly feature is really cool,  but it's just an easier way for you to buy stuff on Amazon.  That's also a feature their mobile apps have.  So it's not unique just to the Fire Phone.  I've kind of lost a lot of faith in Amazon's ability  to create great consumer electronics  because the Fire Phone was a Me Too device  that was priced way too high for what it actually is.  Their tablets are fine.  They're okay, but they're still kind of bland and boring  and they don't have the full Google experience.  So they're not as good as other Android tablets.  I think the worst case scenario you guys are bringing up here,  that's not how it works right now, but it could eventually.  And that's terrifying.  I've seen a lot of startups that are working on  artificial intelligence technology  that could do what you're saying,  listen to what you're saying and kind of infer recommendations  and things like that.

So I don't know why I'm creeped out by this.  Jibo, the whole idea of Jibo, and it's more expensive,  is it sits on your counter and it looks at you.  No, no, here's Jibo coming up here.  Yeah.

Transcript:  And presumably Amazon's been working on this for a long time  because the idea of the voice recognition...  I mean, look, we've got Siri, we've got Cortana, we've got Google Now.  But those companies all worked on those things for years  with a large research team and a lot of smart people.  Where did this come from?  I mean, Amazon all of a sudden has voice recognition.  It had no product related at all.  So in that regard, at least it's impressive.  It is plugged in. It's not battery powered.  It does the same thing as your phone, though, does, right?  It does say connected to the cloud, so it's always getting smarter.  That also says...  That's not good. Yeah.  It really does play into this paranoia.

Start time: 7947.46

Well, she looks a little bit like her son, but it does see you.  And in fact, it's always looking, obviously,  because it wouldn't recognize you the minute you walk into the room.  You can talk to it anytime you say, Xbox, watch TV,  and it'll turn on the TV and all that.

I don't know why, but in every one of these shows,  we're doing best-ofs from the year 2014.  This is the best of 2014 for This Week in Tech.  The producers keep bringing this up.  See, I didn't think all year long, I kept hearing this rumor  that Apple was going to buy Beats.  That made no sense.  And for some reason, obviously they did, and I was wrong.  All the producers have stuck in these clips of me saying,  it ain't going to happen.  All right. I think I'm going to go out on a limb here.  Apple buying Beats.  This was the story that came out late last week.  $3.2 billion.  I'm not sure who had the story first.  I can't remember.  Was it the Financial Times?  Anyway, still no confirmation.  I think it's a bogus rumor.  I don't believe it.  Really?  Yeah.  I thought Dr. Dre confirmed it.  So Dr. Dre posted something on his Facebook that apparently  was a phone call and he said, I'm Rapp's first billionaire,  which he would be with a 25% stake in Beats,  added to his existing fortune.  He'd be well over a billion dollars.  Then he pulled it down.  Now, I got to tell you, Beats business is almost entirely driven by marketing.  It's bad.  The headphones are crap.  Oh, yeah.  The streaming music service has been a flop despite the fact  that AT&T has offered a family plan for it and aggressively marketed it.  It is a marketing driven business.  It has been from day one.  It's the name of Dr. Dre, the name of Jimmy Iovine,  the music industry, cache, the design, the styling,  and frankly, the huge advertising budget.  So they're not good?  No, they're terrible headphones.  You don't have any.  OK.  Yeah.

Admittedly, they have a cash flow of a billion dollars a year,  so a $3.2 billion acquisition is not an expensive acquisition.  Well, 3X sales is pretty high.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have to say though, maybe this is not a good deal or the right deal,  but I cannot for the life of me understand why a company like Apple that is so good  at so many things, particularly hardware that makes people go insane and want to pay  vast sums of money for their hardware and computers.  Their cloud services are the worst.  Yeah, they might as well have been invented by the Soviet Union in the 50s.  Except they're better looking.  But they are so painful to use and so awkward and they do such incredibly terrible things.  It's like, I don't know. I don't understand.  Couldn't they spend some of their $160 million or billion dollars to hire some people who could  figure this stuff out? It's just mind boggling.

Transcript:  I can't see Johnny Ive looking at Beats and saying those headphones  are the greatest headphones we've never designed.  It's not invented here. They're not great.  Nobody who likes audio says they're great headphones.  They're highly enhanced bass, which is great for rap,  but nobody thinks they're quality headphones.  No.  The kids like them because they got Dr. Dre.  It's all about marketing.  3.2 billion is coincidentally exactly what Google paid for Nest, a thermostat company.  So 3.2 billion is the new 1 million.  I guess. It's weird.  The other thing I'd point out is that Apple, most of Apple's $160 billion is overseas,  is offshore. And to spend it, there would be significant tax consequences.  They have to deal with that money and they're using that.  So if Beats were a European company, I'd say, well, that makes sense,  because they've got all this cash offshore and they can't repatriate.  But it's American company, right?  Well, we don't know.

Start time: 8456.62
End time: 8459.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_29

They bought their stake from HTC. Remember HTC attempted to use the glitter of Beats  to sell smartphones.  Poor HTC.  Yeah, that was a mistake.  It's actually what's really poor HTC. If they just held on to this deal,  that quarter was saved HTC.

Start time: 8539.88

Start time: 8557.84
End time: 8614.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  For service people actually like.  The thing that Beats streaming did, they bought Mog, which was a nice service that was struggling,  but they came too late because there's Google Music, there's Spotify, there's RDO.  Everybody's chosen. And I know this because the deal AT&T was offering, $16 for a family,  was much better than the Spotify deal or the Google Music deal.  So I went to my kids, 18 and 22, and I said, hey, kids, let's all use Beats.  Okay, dad.  No. They said, no, I like Spotify. No, I like RDO.  I mean, we're all using.  Maybe they're too old.  Oh yeah, if there were four, I could convince them.  Apparently, according to one story I read, 200,000 subscribers is not a significant number,  not worth billions.  I'm going to be the New York Times is confirming this.  The Wall Street Journal is confirming this.  It came from the Financial Times.  I'm going to be the guy that stands up and says, I call Beats.

And if you're wrong, it's like, well, just another.  I'm the guy, by the way, said two weeks ago, short Apple.  That was a good one.  That was a good call.  Fantastic.  I'm the guy when Apple said, we're going Intel, said, what are you nuts?  So don't listen to me.  So Matthew, you agree with me.  I like this.  This is a bad.  This is a kind of a bad bellwether for Apple, I think.

Start time: 8655.74
End time: 8670.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do, because as soon as I heard about it, even though I've never used Beats headphones,  I've never, you know, I haven't used the service.  It made me.  It troubled me that they would say that much for this thing.  That says to me, we're out of ideas.

Transcript:  So I have to correct myself.  The Dutch reach around.  You're right is something else.  What Apple used is a strategy known as the double Irish with a Dutch sandwich.  That's worse.

Start time: 8712.58
End time: 8732.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think we just brought Urban Dictionary down.  But what you do with a double Irish with a Dutch sandwich is you  root profits through Irish and Dutch subsidiaries and then off to the Caribbean.  And that's exactly what Apple's been doing for some time now.  The problem with doing that is they now have a huge cash stake overseas, but they can't use it.
