Start time: 321.00
End time: 357.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean if it's a fundamental if it was the fundamental flaw in how they do operations and they cover that up  I think that is actually illegal  But in terms of this case based on what we've seen them certain comments from Alex Thomas and others  It looks like this is an upgrade which has caused an ongoing memory failure which rolled over to various different data centers  But it's not a good look you know  14 hours is a hell of a long time to have a communication service that important take out taken out  And it wasn't just Facebook it was whatsapp and Instagram as well the entire shmiel and of course that merging those all in so  It's only gonna get worse if they do this again. I didn't notice

Start time: 359.40
End time: 388.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And there is one advantage of not having Facebook Instagram or whatsapp accounts  I didn't notice although Pavel Dorov who runs telegram. He was the Mark Zuckerberg of Russia until Russia  Forced him out and said we'll take that it will take it from here, and he had to leave he said that  Telegram in the 24 hour period that Facebook was down got three million new subscribers  so apparently you know that as as powerful and  dominant as whatsapp is

Start time: 389.32
End time: 392.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It well, they're gonna find those three million new subscribers on telegram

Start time: 392.78
End time: 401.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wish them luck because their security sucks does it really I mean we know that they say they do their role your own  Encryption which of course is always a bad idea

Start time: 401.24
End time: 407.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sorry compared to signal then the stuff that telegram is rolling out is just ridiculous, but honestly

Start time: 408.78
End time: 415.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does it matter I mean if you're used if you really want secure messaging you'd use signal you wouldn't use Facebook Messenger either right well

Start time: 417.85
End time: 436.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't have the app on my phone  I use the web the web stuff because some people still insist on contacting me on that  But I think if you're looking yes honestly at the end of the day for 99% of the population  Doesn't really matter right, but there's a point of principle to be had here  And you should support people that do it right rather than going with the easiest option

Start time: 437.34
End time: 447.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know even what telegrams doing is easy. It's just their own thing. I don't know I looked at telegram  I looked at I love telegram because but I love its user interface. I love the the stickers

Start time: 448.30
End time: 462.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love the way it works here somebody can read my messages, but if you look for the permissions  It's asking for I draw the line and it's the same with snapchat  You know they're asking for an incredible amount of data in return when you put stuff on your phone of course you are giving

Start time: 462.10
End time: 467.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A lot of way this is it we all live on who knows who you're giving it to and based on the conversation you guys had

Start time: 467.12
End time: 488.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Last week about four square exactly you know it could be going practically anywhere. Yeah, that was a little that was a little bit scary  I think  It's funny because really if you think about what Facebook does with a user base an active user base of over a million and a half  People it's remarkable that they don't go down more often the fact that they stay running is incredible

Start time: 488.70
End time: 500.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it was kind of interesting because like Monday night  I was buckling down to take care of some work, and I was gonna send some invites to a dinner and  10 p.m.. Right when I was doing it gmo went down for two hours, so it's like email went out to

Start time: 503.84
End time: 520.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's you probably more than anyone man have some idea of the complexity of running these massive networks and how difficult it is  It does seem odd that you could take the entire Facebook. What's happened Instagram network down?  With an upgrade that cascades throughout the network that seems like a fragile network

Start time: 520.84
End time: 526.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would love to read the postmortem on how they're trying to take out whatever the single point of failure was that affected them

Start time: 526.32
End time: 532.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, is it possible that this might have been you know part of the first step of unifying them all on a common architecture

Start time: 532.94
End time: 537.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's very like they know that's interesting. I think you think Mark's gonna move that fast

Start time: 538.06
End time: 542.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they need to move it quickly because otherwise they're gonna get regulation to hell and back

Start time: 542.74
End time: 545.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they were probably working on it long before they talked about it publicly

Start time: 545.50
End time: 609.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, people mocked me when I went back to Facebook after Mark's post saying oh you believe him  He's going privacy first, and they actually talked me out of it  On the other hand maybe there is some credibility because two of the top guys at Facebook just left  Chris Cox who joined Facebook early on he's actually  In some ways considered the number three at the company after Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg  He created the original news. Yeah, he's the guy to the work  and  while the you know announcement was very cordial mark which you know wish them well and said you know we've been talking about this for  some time the New York Times  Said they had talked to six people involved in the situation all anonymous that the differences between  Cox and Zuckerberg stemmed from Zuckerberg's asserting control  Over its company and its app Instagram, whatsapp and Facebook Messenger rolling out that plan  to a single privacy focused platform and that was something Cox

Start time: 611.32
End time: 666.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apparently vehemently disagreed with yeah, I saw these reports, and I'm kind of I  Mean two minds about this because if sucker bug has gotten to his head that he is gonna make this a privacy  or privacy sorry  Focused focused communication system. He's made some good buys in the last couple of last couple of months  He's got people from the EFF on board. You know yeah  He hired Nate Cardozo from the EFF to handle the the encryption for whatsapp  He's hired a couple of people. I think another one from access now  I can't remember the name, but if it's looking like this is serious. This could be a very very good thing  But I'm always tricky with anonymous sources hell  I've used them myself  But you know I want to see how this plays out because there's been a lot of stuff movement at Facebook in the last  18 18 months to two years you can read between the lines in Chris Cox's

Start time: 667.44
End time: 712.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Blog post about his departure. He says quote as mark has outlined. We're turning a new page in our product direction  This will be a big project, and we will need leaders who are excited to see the new direction through  Apparently he was not excited  Now remember these guys are billionaires  There's no I mean honestly if I were a billionaire  I might have to think twice about sticking around especially in the face of a complete product redesign  Well the other is departing executive is Chris Daniels who was a longtime Facebook executive who was brought in to replace  Brian Acton of the guy who created whatsapp when he left late  2017 Daniels took over on whatsapp so he's only been there for a little while  Daniels didn't post any any reason for

Start time: 713.40
End time: 729.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  With Cox's statement it was notable in that it said very little in terms of what the direction was that he objected about so much  But at the same time the guys made his money. It's not as though he's post economic now  So it's just like take a couple of years off take a look around is what's coming up and actin

Start time: 731.13
End time: 793.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who of course  Made billions off the Facebook acquisition of whatsapp he and Yannick whom sold whatsapp for 19 billion dollars  They actually depends on this Facebook stock price as much as 22 billion dollars for one app  Speaking at Stanford this week and told everybody told the Stanford students I  Didn't want to sell whatsapp, but you don't have the choice when you take investors. I was a minority stake  I had to do the right thing for our 50 employees and for the investors  We I really didn't have a choice of selling to Facebook. I wasn't happy about it  But that's that's the way it is and he blamed Wall Street  He said the reason we've got surveillance capitalism and companies like Facebook  Digging deeper and deeper into your private stuff is because Wall Street's  demanding those kinds of growth numbers and those kinds of  income numbers and  And he said you should delete Facebook. He says not gonna get better  This is the guy who has billions of dollars from Facebook you should delete it  Yeah, yeah  I'd listen to him and I did

Start time: 794.58
End time: 838.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  honestly, I still use it because you you have I have to get well, I have to  Well, actually it's not so much about journalism because by the time something comes onto Facebook is old news anyway  It's more about I've got family and friends in the US and that's what I hear always in on over and over  Yeah, and yes, I could set up an email pick up the phone write him a letter  Quill but the company's entire business model is predicated on something which is inherently scummy, right?  And it's just you know, I wish I can argue with that. Well, it's a brokeback mountain moment  It's like I wish I could quit you but you're still gonna but you can I have faith in you Ian

Start time: 838.40
End time: 839.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think you could quit well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 847.86
End time: 866.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Twitter at various times  But you know, you know my story with Facebook is I quit in like 2011 and never yeah  Never why did you quit way back when because honestly you could see sort of the writing on the wall. Yeah, right  I mean and it's all played out like that. So

Start time: 867.98
End time: 889.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He you know actin basically said there's there's no choice in Silicon Valley these days that  You you pretty much have to do what Facebook is doing which is interesting and I wonder if what this was Chris Cox's argument against  Going private on Facebook is you're not gonna make any money that this is gonna cut off your air supply to Facebook

Start time: 889.14
End time: 914.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm gonna say as a journalist the we saw a lot of media companies when Facebook made their pivot to video in  2011 think right we'll follow that we'll get some of this gorgeous stuff that's coming in and Facebook basically set the terms that  You're gonna get what we give you and  Then now you've seen with the recent recent buyouts of media media platforms are much lower valuations that hasn't worked  I would not trust this company further than I could throw it and I'm

Start time: 915.62
End time: 929.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I've already strength at all earlier this year Facebook decided to downplay news organizations in its newsfeed and more  Stuff from people, you know and your family and friends which is people you don't have to pay  Yes, well, you know, is that the reason because I thought it was just because that's what people want you long

Start time: 930.20
End time: 940.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know advocated that you know businesses should not should not build their online presence on  Somebody else's plot very on any platform that they don't control whether it's

Start time: 941.40
End time: 964.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm reading some of the money that people are making as YouTube stars Lily Singh who just signed to do an NBC late-night show  She's taking over for Carson Daly in the late late show  And she's like the number 10 Facebook earner makes something like 15 million  I mean YouTube earner makes something like 15 million dollars a year on her makeup videos and her Bollywood videos. She's doing okay

Start time: 965.56
End time: 970.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's doing okay. There's about 50 people out there who are doing okay, and then there's a really long tail of people

Start time: 971.38
End time: 978.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the counter argument to say, you know build your own somebody else's platform, especially if you're doing video  You know, you don't want to know that

Start time: 978.88
End time: 1003.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's probably the one you know one exception but even you know, even in that case, you know  either you know, whether it's Facebook or YouTube or or you know  I mean those are those are really pretty much the only two viable platforms  Hope to hope to get any kind of real traction and you know, nobody, you know aside from that relatively small group  You know, nobody else is really making any money except the platforms themselves. Yeah

Start time: 1005.14
End time: 1051.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean clearly you're working on  YouTube's farm on Google's farm, you know  Making what you can on the other hand some people are doing pretty well. She has 14 and a half million subscribers  It is kind of ironic that the height of success on  New media still is getting a job in old media. I kind of that's another thing I've invaded against for  Yeah. All right. Well, that's believe it or not the light stuff the heavy stuff  Well, you know great tragedy of course in Christchurch in New Zealand  49 and killed in an assault on two Muslim mosques by a madman once again  And the twist here is that he apparently streamed it all on Facebook live

Start time: 1053.04
End time: 1059.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I just saw today something one and a half million takedowns of that video being reposted in the last couple of days  Yeah

Start time: 1060.06
End time: 1073.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Bad enough that he streamed it and people saw it I feel so bad for kids who might have stumbled across it  but even though Facebook has  Tried to suppress it people are resharing it and yeah Facebook says  million and a half

Start time: 1074.26
End time: 1090.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Reshares Australia aired a portion of the video as I understand it the Daily Mail. It's just shameful  You know, we know that airing this stuff increases the likelihood that someone's gonna do it again and again and again  Yeah, it glorifies it yeah, so just shut them down

Start time: 1091.26
End time: 1116.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean YouTube also doing what it can to block them  but everybody it's there's there's something wrong with us these days in in this world and  People are really trying to reshare Facebook at least had some automatic systems that worked fairly well  They said they were able to block automatically 1.2 million, but that means 300,000 still  Got posted and only taken down after they were reported 17 minutes before it got taken down

Start time: 1117.27
End time: 1130.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it's  it just I  One of our guys wrote a very angry piece about this which I don't entirely agree with but there's got to be some  If you're going it's not enough to say you're a platform anymore. You gotta take responsibility for what you publish

Start time: 1130.68
End time: 1135.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How many live feeds are up there? How would you stop this? I don't know. I'm not sure you can

Start time: 1135.50
End time: 1174.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not sure you can proactively stop it  I mean if you're gonna allow live video, you can't really proactively stop it  You know unless you've got somebody watching every single one of those feet and you can't know with a million and a half users  but you know and  YouTube has made a huge deal about their content ID system over the last decade  You know and I mean certainly twit, you know has gotten burned by it on more than one occasion  Yeah, and and yet why is it that content ID could not find this and automatic and proactively?  Well, I mean fine the first time you're not gonna stop it  But after that once you've identified it, why can't it you know subsequently identify it and prevent it from ever going live again?

Start time: 1175.52
End time: 1185.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Like I have no inside knowledge  But just thinking a little bit about content ID and it's probably a batch oriented system, right?  They're not built for the it doesn't work for live as well real time

Start time: 1185.96
End time: 1195.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We know in fact that when we get taken down on YouTube live, it's a completely different process  Right, and I don't think it's content ID related. It's only on the uploaded videos

Start time: 1195.90
End time: 1212.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  so I think it is a solvable problem, but I don't think people have probably thought through like a  Clip going viral in 17 minutes and then getting reshared like that's it  That's a new attack vector that hopefully the engineers are working on at all of the major tech and I'm gonna guess that

Start time: 1214.16
End time: 1248.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The 300,000 that got through were edited in a way that caught that automated systems couldn't yeah  But I mean if it's not Facebook YouTube has the same feature  Microsoft has mixer same feature twitch from Amazon same feature  So there are many ways to do live video. It would be I think impossible  But now my fear is this is gonna become standard operating procedure for a mass murderer. Well fire up a camera and  And start streaming your crime and I that makes me so sad. I mean he very clearly prepared for this

Start time: 1249.02
End time: 1256.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He got the manifesto written. He knew where to in which scum site to publish up a publish it up on  Right. I was not good. Yeah, but yeah

Start time: 1259.78
End time: 1265.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And if you go there you get what you deserve yeah, but I mean he'd obviously prepared for this

Start time: 1265.50
End time: 1282.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  he was obviously ready for it, but  It's it's tricky with so much content coming in and the the ability to block it is limited  But I find it difficult to believe that a company which in its last three months  boasted a six billion dollar profit can't devote some

Start time: 1283.24
End time: 1286.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kind of work towards that. I just don't know what you would do

Start time: 1286.24
End time: 1321.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know. I think it I this is probably the first time that  Like could someone have anticipated this should they have anticipated it you can talk about that  But I think this is the first time we've really seen like dystopian science fiction in this particular  Manifestation and I think probably people at different tech companies are thinking right now about how to prevent the next generation of that  And so, you know fast forward three months  I think there will probably be better facilities faster facilities near real-time facilities. It's  But then the scary thing is yes people will go to different platforms if if Facebook or YouTube do well  They'll go to plenty of places to do it. Yeah

Start time: 1322.44
End time: 1341.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is there so Tali in our chat room asked an interesting question  Is there any place online for for videos like that? There is some historic value  He talks about World War two footage and so forth. I  Don't think so honestly  What's about the public's right to know or need to know and that kind of there's a very big difference between what the public

Start time: 1342.02
End time: 1345.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wants to know all public has a right for it. It's not only that but you know

Start time: 1346.64
End time: 1363.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's it's one thing to know that this event happened, but do you actually need to see video of it?  Does anyone actually need to see video of it? It's what you know  Recording a record record what happened, you know in written form video. Yeah  There's no there's no need for anyone to ever see that again

Start time: 1363.32
End time: 1391.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And yet there is a you know, in fact reddit had to delete two subreddits devoted to gore and death  Videos because they kept getting posted there. Yeah, this is something we want as humans  It's it's it's a very sad thing and I and I think you're I think you nailed it. There's two problems  Of course, there's a problem of a kid seeing it or if people shouldn't be seeing this anyway  It's the worst kind of violence porn, but there's also this issue of glorifying actions like this and encouraging action

It's a behoove every company to try to figure out if there is a way to block it technologically  But I don't think there's gonna be and I don't think you could blame a company when this  Misuse happens and it seems to me Facebook did as best it could do which is take it down as fast as they could  Once they found out it was going on and then block it as best they could  And I'm really sad to me is how many people were trying to reshare it  Yes, if you do that, that's just a press it, you know  Bloomberg Business Week's cover this week  features Mark Zuckerberg  Any less like an Android at that point looks just like data.

Transcript:  It's interesting though because like I remember going to a holiday party at Google in like  2006 or 7 and talking to a couple reporters who are like no you don't understand  Google's gonna be the bad guy and I'm like no that's impossible  Where's a good guy organizing the world's information and making universally accessible and useful and you know, it's inconceivable  And then at some point you see like the memes start to generate wait  Are we the baddies, you know?  I think one interesting thing is like it is important to note that I think there are a bunch of people at Facebook who are  Trying to do their level best to do whatever their job is whether it's connect people or create community or whatever  So I think a cover like that is a really interesting wake-up call for people to realize especially in Silicon Valley  Like the the wonderful golden days of before where everybody looked as tech as saving the world is not the same world that we have

Transcript:  And I think what's interesting is people in tech companies just need to wake up to like you can't just say I work for company  X and company X is making the world a better place  Therefore I'm off the hook like now  Yeah  Everybody has to think about their personal responsibility and think about where they want to be the best  To make changes in the world and maybe that's at one of these big companies and that's fantastic  Maybe it's not maybe it's the US  There's so many people I think who are in Silicon Valley who have not yet twigged to how people outside of Silicon Valley think

Transcript:  Do you think it's a natural consequence of being an engineer that you kind of have this kind of?  nearsightedness about you think only about how good it things  What you're doing is gonna change things. There is an inherent optimism to being an engineer  So and you fall for that and no one wants to think oh  God what what bad things could humans do with my invention? Nobody wants to spend time

Transcript:  Some of us do I mean, you know what? Well, I think it might be changing  I mean when I was when I was working as an engineer, you know  We we often you know one of the issues that we often had, you know  working for an automotive supplier and  You know our salespeople would go to the automakers and say, you know  They would hear engineers talking about some idea for some feature  We wanted to add to an ABS or traction control system and they go to the automaker and and they go and sell this  Thing that we hadn't yet developed. Yeah, and so I mean to to me and a lot of the people I worked with  There was always this kind of dichotomy between the optimism and the pessimism, you know, we're you know  We're doing these really cool things, but we don't want to put it out there until we're until well think it's ready  It's certainly but it and that was a very different attitude from what I see today

Transcript:  QA testers have always been. Oh, what are the what are those monkey apes users of ours gonna do to screw this up?  I mean, that's their job, but the people designing it I think are tend to be very optimistic that does seem to be changing  There's a lot more activism happening in companies like Google and Microsoft  remember Google turned  Decided not to do their search engine in China  Because engineers said no, we don't want to work on that  They turned down that ten billion dollar Jedi  Project that was going to be for I was a face recognition for the military

Transcript:  I did but they're probably gonna get it said it will do it and in a way I honor Jeff Bezos is  point of view which is well  When did it stop being patriotic to do to do work to support our military  But I also understand these engineers saying but yeah, but we didn't sign up in Hall and Microsoft's having this problem with HoloLens  There's engineers saying yeah, but we didn't sign up to create HoloLens so the military could use it to be more efficient at killing  and yet I  Don't think anybody would dispute that we need a military that there are defensive uses for this  It is this it is a long-standing tradition of American corporations to provide technological support to the US military  This is a very challenging time and a very challenging. So  Do you have friends still back at Google who have talked about this activism because Google really is where it seems like where it started

Start time: 1931.02
End time: 1961.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's it's interesting because I know some of the people  You know like one of the people whose name is on the walkout, you know is somebody that I know at Google  And and I think what's interesting is  Just the power that individuals can have by standing up and saying look  I care about this like the first person and the second person is the hardest but then what you find is suddenly  300 people have also signed your letter and then and then that gets people's attention  Yeah tech workers have a lot of power right now.

I've got I mean I huge amount of support for Elizabeth Warren in a lot of areas  She's done some fantastic work  But I think in this one it's more about getting publicity than it is about getting  Making a serious proposal. I I'm just amazed that she did it because this basically kills her with Silicon Valley  Yeah, these and there's a lot of money coming out of Silicon Valley  Not well thought out. Yeah, and I don't understand why she puts her heart such sort of half-hearted

Transcript:  There's all sorts of issues, you know, I think you know the proposal is put forward I think is probably overly simplistic  you know which you know for a politician is probably the right way to go because  You know, I think most voters are not gonna dive into the nuance of this stuff  You know, I think that there there are some aspects of what she's proposing and I think there's definitely some room for  Separating some of these businesses. I think there's definitely some things that should that probably should be done  I think you know kind of the sweeping approach that she put forward in that proposal is  Kind of going overboard and doesn't address a lot of those nuances

I think in the early days  There was always the feeling that that search should somehow be a priesthood should be above  the hurly-burly of commerce so that it can provide a reliable source of  Information it's hard to support it.

Transcript:  It's something the tech industry has done for many many years. And in fact, every industry does is buy up your competition  And we've seen this with Facebook and whatsapp and Instagram you buy up the competition you lock it down Cisco was famous for this  In the 90s with other networking companies. I do feel if you're gonna get free a proper free market competition  You've got to stop large companies from dominating the market. You've got to have a competitive environment

Start time: 3279.92
End time: 3311.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it's also super interesting that Facebook has deliberately  Pursued a policy and and like do things like their apps so that they can spot the newer stuff coming up before it goes completely  Viral like it's an interesting strategy as a company to say you can wait until you hear about it on reddit or you know  Read about it on slash dot or you can install apps that watch where the teenagers go or where whoever  Such as you can see the next property and then make a strategic decision. Do you want to buy against them?  Do you want to buy them? Do you want to compete against them all that sort of stuff? This is it

They just hacked in hard sort like selenium like pretended to be a web browser  you know just all these awful ways, but then you prove that out and suddenly you start to get the momentum and  You know, it's not to you cannot minimize the amount of work it takes to prove out the point but to see how much  Momentum that's gotten now is just inspiring

Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, but you see we've seen this in other industries  There was for me the most interesting keynote from the RSA to RSA show a couple weeks ago was Bruce Schneier  Who was saying basically it's not enough to complain that politicians don't get tech tech people need to go in government  It's our fault. Yeah and make it work  Now obviously you can't expect someone just out of college and in fact you wouldn't want someone just out of college  But when you've got someone who yeah, your company's just gone IPO  You're maybe not post-economic but reasonably comfortable  Is it gonna it a will it hurt you'd spend a couple of years in government service and B from employment situation?  Will make you more valuable and this is something that Schneier said was in the legal industry 50 years ago  The idea of doing pro bono public work was just anathema. Nobody did it now  If you want to be a partner in a major legal firm  You've got to have done that work and you've got to show a commitment and that's a cultural shift

Start time: 3516.56

Start time: 3519.48
End time: 3558.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and that under interview with with Bruce was really fascinating stuff and there's also this movement towards they call it public interest technology  Yeah, where?  Universities are moving towards this idea of like how do we get people involved?  So there's a brand new group called coding it forward where college students actually can apply to become part of the government  And you might say oh, well, don't they need to have a few scars?  But you know if somebody's willing to take that initiative, it's a totally different internship. It's a totally different experience  It's not just go to you know, pick your favorite company for three months you you I've literally seen somebody who thought they were gonna be a  Biologist and now they're like no I want to work on civic tech and government tech

End time: 3583.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And we desperately need them there because there's a huge skills gap  And I think a lot of people who go into go into tech are fundamentally  Ethical anyway, there are a few people who are just like I'm just in it for the money and you meet them and you just but  They're generally people. I mean we all make that  Oh, we want to make the world a better place  But some people already do and I think that should be supported and we don't we don't just need them

Transcript:  Need these people at the federal level we need them at the state and local level as well  You know at all all levels of government, you know, especially especially at the local level  I think you know that because there's a lot of a lot of big problems that cities are having to deal with I mean certainly  Here in San Francisco, but you know where I'm from in Detroit and Chicago and New York, you know to  to have people that understand, you know and have have some background on the technology side and an ability to  Vet some of the ideas that come forward and and be able to work and create these public-private partnerships  You know to deal with some of the some of the issues that are out there whether it's homelessness or transportation  Or or anything else, you know in a city  You know in looking at Detroit as an example  I mean Detroit's made tremendous progress in the last five years more so than you know at any time  You know in my decades of living in the area  But you know, there's still a lot of big problems to deal with  You know, you've got you know, like like a lot of big cities, you know  you've got a large population of low-income residents and you know, they have  Very different problems that are not going to get solved by just you know, throw them a smartphone and a Facebook app  And you know, I mean just you know for things, you know, like in Detroit for example  You know  It's estimated that 30 to 40 percent of the population of Detroit is underbanked or unbanked  I mean they have no bank account or or or very send. Yeah  And you know that means they don't have credit cards  They don't have debit cards which makes it a challenge  You know if you know say well, you know if the bus system is not working, you know, you use an uber or Lyft  Well, if you don't have a credit card, you can't do that  You know so and and that's not an uncommon thing in a lot of big cities to have a large  Portions of the population that are underbanked and then you know you go outside of the US  You know to other countries and in many cases, it's it's much much more so so, you know  There's there's a lot of there's a lot of these things that you know  A lot of the technology that comes out really seems to be aimed more at more, you know affluent  Citizens. Yeah, and so, you know, we've got to find ways to deal you know to help fix some of these problems of  Lower income residents to help lift them up. I think it's very very important

You need some balance in between  And you know because a free a pure market economy can only exist when there are enough players that you can actually have those forces  Pushing back and forth.

Oh, I think the fact that Google exists is fantastic  Yeah, and we've gotten huge benefit out of that and even Facebook as much as I despise it. There's been huge benefit  But we've got a brain.

It's  We've seen this with net neutrality  I mean Google wouldn't have existed without net neutrality MSN and Yahoo would simply abort faster speeds and  Drowned out what was in many ways a better search engine and now we've got some existing tech players who are just like yeah  Let's just get rid of that.

Transcript:  I think this is the conversation for the next five years that that we as a nation need to have  Absolutely, and it's an important conversation. There's no correct answer. There's no obvious answer, but nobody's got it  All right, but you we've got to figure it out. We've got to figure it out. All right, let's take a little break and then oh  I don't know. I think we uplifted it a little bit  So maybe we can go back down and talk about Elon Musk. We've got our car guy here. Sam will submit  He has lots to talk about  I have to say one of the stories that we were going to talk about is euro  As you know the euro deal the acquisition by Amazon went through and the euro founders are very happy to say that  They are going to continue to keep your data private. In fact, I think in some ways the attention that's been paid to  People get it because of this has really  Helped them. They're gonna be run independently inside of Amazon. Their privacy policy is not going to change  They are gonna keep your data private and it's I've been very reassuring to me euro is one of our sponsors  I use euro at home. I set my mom up with an euro and I still recommend it as the best mesh  System out there and it said to me. It's very encouraging that  They're gonna have Amazon's resources, but they are not going to be in any respect less private or less secure  In fact, maybe if anything more secure we do know that the the kind of single router model has failed us  the idea of you have this one router in the you know, wherever your wherever your  Modem is and it's and it's broadcast in the whole house  It just doesn't work and part of the reason doesn't work is because we now have dozens of devices  Using that router. I looked the other day on my ear. I think I have 68 devices on my internet, but that's not atypical  You've got Amazon echoes you've got nest thermostats. You've got the ring door, but all of this stuff is using your internet  So no wonder Netflix seems to bog down a little at night if you have if you are hearing that age-old complaint  Honey, the internet is down  You got to get an euro. That's why I got our euro and we are so happy  if you want an easy way to understand this is to think of  Bandwidth as light waves  And really is it's electromagnetic radiation Wi-Fi waves don't go through walls. Well  So you would never ask a light bulb in your living room to light the whole house to light up the master bedroom  What you need is a distributed system. It's what we've been using in business for years  But it'll with a lot of expense and a lot of work and we have a professional IT team that's managing it now  You can get an enterprise Wi-Fi installed in your house in a few minutes. The euro app makes it makes it easy  You could do it yourself. The euro app is fantastic. It lets you manage your network in your hand  You'll know exactly what's connected at any given moment the internet speeds you're getting from your net service provider  It runs an automated test every night. It's easy to create and share a guest network. That's secure  You know, you can let guests on your network, but not get access to your other stuff  WPA to encryption euro has said incidentally that they're going to add  WPA 3 and software when that comes out. It's just fantastic  I think the updates alone are a huge part of what makes euro great. You're always running the latest secure  Firmware without having to pay any attention to it at all and the customer support is just as good  You can call and get a Wi-Fi expert within 30 seconds  I turned on euro plus and I'm really happy about that too. In fact, I've got it right here if I go to my euro plus  one of the things  The euro plus does for me is it gives us advanced security?  So not only do I keep the teenager safe because I block adult sites and violent sites  Don't put up my URL history I can I can see the safe the safe filters are on for Michael right safe search  We block adult a little legal and criminal or violent and yeah, you're right  I can go in there and see what sites Michael tried to get to I won't I won't embarrass him  Add blockings turned on and that's a beta advanced security, which is great blocks fishing  Email blocks malicious content blocks payloads. That's great. You get a lot of freebies in addition to your euro plus  Subscription so you get really complete protection for your network your devices and those who use them as they connect to the internet  it's got a database of  millions of known threats so euro plus prevents you from  Accidentally or even on purpose going to malicious sites. Let's see. Hey good news this week didn't have to block any threats  Let's see if there are any. Oh  There was one day Michael's phone went to 17  Dangerous sites now. This isn't adult sites  He was probably trying to download some fortnight hack or something like that, right?  Researching the beta or he was researching beta. He was that cult of the dead cow  How do I apply and we blocked that as we as we ought to I have to say it's a good thing  Beto's family did not have an euro because that he would have been out of luck  I I am just a huge fan of the kind of control I have in the information I have I know exactly  What's going on in my network and what's great is I can switch networks and I could see my mom's network  Way across the country and if mom has trouble with her internet see she's a little bit simpler network six connected devices  Not as much IOT stuff going on  But mom did have an out a little studio out back and so it was hard for her to get the internet out there  So I put an additional euro beacons to extend it out there and that's been working great  I just I just love the euro never think about Wi-Fi again get $100 off the euro base unit  That includes two beacons and a year of euro plus 100 bucks off when you go to  Eero.com slash twit and use the code Twitter check out euro.com slash twit the checkout code is  TWI

Mr. Musk's February 19th 2019 tweet  Mr. Musk did not seek pre-approval for any of his Twitter communications, which he's supposed to do what?  Yeah, which is anything that is remotely material. He's supposed to get approval  So they acknowledged in that in their response to the contempt petition that he did not request pre-approval for any of his tweets  So, you know clearly he's completely flaunting  You know the agreement that he signed and also paid 40 million dollars in fines for

Start time: 5032.70
End time: 5051.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That should be the headline and his successes should be the headline right but he keeps undermining himself by opening his mouth or you know  Yeah firing off tweets and then he's enabled by people like Jack Dorsey who called him, you know  He's the best Twitter user out there. Yeah, Jack Dorsey the CEO. Oh, I'm sure Twitter loves him

Start time: 5051.66
End time: 5088.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, quite sure he does but you know, I can forgive Elon Musk a lot because SpaceX really has  Revolutionized orbital delivery in a way that would never have happened  Otherwise on the other hand he needs to stop being quite so stupid with his cleverness  You know  he really needs to dial it back a bit and  Maybe just think about the interests of his companies rather than might need to shout out about stuff but coming back to the new car  Isn't this just what Detroit's been doing for ages? It's just like yeah  Here's our new Chevy something with exciting new wing mirrors and yeah exactly  It's no it's no different from what any other automaker does, you know every week

Is there something going on in the world?

Start time: 5124.42
End time: 5224.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think in Elon's case, you know part of it goes back to you know, his experience in the 90s  You know in the early 2000s  With X or you know with zip to and then with especially with PayPal, you know where he he kind of got pushed out of PayPal  and  He has resented that ever since you know after his experience at PayPal after the buyout and then he got he got pushed out  He you know, he made a commitment to himself and Ashley Vance talks about this in his biography of him  You know that he never wanted to relinquish control of anything that he did ever again  He he did not want to be pushed out again, which is why he  You know, he retains such a large equity stake in both SpaceX and Tesla, you know  like twenty-two twenty-three percent of both of those companies and  But in order to do that because he's had to raise so much capital  He has had to borrow huge amounts of money personally in order to every time they sell shares to buy up a bunch of those shares  Himself in order to keep from his stake getting diluted so he doesn't lose control  So he you know, he's he owes  Banks he personally owes banks not the company but he himself owns owes about eight hundred million dollars  for  Money that he has borrowed to buy Tesla shares every time that they have sold shares over the last several years  And you know that puts even more pressure on him because you know, he's heavily leveraged. He's heavily leveraged. He's apparently  pledged about almost half of his stake in Tesla as  Collateral for those loans and if the price drops too low then in some ways I respect him for this though

Start time: 5224.88
End time: 5229.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 5230.04
End time: 5240.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You've got to respect that much, you know, the problem is that he's not a good manager  He's got amazing ideas, but he's a terrible manager. He should not be running the company on a day-to-day basis

Transcript:  Same thing about Steve Jobs, which is part what why you needed someone like Tim Cook  Yeah

Start time: 5252.80
End time: 5324.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean the difference between jobs and Musk is that when jobs came back to Apple in 97  He was self-aware enough to realize okay  These are the things that I care about and that I'm good at right and all this other stuff  I don't care about and that's why he brought in people like Tim Cook and and you know  a lot of a lot of the other staff and promoted the people from within that that he thought could do those jobs and gave  Them that responsibility he oversaw it but he was he did not micromanage all the operations stuff like Elon tries to do  Elon thinks he can do it all himself, which is why everybody keeps bailing out of the company  They can't work with the guy. So that's you know, that's that's a fundamental problem. But I mean Tesla, you know, I  You know, I'm often very critical of Tesla, but I think Tesla deserves enormous respect and credit for  Making the idea of the modern electric car a viable concept  Absolutely to make you know to make people realize hey, you know, this actually can work  You know, we can we can use EVs as our daily drivers  It doesn't have to be just a glorified golf cart  Yeah, and for that, you know Tesla, you know, whether they they survive or or fail, you know  They deserve respect and credit for that.

I thought newsfeed was the right thing to do and everybody else said no, but I believe right  yeah, and therefore like I'm gonna believe in my own ability to affect change and  Elon has been right about some very big bets  But man, wouldn't it be great to have you know, some high emotional intelligence billionaires who?

That's when you need adult supervision. Yeah, you need somebody more rational  You know and at some point, you know, it's you know, the company's got to grow up or or flame out  Yeah, you know and I hope you know that Tesla doesn't flame out, you know, but yeah  Because they have done a lot of good  But I don't think that they I don't think that as long as if Elon stays in place  I think that it's gonna be bad for the company as a whole

Transcript:  Well, the speculation is Google has already demonstrated a streaming gaming service. Remember you could play  What was that the Odyssey game  Assassin's Creed Assassin's Creed  Odyssey on a Chromebook in a browser. I didn't get into the beta but apparently it was pretty good  this is this is  Was a demo or a beta of something Google's expected announced called project stream and they're partnering with  Ubisoft the publishers of Assassin's Creed  They also hired a very well-known  Game producer programmer founder of motive Studios Jade Raymond. She's now a Google vice president  So that's a huge hire. That's the kind of hire you you'd make if you're gonna start a gaming  Service so it's expected that they will announce the public unveiling of project stream  There are some rumors that they might even do a console. Although to me that's the opposite of what project  Project stream is about using low-end software or I'm sorry low-end hardware  Like an Android TV like something like the shield  to play triple a games  Yeah, right

Start time: 6030.26
End time: 6039.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's yeah, I mean a chromecast type model for this could work very well  I mean they need new areas to get into this looks it plays to their strengths like you

Start time: 6039.14
End time: 6069.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think a console is gonna be in the game. You know, I'm like angle maybe but you know what when on live  Tried to do this, you know, they had to have over the first they had to build out their  Capacity for whatever their peak load was gonna be, you know, and they they didn't have to do it for all that  Yeah, you know, so they you know, it ended up costing them way too much money  Google on the other hand, you know, it's probably got more than enough extra capacity sitting in the couch cushions  So to speak, you know that they could run something like this alongside all the other stuff that they do

Start time: 6069.86

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wouldn't be surprised if they came out with something to go up against which with as well  Amazon on Twitch. Yeah, Microsoft has mixer. Yeah, so I don't know has YouTube YouTube  But YouTube it doesn't seem to be as popular with the game streaming things as other platforms  So maybe they're doing when you push in that area  I mean the fact of the matter is gamers will spend a lot of money  Which is what you really really want from a customer base, but is that why Google's doing this?  I think it's Google's next big thing, you know, I feel like for instance the example

Transcript:  I give is Microsoft's HoloLens, which clearly looks like a product by itself  But at their most recent HoloLens to announcement it it became clear that really what this was is a demo of Azure  Services that that it was a piece of hardware that had its own merits and its own use in enterprise  But really that the power of it came from Azure and in fact  It's being branded as an Azure service and I wonder if this is a way of good for Google to show how great their cloud

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what actually it turns out one of the most challenging parts of building an automated driving system is like you have  The top the first part of the stack is the perception  That's where it's taking in all the sensor data and trying to classify. Here's all the objects in this field of view  Okay, so you get that once you've classified those objects. The next step is the prediction  You have to figure out what those objects are gonna do next  And then then that feeds into the path planning  the for things like vehicles other vehicles on the road, you know physics to some degree are gonna limit the  They're gonna put some constraints on on how much those you know, what?  It's moving at this problem is pedestrians  Yeah, understanding what pedestrians are gonna do and as humans are always the weak link in any way we usually are but  But we're actually, you know, our brains are actually remarkably good at you know  Detecting subtle nuances subtle motions, you know and reading body language and from that inferring what people are gonna do next  I mean think about walking through a crowded train station and you know, your your eyes are always scanning, you know  And think think about how infrequently you actually bump into other people  You know, it's amazing the flow through there is phenomenal. And so there's never driven through an Indian roundabout  I've seen video of it. I've not actually done it but holy cow  Yeah, but you know, there there's companies that are now focused, you know companies that previously were thinking about trying to do the full  AV stack they're now focused on very specific problem sets like predicting what the humans are gonna do and  There's one startup out of Cambridge called perceptive automata that they're they're doing they're taking video clips  it's recorded from cars driving down the road and  Slicing it up into tiny pieces and they're having  Having the pedestrian or having Pete having groups of people look at those clips those short clips and labeling them to  You know say okay. What do I think it's gonna do next and  Yeah, and then from there  You know using that to train the neural networks for the for the prediction engine  So and there's all kinds of interesting approaches out there

Transcript:  This episode of twit brought to you by I love this company thousand eyes  This is a great success story thousand eyes was started by some UCLA graduate students  They were doing research on networks and how networks  Worked and where networks didn't work and how to detect where problems occurred in networks  They they got a grant to do this. They came out with some very interesting results  In 2010 they found it actually were mo hit lad who is the CEO now and Ricardo Olivera  we're working in the UCLA internet research lab trying to  visualize autonomous system topologies  they got a half million dollar grant from the National Science Foundation and then they founded a company and today  Thousand eyes is the best way to know what's going on in that puffy little cloud. We call the internet  There's a reason engineers draw the internet like a cloud  Stuff goes in something happens and then it comes out maybe and it's hard to know what's going on in the cloud unless  You have thousand eyes you can get an immediate unmatched view of all the networks and dependencies  That impact your customers digital experience with thousand eyes if you're sitting there and you're looking at your network  And you know you're delivering content or you're delivering apps or you're delivering data and you're wondering or you're just using the cloud  And you're wondering what's happening? Why is it so slow?  Thousand eyes can tell you it's like you've been looking through a  Smudged window and then thousand eyes comes along and it's I can see  Cloud is great for business. We're all moving to the cloud  But you know when you gain agility you increase risk and the thing that really bothers a lot of companies you lose control  And when your cloud app or services down, do you know what's going on? Do you know what went wrong?  You're scrambling to figure it out, but money's going out the door your productivity has gone down  Your brand image is going down. You need a quick  Fix you need to be able to see into the entire service delivery path from the cloud to your end user  including all those portions you don't own or control like Google or Amazon or  thousand eyes  Gives you a view you've unlike anything you've ever seen before its cloud-based software  It's built specifically to help organizations do the cloud right?  They have a massive array of vantage points and they are everywhere  Cloud providers the global internet even down to the Wi-Fi in your local coffee shop  This is not passive old-school IT monitoring, which is essentially siloed  You only see what's going on in your data center thousand eyes unique path visualization technology extends beyond any boundaries  Letting you see understand and fix even improve the experience for all of your apps your services your website  This is an amazing solution, and it's a great way to for instance choose the right cloud for your needs  To connect to the right SAS instance to see issues before they impact you your customers and your employees  Top banks use it enterprises use it SAS companies use it the world's fastest  Best brands are using thousand eyes software to do the cloud and do it right  You got to check it out go to thousand eyes comm slash twit  Here's a little booklet you can get there and give to the boss  You don't want to challenge them with too much technical detail you can give them this five cloud migration challenges  You shouldn't ignore, but it's a great way to open the conversation boss  We need thousand eyes so that we know what's happening up there in that puffy little cloud if the cloud is important to you  In in the future or today you need thousand eyes go to thousand eyes comm slash  twit thousand eyes comm slash twit  Thousand eyes thrive in a connected world. It's a great  Story the thousand eyes story and mohita is really a neat guy and fascinating and boy do they know what's going on out there  Verizon is gonna launch 5g service in Chicago and Minneapolis  Yeah, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's gonna be so long before we have any significant amount of 5g  I got really irritated last week. I was listening to  Peter Kafka interview Randall Stevenson CEO of AT&T  Yes, and the first question he asked him was why do we need 5g make the case for 5g?  The first thing out of Stevenson's mouth was we needed to enable autonomous cars  Because you know with 5g with no latency  We'll be able to take all that  expensive computing hardware out of the car and move it into the cloud and control them that way and  As somebody who spent a good part of my career working on electronic control systems for cars as an engineer  I was just flabbergasted

Start time: 7653.90

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't know you don't need 5g for that. Okay. What you need is any kind of vehicle to vehicle connectivity so cars communicate  Intent to each other right but you can do that now over DSRC, which is basically a flavor of Wi-Fi or  With CV to X which is just is there a stand down LTE. Yeah, there is. Okay good and  So I mean Cadillacs already got some cars out there that have this in there and  Toyotas got him in Japan and they're bringing it here to the US in a couple years  But what Stevenson was talking about was doing all of that computing, you know taking the sensor data  To the cloud and then and then these cars are generating four terabytes a day  I was gonna say given that you could have silver the boot for goodness. Yeah  Drive five minutes away from here. Yeah, and I have zero signal zero bars of any kind  That's right. Yeah, you know and and we're you know, a half an hour from San Francisco  So, you know unless they can get universal connectivity everywhere 5g is not gonna be the answer

Start time: 7734.76
End time: 7746.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're gonna take that out because that has been often been a selling point  We will not mention autonomous vehicles now really what it why do carriers want 5g?  Is it a is it a moneymaker for them? They hope it will be yeah

Okay, and basically you've got big problems with it's a big country  There's lots of areas where it's difficult to explore this stuff  But 5g for it to work  You've got to have an amazing number of base stations around to even get through the interference

Start time: 7834.22
End time: 7862.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, if you're doing millimeter wave 5g, it's only got a range of a couple of hundred meters  Right and which again going back to the car thing if you're even if the latency on any given base station is near zero  Is like, you know one or two milliseconds, you know, that's that's not really enough to do real-time control anyway  But if you're constantly handing off every time you're doing a handoff as you're going, you know  A couple of blocks that's gonna add new problems in there and there's gonna be dead spots in there
