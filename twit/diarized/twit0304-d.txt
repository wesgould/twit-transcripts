Start time: 198.08
End time: 224.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah well these are, it was interesting in regards to the fact that Ford has got  their, I don't know, I think they've gotten a little crazy with this futuristic stuff  but this is, you know, probably a lot of the fallout from it will be handy  but these are talking cars but you know every time I mention to somebody it's like  it's not that these are cars that talk to you.  These are cars that talk to each other, they talk to the highway.  That's good.  They talk to the police department, they do all these things.

Start time: 224.88
End time: 228.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 241.22
End time: 269.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah so it's a communicating car and it talks to all kinds of...  So for example, in a perfect world where everything was tuned to these cars  the car would be driving along and there would be another talking car in front of it  and the car in front of it would talk, you wouldn't know this,  you'd fall asleep at the wheel and your car would talk to the other car  and say hang on because I'm going to hit you.  That's great.  Or it would slam on the brakes and stop you from hitting the guy.

Start time: 269.80
End time: 278.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See I see what's going on here which is Ford wants to make autonomous vehicles  or move a step towards it but they don't want to say autonomous vehicles.  No they don't.  They would have called it smart cars a few years ago

Start time: 278.96
End time: 281.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  but they've smart so lame now nobody would call it that.

Start time: 281.90
End time: 294.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no they made a point that they don't want autonomous cars.  They say that the driving experience is important  and people don't really want autonomous cars.  They want everything handled but they still want a driver behind the wheel.

Start time: 294.72
End time: 299.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well I think people aren't yet comfortable with the notion  that a car would be driving itself.

Start time: 299.56
End time: 311.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well I'll tell you I rode in that Google car that drove itself.  Did you ride in that?  The self-driving car?  Not only did I ride in it I also stepped in front of it  in a crosswalk with only 20 feet to go at full pace.  You've got to talk to George Stephanopoulos

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As testament to that you're here.

Start time: 340.70
End time: 362.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I wouldn't, just to finish the thought, sorry John,  I wouldn't be comfortable having a self-driving car  but where I really saw its functionality is  in situations as John's describing where people fall asleep  or you look away to text and it's got your back.  If it's only for five seconds,  I'm not saying that condones texting but people do it.  Right.  Or look at the GPS or something.  So sorry John, go ahead.

Transcript:  The problem is they say that their infrastructure  is nowhere to be found because they need smart highways  and this is never going to happen.

Start time: 385.09
End time: 393.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, right.  Because they're not just talking to other cars.  They need to talk to the highway  because they need to know where the road is and all that.  It's not what Google says.  Google says they don't need it.

Start time: 394.20
End time: 396.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They can do it off existing materials.  Sorry John.

Start time: 398.27
End time: 415.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The only thing that's going to come out of this  is they're going to have black boxes in all the cars.  Once a year when you get your car smogged in California,  you're going to bring your black box in,  they're going to look at it  and you're going to get 15 retroactive tickets  from local police departments.  That is exactly what's going to happen.  They don't want to talk about that.  I think you're right

Start time: 416.29
End time: 424.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  because we've already got red light cameras.  This is just the logical next step.  You ran a red light on July 15th.  You were going over the speed limit on July 23rd.

End time: 434.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, he's been talking about it.  It's not a conspiracy.  They're already talking about this being implemented  by police departments around the country.  Insurance agencies?

Start time: 435.88
End time: 439.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That would worry me more.  Lawyers, absolutely.  They'll subpoena that information in a heartbeat.

Start time: 440.08
End time: 444.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If the information exists, it will be subpoenaed.  Yeah.  We'll see whether you get retroactive tickets.

Start time: 444.76
End time: 451.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  With all these municipalities running out of money,  they're looking for any sort of revenue stream  and this is a beauty.  Gautam in the chat room has a great name for it.

Start time: 464.09
End time: 475.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you start reading police blogs and municipal blogs,  there's a discussion about black boxes.  It's all over the place.  Has it been on law and order?  If it hasn't been on law and order, it's not close.  Both cars have had a black box in them since 2006.  All of these cars have the black box in them

Start time: 476.00
End time: 489.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and the teenagers have the little plug-in things  that can tell you a lot about what's been going on.  If they recorded, would record speeds and so forth.  But they'd also have a GPS.  They need to have a GPS built in so they know  they could match the coordinates and so forth.  I don't know.

Start time: 490.98
End time: 501.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Have you also seen these cameras for teenagers?  Yeah.  So the ones where they cache a certain amount of data.  Right.  Cabbies have had these for years.  Yeah.  If there's any incidents,  then that's automatically stored into memory.

Start time: 501.98
End time: 520.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what will happen?  You'll get a discount on your insurance  if you're free to have it.  Yeah.  Maybe something like that.  Yeah.  But I'd hate to see a municipality doing that.  Yeah.  You know what?  I don't think they will, John,  because it crosses state lines and city lines  and they'd have to say,  oh, we're only going to look at our city  and I don't know if that can happen.

Start time: 520.88
End time: 523.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The chat room is chastising me  because law and order is the canceled problem.

Start time: 523.88
End time: 526.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't see that as a problem.  Is it one of the first things I'd implement  if I was a mayor?

Start time: 526.98
End time: 528.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why we have not elected.  Hey, break the law.

Start time: 528.94
End time: 530.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's the argument?  What's the beef?

Start time: 530.88
End time: 531.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're not going to elect you, John.

Start time: 532.04
End time: 553.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's going to save a lot of police money  because you don't have all these guys  patrolling with radar guns anymore.  You don't have to.  And you just bring these people in once a year  and you get your tickets.  I don't see that.  It saves money on those cameras.  It saves so much money and makes money.  It's just a bonanza.  It's so obvious.  It's a law and order bonanza.  The Ford snitch.  It's a bonanza.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  D8 happened this week.  Actually, D9.  D9.  One more, one better.  That's the All Things Digital Conference.  We asked Kara Swisher to come in.  I think she was very busy.  We'll get her on a future show.  But they did a great job, a great panel,  including Google's Eric Schmidt.  The Schmidt?  The Schmidt, who was very presidential.  He was so mellow compared to his other wonky appearances

Start time: 578.96
End time: 583.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  where he said at least one complete wanger of a statement.  But he was controlled.

Start time: 584.02
End time: 600.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The scuttlebutt is he wants to run for prez.  He didn't get the commerce job.  That was his job.  That would have been a stepping stone,  at least some service.  Here's Kara Swisher just asked him  what did he do wrong as CEO of Google?

Start time: 601.60
End time: 619.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, when we talk about the identity discussion  we have about Facebook,  when I went back and looked,  four years ago I wrote memos  which talked in general terms about this.  I did nothing about the memos I wrote.  Three years ago I wrote memos  that talked about this general problem.  What's the problem he's talking about?

Start time: 620.06
End time: 627.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The Facebook, the identity problem online  that people don't have a way to create a personal identity  and that Facebook has done that  by basically giving people...

Transcript:  Stealing a march on Google.

Start time: 629.81
End time: 640.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would say that's probably the thing that I...  I clearly knew that I had to do something  and I failed to do it.  And why was that?  I think I was busy.  Didn't you get it?

Start time: 641.28
End time: 644.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  At least he didn't say I was drunk  because that's what I always say.

Start time: 645.24
End time: 657.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's one thing.  He basically owned up to the fact that  he calls it the identity problem  and he says, and I'm quoting here,  Facebook, it's the first generally available way  of disambiguating identity on the internet.

Start time: 657.14
End time: 677.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, so Twitter has that too.  So you're at Becky Worley.  You're the only one and only at Becky Worley.  B Worley.  Or B Worley.  Yes.  Okay, well that's important.  B-W-O-R-L-E-Y.  You're John, you're the real Dvorak.  I'm at Leo Laporte.  So Twitter has that.  Facebook kind of, but not really has it because...

Start time: 677.28
End time: 679.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have a fake John Dvorak on Facebook.  What is that?

Start time: 680.50
End time: 682.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Facebook.com slash fake John Dvorak?  No, it says John.

Start time: 683.14
End time: 686.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It says me.  It claims to be me.  Oh yeah, oh, there's a Leo Laporte.

Start time: 687.50
End time: 695.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's part of the problem is that there are many people  with the same name.  I mean, Dvorak maybe is not so common.  Well, actually...

Start time: 696.38
End time: 699.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but no, this claims to be me.  Right.

Start time: 699.12
End time: 712.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, hey, look, this is even worse.  Here's John Laporte.  So that's kind of...  That is kind of a mashup.  Looks like our love child.  No, I'm sorry.  Search for the wrong name.  So I said search for John Dvorak.  Yeah, but I mean...

Start time: 714.40
End time: 715.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, and this is...

Start time: 715.16
End time: 717.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which one is you?  Is that you, John?

Start time: 717.26
End time: 724.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  I never use Facebook.  There it is.  That's not you?  That's the phone of John Dvorak.  No, no, I don't have a Facebook account.  How could it be me?  Oh, that's interesting.

Start time: 725.28
End time: 728.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to like it anyway.  But see, the point is, is that...

Start time: 731.53
End time: 733.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't like you, John.  I put you on...

Start time: 733.18
End time: 740.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't have an account?  No.  No, it's not me.  Sure.  He's just making this up to get people to like it.

Start time: 740.20
End time: 745.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's why I don't think Facebook is one, this one.  For instance, if I type facebook.com slash leolaporte, it's not me.

Start time: 746.88
End time: 761.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But this is one of those places where we may or may not be...  It is you.  It is me.  Never mind.  Our situation may not be germane to the average Joe,  because for the average Joe, creating an identity online  is not an identity for a public face.  It's an identity in their community.

Start time: 763.17
End time: 796.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but I think eventually  don't you want to have a unique identifier on the net?  It may not be John Smith, if your name is John Smith.  It might be something else, but don't you...  I mean, chat handles, for instance, are kind of considered unique.  You need this kind of bad form to copy somebody's chat handle.  Don't you think ultimately, just as we have a unique phone number,  we'll want some sort of unique identity on the net?  I think that was the fear, is that Facebook was going to steal this  or Twitter was going to steal this, and Google...  That's why they created Google profiles.  But they don't have a competitor.  That hasn't gone anywhere.  No, I thought it might.

Start time: 797.60
End time: 809.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think there's anything unifying or ubiquitous  that's made any kind of a play for this except Facebook.  And Google did have an opportunity, and they blew it.  And that was what Schmidt was owning up to,  is that they had the opportunity.

Start time: 809.56
End time: 812.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think he's overstating the case.  I agree with you, Leo.

Start time: 813.28
End time: 814.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They didn't blow anything. They couldn't do it.

Start time: 815.30
End time: 821.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that was Mossberg's follow-up.  He said, well, you tried.  It wasn't that you were busy, it was that you failed.

Start time: 821.76
End time: 824.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it wasn't that I was busy, I sucked.

Start time: 824.68
End time: 827.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and good for Walt for following up that way.  I think he's right.

Start time: 829.32
End time: 838.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think they missed a...  And you know what?  Three years ago, did you think of Google as a source of identity  or a search engine?  They're a search engine.

Start time: 839.36
End time: 840.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They still are a search engine.

Start time: 841.32
End time: 852.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He also talked a lot about this gang of four.  Well, that was interesting because he left out Microsoft,  and I think there were a lot of people in Redmond who were upset.  He said the people that power technology today are  Google, Facebook, and Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.

Start time: 856.36
End time: 868.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think his point was they are the four broadest consumer brands  that have gone to a global level.  And while Microsoft may be a very powerful tech brand,  they have lost their cachet as a consumer brand.

Start time: 869.03
End time: 872.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, he did admit they're a good enterprise brand.  He just said they're not a consumer...  You agree, John?

Start time: 874.36
End time: 874.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree 100%.

Start time: 876.46
End time: 888.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In fact, it scares me a little bit if you look at how successful  particularly Facebook and Amazon are,  it's a little scary.  I don't want them to be this successful.

Transcript:  We've seen some malware, but does that mean the party is over?  I think the party is over.  In my opinion, it's a numbers game.  There was a good article on the unofficial Apple weblog.  I can't remember the guy's name.  But he says it's purely a numbers game because Apple has now  gotten to the point where about 17% market share of all computers  have become so security conscious.  It's about 80% of Windows users are protected by antiviruses.  So the 20% of Windows users that are unprotected,  70% Mac users unaffected, it's about the same number.  In other words, the Macintosh platform represents  a good opportunity now.  It's easy pickings.  It is because these people, and I include myself,  completely unsecurity conscious.

The minute you can figure out a way to get on somebody's iPhone,  you've made it.  Gold and...  Everything's on it.  Was it you, John, who was telling me that there's a market  in New York City for taxi cabs for lost phones?  The taxi drivers know exactly where to go to sell...  You drive up, the guy in the corner gives you $100,  and they give you more money if you've popped the battery.  So what they're not looking for the phone,  they're looking for the data on the phone.  So if you've popped the battery,  the person who lost the phone can't erase it or deactivate it.  So now the bad guy has the phone,  and it's loaded with personal information, contact lists,  all sorts of stuff, credit card numbers.  So there is already a market for the hardware.  I could take just a matter of time  before people start hacking the cell phones.

And finally, if you want and John, we're going to send you  one of these because I know I know how much you love bricks.  I love bricks.  What a commemorative brick that matches the brick that's in the  brick twit house.  You could have that on your.  You could have that on your.  It makes a fine paperweight.  It weighs about 12 pounds.  It makes a good weapon.  Yeah.  If you don't like somebody throw it to the window, but don't  throw the one that has your name and address on it.  Anyway, bricks.twit.tv.  It's helping us build the twit brick house turned out to be a  little bit more expensive for the studio than we had  anticipated.  And so this is our way of letting you participate.  No, it is not tax deductible.  We're not a charity or nonprofit.  We're just not making any money.  Bricks.twit.tv.  But now that's enough of that.  That let's talk about go to my PC.  One of our fine sponsors, Citrix, has been with us since  almost the beginning.  They've really been a great sponsor and they make great  products.  So we're very happy to do these ads for Citrix.

Well, I think for one thing, I don't think that the model  I think it's a done deal what a desktop computer should  be like, how it should be used.  Those that interface that we're talking about that  they're trying to replace it with is for small screens.  The reason is designed.  There's a reason it was designed the way it was  designed.  The reason that Steve Jobs brought it into play because  it was the thing you could use with your finger and a  touch screen and a small touch screen.  And you needed to, you know, you need these icons  to move around.  There's a rationale for it.  There's no rationale for this stupid interface to be on  a large 21 inch, 27 inch screen.  It's crazy.  So we're talking about just for people who haven't seen

Transcript:  it or are listening, we're talking about the Metro UI  that's on the Windows Phone 7.  It has the large tiles that each represent sort of a  concept or, you know, like social or contacts or phone  or but this would have space for a bunch of different  things.  They have specific, it's almost like they're trying to  create almost like an expose interface, but for Windows  and using it, marrying it with the Metro UI that we've  gotten to know on the phone.  It's a touch interface.  Exactly.

Start time: 1564.42
End time: 1607.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now here's what my theory is.  My theory is that Microsoft has had nothing but  difficulty adapting its operating system to the phone.  And what they've always tried to do since the very  beginning with Windows, before Windows Phone when they  had their first smartphones is they took the big Windows  interface from a desktop and put it on the phone.  So now instead of it, instead of separating these two  as separate items, as separate things, they keep  wanting to have them all the same because I think they  figure that all their users are complete idiots and  they can't go from one model to another.  So they're going to take the phone model that they know  works on small screens and move it to the desktop.  Now I think they can save themselves by having a  little button you can push that would throw you back  to the real.  They do.

Start time: 1608.42

And so when you have Microsoft Excel or Office or  whatever and you need to have that kind of, let's face it,  get real Windows control, you can get there.  But let me play devil's advocate here.  One of the things that the iPad really proved to  everybody is that there is a market for a simpler  computing experience.

Start time: 1654.10
End time: 1669.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

It was a nuisance.  That's why the Wacom tablet people sell  so many Wacom tablets.  Well, and Apple's response to that is,

This will be an option,  although it's going to be the default option,  which is going to turn off a lot of people,  because as we know,  there's a number of people that buy these machines  that are too, I hate to say it,  but they're too stupid to know that they can change stuff.

This is Intel responding, I think,  to the challenge that ARM presents  in the mobile platform.  Intel just can't get into mobile computing.  So they're trying to create more platforms for themselves  instead of desktop and laptop.  I just not excited about it.  Yeah, that's kind of...

At the same time,  Microsoft's doing its Xbox conference at E3.  I'm going down to E3  because we'll have coverage on Tuesday of E3.  Too much stuff is happening all at once.  Great week.  But let's talk about in just a second,  iOS 5, OS X Lion,  and finally, Apple, unheard of,  has a press release saying,  yes, Steve Jobs will be giving the keynote  and he will be talking about iCloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They have a press release.  What?  Before we do that, though,  let me quickly mention squarespace.com,  the secret behind exceptional websites.  We've been talking about Squarespace for some time.  Our Twitter blog is on inside.twit.tv.  We're doing a complete web redesign  based on our Drupal platform  and the website, guys, ImageX Media up in Vancouver  asked me, well, what about your blog?  And I said, are you kidding?  We are never taking it off Squarespace.  This is the platform.  Squarespace, if you're looking to set up a website,  and not just a blog, any website,  a photography website, a site for your business,  you got to have a website.  You cannot live with a Facebook page alone.  Squarespace.com slash twit.  Check it out.  Free for two weeks.  You don't need a credit card or anything.  You just go to Squarespace.com slash twit  and fill out the simple form that just says,  give me a name, a password, an email,  and you're done.  For two weeks, you've got the full access  to the Squarespace design tools,  including their amazing social widgets.  So, yes, you can incorporate your Facebook page  or your Flickr page or your Twitter page easily  right into that Squarespace site.  And here's the deal.  You don't have to know JavaScript or CSS.  You just put the little widget in there.  You do the sliders, the checkboxes,  and you get in a unique design  that's going to look great with your site,  even arbitrary RSS feeds  so that you can put anything you want in there.  Squarespace.com slash twit.  Take a look at the example sites.  You'll get some idea of what people are doing  with the amazing Squarespace platform,  including the pro photographers,  the artists, the nonprofits,  businesses of all kind  who use Squarespace to create their websites.  Squarespace is hosting plus software.  You never have to update the software.  It's always up to date,  so security is not an issue.  I love that.  You'll never run out of bandwidth  because Squarespace has an amazing  virtual server technology  that just keeps the sites going  and going and going.  And it starts at $12 a month  for hosting and software.  The new Squarespace 6 is just about to come out,  so you're going to want to check that out.  Squarespace.com slash twit.  Just click that try it free button.  Set up your new Squarespace site.  Do what Alex Lindsay does.  You know, Alex went to a restaurant  that didn't have a website,  created a Squarespace site for them,  and just said, here's the password.  It's yours. Use it.  You should have a website.  Squarespace.com slash twit.  So Apple, iCloud, with lots of rumors,  Apple apparently made a deal now,  has made a deal with all four music labels.  So is it a music service?

Start time: 2400.60
End time: 2406.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, what would that look like in your mind?  Is it straight streaming?  Is it like Amazon's?

Start time: 2406.62
End time: 2471.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, so there's two guys out there now,  Amazon's cloud service and Google's music service.  Both Amazon and Google  allow you to upload all your music  to their service and then stream it.  Now, Amazon has a limit of 20 gigs  for free if you buy an Amazon song,  5 gigs if you don't.  Google has a 20,000 song limit right now.  It's free, but it's in beta.  I don't know if they're going to charge later.  So it's a streaming service,  but you have to, I mean,  it took me days to upload 6,000 songs,  but now on all my phones,  I can listen to my music.  Big deal.  Days.  It did. It took two or three days.  How much music do you need on your phone?  Well, this is 7,000 songs,  but it's not on the phone.  That's the beauty.  I can listen to everything in my collection.  Well, I mean, yeah, well, okay.  But I also have Mog.  If you have Rhapsody, Mog, Ardeo,  any of these services,  you have 8 million songs you can stream.  So I'm not sure what the advantage there is.  Google does not sell music.  Amazon does.  Amazon decided not to license this service.  They're in trouble with the music industry.  Sony says they're going to sue.  Apple made the deal.  So Apple's got to offer something.  Do you think Apple will offer this magical thing  where you push a button  and everything is just instantly on the cloud?  Well, that's the question.

Start time: 2481.86
End time: 2488.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think Apple  has Apple's interest  to do something that makes you want  to only buy from iTunes.  They've got to be threatened  by Amazon at this point.  Okay, so here's one rumor

Start time: 2488.70
End time: 2510.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that I think is interesting  that sort of goes back to this  and also has a consumer play for Apple.  This whole Mac rumors has it  that this is all going to be driven off of  the time capsule wireless router hard drive.  I pray that's not true.  So that you basically sync to that hard drive  and all of your licensed stuff  is somehow held to that.

Start time: 2511.14

Start time: 2531.72
End time: 2543.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think that's enough  in their business to make it  such a fundamental point.  I mean, this may help sell more hardware,  but I think he's always looking  for a direct hardware play.  It's a non-starter.  Yeah, I agree with Becky.

Start time: 2543.76

End time: 2583.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I never stole music.  I have hundreds, maybe two hundreds.  But so my point is  is that it would be so nice  to consolidate all of that  and have it done wirelessly  that I would shell out  50 or 60 bucks for a router-hard drive combo  that did all of that sinking  from my iTunes account.

Start time: 2583.82
End time: 2585.73

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know how much it costs.  But anyways...  Hundreds of dollars.  It's hundreds of dollars, John.  But I'm kind of digressing.  But that's like one of those solutions  that I think would be the added value  that would make me go,  oh, thank you, Lord.  That they would actually

Start time: 2600.18
End time: 2608.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that you'd have to buy the time...  I don't know.  I think that rumor is wrong.  Okay, that's fine.  $299 for a time capsule.  Oh, that's a window.

Start time: 2609.37
End time: 2612.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  $299 sounds about right.  So what is the deal with music from Google?

Start time: 2613.90
End time: 2615.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do you mean what is the deal?  So how does it work?

Start time: 2616.13
End time: 2620.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Somebody explain  why I would want this service.  Because now that I've uploaded everything

Start time: 2620.88
End time: 2719.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to Google now on my Android phone  or my Google tablet,  it doesn't work on iOS yet.  I can stream any song that I own.  Presumably, I own stuff that maybe isn't on  Mog or Rhapsody or RDO or Spotify  or one of those radio services.  But I have access to my collection,  my personal collection,  without putting it on the phone.  So the amount of storage  on the phone is irrelevant.  It's not a great...  I mean, I don't know what the play is.  It makes sense for me for Amazon  because Amazon encourages...  That way, you buy a record  like when Lady Gaga was $0.99.  That's a huge point.  I pushed the button.  The download was slow.  I didn't care because it's stored in my locker.  So it's available to me anyway.  And so that makes sense from an Amazon point of view.  They're selling more records.  It's kind of an added benefit.  First of all, I think iCloud is more than music.  It's going to be mobile me.  It's going to be reinvented mobile me.  So it's going to be mail.  It's going to be picture storage.  It might have some real advantages.  And I think this is where  Apple's big advantage is.  If it ties into the iOS  and becomes now storage for the iPad  as well as your desktop,  because that's a big problem with the iPad  is you don't...  Where's my stuff?  So if suddenly everything that's on your iPad  is duplicated on your iCloud,  is visible on your desktop,  it looks like there's a rumor that  if you look in the code,  or I think it was actually a leak in iTunes,  that there is going to be  over-the-air app updates on iPhone and iOS 5.  Maybe iCloud kind of ties in as well  and it kind of ties in as  kind of this whole idea of  no more connection to your computer.  It's just kind of all is there.  That makes sense to me.  I don't see a compelling music service from Apple.  I can't think of what Apple could do  that would make me go,  wow, I got to get this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I also...  A while back I said that  as soon as Amazon opened the door,  Google and Apple would be smart to just pile on  and get it all out done once  because then all those music companies  are going to have to go after  all these big players.  But look at something like Dropbox.

Start time: 2739.08
End time: 2758.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apple's got to be looking at Dropbox,  which is very popular.  It's used a lot by apps  on iPhone and iPad  because it's a way of getting data out  of the iPad kind of automatically.  You can put it on the Dropbox  and it's visible on your desktop as well.  Dropbox is a great service.  It's pretty expensive.  It's more than MobileMe.  It's over $120 for 50 gigs.

Start time: 2760.08

End time: 2786.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  well, two's not going to last very long.  Okay, I'm going to give you  a couple of things  that I think would make iCloud compelling.  One is a Dropbox-style service  that lets me kind of sync all my data  across all my platforms.  Two would be...  I'm taking notes in case  I have to do a story.  Two would be,  and I think this is more important than music,  TVs and movies.  What if I buy a movie on iTunes  and now it's available  to all my devices streamed from my iCloud?  That's what I want.

Transcript:  That would make sense still  because there's a trend right now  and you see it with...  I don't know if it's Comcast  or one of these cable companies.  They show this ad where you can stop the...  XFINITY, yeah.  In one room, you can stop your DVR  and then you can go to your bedroom  and start it up from there on that screen.  The idea of the mobile,  of being able to move around the content  from here to there...  Well, it's the Kindle thing.  ...is a very common thought right now.  So that would...  What you described makes a lot of sense  that that would actually happen.  Buy once, watch anywhere.  Right.

I can go to my library  and see all the books I've ever bought  ever on audible.com.  I could scroll through them all.  And if there's a book I want to re-listen to,  I could just start listening to it right away.  There's sleep, which is very cool.  I just don't love audible.  So I downloaded the Temporal Void  and the last book of the Temporal Void trilogy  because I know I'm probably going to get through that.  You just kind of never run out of great things to listen to.  There's over 500 books now in my audible library.  I've been a subscriber since 2000.  I want you to give it a try.  Now here's how you get two books absolutely free.  You just go to audible.com slash twit2.  That's a special URL just for you.  And you can pick two books from all of their great books.  Do you listen to audible books, Becky, ever?  You travel a lot.  I would be shocked if you didn't.

Start time: 3296.84
End time: 3308.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  because one of my predictions  at the end of last year  was that Groupon would live to rue the day  they turned down five million dollars  from Google.  Six.  Six, yeah.  Six billion.  I don't know if they turned it down

Start time: 3308.80

Start time: 3313.86
End time: 3318.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Start time: 3318.90
End time: 3327.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 3327.92
End time: 3329.31

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 3346.10

Start time: 3359.84

Start time: 3368.19

Start time: 3372.21

Okay, let's go see my deal of the week  here in the beautiful Sonoma County area.  So this is the kind of deal you get.  Red beacon, $25.  I only pay $25 for $50 worth of yard work.

Start time: 3494.12
End time: 3511.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  for Groupon, though, is that they have the men on the street,  the people on the street.  If they've got the infrastructure,  if they've got the infrastructure to sell the deals.  But the thing is, this is not necessarily  like the Fuller Brushman going door to door to businesses.  You could set this up pretty easily.  But there is a barrier to entry

Start time: 3511.14
End time: 3572.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  because you do need local salespeople.  I mean, this company has gone in three years  from zero to 7,000 employees.  Here's the kind of...  There's a lot of red flags.  I'm not an investor, I don't invest in tech stocks,  I don't allow myself to for editorial reasons,  and I would lose my shirt if I did because I...  That is the real reason.  ...clearly have no clue what I'm talking about.  But there are a lot of red flags.  For instance, what about this?  In the recent funding rounds,  because this is all in the S1, right?  Groupon raised $1 billion  across its Series F and Series G funding rounds.  Of that, 86% was paid out to Groupon's directors,  officers, and stockholders.  They took of the billion, $946 million off the table.  Ponzi scheme.  They took it.  They kept $151 million to run the company.  Boy, I'd love to be in this ball...  How do you get in this deal?  How do you do that?

Start time: 3587.90
End time: 3600.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, this could be interesting because  in terms of maybe my projection is not as far off as I thought  is they're only looking to raise a billion, right?  Right.  And if their valuation is $20...

Start time: 3600.42
End time: 3603.85

I don't mean to be harsh,  but I don't trust Mark Pinkus as far as you could throw him.  That's the CEO of Zynga.  He's had some questionable comments in the past.  Who?  Mark Pinkus, Zynga's CEO.

That seems reasonable.  You know, objective journalism,  you shouldn't be promoting commercial enterprise  and so forth.  However, they're using this to decree...  This is the France...  The Conseil Supérieur de l'Audiovisuel, CSI.  They're using this to tell...  You know how on CNN they'll say,  follow us on Twitter at the Rick Sanchez or whatever it is.  They cannot do that now in France.  The government says you may not do that.  Or you can't say our Facebook page.  You can't promote that on the newscast.  Christine Kelly from the CSA said,  why give preference to Facebook,  which is worth billions of dollars  when there are many other social networks  that are struggling for recognition?  This would be a distortion of competition.  If we allow Facebook and Twitter to be...  I think they call it le Twitter.  To be sat on air, it is opening a Pandora's box.  Other social networks will complain to us saying,  why not us?  Plus...  That makes no sense.  This is why, actually, I love France,  but talk about a nanny government.

So in other words,  the taxpayers are paying for the police  to not do their job.  It's ridiculous that they would say that to this guy.
