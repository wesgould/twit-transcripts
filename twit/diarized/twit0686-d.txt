Transcript:  It's a subtle difference, but important, I think. Probably. Thank you, Larry, for being here.  We also welcome from CNET, Lindsay Turrentine. She's editor in chief at CNET.com. Always a pleasure to have you in Lindsay. Thank you.  So fun. She made the trek up here. I did. Larry Magid. I know. I told you I couldn't do it.  Yes, because you have your book club. Right. At Chef Chews. At Chef Chews. Oh, you didn't.  I'm from California. Okay, that's different. Right. If there's Chinese food involved, I'm there. Absolutely.  And you're doing the Crazy Rich Asians. So do you choose a restaurant that goes with the media that you're doing?

Start time: 170.90
End time: 194.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, because Chef Chews' son was a director. Oh. So there's a connection there.  Even though the movie took place in Singapore and they serve Chinese food, but there are ethnic Chinese people in the movie and the book.  Perfect. I think it works.  And it was, by the way, very, the book, I have to admit, I kind of skimmed. The movie I loved. It was a counter stereotype. I mean, it was great. I really enjoyed it.

Start time: 195.90
End time: 218.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have not seen it. I will probably see it. I haven't seen it either, but my 15-year-old son saw it because the horror film that he and his best friend went to go see was sold out.  Yeah, when they went to see Crazy Rich Asians. And he came home and he was like, Mom, you got to see it. It's really wonderful.  Oh, that's great. He's like it was it was romantic, but it was funny. It was like Alien versus Predator. He really was charmed. Wow. That's great.

Transcript:  So I was here for Dreamforce, which is the big conference for Salesforce that shuts down half of San Francisco.  175,000 people come in. Was it fun? You actually did a panel or something? Yeah, I did.  And yeah, it's it's interesting because everyone was talking about AI last year, but it was really sort of this, oh, AI will be good. Change CRM.  Exactly. And it's like, OK, buzzwords. This year you actually had companies coming in saying this is how we're using it.  And I always love it when it gets to that level. And then we had Oculus Connect down in San Jose. So I had to get my VR on.

Start time: 269.64
End time: 279.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was not fun for people whose offices are two blocks away from Salesforce. I can imagine how horrible that must have been.  Also, somebody said I needed to raise my mic. Is it better? Yeah, I hope so.

Transcript:  So I'm sorry to say if you were tuning in to watch Chongqi Wang delete Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook page, he has decided to cancel that.  Oh, yeah. I reported the bug to Facebook. I will show proof when I get it bounty from Facebook.  Oh, he's a so-called or self designated white hat hacker from Taiwan who said he was going to broadcast himself hacking Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook page today.  But he's called it off. It's kind of like the digital equivalent of Al Capone's vault.

Start time: 316.06

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's also, I'm going to do something super illegal that everyone will immediately know is me. That's probably not the best way.  Don't do it on Facebook Live. No, don't do that.

Start time: 327.18
End time: 357.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  However, it isn't apparently related to the massive security breach which Facebook revealed on Friday.  This is a little hard to believe, but according to Wired, and this is Louise Metzakis and Issy Lepowski writing in Wired,  they found out about it September 16th because they saw an unusual spike in users actually seeing Facebook.  Now when you have two billion monthly active users, what does an unusual spike look like?

Start time: 357.94
End time: 368.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It must be pretty big, but they probably, because they have so many users, have really predictable patterns.  That's a good point. Statistically, they can probably predict it just down to the hundreds of thousands.

Start time: 370.68
End time: 380.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, 50 million is a lot of people, a lot of accounts, but when you consider Facebook as what, 2.3 billion accounts, it's still a pretty small percentage.  I wasn't affected as far as I can tell. I assume everybody would know.

Start time: 380.90
End time: 404.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's how you would know. So let me give you the full story.  September 16th, they saw an unusual spike. They had started investigating.  On September 25th, which is what, how many days ago? Four days ago, the company's engineering team discovered hackers  appear to have exploited a series of bugs related to that Facebook feature that you could, you know, you've probably all used this  where you say, what do I look like to others? What's the view as feature?

Start time: 405.48
End time: 407.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which is actually a privacy feature, ironically.

Start time: 407.98
End time: 447.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, what do people see? Do they see my phone number?  The bug is an interesting mix of three different bugs.  The first one, it's a bug sandwich. I like that.  Yeah. The first one, when you do view as in the Facebook page, it should get rid of the video uploader because you're viewing it as somebody else sees it.  But the video uploader remains. Bug one.  The second one caused the uploader to generate an access token that had the same sign in permissions as the Facebook mobile app.  So I'm, as a hacker, able to go to your site, somehow get the view as, get the uploader, get your token.

Start time: 448.52
End time: 452.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. So it's the persistent authentication that they're taking advantage of.

Start time: 452.96
End time: 489.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And when the video uploader did appear in the view as mode, it triggered an access code four.  And this is the bad thing. Whoever the hacker was searching for, basically giving anyone the hacker the access code for anybody on Facebook.  Facebook told everybody on Friday. And what they did is to protect people.  They think there was about 50 million accounts access, but they were worried about another 40 million that could have been hacked.  So they they essentially reset that token for those 90 million people. So they logged everybody out.  So the way you would know is if you had to log into Facebook again on your mobile or your desktop.  I did too. I did too.

Start time: 491.16
End time: 510.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And wait, wait, wait. I got to ask you, when you log back in, did you get a survey?  No. OK, because I got a survey on mine saying I think Facebook is and they had choices from wonderful.  I use it all the time. And the the worst one was a detriment to humanity.  It's like, wow, that was on there. It was on there.  I did not get that survey. You don't give me that kind of loaded gun.

Start time: 511.06
End time: 521.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have no this is just my theory, but I know people had already been bounced.  I hadn't been bounced yet. And then later that day I got bounced.  So which made me think that I was part of the 40,000, not the 40 million, not 50 million.

Start time: 523.10
End time: 555.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I don't know. So as you said, Robert, that that that token can be used to basically log in without you.  So it's you as Facebook. And we saw this has been stolen once before.  You remember about five or six years ago, the fire sheep exploit that would allow somebody on the same Wi-Fi network as you to access your Facebook token and then post as you.  Right. So this isn't the first time that's happened.  It is not good for Facebook. It's probably the worst hack we've seen, not the first, but the worst that we've seen of Facebook.

Start time: 556.36
End time: 558.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's very sophisticated. This is a revenue hack, though.

Start time: 559.76
End time: 577.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is this hurts Facebook because this is data that they wanted to sell for users, though.  It's like, well, Facebook was already selling that data.  Are you talking about the phone number issue? No, no, no.  I'm talking about what they what the breach would have encompassed.  I mean, the worst part of it is the fact that they could have gotten the token so they could have access other sites that you're using Facebook as an application.

Start time: 578.08
End time: 594.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but if I get your token, I can change your password.  Maybe I can't. I change your password. No, no. It's really I can post on your behalf.  I think it's about the other site. Well, that's the other thing.  Many people use Facebook. Did it affect this?  Yes. Facebook has a single sign on that you can use to log on other apps and sites.

Start time: 595.48
End time: 607.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, it did affect that, which is a huge concern.  So if somebody is stealing the ability to log into another site and then can use that as a way to get in and mess with that site or that service.

Start time: 608.14
End time: 627.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the best. It was a last straw for our mutual friend, Ed Bott, who wrote on Facebook that he's going to be deleting his account at the end of October.  I don't know how many people I suspect there'll be relatively few people doing that.  But here's a guy who I think, you know, knows a lot about tech.  And apparently it's just enough for him. I mostly delete.

Start time: 628.18
End time: 653.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I basically there's nothing I post on Facebook. All of the information, my personal information is wrong.  I put erroneous information. You're actually a rabbi on Facebook, right?  Yes. But why do you use Facebook if you don't put your stuff there?  The only reason why I use Facebook is because I need to administer certain pages.  So it's tied to that. And also because I use it as a third party authentication, which I will no longer be doing.  I'm going to be moving all of that. I never do that.

Start time: 654.30
End time: 669.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm the opposite, which is that I use it to quietly watch what other people are doing. Lurking. I like this.  Yes, I use it as a lurking platform. Really.  But I mean, in the sweetest way, just see pictures of other people's kids or whatever.  But I never use it as a third party authenticator for that reason. It just freaks me out.

Start time: 670.82
End time: 702.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I only do when I'm really lazy. If I'm really in a hurry and too lazy to type in a username, I might.  But in general, I avoid it. But, you know, I use Facebook a lot to post comments, personal thoughts.  I try not to be overtly political, but kind of subvertly political. And this is I ask a lot of questions.  And I also use it to post links to articles I read, write and broadcast. I do which get almost no engagement.  People engage heavily when I say something personal, to some extent when I say something political,  but hardly at all when I try to get them to read whatever.

Start time: 703.20
End time: 709.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's actually the Facebook algorithm. I mean, Facebook changed this not long ago.  And they're just nobody's seeing that post that you're doing.

Start time: 710.68
End time: 717.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Larry, the problem is that you're not paying Facebook. If you were paying them for the engagement,  then you would get all the engagement you want. That's probably true.

Start time: 717.98
End time: 757.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is funny that Ed bought this bother.  This bothered Ed bought so much to delete his account because I don't think this I mean, this is their security breaches.  Lots of companies have security breaches. This is the one that bothers me a little bit more.  This is a Cashmere Hill article that appeared on Wednesday, two days before this.  Facebook is giving advertisers advertisers access to your shadow contact information, not information you're giving Facebook,  but information Facebook has about you from other things.  For instance, if you use a phone number for two factor authentication to.  Yeah, that's oh that I hate that idea.  So they're apparently taking that phone number and adding it to your profile.  You can't see it. You don't know if you look at your profile. My phone number is not there, but they know.  And they're using it to sell ads against you.

Start time: 758.06
End time: 772.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But what's particularly bad about that is they push that heavily on people as a security precaution.  And it's a good idea. I mean, it's a good security precaution.  But when they mix a security precaution with a marketing advertising gimmick, it kind of destroys something that's very important.

Start time: 772.90
End time: 788.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they have an opt out. Facebook does have an opt out.  They will take you off that shadow sharing list if you give them your Social Security number and your mother's name.  So send them nude pictures.  And if you send them nude pictures, they'll make sure that no nude pictures ever show up on Facebook.

Start time: 788.90
End time: 851.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this comes from research done by Northeastern University, Princeton University.  Cashmere Hill says I asked last year whether the Facebook was using shadow contact information for ads and they said no.  However, these researchers did a series of tests that involved handing contact information over to Facebook for a group of test accounts in different ways  and then seeing how much of that information can then later be used by an advertiser.  And the way they did this is complicated because they have to see what information becomes available to advertisers by looking at the stats provided by Facebook  about the size of an audience after the contact information is uploaded. It's complicated.  But they figured out that when a user gives Facebook a phone number for two factor or in order to receive alerts about new logins to your account,  in other words for good, sensible security reasons, that phone number now is targetable by an advertiser within a couple of weeks.  So if you want to be more secure, you're going to have to give up some privacy.

Start time: 851.90
End time: 853.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, we did a know how not too long ago.

Start time: 854.42
End time: 858.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That, by the way, for me is why Ed Bott should have quit Facebook, not the other one.  Right.

Start time: 858.90
End time: 870.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That Google ultra secure privacy measure is looking better.  That's annoying. It's so annoying.  But I mean, it's secure. It's very secure. And you don't give any personal information to make it work.

Start time: 871.08
End time: 875.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's interesting? Yeah, you have to use a dongle.  Actually, in fairness, Ed didn't say why he was deleting Facebook.

Start time: 877.00
End time: 882.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He just said that they squandered the last centilla of trust I was willing to give them.  So lots of strong.  Maybe it is this.

Start time: 883.90
End time: 891.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I haven't been able to do it yet, but I have removed the app from my phone.  Which I know doesn't do much for my security situation.  That's what I did.

Start time: 891.98
End time: 893.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How much more battery life did you get on your phone once you removed it?

Start time: 894.44
End time: 908.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, not a noticeable amount, but I just brought me a lot of sanity.  You know, one reason you get more battery life, you don't look at your phone as much. You don't have stuff to look at.  Yeah. So I find myself looking at Twitter way more.  It's sort of the like, it's like vaping when you quit smoking.

Start time: 908.90
End time: 914.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're going to do the next thing. You're going to delete Twitter next and then you're going to delete Instagram.  But you know what?  And then pretty soon you're going to delete those accounts because that's what I did.

Start time: 914.96
End time: 918.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then I just will leave my phone at home.  Right, there's no phone I don't look at. It's like what do I need a phone for?

Start time: 919.46
End time: 936.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a bot that runs in a container and it has made my Twitter feed so sane.  Your bot runs in a container.  It runs in a container and I mute, but it does all the blocks automatically.  And I just gave it a couple of parameters to look for.  And my feed has become so much more useful.  For Twitter or Facebook?  For Twitter.

Start time: 936.98
End time: 973.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know the best thing to do is just delete your Twitter account.  And one of the reasons I say that is because, not merely because it's a dumpster fire that draws your attention constantly.  And I always feel worse when I look at it.  By the way, that was what put me over the top.  Do I feel better or worse when I look at these things?  Always worse.  And I always feel worse.  So that was enough for me to say, okay, well I better not do this anymore.  But the other thing that happens, especially with Twitter, is for some reason it makes people crazy.  And they tweet things they shouldn't.  This is true.  Elon Musk.  Two words.

Start time: 973.94
End time: 975.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yes, Elon Musk.  $40 million.

Start time: 976.06
End time: 988.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Funding secured are going to cost him, Chairman of the Board at Tesla, it's going to cost him $20 million.  It's going to cost Tesla $20 million.  That's a lot.  $40 million for a two word tweet.

Start time: 990.90
End time: 996.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Plus they're going to hire a nanny to watch over him apparently to make sure he doesn't miscommunicate in the future.

Start time: 997.37
End time: 1033.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Think of all the things.  So let me explain what happened here for those who don't remember that two word tweet.  This was a couple of months ago.  Elon tweeted, I mean as soon as I saw this, and Elon, this is not the first time he's gotten in trouble on Twitter.  And by the way, it's not just Elon, it's a lot of people getting in trouble on Twitter.  The President.  Oh sure.  Everybody gets in trouble on Twitter.  Eventually you'll say something inopportune.  And part of the problem with Twitter is it feels like it's transient, quick, it's going to go into the ether, and it's preserved forever.  So it's this mismatch between expectation and what really happens.  You think it's water cooler talk, it's a quick bull mo.  Instead it's your permanent record.

Start time: 1034.17
End time: 1037.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  With no context.  And contextless.  Because it's very little context.

Start time: 1037.94
End time: 1044.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I'll give you a little context.  Elon Musk's tweets.  I'm thinking, obviously, you've been on Joe Rogan or something.

Start time: 1045.00
End time: 1049.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A little smoke.  I think this was before Joe Rogan.  Wait a minute.  But okay.

Start time: 1050.76
End time: 1059.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But he's saying, I'm thinking about taking Tesla private, buying all the shares at $420 each.  Now I know you have a 15 year old, so you know what $420 is.  That would have been okay.

Start time: 1059.90
End time: 1062.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If he had tweeted that, that would have been okay.  Oh, I didn't think.  Oh, the $420.

Start time: 1062.90
End time: 1063.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He claims he didn't know.

Start time: 1063.90
End time: 1064.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Bull!

Start time: 1066.63
End time: 1122.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and the devil's triangle is a drinking game.  He knew what $420 was.  It's a pot reference.  So he says that.  And immediately the stock goes, whoa, because that's more than it's currently trading for.  So a lot of people, short sellers probably go, oh crap.  And long sellers go, buy, buy, buy.  And then he tweets, funding secured.  Now that's actually what got him in trouble.  Not the pump and dump, which I think should get you in trouble.  But 50 Cent, we talked yesterday, I'm sorry, I have to say it like this.  50 Cent tweeted, he really liked this H&H stock some years ago.  Made millions of dollars on a penny stock, no trouble at all.  SEC says that's fine.  But the reason Elon got in trouble with the SEC is because those two words, funding secured, weren't true.  Elon said, well, I had talked to the Saudi royal family and they showed some interest, but he had not secured funding.  And that's the lie that got him in trouble.

Start time: 1122.90
End time: 1125.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, he's also CEO of a public company and he's supposed to know better.

Start time: 1125.90
End time: 1130.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A publicly traded company, you have to operate under their rules.  But it's ironic that saying $420 didn't get him in trouble, but funding secured him.

Start time: 1132.20
End time: 1152.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have a tip for anybody who uses Twitter.  Don't lie.  I mean, it's pretty simple, right?  If you use Twitter, it'll make you sad.  But if you use it, if you don't want to get in trouble, just don't make stuff up.  I have a policy.  No one's getting people in trouble on Twitter.  I mean, among other things.

Transcript:  You know what?  You don't have to use your imagination because there's one guy, we talked about this last week, who doesn't do this.  I mean, he tweets, but it's very bland.  Jeff Bezos is very careful not to give interviews, not to be in public, not to tweet.  Is he tweeting at all?  He has a Twitter account.  And if you look at it, it's not him.  It's not him.  It's promotional for Amazon.  Right.  That kind of discipline is what you need in this day and age.  And the problem with Twitter is it undermines that.

Transcript:  I'm just curious, don't you think people who are Trump fans like that about him?  Oh, I think so.  Isn't that what people liked about Trump in the beginning?  He spoke his mind.  He said truth to power.  He didn't, he wasn't mealy-mouthed.  He wasn't cautious.  He said what they were thinking.  And he bypassed the media.

End time: 1254.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, I just want to point out, he absolutely did not bypass media.  He used it as an amplifier for his tweets.  Because if nobody reported on the things he said, but the fact that he would get media coverage every night during the campaign, he didn't bypass media.  He completely, he was media savvy.  In fact, if there's anything you could say about Trump is that he, more than anybody else in the history of the world, used social media, particularly Facebook and the mainstream media, to his advantage.  That was huge.

By the way, I mean, nobody mentioned that Congress passed a huge tax bill this week.  No attention paid to it.  Giving trillions of dollars back to the wealthiest Americans.  No attention paid to it.  I don't want to be a conspiracy guy.  But honestly, you could make the case that media is still being manipulated very effectively.  It's a tail that wags a dog.  It's the tail that wags a dog.  That's exactly what it is.  In any event, Facebook has...  It's funny.  I don't even...  It's like, well, yeah, of course Facebook got hacked.

The issue to me is not so much the way Facebook does this.  Although you can go too far.  So, for instance, and I know that Facebook does this, they sell ads against state of mind.  So if you're depressed, you're showing depression in your posts on Facebook and Facebook can tell this by the way.  Don't they deny that?

End time: 1812.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

If this was this came to us from I'm forgetting who it was.  Is it the one when it works with Dana Boyd?  I think it might be at Data and Society.  Anyway, if if they know you are bipolar and you're bipolar one, so you have manic episodes, they can target your manic episodes because it turns out people with manic episodes buy impulsively.  That's right.  Now, that would be wrong.  OK, that's where there should be a limit.  If they if they give you bowling ads because you were at a bowling alley last night, I don't think I have a problem with that.  But why is that the limit?  I mean, playing devil's advocate here, why hitting below the belt?

Transcript:  I mean, that's that's what advertising is.  Advertising, efficient advertising looks for the times at which you could hit certain people to buy certain things.  You're right. All advertising is essentially manipulation.  Yeah. So yeah, there's definitely a spectrum.  And yeah, if you had an advertiser who was saying I only want to target manic people in their manic phase, that sounds horrible.  But it's not that much different from an advertiser.

End time: 1929.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, when we do our ads, one of the one of the things I think, you know, at least in my mind, that justifies advertising.  First of all, you're right.  We have to support ourselves and it's free.  But also we try.  We know our audience pretty well because of the nature of the narrow casting we do.  And we try to pick advertisers that fit that audience that they'd be interested in.  So that's targeting.  But it's not targeting.

Everybody tells you you got to save for the future, whether it's kids going to college,  your retirement, maybe you want to buy a house.  But how do you save?  You don't put in a savings account, right?  Because the return on that is so low, you'll actually lose money just by inflation alone.  So you've got to invest.  But how do you invest?

Transcript:  The Rock and Bowls used to be the way to save bowling.  I don't know if that's still a thing, is it?  Let's talk about as long as we're talking about Facebook, Instagram.  Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, founders of Instagram, walking out the door at Facebook.  Apparently.  Not just walking.  They slammed the door behind them.  They slammed the door because they didn't like Mark Zuckerberg's interference with their business.  Now, there's a lot of takes on this, a lot of hot takes.  Ben Thompson, a strategist, I thought had a very good take in which he said,  you know what, Kevin, you were never CEO of Instagram.  You were a product creator.  But to be a CEO, you have to have a business.  You have to make a business out of it.  And that's what Mark Zuckerberg does.  That's what he did.  And maybe Kevin didn't like that too much, but that's what you do.

Start time: 2341.52
End time: 2358.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I suppose.  But back to our prior conversation, Instagram already seems to be doing pretty well from an ad targeting standpoint.  And I think the problem is that Zuckerberg wanted to take more of Facebook and apply it to Instagram,  which those guys do not want.  Interesting.

And I thought it was a very good piece, but I just think it's kind of interesting to call that opinion.  But, yeah, she's basically well, let me see if I can find it, because she's talking from her experience with both Mark Zuckerberg and Kevin's sister.  And I'll read you some quotes because I thought it was a very good piece.

Transcript:  You know, I work with both companies through my nonprofit, Connect Safely.  In fact, we just just recently published a revised version of a parent's guide to Instagram, which you can find at Connect Safely.org.  I think it's still on the front cover.  And the companies, at least in the groups that I work with, which is the trust and safety teams, are different.  They have different sensitivities about privacy and trust and safety.  They're trying to merge them.  But I think for Facebook, it's like herding cats trying to get the Instagram people to get lockstep with the with the Facebook people.  And I don't know, maybe that will change over time.  But it's been my experience, at least that there are differences in terms of how they manage that aspect.  Those aspects of their companies.

Transcript:  Here's what Kara says.  And by the way, the title of her piece should tell you something.  A wise man leaves Facebook.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Kevin's sister, the founder of Instagram, wasn't a team player.  But Kara says that's exactly what Mark and Facebook needed.  They needed somebody to speak truth to them.  While it's good to be king, she writes, and Mr. Zuckerberg is that controlling every aspect of the company from its many units to its board as controlling shareholder.  It's not easy without the Instagram founders.  It will be so much harder.  So it sounds more like the issue was that and she says she got this from insiders at Facebook telling her this system was an irritant.  Yeah, she said when she had problems with Instagram, she texted Kevin Sister and he responded to her.  He listened.  He didn't get angry.  She said that's the kind of thing you need a product guy like system to be doing.  On the other hand, she said Zuckerberg, it would be nice if system was still in the room to articulate that to powerful people like Mr.  Zuckerberg.  But now, just like that, he's not.

Transcript:  I don't buy the hot takes that they're out because they weren't businessmen.  Instagram was making money.  It had a revenue stream.  It was growing.  The difference is, and this is why it didn't mesh perfectly with Facebook, is for Instagram, for him, his users were his customers.  He was selling ads to them.  And Facebook, if you're a user, you're not the customer, you're the product.  And those two cultures do not match well.

Transcript:  The best quote from this New York Times piece, though, is this.  And Swisher says she she had a talk with Kevin Systrom at a hopelessly hip coffee  place in San Francisco where I was left with one thought.  One thing he said seemed particularly wise.  So I asked him if I could put it on the record.  Quote, social media.  Now, think about this is a little hard to grok, but see if we can get this  is in a pre Newtonian moment.  So before Newton, we knew gravity existed, but we didn't understand  why it worked or how it worked.  We all understand that social media works, says Systrom, but not how it works.  There are certain rules that govern it and we have to make it our priority  to understand the rules or we cannot control it.  Do you think that's fair?

Start time: 2619.70

Transcript:  I'll tell you maybe what he's thinking is, of course, Mark Zuckerberg created  Facebook to connect and everything like that.  It was used against us during the election by the Russians, particularly  to convince people either not to vote or to stay at home mostly or to vote  for somebody in particular.  To me, that was the kind of come to Jesus moment where somebody figured out how to  use social media, pardon me for saying come to Jesus, in a very powerful way.  And they understood it, but Zuckerberg did not.  And it took Facebook off guard.  It's like, what?  And in fact, at first they denied it even happened.  Finally, they've basically admitted, yeah, that's what happened.

Start time: 2670.30

Transcript:  It's look, that's a, it's a great thought.  And it's actually really good insight into the mind of a startup person.  However, that last part of otherwise we can't control it.  You're not going to control it.  That's the thing about social media.  It is such a huge zeitgeist now with so many different systems of algorithms that  compete with one another.  That's a huge problem.  It's a lot.

Start time: 2716.14
End time: 2737.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And maybe this is oversimplifying it, but the thing that really kind of strikes me  about this whole conversation is that what social media is, is just humans acting  like humans, and maybe we just need to step back and be like, okay, humans have  problems.  They sometimes are good and sometimes they're bad.  And we have to be thinking about the bad impulses along with the good ones,  because we know that people will use it for bad things.

Start time: 2738.56
End time: 2760.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And to that extent, neither Zuckerberg, a sister, or anybody else at a social  media company can truly control what goes on because it's sort of like asking you  to control what's going on in your chat room.  I mean, at some point, people are going to have to say, right, exactly.  The mayor of Palo Alto doesn't get to control what everybody in Palo Alto does.  And so there is a lot.

Transcript:  I just read this article in New Yorker.  I thought it was really, really good by a professor of communications at the  University of Pennsylvania named Kathleen Hall Jamison.  She is, according to this New Yorker article, absolutely nonpartisan.  In fact, almost humorless.  At least that's how she comes off in the article.  She wrote a book called Cyberwar, How Russian Hackers and Trolls Helped Elect a  President, What We Can't, Don't and Do Know.  And she at first poo pooed the idea, as many of us did, that you could throw an  election by remote control using Facebook.  But she did some research and where it  started for her was she she does a lot of media research.  She was watching the dials during the presidential debates.  In fact, this book was originally going to be about the debates.  And she she noticed.  Something somewhat surprising.  You know, most people, most of the media  watchers who watch the debates thought Clinton won them all pretty resoundingly.  However, her research showed.  That during the debates, people there was a small but significant drop  in the number of people reported who had the intention to vote for.  And that furthermore, the debates afterwards, more people thought  she Clinton was less trustworthy than more.  And she was puzzled by these results.  She said that that didn't seem to fit.  You know, the research I would not would not have expected this.  So she put a lot of work into this and where really open her eyes really were  open was when Facebook finally started releasing the ads from the troll factory,  the Internet Research Agency, the Russian ads.  And she said it was very clear that Russia in it actually a surprisingly  sophisticated way was going for that result, that you don't trust Clinton.  You don't trust Clinton.  And she said the other thing that was very clear is it was synchronous.  It was in lockstep with the Trump campaigns message that that the two of them  combined in very clear ways to create an impression, however subtle, but sufficient  to change people's mind in the election.  That was very scary.

Start time: 2952.08
End time: 2961.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Part about that campaign was not that people can be swayed by media because  we've known that since the start of media, it's how cheap it was.  Sure. It cost nothing.

Start time: 2962.16
End time: 2974.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Start time: 2974.74
End time: 2982.60

And what you're talking about is organic content that's being posted on these  services. So again, it gets back to how do you control the people and how do you  control the people who are controlling the people, which in this case could be  bots controlled by foreign agents.  So that is a challenge that I think Zuckerberg doesn't yet understand how to  control. I don't think he knows what to do about it.

If it's just some kind of mammor or poster like the ones you were showing,  you might look at that and say, yeah, I agree with that.  Amplify it.

Special, special birthday.  Not somebody here, but somebody you all know.  This week in tech, this week brought to you by Wasabi.  Wasabi.  Wasabi. It's that green hot stuff.  Oh, I love that stuff.  But that's not the Wasabi.  I'm talking about Wasabi.  It's hot, but it's hot cloud storage.  OK, from the guys, my friends who did carbonite, they knew more about,  they learned more about, they got the patents on how hard drives work than anybody.  And when David Friend, you know, kind of semi-retired,  this problem with David Friend is he can't retire.  He is a serial entrepreneur and he started a new company.  He and his buddy, Jeff Flowers, who was the technologist behind carbonite,  went out and started Wasabi because he realized there was a huge opportunity here.  Data storage is  big, to put it lightly.  There'll be an estimated 163 zettabytes of storage by 2025.  That's, I think, 21 zeros.  Tons of data.  There is a huge market for people who want to efficiently and affordably,  underscore affordably, store data that's critical for business,  critical to get the job done.  You're going to store that data in the cloud.  You know you are, but there are lots of issues.  Wasabi is disruptive technology that's turning the industry on its ear.  Now, I know if you're about to acquire cloud storage, I know the names and you  know the names, the big three you're going to look at.  I just want you to add one more name to your thinking.  That's all I'm asking.  Wasabi uses technologies that result in  storage is 80% cheaper  and six times faster, 80% cheaper, six times the speed.  And they don't charge you for egress, free, unlimited egress.  It's simple.  There's one tier of service, no charge for egress.  You pay for storage.  That's it. It's just as secure.  In some cases, even more secure than your local storage.  I think always more secure than your local storage.  It's HIPAA compliant.  It's FINRA compliant, CJIS compliant.  Wasabi has this thing they call the Wasabi Ball, which means it's a physical  device that allows you to migrate petabytes of data quickly, easily, securely.  You got to check out Wasabi.  You can experience it yourself with free unlimited storage for a month.  See, it says terabyte there, but if you go to wasabi.com and click the free trial  link, use the offer code TWIT, you're going to get unlimited for a month.  See what you think.  Wasabi, W-A-S-A-B-I dot com.  Enter the code TWIT.  One low price, no tiers, no egress fees.  You will save. It's faster.  It's better.  And I, 11 nines of durability, redundancy, immutable.  Oh, I love the immutable storage.  You'll get this. You can say this file may never change.  So if you're worried about ransomware or, you know, anything, any data can get  corrupted. You say this file, that's immutable.  That's that storage that's permanent.  That's untouchable.  This is S3 compliance, got S3 compliant interface, but it's not as three.  It's Wasabi six times faster than S3, 80 percent less than S3 and 11 nines data  durability. And I love the idea of immutable storage.  No charge for API calls either.  W-A-S-A-B-I dot com.  Use the offer code TWIT.

Start time: 3583.54
End time: 3603.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  was this concept of authority.  Giving pages that had a lot of inbound links  authority. And that's really what made them successful.  So I feel like Alta Vista was just, we have  an engine that crawls and if it has certain words,  we return it. But they couldn't tell whether that was an important  page or a high quality page or a lot of people paid attention to it.  That's what Google did.

Start time: 3603.72
End time: 3642.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which is ironically, because one of the things that's gotten Google  criticized by conservatives is that it will  it will surface very popular,  highly regarded websites, which, by the way,  often tend to be liberal or mainstream.  But that's exactly what, you know, when you look at the chart that was created  by, I think, Cheryl Atkinson about the left and the right  websites and how Google would skew towards the left.  Well, the left was Washington Post, New York Times,  CBS, ABC, all of these highly credible  sources, which would naturally rise to the surface  of a Google algorithm, because Google, as he pointed out,  was all based on authority. That's the currency in the search economy.

But anybody who doesn't get high in those results for whatever reason is going to  say, well, there's bias involved. Right.  And that's really the challenge, isn't it?  For Google is to prove to demonstrate that their algorithms are unbiased.

And Google seems to be moving toward recency,  the recency and frequency of update as a symbol of authority, which is very  interesting because you can update something all the time.  Right.

There's the people who write the algorithm.  There's the people who implement the algorithm.  There are the people who actually look at what are the data sets and an algorithm  can actually ingest and you will never get rid of that ever, ever, ever, ever.  The human part of it. Yeah.

There's a little bit of Wikipedia stuff here.  Then Twitter, which honestly, yeah, I don't think Twitter belongs in that list.  Videos.

End time: 4541.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, they know way more than their parents do and way more than the  teachers on campus do,  but they know how to use it.  They don't care how it works.

Start time: 4542.12
End time: 4568.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But do they care whether it's factual?  Like, do they?  Right.  For instance, we were talking before the show about this devil's triangle.  And during Brent Kavanaugh's testimony,  which he said that notation is your book, Devil's Triangle, was a drinking game.  The Wikipedia article was changed to say that it was a drinking game.  Now, what I love about Wikipedia is it's  self-healing and it was immediately or almost immediately changed back.  But I guess some of that depends on when you hit it.

Start time: 4568.86
End time: 4586.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It also depends on how prominent it also depends on how prominent the story is.  So, for example, when somebody changed my Wikipedia entry to say that I was born  in Egypt, it took about two months before somebody fixed that.  I don't even know who did it.  Why did you do that?  I don't know why I wasn't born in Egypt.  People get bored.  It could be an Arabic name.

And you're not allowed to change it.  Yeah, I didn't. I was actually clean about that.  I stayed in Egypt for a while.

Start time: 4616.36
End time: 4624.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 4624.92
End time: 4643.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And so this is what my son is in high school.  And what he does is uses Wikipedia to find sources.  You start.  And then he knows to go to the sources and click through.  And he also has a very I mean, he may be a special case because his mother is a  journalist, but he has a very sophisticated set of his own standards for the kinds of  sources he uses.

Start time: 4644.32
End time: 4658.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, that's the advancement of education technology, though, because it used to be  we just needed to get them the information.  Now we actually have to teach them, OK,  you have access to unheard of amounts of information.  We're going to show you how to actually choose what is usable and what's not.

And most teenagers and much younger children get almost all of their information  from YouTube, and it is difficult to navigate.  Really, I don't even have to navigate.  It's difficult to know what makes somebody an authority, whether somebody on YouTube  is right.  There are a lot of people who speak with great conviction and very little

Transcript:  I find Wikipedia really useful.  I had to repair my toilet a few months ago and I was about to call a plumber and I  said, yeah, let me just go to YouTube and figure out how to do this.  And it was actually very easy because somebody stepped me through the process.  And I find it very useful for that.  But if I were looking to buy a toilet, I'm not sure I would rely on some anonymous  person's recommendations.  I'd go to Toilet.com.  YouTube is great for how to.  It's fantastic.  And I'm going to give a plug to Present Company.  I mean, that's what I love about CNET and PCMag and PCWorld and all of the other  places where you actually get a byline.  Catholic Church. Let's not leave them out there.  In your product recommendations.  You may not agree with it, but at least you know who they are and you can rely on  hopefully that they're being honest as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Transcript:  Everything Google.  Well, OK, so that's an interesting.  And that actually comes to one of the stories.  It was a big story this week is that Chrome 69 all of a sudden starts signing.  It starts signing you in if you sign into any YouTube or Google property.  It signs you into Chrome.  That's right.  Doesn't synchronize.  You have to turn that on, but it does sign into Chrome.  And people got very upset about that.  Matthew Green, who's a highly respected cryptographer at Johns Hopkins, said,  that's I'm using Firefox.  That's unacceptable.  Google's response, by the way, was quick.  And they said, all right, next version.  Yeah, we're going to give you a chance to opt out.  But I don't.  Why were people so upset about that?

Start time: 4923.00

They unified it all.  They unified the user privacy agreements that people were in up in arms around  that. But I think that honestly that reflected how people think of Google.  And they and they log in once they expect it to be logged in.

If we go to Gmail for my account, I'd otherwise have to log out and log her back  in, which is great, since I'm usually the only one who uses my computer.  But but the other thing, the only thing you have to remember is if you want to do  something that's absolutely private, you make sure you log out and go into  incognito mode. Just don't assume that anything you type into Google is private  if you might be logged in or if you might be think.

You know, you got to.  There's no reason an open source project.  People have to work for free.  That's fine if they want to charge.  But I paid for it and I never got any any login or anything.

Transcript:  So they brought to you by Rocket Mortgage.  Quicken Loans, the best lender, biggest lender in the country,  number one in customer satisfaction eight years in a row,  focuses on the customer experience when you get a home loan.  And they know it's a challenge, right?  You're it's a big deal.  You're buying the most expensive thing you'll ever buy.  You're writing the biggest check you'll ever buy.  And there's a lot of anxiety associated with it.  And they want to make it easy.  They don't.  They created Rocket Mortgage just so you don't have to go to the bank,  get all dressed up, pretend you have the money to see the bank only lends money  to people who don't need money.  And so that's not going to work.  So no, instead, you go to Rocket Mortgage to answer a few simple questions.  You can do it on your phone.  It's quick, it's easy, and you can get a loan in minutes.  So that's a great start.  But because of rising interest rates, it's not all.  There's still some anxiety because even after you get that loan,  there's some pressure, there's some uncertainty.  Are the interest rates going to go up?  Do I have to buy a house quickly so that I don't have to pay tens of thousands  of dollars more because of the interest rates going up?  So that's why Rocket Mortgage and Quicken Loans created the power buying process.  Step one, still there, the pre-qualified approval, a few simple questions.  No need to get paperwork, no need to call the bank and get your old check statements  or previous employers for stubs.  They'll do it all for you.  And within a few minutes, you get pre-qualified approval.  Then step two, within 24 hours, they'll verify your income, your assets and your credit.  Again, no effort on your part.  They've got trusted relationships with all the financial institutions.  Once you give them permission, they can get all that information.  And then they give you this thing they call verified approval.  Basically, you're now a cash buyer.  When you go to a house and you say to the seller, I want to buy this house,  you show them the letter or even the screen on Rocket Mortgage.  And it says they're verified, they're good for it.  They're good for the money.  That puts you right at the front of the line.  But here's where step three makes such a difference.  Once you're verified, you qualify for their all new exclusive rate shield approval.  They lock up your rate for up to 90 days while you shop.  You have three months where no risk of the rates going up.  If they go down, they go down and that's great.  But they can't go up.  So you win either way.  This is exactly, exactly what you'd expect from a customer focused company.  They're thinking about your experience and they're making it better.  It's Quicken Loans and Rocket Mortgage.  And you can get started very easily right now.  In fact, set up the account if you're going to go home hunting soon.  Maybe you're going to need a loan soon.  Maybe you want to refi. Set up the account.  Do that right now.  Rocketmortgage.com.  slash twittoo.  And when you use that URL, they know they heard it on Twitter.  That's good for us.  Rocketmortgage.com slash twittoo.  Rate shield approvals only valid in certain 30 year purchase transactions.  Additional conditions or exclusions may apply  based on Quicken Loans data in comparison to public data records.  Equal housing lender licensed in all 50 states and MLS consumer access dot org  number 30 30.  All you have to remember rocketmortgage.com slash twittoo  for rate shield approval, the verified approval.  I mean, this thing is great.  Rocketmortgage.com slash twittoo.  You remember, you'll remember this father, Robert.  Estonia had those digital ID cards, right?  Of course.  And they had a chip in them that had the fingerprint.  And it was provided by a digital security firm called Gemalto.  You also remember probably there was a security flaw in them.  And Estonia had to recall every one of those digital cards.  One point three million of them, they're used all over Estonia for services,  for identity.  It's a huge deal.  And Estonia is so pissed off, they're suing for 152 million euros.

In 2017, two years ago, 3.7% of calls.  This year, 29%.  And they're the ones who said, we think it'll be more than half.  Next year, it'll be 45%, more than half within a couple of years.

So they'll have to go through a kind of a pre-screen before they reach me.  They have to say their name.  Yeah. Yeah, they have to say their name, which I think will get rid of most of them.  Yeah.  At that point, there's got to be a solution to this.  It's crazy.  But on my landline, it was 100 percent.  I mean, literally 100.

Transcript:  Well, the thing is that not this podcast, but some podcasts are very easy to make.  So I think that the podcasting universe  has a glut of just people who like to sit around and hear themselves talk,  which if it's not, as you know, this show, no.  But if it doesn't have wonderful producers like Carson and if it's not  structured and reliable and it doesn't have sort of a narrative quality,  nobody is going to listen to it.

Start time: 6524.02

Transcript:  Yeah, there's different levels of podcasts.  There is the person who is just talking to a mic and maybe you like the sound of his  or her voice, and then there's actually podcasts that will try to show you how to  do something or want to inform you and they all get lumped into the same basket.  That seems really unfair.  Sure.

Transcript:  But I remember when I've been actually podcasting since, believe it or not,  the late 90s before the term existed and for the longest time we got no respect  with the Roger Danger field of media, right?  Everybody wanted video.  And then serial came along and suddenly podcasting and Leo, you actually made a  pretty big contribution to it as well.  Podcasting suddenly became cool and all these television and radio networks  are wanting to jump in. But I think it's cyclical and I think it's been overhyped  over the last several couple of years and maybe it's a flight to quality.  Maybe at the end of the day we will have fewer podcasts, but better podcasts.

And so you can actually have a searchable transcription of it.  And it's not perfect.  But I've been using it.  We use this. I've been using it a lot.  And it's yeah, it takes some work to make sure you fix all the typos.  But if everybody did that with their podcast, it would be searchable.  So at least it'd be more, you know, more discoverable.

Start time: 6740.84
End time: 6762.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Also, I'm seeing a split.  There's going to be those that are like the Twits and the other podcast companies  that can actually survive because they're putting out quality content on a regular  basis. But then you've you've also got the increase in the rise of the one thousand  loyal listeners, podcasters who realize I'm going to have a small audience.  It's probably not going to grow.  But I got one thousand and that's enough for me.  Right.

Start time: 6763.28
End time: 6846.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Essentially, that's what we are.  I mean, it's a larger number than one thousand.  But really, the only reason Twit continues  after 15 years is because we have a very loyal core audience that that just has  stuck with us all this time and they're not swayed.  They're not seduced by these other podcasts or maybe they are.  But they end up continuing to listen to to to Twit.  And I hope they do.  The issue that we face is right now is that advertisers are starting to feel their  oats. Yeah, the IAB, the Interactive Advertising Board, which is a big digital  app, you know, I'm sure you're very familiar with.  Oh, boy, do I.  Unfortunately, they seem to represent advertisers a little bit better than  podcasters, especially podcasters don't have much of a voice with them.  And they're really pushing for podcast metrics for I don't want to do this to my  audience, requiring your audience, for instance, to use an app that measures  right, whether you listened.  You know, when you buy a newspaper ad,  nobody says, yeah, everybody read that newspaper from cover to cover.  And they saw your ad.  That's not how it works.  But for some reason, digital advertisers feel like they should know.  And it's because they're given this false  sense of confidence from from banner ads where I know who saw my banner.  Oh, yeah, right.  And honestly, the only thing that should,  in my opinion, affect advertisers, whether your ads work, whether you get results.  And if and if you got more, you made more money than you spent  on the advertising, then that was a success.

Start time: 6846.22
End time: 6853.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Is that the reason why you and a lot of people give out a special code or  a special URL? Yeah, you know, in the media in general,

Start time: 6854.28
End time: 6886.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that's always kind of how media evolves.  When you first, for instance, when Tech TV first started, it was they call  this direct response advertising.  We don't make we don't we've never done  what's called cost CPA, cost per acquisition ads, where you get 50 bucks  for everybody who signs up. We've never we've always refused to do that because  I consider that devaluing.  So we do traditional impression based  cost per thousand impressions advertising.  But.  I'm sorry, what was your question?

Start time: 6887.10
End time: 6890.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, giving out codes like the codes, like it, so the code does.

Start time: 6891.32
End time: 6982.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry, I completely spaced the code doesn't like if you use the code,  we don't make more money, but they know that you got to use that to figure out  are my ads working.  And it's kind of a problem for us because, you know, advertisers will use a variety  of codes, but almost all our users just use Twitter.  So advertisers, every once in a while,  an advertiser say, well, I didn't get any response from that show, only got  response from Twitter. You weren't on that show  or things like that happen all the time.  So I'm not a big fan of advertisers and I know they want this, but I'm not a big  fan of them getting real granular about the metrics.  And I really don't like the idea of them demanding.  And Apple started to do this, by the way, Apple.  If you listen in Apple's apps, they're counting you.  And I don't like that.  I don't want to see that be a requirement.  And I would hate for advertisers to say, yeah,  we're only going to count iPod iTunes listeners.  We're not going to count anybody else.  That would that wouldn't be good for us for obvious reasons.  Less than half of our audience uses an Apple product to listen to us.  So this demand from advertisers, I think, is I understand why,  but I think it's misguided.  It's going to hurt advertisers.  And really, the only thing that I tell advertisers is, does this ad work for you?  Did you get results?  And we produce phenomenal results for all of our advertisers.  And, you know, that should be good enough for them.  If you ask me.  So I hate to see this push towards metrics because, you know, I mean,  we give you a metrics, we know how many people downloaded it.  Sure.  That's that's as that's better, probably, than how many people bought a newspaper.

Transcript:  I get that.  So, you know, I as a YouTube, I run a nonprofit.  And I get when I'm doing fundraising once in a while, I'll get a potential sponsor,  a potential funder that will start asking for metrics, how many hits did your  website get and this kind of stuff?  And we can produce that if they want to.  We have to go in and look for it.  But it never occurred to me that you value a nonprofit based on how many hits

Start time: 7006.20

Used to be until recently in Hollywood,  the amount of money you'd get to make a movie would depend on your Twitter  following. So so if you're Casey Affleck and you have five hundred thousand  people on Twitter and you're Ben Affleck and you've got five million,  he's going to get ten times more.

And I understand it because you want you want to get efficiency.  But this obsession with metrics, it's, you know,  you probably when you were a teacher, you would tell kids they when you use a  slide world to do mathematics, you know that you don't have you only have a  certain amount of accuracy, right?  You can't say, you know, three.  I saw one of those once.  Yeah, I have one in my office.  I want to visit.  But you can't say one divided by three is, you know, point three, three, three,  three, three, three, three, three.  A calculator will say that.  But that but you can't be that accurate in the real world.  Unfortunately, everything now is calculators.  It's all computers.  It's all high metrics, digital.  And it gives people this false sense of information.  And they want this information.  But I'm afraid they're getting they're  getting the information, but it's not useful.  Isn't that one of the promises that we're making?

Start time: 7084.96
End time: 7099.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Though we're saying, look, the reason why you should go with us over  traditional advertising is because with them, it's shotgun.  You're paying for time with us.  You're actually paying for engagement.  So that's what I think.  But but then we know they want to see if there's actually engagement.

Transcript:  That's fine. And that's why.  So to get back to this history of direct marketing ads, when you're a new medium,  for instance, when tech TV started, almost all of your ads are direct.  There are 800 numbers or they're using offer code that because they want metrics,  not necessarily because it's cost per acquisition, but just they want metrics.  As a medium matures and becomes network television, you start to see very few of  those. You don't see direct response ads on network television because advertisers  at some point say, well, hey, I'm going to buy the NFL.  It's going to work. Right.  Super Bowl is going to work.

And it's, I mean, literally over a million dollars on one ad.  And  all I could say was, you know, jaw dropping.  And that's and that was it.  That was that advertiser left.

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by Molecule.  You notice, by the way, how delicious, fresh and clean the air smells in here,  even though Alex Gumpel is eating hot dogs just around the corner.  That's because of our molecular freshener.  It just it takes all of the pollutants.  And by the way, most air purifiers,  the HEPA filters, all they do is they collect the the the the pollutants in the filter.  In fact, a lot of times they don't collect all of them.  They can only collect larger molecules.  The smaller things like bacteria, mold,  volatile organic, V.O.C.s from paint and formaldehyde from carpet.  That just goes right through those HEPA filters.  The molecule doesn't trap them.  It destroys them.  I love I love this.  The Apple of air purifiers is using something called photo electrochemical  oxidation Pico to it has that it has this  kind of a catalytic converter kind of for for these molecules.  It has a metal.  You have to go to the website and look at it as a metal plate in there that attracts  the molecules and then it has a UV light in there that burns them up, destroys them.  They're gone.  It makes it it gets pollutants 1000 times smaller than those a HEPA filter can catch  and it makes it easier to cope with asthma and allergies.  I know Lisa used to wake up with a headache every morning.  That's why we got the molecule in the bedroom.  And now I know it works because as soon as we leave, you know, go on vacations to  get in the headache again from allergies, the molecule captures them.  Lisa hasn't had a headache since we got the molecule.  We liked it so much. We got one for our son.  We got one for the studio.  Molecules technology was funded by the EPA.  It's been tested not only by people like me, but verified by third parties  university labs like the University of South Florida Center for Biological  Defense, the University of Minnesota's Particle Calibration Laboratory.  It looks beautiful.  It's so cool because it automatically will send off for new filters and the new  that new whatever that metal thing is, it'll send off for those automatically.  It's got a filter subscription service.  So the filters arrive when you need them.  You can connect the molecule to your Wi-Fi or your Bluetooth controller  from your phone. You don't need to.  It has a button on the top of it.  But if you want to, I love it.  We love our molecule.  That's why we bought two more.  They sell out fast.  So right now, go to Molecule, M-O-L-E-K-U-L-E dot com, Molecule with a K dot com.  They reinvented the air purifier.  You'll get seventy five bucks off your first order if you use our promo code  TWIT seventy five.  TWIT seventy five will get you seventy five bucks off.  Easy to remember, right?

There's auto and there's boost, which if like you've got a big room or you have  somebody just smoke a cigar, you can turn the boost on and it really cleans it out.  It's amazing.  So you're going to explain this to me because I don't understand at all.  I read this today. Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web.  He's a particle physicist.  He was working at CERN.  He currently is director of the World Wide Web Consortium, is taking a leave of  absence to create something.  Something I don't  I don't get it.  It's so there's this open source project called Solid.  He says to restore the power and agencies of individuals on the Web.  I mean, basically his opening salvo is right on.  I've always believed the Web is for everyone.  That's why I and others fight fiercely to protect it.  The changes we've managed to bring have created a better and more connected world.  But for all the good we've achieved,  the Web has evolved into an engine of inequity and division swayed by powerful  forces who use it for their own agendas.  Boy, in a nutshell, that's what we've been talking about all day.

Start time: 7598.88
End time: 7602.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the decentralization of data that's being used.  That's what he wants to do.

Start time: 7603.02
End time: 7613.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Solid's an open source project and he's  creating a company that uses Solid to but to do called INRUPT.  I N R U P T.

Start time: 7616.32
End time: 7626.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know, but I wonder if this is the long talked about idea that you  are actually the owner of your data, that you personally profit from it.  So you can sell your data where you want to.

Start time: 7626.98
End time: 7647.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the current model is you give your data to a company like Facebook, like Google.  And their broker and their broker.  Right. This is  turning you back into a client because Google and Facebook want your data,  but you get to choose who it gets shared with and what it gets used for.  The only way that you can keep that agency is if you have some sort of control over

Start time: 7647.52
End time: 7653.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  where it's stored and it's effectively a currency for you.  You choose to spend your currency for a product precisely, precisely.

Start time: 7653.74
End time: 7668.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But then the question is, once you transfer that data to another agency,  do they then own a copy of it or will they somehow will your server somehow  pull it back in if you decide to cut off your relationship with that company?

Start time: 7668.40
End time: 7683.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, that's that's the point of owning it.  Since you actually own the storage,  you you are the proprietor of all your data.  It can only be accessed by those agencies that you give permission to access that  data. So if someone stops doing business with you, they no longer get access to your

Start time: 7683.68
End time: 7687.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  data. But is that enforced by technology or by contract, by agreement?

Start time: 7687.90
End time: 7695.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Both. So the idea is you it's kind of like  de cloudifying what we know of as well.

Start time: 7695.22
End time: 7696.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Had you heard about Solid before?

Start time: 7696.76
End time: 7704.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've heard a little bit about it, but it was always this pie in the sky.  It's like, yeah, that would be a great idea.  But are you really going to ask millions of people to set up their own?

Start time: 7704.30
End time: 7739.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I created and interrupt what they call a pod, a solid pod, which is my data store,  I guess, and it has a website.  It has a profile, which I'll obviously have to add to an inbox, a public folder.  And then they say, get the apps.  The problem is, are there apps? Not really.  And so that's what needs to happen now.  In fact, frankly,  you're this is why I wonder how possibly this could succeed.  You've got to replace everything we use.  The apps are coming, it says.  You've got to replace everything we use on on our phones right now, for instance,  with apps based on Solid.

Start time: 7740.16
End time: 7754.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And not only that, you would need the big players.  So Facebook, Google, Apple, you would have to get them to buy into this,  because if they're already getting the information for free,  why would they suddenly change their model so that they have to contract with you?

Start time: 7754.24
End time: 7766.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So there has to be the way that I see this working.  If it works is that there has to be some upcoming big product that does not exist  yet that this partners with first. Right.  And that's really the only proof of concept.

Start time: 7766.80
End time: 7780.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And this is what Cory Doctorow has said, is that if you want to beat Facebook,  you've got to provide an alternative.  Precisely.  So, you know, maybe that's what this is the beginning of.  The first steps.  It certainly has a big name behind it, Tim Berners-Lee.

Start time: 7782.28
End time: 7814.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The other thing is if it provides data  portability so that if you can decide, I mean, the problem is,  if you want to beat Facebook, the other thing you have to do is you have to have  a critical mass of users and you have to gather their data.  So if you could somehow get people to switch kind of like number portability  with cell phones, which enabled people to shop around different services.  So you could actually switch from one social network to another and have your  data instantly come with you, which Facebook says it wants.  I'm not sure it'll ever actually work towards that.  But if some third party did that,  then we would have true data portability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In effect, I mean, this is what Google does for most people, right?  This is what Google is for most people, is this this repository of all information.  Facebook somewhat.  But it's but Google owns it.  And Google does not hesitate to use it to make revenue.  And this is like that, but without hiding that fact either.  No, no, they're wide.  I mean, they're saying, look, we're going to give you we give you these services

Transcript:  Well, I I mentioned this only because I wasn't completely clear about what it was.  Thank you for explaining it.  And because I think people should know about it so that they could,  I don't know, set up a solid pod.  It's better than Tide Pods  and maybe if there's some, you know, what you need, of course.  And this is the really hard thing.

Transcript:  That's something that Scott Stein, who reviews the iPhone for us, has written a  lot about. I've been saying the same thing.  It stands to be a very interesting phone, partially because it is actually the screen  is larger than the XS, which he pronounces like tennis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that's sort of interesting.  And we've been doing it.  We've been I could talk about this for a while.  But the other interesting thing about the new phones and the only thing at this  moment that would drive me to get the tennis is that we did the drop test on it  that we do all the time. Yes.  And it would not break.  You can't break it.  I couldn't break it.  Seriously.  And we tried hard.  We've broken it every time in the past.  We could not break it.  And I looked at that exact phone after she did that test.  I held it in my hand.  It was barely scratched.  That's pretty impressive.  And that if I could have any phone without a case.  It would cause me to buy that phone.
