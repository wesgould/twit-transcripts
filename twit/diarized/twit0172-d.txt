Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the big story well wait before we do that Leo why don't we I like to ask him a  quick question about about the since he wrote this book what is your conclusion  about Twitter and business and what is the some of the creative ways people use

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  it well I I did basically a lot of case studies of companies ranging from Dell  to hold foods to Comcast and the research was really interesting and  eye-opening because it showed me how Twitter which is a very minimalist tool  can be is very malleable it can be adapted to a wide variety of purposes  and and I was just amazed how all the different ways that companies use  Twitter internally for communication externally for customer service you know  Comcast the Comcast cares guy which was on Twitter a while back you know he's  he's one of the one of the big profiles in my book I'm very very impressed with  him so it was it was it was a blast I'm not a business writer per se but it was  interesting writing a business book doing all this research as a journalist  and and just building up a little social media expertise it was it was a lot of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  fun you know I wonder though you know we the Reuters Bureau on Second Life just  closed I thought I thought even when they why would they have to close when

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they just leave it open who's gonna go there if there's not doing anything but

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think remember when everybody was going to Second Life there was you know  the Norwegian console and the stuff and everybody thought oh this is the next  big thing and then people realized no it's just a bunch of people with new  naked naked body clothing yeah wandering around naked pretending to have sex  right and they left you know and they said this isn't and I wonder if in other  words the Emperor had no clothes with it literally when it came to Second  Life but I wonder if Twitter is the same thing or if there really is some

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  last one I don't know you know because one thing Second Life is a is screwy  compared to Twitter yeah no you're right I mean Twitter is just a simple tool  that I find it very valuable I use it specifically for just to get some  feedback with my audience a little faster than email it's quicker stuff and  it doesn't get left in the box and I try to respond to people who have  interesting questions and then I also add use them as a resource because  there's a day there you know like when I went recently went to Portugal so I  Twitter that I was gonna go there and I had about and I said you know is anybody  gonna be around or something so one of these guys Vitor from and and actually  there's oh I got it now he's gonna get mad that I forgot to mention is I'll  have to dig it up and bring it up Vitor Vitor was the guy went you know she's  got a camera shooting with and so you met him on Twitter I met a bunch of  these guys apparently there's about 40 guys on Twitter and Lisbon or more that  are all you know connected in the same circle and I went and had dinner with a  group of them and then the next thing you know I'm out shooting photos with  another group of them the next day we spent like seven hours you know in fact  we're gonna put up a flicker feed of our best stuff I shot eight 12 gigabytes of  pictures with a with an Olympus 520 and a bunch of lenses and we got some good  shots I think because it was you know but it's all through Twitter it's all  through Twitter you know and these guys by the way we're all professionals it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  wasn't a bunch of kids thanks second life was just way too complicated for  new users Twitter is so easy to get started they just got a text something  that 40404 and they're done right and the second life you got to set it up on  your computer you gotta know where to go you got to learn this quirky interface

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so you got to make money and you got to you know eat food I think though that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  there's a little bit of a flavor of the week still happening flavor the month

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  happening with Twitter yeah well yeah but you hate Twitter you immediately  took a dislike to it once you realize that rather late into the game I might  add I think you know months went by before you realize it might impinge on  your trademark well and then you jump ship to the other competitor which died  I think Jai Koo and then you've kind of toyed with starting your own I have my  own Twitter I sense that there is a resentment that's deep-seated that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  affects your opinion about it. That's what Gilmore said yesterday said it's you're too  emotional about it but I'm trying not to be emotional and look at all these

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  people you have following you that's the thing that's the irony yeah I mean you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  mowing I think that's where I mow and grow about is because okay I've got it  seems like I've helped build Twitter a little bit but what what do I get out of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it what's what's in it for me? Well you're not using it to get anything out

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  of it if you would like I do sometimes I get some stuff out I asked for instance

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  what's the best pen to buy and I got a lot of answers. Yeah well now there here's  the problem I have with it now that you brought that up I'll ask a question to  my legions I got about 35 that little less than 35,000 and so I send out a  question and then and somebody answers it within a few minutes and they get  the right answer and then the answers keep pouring in the same answers and  from all so I'm getting and I can't say hey thanks you know I once I was I did  questions been answered thanks a lot but no they said nobody pays attention to  that and they keep coming in then pretty soon is like a huge how come you're not  answering me how come you didn't acknowledge you would you did you buy  that such-and-such a device and you know that becomes complicated that's I don't  like the fact that the feedback loop is not enough of a community. Yeah they'll

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  tweet something two weeks later and then you know you'll tweet something back and  they won't find it for a month later because they can't find replies and you  know it's a mess depending on the tool set you use but I think over time  Twitter is gonna develop hopefully they'll develop something new instead of  relying on all the third party developers to do everything for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Something's happening I'm not saying that something's not happening with the  idea of kind of microblogging and all that stuff I just anyway you're the one

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that sold me on the idea and I find it annoying that you you hate it so much  now. I don't hate it. It's like you're suckering me in and then next thing you know you're...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't hate it it's not that I hate it it's it's I'm trying to figure out where  the real utility is and it's not it's not at twitter.com. Well it's very

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  utilitarian for me when I went to Lisbon I can assure you I would have had two or  three I had at least one day of not having any fun shooting photos and not  knowing where to go because these guys took me around right I would have never

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you know worked out this. Well that's any social network but Facebook could have  given you the same. Yeah probably. Any social network would help you. But this  was it seemed... And that's the future I'm not saying that look I'm not saying that  it's like saying oh the internet it's never going anywhere I mean clearly  there's some future. You might have something. It just seems to... Yeah guys can we

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  take a step back for a minute and listen. You gotta wait longer Buona. I had to get it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait a minute is that Patrick Norton? No it's not Patrick Norton it's Buona McCall.  That's funny that's I have the wrong CG up I had the Patrick Norton CG up for a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  moment there. Okay let's take the Facebook thing I don't know if you  have the same level I mean when I met up with these guys in Lisbon they're all  mature males and they were not kids I think with Facebook you're gonna run into a lot of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's true I would say Twitter skews older. Is that your experience too Julio that it's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  little bit of an older audience? Yeah if I go before a college crowd and I say the  word Twitter and I asked for a show of hands how many people use Twitter you  hear crickets it does tend to skew a little older I find that fascinating

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because... Doesn't that tell you that there's something that in fact isn't  really the future? What about Eric does he use your son John? Does he use... He uses Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uses Skype for IM. Yeah well actually he uses everything but I you know everybody  at Mevio we all use Skype for IM it's our IM network. That's I find that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  fascinating well you got Skype there anyway might as well use it. Yeah and then

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  people we used to have a lot of people in England and so you needed to talk to  them and it was the easiest way to do it. Well I think the Twitter thing I think  it has something to do I think the age thing skews that way because it's kind

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  of like lazy blogging. It is lazy that's why I like it because I don't have to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  type. And I think a lot of people when they get older they don't have as much  time on their hands like some college kid might who they think they're busy but  they're not and they could get forward to you because I've set up Facebook  accounts a couple of times I can never bring myself to ever doing any more work  on it. Right. It's just too much work. Facebook is just it's really I find it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  really complicated just kind of a hassle the minimalism of Twitter really appeals

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to me. That's really where its success lies I guess is that it's just what it  is it's also where for at least at first a lot of people went but is that all  there is but maybe that nowadays we did we want... That's the problem actually I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  think that's what's gonna kill it eventually. You're gonna... By the way Leo

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  you're all over my book I've I really admired what you've done with  microblogging on different platforms and the Twitter army's in there your  Twitter activities in there. I've watched you do the microblogging thing for a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  long time and nicely done. Thank you. Anyway when I said that that's gonna be the  downfall of Twitter what I mean by that's not that it's minimalist is that  it's not going to stay that way because everybody has to have creeping  featurism so the next thing you know let's add this and let's add that and  then it becomes more and more complicated let's have home pages for  the individuals and the next thing you know it's gonna be you know useless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well isn't Twitter isn't Twitter kind of Apple-like in that it resists that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They seem to be yeah they seem to not want to add features. In fact if  anything they've been taking features out. Well they've been changing things around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They've taken a new approach to stability let's remove the things that people want to use.  People want to use things from the server and then everything will work that'll  that'll that'll take care of it. Well whatever anyway I know the audience out

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  there hates us talking about Twitter all the time. You can't help it because it is there's  something happening and it's trying to get a handle on it it's not the company  necessarily Twitter you know one of the things we're gonna do is add a text  stream to the video and audio streams we're already doing of clickable links  comments suggestions that will then be stored you could read it later it's like  kind of real-time show notes but from all of the listeners right and that's  similar in a way to Twitter they'll be they'll be using Jabber so it'll be  truncated to short you know have to be short it'll be like IM messages kind of.  So what I think IM is really what's happening here it's not so much Twitter  as short conversations. I kind of use it as I am personally. Yeah with a lot but  with a large group that you can subscribe to or follow I think that's  really what's happening is that we're seeing in addition to email we're  seeing a shorter short form email system and Twitter is just the first

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  iteration of that I think. Well one of the things I've noticed if you use it as  an IM system is that you also send out these messages to everybody else so that  so each if you have a group of big big group of followers it's almost like a  club and so you're so it's like open IM so it's like if I am anybody in the  group unless it's in a private message but if I am anybody in the group with a  Everybody if they want to or not gets to read it. Yeah or they could follow you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If they want. I think also one of the things people like about it is that you  can you can shape your information. Look we're all of everything that's going on  right now I would say I would submit everything that's going on right now is  about tapping into the vast stream of information that the internet is and  somehow massaging it so that it's useful to you and the thing that Twitter did  that solved a big problem was choosing who you follow it eliminates spam it  lets you shape the stream that you receive to be the most useful to you and  everybody uses Twitter has a different shape that they pursue some I kind of  try to follow news right with news links and and but that's what you can do and  that's kind of the power of Twitter but really it's just a first in my opinion a  first iteration at a scheme to somehow make it possible to follow what the  hell's going on in this vast sea of information does that make sense yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  as a journalist as a journalist I've just found Twitter so incredibly  eye-opening just because it allows me to throw a question out there you know tap

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the expertise of a hive mind. But you and you and John as journalists are  using it as a query mechanism. Not to excess by the way I consider

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that you have a responsibility to these people following you so I try to provide  them with certain kinds of insight and you got that right away you put content  out right away it was a secret to your success. Content nut right and so so now  I'm getting you know I got all these people that gave me feedback that they  want stuff about wine so every time I run into a good bottle of wine someplace  which I do often I tell them where it is and what it's gonna cost and they can go  get it and it seems to be a whole group of people out there that are just really  they're locked into that idea so I mean and then I also find when I have good  links and I don't want to necessarily send it to my blog which I do once in a  while you know I'll just send them you know some funny stuff. So Apple did an

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  interesting thing this week they well I can't remember who was it was the  Washington Post I think so the security column Brian Krebs security column on  the Washington Post discovered an Apple tech note which had been there for  some time suggesting that people who use Macintosh's ought to be running an  antivirus A and don't this was kind of the funny part they said don't all use  the same one here's three because we don't want virus authors to know what  you're using so you know mix it up guys the journal the Washington Post published  this information literally two days later Apple pulls it down. Yeah this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  what you know every time I saw this I tried to explain what's the irony of  this is that they publish something in there on their website that they want  people to read until somebody actually reads it a year and a half later this  was probably a year and a half June 2007 is when it was posted but Brian Krebs

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  discovers it and suddenly it's a big story and then they all pull it down it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  says well I guess we do you know I'm thinking do you want us reading this you  put us you put out something saying you want the people to use antivirus and  then somebody actually reads this and decides to make it even more public by  talking about it in the Washington Post and then you pull it off I mean you  didn't want it read or I don't get it. Dwight Silverman had a theory. It almost seems like an

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  inside joke and someone on the server team at Apple said hey we're gonna put  a we're gonna put an antivirus article up let's see how long before someone  notices it and then a year and a half later it blows up and then oh pull it down pull it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Dwight had a very good theory I thought in the Houston Chronicle in fact I  asked him to come on he's he's going on a college tour with his daughter right  now so he can't but I'll speak for him I'll channel him and he said this is  Apple marketing finally you know Apple marketing says whoa dudes our ad campaign  I think that's true said no viruses in fact was the very first switch  campaign remember was a PC falling over with a bug you can't put they said what  are you doing you're ruining the message so here's the question if  that's what happened is that irresponsible of Apple to let the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  marketing team yeah it's not even I mean this would you guys totally  irresponsible if you need a antivirus and I guess you do yeah at this point  you should have one I mean I mean you these people basically have zero  protection and you know why it doesn't hurt to have something like that running  I mean yeah okay it hurts the sales pitch that the Mac is less prone but  they can still say it's less prone the total number of viruses on the Mac if you  put them side by side with the with the piles of viruses that run on the PC it's  like it's a mountain and a molehill it's unbelievable I should get wanted to read

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  this in his best Patrick Noyton marketing marketing ease but I'll do it  for you Bill Evans Apple spokesman says we have removed the knowledge base  article because it was old and inaccurate the Mac is designed with  built-in technologies that provide protection against malicious software  and security threats right out of the box however and then and then I think he  probably hopes that that will be the sound bite because then he goes on  however this is this is the lawyer now the lawyers are in it so you got you  started with a tech guy saying that publishing the tech note then the  marketing guy said what are you doing then the lawyers get in and they say but  you got to say this however since no system could be 100% immune from every  thread running antivirus software may have to offer additional protection

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  yeah right some assembly required exactly may cause bloating and death

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  sound effects include death sausage fingers so I think it's just Apple got

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  busted basically on this one I don't know why they didn't you know they

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  should have just shut up yeah they should just left it and left it alone

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Julio do you think this was irresponsible of Apple to pull this well

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll tell you I've been I'm a more of a Mac user than a Windows user and I've  been using Macs without antivirus software for years but you know frankly  I'm starting to feel more exposed and vulnerable and just the visibility of  the Mac platform is increasing in recent months and so you know I'm I'm about to  stick some antivirus software on there so I think you know the real question is  should Mac users be using antivirus software I talked a lot of Mac users  that say no but I think the you know the answer very surely should be absolutely

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the funny thing is none of these antivirus programs really do very much nor are they updated very often because there really isn't any there's no real activity going on out there there are a few threats none of them really in the wild

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  there's a spyware issues that that apparently are on the Mac coming from some websites that's my understanding

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  yeah and one of the things that gives me peace of mind about sometimes using the Mac online is if you get infected it's mostly most times it's your fault you have to do something pretty

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  yes all the exploits require you to click on some but you know you can I mean I'm still surprised this hasn't been done you know once in a while something will come up you know there's a classic one recently about you know you need to update your flash  and it was that's the koob face we'll talk about that a second yeah it pops up and then you hit you stupidly to hit yes instead of closing the box now it seems to me I don't understand why you can't remap one of these dialogue boxes so the X itself  becomes the initialization button you could I know I haven't seen anyone do it though not that I'm giving people ideas yes you are well believe it's already been done I'll be surprised if this is I don't know that it's yeah I'll tell you what it is it's called click jacking

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and I don't you could easily change the default button but it's worse than that click jacking they over it takes advantage of a flaw in HTML that allows you to essentially overlay an invisible button on top of a visible button  I like that yeah it's very sneaky and it's being used quite widely now and in fact I'm gonna talk about a click jacking exploit but it's yeah you can't you don't even know you're clicking the button so here's an example of how it was used in fact this happened to a bank we talked about it on security now I think it was Ing how do you pronounce that?  Ing is a Dutch bank I thought it was a Chinese because no it's Vietnamese no it's Dutch Ing not NG yeah no it's Vietnamese okay anyway Dutch or Vietnamese it happened I think it happened to them their login system to the online banking was so poorly designed that a bad guy was able to put out a web page if you had been logged into your Ing account  put out a web page you looked like you were clicking on you know download whatever download the latest version of Madonna's album and in fact what he's done is put on top of it invisibly the Ing login oh nice so you click that button what happens the JavaScript runs on his page that has now logged into your account  and has any I mean has you know he's got access to your account has any changes sent to him in fact this was a Gmail exploit as well it's happened to a number of Gmail users again click jacking you stay logged into Gmail you think you're just clicking an innocuous button what in fact happens is the JavaScript runs in your Gmail account forwards all your Gmail mail to another box you still get in the mail but it's also being forwarded to the bad guy who then goes to you know Dotsder or whatever  go daddy whoever your registrar is says I want to reassign my web page to Joe Hacker right they send a confirmation to your Gmail right right right right you give it the okay next thing you know it's running on somebody else's server he's hijacking these guys servers wow click jack very very very creative so JavaScript has become the new macro virus in essence absolutely yeah yeah yeah the macro virus is a cross-platform infections that happened through well what's the fix for it well the short term first of all Ing fixed it  by changing their authentication logging into the page Google Mail has not yet fixed this the real fix for the end users look first of all log out of every page don't you know you go to your bank don't just close the window explicitly you have to log out right same thing with Gmail we I leave my Gmail account open but you shouldn't I know what sometimes you can I always see what here's what I when I discover that I'm logged into Google is because I like to get some stock quotes once in a while when I'm logged in I like for example if I could put any any

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  quote just some some some symbols so I'll put the symbols in if I'm not logged in to Gmail or Google the first thing that comes up is the symbol a little chart and the whole thing if I'm logged in it doesn't show up at all so as soon as I put a symbol in and I expect to get the  it knows it's you yeah but it but it doesn't know it but if for some reason I have this is what that's bizarre it should know more not less yes it knows less it doesn't give me what I'm looking for which I'm looking for the stock quote it doesn't give it to me it's down on this page someplace and so I said what is all blogged in so I unlog do the same search boom right at the top perfect did you know with a Google search you can type what time is it in you know Tokyo yeah that's so cool there's a bunch of stuff like that they used to have a better search for phone numbers  but that seems to have gone by the wayside I used to do you used to be able to type in Leo Laporte Healdsburg or Healdsburg Petaluma phone and it would know and it would put a little things at the top of all the Leo Laporte's in the area with the phone numbers not mine I hope well not it doesn't do any anymore thank goodness I can tell you why it stopped doing that Leo Laporte called up and said what the hell are you doing get that phone number out there so anyway that's click-checking and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  just not big enough market share although Mac market shares now up almost to 10% according to the latest numbers and I can do a lot of my I'm sorry that gets back to my earlier point with the Mac market share on the rise it it's only a matter of time before it crosses a threshold a line and all heck breaks loose so that's why as Mac user I'm just you know as time goes on I just get more and more nervous net applications which is a firm that watches this is actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  a really good way to see what real market share is because they essentially look at logs to see you know who's using what browser the November results are out showing significant gains not only among Safari users but just Mac in general and even iPhone Safari is 7% of browser market share that's of course Mac and Windows so that doesn't you know I imagine it's mostly Mac but that could be Windows ie of course losing ground it's now  below 70% for the first time in years and in terms of operating systems the Mac is now 8.87% nearly 9% of market share and the iPhone is 0.37% which is a which is a big jump I wonder why somebody's new it's a new gateway drug the iPhone is I wonder why somebody hasn't revived the the destructive virus you mean like the old

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  days where they would go and say haha haha and then erase your hard disk yeah yeah no now they just get you into a botnet and I think that's because they make a lot more money then yeah but I mean I still think there used to be done as a kind of a game and they weren't out to make money and I'm sure there's still those types of personalities out there and I haven't seen one of these they're all get hired by the Russian mob and they're writing bot and they're writing things they'll get you into botnet the big a big botnet was just discovered several hundred thousand machines you know what a botnet

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  is right why don't you explain what a botnet is to her a botnet is an army of people who are not smart enough to protect their no I'm just a botnet is just a series of computers who've been compromised and they they're at the will of some somebody's command so somebody can be sitting at their their their underground basement in their mother's house or whatever and hit a button and bam attack your site with hundreds of these drones and the sad part is that people

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  who are compromised don't even know it well you know there's a couple things one of them is the the botnets are mostly used for spam they set up giant spam networks they're not uses so much for DNS attacks and so you you know a lot of people essentially at all all during the night they will be sending out spam unknowingly yeah you don't know because that's the whole point they don't want to erase your hard drive because they don't write they want to live there now the other thing that the latest type my Comcast  router blew up like a few months back and they gave me a new one which is an RCA but what's cool about it's got a button and you can turn off the connection I think that's cool I think that oh it's an off button it's an off button so I can turn off the modem at night and I just do it anyway because I don't want to see yeah why not what do I need the thing running all night I'll tell you why not because there are those people out there who will think okay I'm protected now I don't have to worry anymore I've got the button well most of the time the action takes place at night anyway when you're when you're compromised already

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  compromised machine goes to work and trend micro has discovered a worm they call it down add dot a Microsoft calls it conficker dot a and semantic calls it down a dump dot a this is part of the problem by the way yeah no that is it makes it the sound like there's three new viruses it's the same one and what is Kaspersky calls it something else I'm sure they do something Russian it is it is one of the largest botnets they've ever seen with half they believe half a million infected computers  so these are all logged into an IRC session and you're right they could be used for spam but they're also used to blackmail you know betting sites things like that yeah Microsoft warned that the worm was behind a spike in exploits of a bug in the Windows server service which is used by the operating system to connect to network and file print servers so that's another use is you've got a you've got this army of bots now you can use it to infect other computers and build your army that's when Microsoft put out a patch by the way they're gonna be eight critical fixes on Tuesday this  is another patch Tuesday coming up after the day after you hear this according to according to a trend micro of course these guys you know have some vested interest in you being yeah fine they like a little bit just a little bit but yeah doesn't mean it's not true it's just you know we should point that out this has real potential to do damage they say it they've spotted infected addresses on the networks of ISPs in the US China India the Middle East Europe and Latin America now here's the thing that's amazing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it just began spreading right before Thanksgiving and already half a million computers on this net what was the spreading mechanism that Microsoft exploit that was just patched in October it's a Windows it affects all flavors of Windows I mean everything there is it back to how does it get on your machine is the question I'm asking well it's using a remote procedure call service this I think it's normally used for printers it's a worm

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  yeah it's essentially a worm they're going through this exploit and they're executing this remote code and they're infecting these guys so that's really scary because it doesn't you don't have to be a dumb user to get this you just don't just be on the net unprotected no firewall and you'll be infected in a matter of minutes I think that's what I'm thinking oh man so this kind of follows right after McCollough was closed down we talked about this a couple of weeks ago McCollough was the company in San Jose that was it turned out spreading 70% of all spam  was coming from this one company yeah well once again Washington Post kudos to the Post kind of discovered this and it wasn't it wasn't the cops that busted them it was the Post and then I think it was global crossing there there and McCollough's upstream internet service  spreader pulled the plug on them all of a sudden in one you know hour 70% drop in spam so I think this is what happened is that the crooks when that happens that you know quick there's a market for we got to get we got to find a new host put out a worm put out a worm emergency emergency we need a worm emergency worm so you can tell when a computer is infected when it's on the botnet so the security the security teams are actually  sending lists of infected PCs to their ISPs you may you know if you have one of them you may get contacted by the ISP hmm I doubt it yeah you know you know I can't see an ISP have you ever anybody ever any show of hands chat room anybody ever get a letter from the ISP saying I think you got a bug dude no more like I think you owe us a bug dude we had a infected machine up at Port Angeles that was sending out just unbelievable amounts of crap and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so I go up there and I'm and it was the machine was acting up it was like so busy sending out spam I've got a hold of the ISP and so they can monitor the packets activity I'm looking right now and not a single person and hundreds in our chat room are responding we got 500 people in the chat room they said nobody everybody says never right you have to come if you call them they'll help you and so anyway once they said that I said oh and I ran a scanner and found some some something on there that who knows who in the family got it on there but got rid of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  here's a guy in in Canada who says Rogers his Canadian Internet Service provider did contact him no Canadians are nice that way well it's the kind of money they're paying you ought to get something out of that but while we're on this security topic and one of the things that I'm going to try to do is you know my family calls me for tech support which they do if they complain about their computers slowing down for no reason yeah that's all of a sudden it was slow that that's a red flag right there totally because I mean that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  like the only way you can tell now because a lot of these scanners don't even detect these things so if it just slows down you know it's like time to grab my medical bag and take a drive and try to get these things there's a couple of things I like to recommend people do one is have a at least running AVG free free free dot grease off calm for the virus protection and then there's a number any number of spyware programs you need to have run probably two of them because they're none of them  were perfect and then you know I I've been using system mechanic which actually works quite nicely who makes that Iolo yeah really have you guys tried those the latest version of the semantic suite because they're all I don't I refuse to use semantic stuff it clogs up my system with all kinds of hurt to turn a new leaf I heard they they fixed all the all the suckage essentially well I don't know first hand it's possible but you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the problem is you lose a customer like me and it's like it's you know it's always harder to get a customer back alright I'm gonna read you I'm gonna read you an email I just got from the vice president of consumer product management at semantic corporation I lead a product management for Norton and I've  cringed in recent years as you stomped on our box I actually did I literally stopped on you did you stomped on the box I'm on the call for help in Canada and shared your frustrations with the project we've heard you and we've heard similar frustrations from some of our customers about the performance impact of Norton that's chiefly what I don't like about Norton yeah so a year and a half ago we took a hard look at our development process to determine how we could maintain great protection and also deliver the industry's fastest and lightest security solution we set a goal of zero impact  performance and he believes they've done it with the 2009 he's asked he's asked me to review it I will I don't have the lab you know what you really need is a lab with about multiple computers and you can put it on and see and benchmark right you gotta do some blind studies or whatever but it's what's very hard to test and there a lot of antivirus companies I think with some justification complain about sites like virus bulletin that say we've got a suite of viruses you know we've got we've collected these viruses and we test  against them and I think I think that they they complain they say this very it's a synthetic test and you can build your antivirus to score well on this test but it doesn't mean it's a good antivirus and I think that's a legitimate complaint yeah it's very hard to test

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  antiviruses you can test their impact in your system that I could do but much harder to test whether it's effective antivirus I think and I and I did I did write a brief story about the the latest Norton and its impact on the systems that I was running on  it's it's it's foot footprint is very very it it didn't suck resources very much at all but it's still it's still a dilemma because you know readers asked me about this is should I pay money for the stuff and you know I tell them at you know at minimum like just as as John just said you know at minimum run the AVG free and Windows Defender is free you know you're you're pretty well protected with the free stuff but the the stuff that you pay for is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  starting to look a little better because it doesn't suck your resources well and don't be such a cheapskate what does it cost 30 40 bucks it's not a year yeah I mean it's not a huge well you think it's a lot yeah too much given that so are the free products as good as they're paid products I have I you know you can talk to a lot of different people a lot of people feel that the that the free products are easily as good they're slower yeah but she's slow right but you know you what you do is you set it up to do a scan at four in the morning or you do it you know when you feel like it I only scan I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  have the thing running all time even though I do have one of the little monitors running and it doesn't seem to get in the way of anything I guess yeah it's been mentioned it's been mentioned in the chat room I don't know if we mentioned but not 32 is also a great one well there yeah they're an advertiser on the radio show and I've been using for years he said yes et not never tried it it's very lightweight all our tests were always it was very lightweight and very fast very effective I mean let me be blunt though the reason you don't get a virus John is because you're smart enough not to do this  with things like download the new flash player when you get that message that's really the issue and if you're that if you're I don't want to say dumb because it's not dumb but if you're ignorant naive naive ignorant yeah yeah no nothing is going to protect you you can have every every software program on there and if you're going around saying I'll download that I'll install that no problem you're gonna get bit aren't you yep I don't care how good your antivirus is so really I think it's almost a case of people who  know what they're doing don't need an antivirus at all a lot of people like Bill McCrone he never has he never has one installed and and the people who need an antivirus it's not going to protect him because really what they need is an education at least that's what I always you know I wrote a column once saying that people should get a license you have to have a license to be a computer user this is in the days when you're actually trying to get hate mail you must be licensed to use the computer I agree with that actually there's a famous one of those you know those stupid tech  support stories where a woman calls up and and tells the story about the computer and she you know it's one of those like I moved the mouse on the screen but nothing happened and and the guy says oh do you have the the box that came in she said yeah I should hear this is what you need to do I want to take unplug the computer take it put it in the box seal up the box ship it back to us you're too stupid to own a computer but the two main the two main sources of work viruses I think they're the two main sources of viruses  are number one pornography and number two lime wire and peer-to-peer networks those two I think they account for a large piece of the pie where these things spawn from so basically these people are having sex with hookers and complaining that they get a disease yeah I guess you could put it that way yeah I wasn't thinking that but basically they're doing they're doing unsafe computing and and then they and then they complain because they didn't wear a condom well yeah I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  mean so I don't have as much a lot of people yeah you know the thing is I I know people like this and they're they don't know it's dangerous they they're clueless and they're always on these porn sites are floating around here and there phony baloney chat rooms and you know whatever these you know some million of these crazy sites that are all look like they're all mobbed up and and then they loaded with their machines loaded with virus and they're moaning about it in fact some people have their machines that they won't even you can't even boot the machine it's so messed up right you know you've heard that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  one right you ever once well says I get they can't get the machine won't boot now it's just so it's such a mess takes hours to boot you know literally hours yeah you know what cracks me up is those are the people who say okay I'm just gonna go buy a new computer that's their response to it is okay well I'll just buy a new computer yeah and then they just make mess up the next one yeah it's like they throw it out cuz it's got oh it's got it's a mess I'm throwing it out stop like well you guys you guys will probably make fun of me but you know when my

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  computer starts acting up you know when it starts acting slow and you know there's the slim possibility that I'm infected I I usually just wipe the damn thing no I'm not laughing at you that's exactly the thing to do is that all the way to wipe out the whole machine yeah yeah well why just take them take and tweak out with the problem it's not that hard to do well see see you John my all my information everything a value in terms of information is already yeah so I can

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can just nuke a computer without thinking about it best thing to do is you have a you have an image of your system that's known good yeah and you just frankly once you get a bug you're screwed there's no way you can figure out how to get rid of that I'm sorry no bull no but on a Mac too long no I'm no no no because what happens is you let's say you get this this virus that we were just talking about this botnet what's the first thing it does it gets attaches the button it and then it and it puts a bunch of other stuff on your sir there's no way that you can know you don't have anything on your  system there's root kits there's all sorts of ways to hide this stuff you cannot with certainty clean a system that's that's old time thinking that's the old that's the old days you could do that not anymore nowadays you just got it the best thing to do is make sure you've got good backups have an image that's known good or use it for use your disk I think it's better to do an image because you can have all the updates on it and this blasted on ten minutes later you're back to back good to go exactly you just lost all your porn I like to freshen it every  few weeks anyway

Obama carries is you knew it oh  Obama carries a zoom or does he put on your microphone John you so that's the question and when this story came out  uh huh Obama squirts Obama squirts now I don't know I'm sorry what was that that's the term for the zoom to share a song it's a squirt that's what bomber calls it he says you're listening to some music a good-looking girl comes up and you say hey let me squirt my music for you soon  what you were selling baby it really comes up with this stuff a bomber it's something got to rethink his marketing strategy in fact even Steve Jobs wouldn't when

let's let's talk about it the city paper dotnet published an article about Obama working out of the gym  blah blah it was very innocuous piece except four graphs down they mention the fourth paragraph that he looked like he had a zoom well either look like you have one or one of you made it look like he had one maybe you could have been an iPod in one of those cases matter it doesn't matter because it got picked up it was Doug it was tech blogger picked it up it the site city paper dotnet was down I mean they got hit hard everybody wants to see Obama like that's the story there's is Obama carrying a zoom

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and then that you know what this would this if it could be proven he uses a zoom it would the sales would skyrocket yeah well he'd be the only one yeah huge story so it turns out okay so then believe it or not my son uses a zoom by the way does he yeah why oh poor kid that's all you would buy him I refused you know to follow with the rest forgot to have you play with the storm you want to play with it yeah so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  got a weird kind of etched backing that actually has a grip to it so it actually doesn't slip on your hands it's you know what it feels like a fine Dunhill lighter feels like a fine sterling silver like that's what I'm back there

Transcript:  that chance when I'm president because that's how will strengthen America's competitiveness in the world in addition to connecting our libraries and schools to the internet we must also ensure that our hospitals are connected to each other through the internet so I mean this is a this is certainly the most technologically sophisticated president we've ever had just by his generation if not by anything else but he's saying something important here and I and I think we need to make sure that he follows through on this universal internet access and I think we do need that in this I think it's  happening already because the FCC is looking into taking a chunk of spectrum and given everybody free you think that'll happen free internet access yeah it's not gonna be it's not gonna be great access doesn't have to be 300 kilobits I don't want you know that's one of the concerns is Verizon hates it and Comcast aids it because they're afraid of losing their business  we'll give him 150 kilobits give him 300 kilobits you don't have to give him you know four megabits down give him enough to get your email to get your email to get online to surf the net not to download you know movies or whatever give him a give him a kind of a basic internet service but it's everybody should have it yeah because you might need it you might you do nowadays if you want to you know participate in society you need it yeah I agree every we'll see what happens that's fine that you're on this bandwagon Twitter and every pot of Facebook in every garage you're doing it because you're gonna make more money yeah

Transcript:  I want everybody to be able to download Twitter by the way so you got this microphone here and you've got a pop filter in I do that because that thing pops like a champ if you don't have this oh yeah they claim to have a built-in pop filter it doesn't work

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  high lpr 40 that's the mic I use now what do you know what can you tell people out there who are wanted to do or do a little podcasting once in a while anything about these pop filters and which why do you why did you pick that one well I had a big first I had a big muff and that's that you had a what muffles it oh I'm sorry I was for your benefit and then I had a silk stocking stretched on a giant ring which is the old classic and that's the best way is it still oh yeah if you look at you know what look at any picture of Axl Rose  singing and you'll have the big silk stocking thing and and but the problem with that for what we do we do a lot of video I don't want you know you can't you couldn't see me I was like behind a big black screen oh that's why you had the small one that's no I got a little one somebody sent it to me I don't know who I want to thank him but I can't remember his name thank you mask man it's a good little size of the it's a little bit about the size of the microphone it's metal yeah it's pretty fine mesh it does a good job and then you just when you when you say pop by you say it out of the side of your mouth sure pop by as best you can pop by this  Taylor man but that thing will pop on a B oh yeah and a D and everything it's very it's very but and and and because it's a dynamic mic you got you they work sound so much better if you work them close but that's the problem is if you work them close that pops so you have to right back off a little bit so the big story of the week is oh no we already did that Obama's Zune so we think it was it was a Zune but it was a Zune from an aid it was an aid Zune so don't worry Obama does not carry a Zune I think he should but I'll tell you one thing that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  really it's small it's a relatively small thing but it's one thing that really impressed me about the Obama campaign did you guys play with the campaign's iPhone app yeah that was amazing it was amazing you know they could have put out an iPhone app that was kind of lame but the thing just was tricked out and that that you know that little gesture really really impressed well I mean there's just no question in my mind at all that he's got some you know I've talked to some of these people very very including Chris Hughes the guy who started Facebook he's more

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mark Zuckerberg's roommate at Harvard he's got very smart people doing his technology they harvested I don't know how many millions of SMS messages when they said hey you want to know before the press does we'll text you the vice president and they've been very aggressive the I have a feeling that that iPhone application did similar it was similarly used to harvest phone numbers right was he was he that techie when he was in Illinois I don't know I don't think he's that techie I've wrote a column in market watch about this guy

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  behind a questioning whether he's the great tech savior just because somebody uses a blackberry and is addicted to it doesn't mean they're a tech nut but he does recognize obviously how important it is and I think he's he's since he went to the right guys to do his website and all these apps and everything he has some amount of cognition regarding tech and how important it is but I don't think that personally that if you ask them about you know even though he's been grilled on some of these things but he's been briefed you know if you ask him for example you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  what do you think of PHP does it have a future to me if you're a techie at all you could answer that question well you remember when he talked to Google now who knows why but when Eric Schmidt said they threw him a softball that he'd been briefed on for they're saying in the the stick am chat that he did as a senator he did a podcast so that doesn't mean anything doesn't mean he knows anything okay do you want a president who understands PHP no I'm just saying if there was Jimmy Carter was a nuclear engineer he still

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  said nuclear it didn't help it was the rabbit that did it it was that crazed rabbit that attacked him in the rowboat the nation lost confidence yeah John you raised a good point I mean a politician doesn't necessarily need to know his or her way around technology I  interviewed a Minnesota politician who shall remain nameless and I was talking to her about the digital TV transition and it became you know very quickly apparent to me that she didn't know what the heck was going on she was talking about  satellite you know getting satellites and but at the same time you know her staff has has shown you know great leadership and sort of yeah you get the right people working right you get the right people working for you and you know you can get away with a lot you don't think

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that's the I think that's the bottom line he's got some really smart people working around him that's that's really building I mean his his campaign is like the template for future marketing company no no question about it it's ridiculous how now you that but also the money for

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  fundraising the problem is everybody now believes that all the camp future campaigns are going to be spending a billion dollars to get the guy even you know that number is interesting but in Canada with a population of 30 million they spend equivalent of almost

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  $10 spent $300 million on the campaign now per capita we you know they're they're still gonna have the government overthrown they still have a crappy crappy system going on now now they're doing now they're trying to figure out that it's very complicated that it's a complicated thing there is  parliamentary government and now he's going to the governor general and she's got to decide what to do and you know this is why you really you shouldn't have a queen I'm not a monarchist in any event they spend about $10 per person in Canada we only spent about a buck fifty per person including both campaigns so it isn't an outrageous amount of money given especially how media focused campaigns are there's a you've got to buy a lot of ads

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that number is wrong because if Obama took in apparently spent something close to $750 million a billion and a half we got $350,000 total population $150 million so it was about a buck fifty no no that's not the right it's not right it's not right no alright two bucks it's not ten bucks no no it's not ten bucks but it's closer to it's not a buck it was we'll figure it out

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  well did the governor general already decide what is she is she going to rogue them it's like there's some weird word the roger she's got a rogue I think they stopped parliament or something she did it she did it she decided to rogate rogaine she prorogued she prorogued the parliament we don't know what we're talking about ladies and gentlemen they prorogued the parliament parliament is shut down that's what Stephen Harper wanted that's kind of a shock well he wanted that because all hell is breaking he was getting screwed but he was getting screwed his party won all the votes I mean it was a coalition government he didn't have a he had a plurality he didn't have a majority

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  well I still he had more votes than he had before when he was the prime minister and you know getting less votes I mean getting more votes usually means you're gonna stay in you know get kicked out when you get more votes not less anyway it's pretty funny it's anyway let's get out of politics because I know you guys hate it when we talk politics but sometimes politics intersects with time it gives us another chance if you say Obama one more time we'll have half these guys in the can and you know what you know Leo I think what would make him a really

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  tech president I'm gonna end on this if if he had a lol cat I can has oval office thanks to out sanity for that one well one way I like to amuse myself is to get on the internet and look for sightings of Obama or Biden near Macintosh computers you can find find those on a regular basis I call them I call them Barack Mach and Biden book sightings interesting huh yeah that's I'm surprised there has a bit more conversation about

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  what they prefer Windows or Mac I mean it's a stupid conversation but I'm just surprised it hasn't happened it appears to be Mac says Julio who is the Mac man yes I noticed it's always the vested interest I will stay a little political here with this Google story AT&T hired a guy named Scott Cleland to write a paper for his anti-net neutrality group the net competition org that says that Google uses 16.5 percent of all consumer internet traffic  and yet pays only a fraction of that in bandwidth costs why does AT&T care because they'd love to charge Google a little bit extra to access their customers doesn't sound right it's not right the count the calculation was done by calculating you know foot traffic to YouTube not the total bandwidth that YouTube uses but merely the number of visits to the YouTube site the number of videos displayed and of course Google immediately said look it you've got people downloading high-def movies from Apple it's a smaller number but it's a  lot more bandwidth YouTube's crappy bandwidth right on the other hand YouTube just kind of contrary to this started putting HD video up you can now if there if you posted an HD in many cases you'll get an HD like well how would be the limit used to be a hundred K 100 megs you can now get a pro account you go bigger what does that cost I don't know you know I don't think it's that expensive and so the with the pro account I can upload like more than the hundred megs and oh yeah put an HD

Transcript:  issue that I didn't know you know 15 years ago I was at my supermarket and I was in one in one of the aisles and I had a notepad and a pen and I was like writing on it and I got thrown out of the supermarket because because people thought I was like bright I was doing price comparisons maybe this is this is just kind of a there's kind of a tech twist to this issue but the Amazon app frankly doesn't bother me too much if there's a feature that can be used or misused it's really  to how the person uses it I don't think that the feature itself

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think well you know I don't think you can do anything about this sort of thing and I was  we were talking to the last week or whenever somebody's mentioning how they go to a store at the airport and then they  find a book they want to read and then they go walk out of the bookstore and punch it up on their iPhone and download or download under Kindle  yeah well that's gonna happen yeah welcome to the real world that's why these stores have got to change they should have their own way of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  selling right there cheaper or provide something that you don't get in an e-commerce transaction maybe a nice place to sit beverages  yeah you know make service be primary I think it's gonna be good in the long run if you're gonna stay in brick and mortar businesses you have to  provide service you have to do something you can't do online right and they just got to wake up to that fact yeah the only thing they got now
