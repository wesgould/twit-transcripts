Transcript:  This is Twit, This Week in Tech, episode 30 for November 12th, 2005.  We're back in front of a live audience, but this is a special audience because about three quarters of this audience are podcasters.  How many of you are podcasters? Yeah!  Well, the rest are pod listeners.  How many of you are pod listeners? Yeah!  You know, pod listeners are every bit as important as podcasters, although I think there is soon to be a one-to-one ratio.  Yep!  Of podcasters to pod listeners.  We're at the Podcast Expo in beautiful Ontario, California.  Home of the truck stop, or something.  Home of the freeway bypass.  Unbelievable place out in the Inland Empire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And the sanitation conference next door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And we're right next door to the Port of San folks.  You know, we're at the Portable Media Expo.  I saw the portable sanitation expo.  I almost went in and gave the keynote, and I think it would have gone over really well, frankly.  Portable Your Passion.  So this is a special edition of TWIT because we are, as I said, at the Podcast Expo, so we're going to talk to a lot of podcasters today on the show.  But let me introduce our panel to begin.  Patrick was here yesterday, and they've had to go back home to make a dining room set for his wife because they're having people for Thanksgiving.  Kevin was in NoShow because he's got 2.8 million. What the hell does he need to come here for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, he's in some strange country now, isn't he? Is he? Where is he? I don't know. He's in Europe, I thought, somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Dvorak's ignoring my email again.  It happens every time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, he thought you were spam.  Maybe I'm spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He gets no spam, and he gets no Leo, and he gets no email at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe I'm part of the spam thing, but there is a great cast of characters, including, we're welcoming back Steve Gibson of GRC.com. We love Steve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who happened to be in the neighborhood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Happens to be next door, practically, so that's really great.  Doug K. of IT Conversations is back also. Doug, it's great to have you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It's fun to be here, and I only have one thing to say.  What's that?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Light pen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He remembers the light pen.  I do about the LPS, too. The light pen I did for the Apple, too.  That was Steve's first product.  Yep.  And that's how I'll always remember Steve.  So this is the old side of the bench right here. Me, Doug, and Steve.  Right.  We're the old folks.  The founding fathers.  And then, of course, to my left is Alex Lindsay, who's slightly younger, of the Pixel Core. We call it the pimple core. They're all so young.  No, and thanks to the Pixel Core for making this possible. We're going to do a video again. This is the first time we've done kind of like on the road video.  With the new cameras and everything.  Did you drive all this down, or did you fly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We drove it down.  Oh, yep.  It was fine. It was a five with all the trucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's nice. And to begin kind of our roundtable of podcasters, Digital Bill from the Wizards of Technology, an old friend and a great friend. And we're in a kilt in honor of Patrick Norton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's right. I'll be playing the part of Patrick Norton today.  I think you do a pretty good job. You got a sledgehammer with you?  I think Mark has it over there.  How do you like my microphone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is the best microphone I've heard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's really good.  And the price was good for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The price was right. This is a Hile PR-40 and designed by, I didn't know this, the former sound guy for the Grateful Dead. Hile Sound does high-end audio. And this was one of the prizes we won for being the People's Choice podcast for the show or whatever it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The question will be, can it happen again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Never. You know, I'm firmly of the opinion that the tech podcasts are atop now because that's who can get podcasts.  The tech audience.  But I think by this time next year, I hope it'll be a mainstream audience. Don't you think, Bill?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I do. I mean, we've been walking around and the thing that was always amazing to me is how many people come up to us as a tech podcast and they're like, well, it's the Wizards of Technology. We're not quite used to that.  But some of the guys that came up and talked to us are people who have their own podcasts, the Raidercast, the guy that has a podcast about didgeridoos, right? The Australian.  I'd love that.  He says he knows both of the guys in San Francisco that play them.  Play the didgeridoo.  It's a small community, but powerful.  They're way out on the long tail, right? These are the guys who are.  But there's an interest for that. And no matter what you have to talk about in podcasting, you have whatever your passion is.  There's somebody somebody's going to want to listen because you're not the only person that likes didgeridoos.  There are other people that do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, in fact, Doug was telling a story about telling your knitting story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I was when Odeo was first getting started, I was in their offices and we were joking about, oh, someday there will be podcasts about knitting.  And Noah turned around and went to Google and put in knitting podcasts and came up with two of them.  Yeah. You know, one was Nick.  I loved it because it cast is good.  It was it was so so perfect. It was.  So tell me, how did you get started in knitting?  There was a pearl one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait. What do you mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Knit cast is good.  You've listened, Leo.  He's a closet knitter.  I actually I do knit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I haven't needed lately, but I know how to knit and it's very soothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm surprised you have time for knitting.  I don't have time for knitting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why I don't. You knit when you watch TV or you're doing something else.  And when am I watching TV or doing something else?  Never anymore. So I could knit during twit.  You look very comfortable there, Leo.  I am so comfortable with my high LPR 40 microphone.  I mean, I can do all sorts of things.  The force is strong in this one.  The mic is good, too.  So you said something that I keep hearing at this conference,  Digital Bill, and I want to know what the hell it means.  Long tail.  Oh, the long tail. I don't know.  Everybody's talking about the freaking long tail.  Yeah. You don't have one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I had mine removed, actually. It doesn't look good with the kiln.  You still have the bump, though.  You noticed that?  OK.  The long tail is the part of consumable stuff.  You can probably explain this better than me, Doug.  There's an initial high end of demand.  The early adopters.  The early adopters, they're the first people to jump on to anything.  So we're the fat part of the tail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This whole audience are early adopters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's kind of like a spermatozoa?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  On the leading edge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It could be like that.  And then that demand tapers off in kind of this tail-shaped pattern.  But I think Amazon were the ones who kind of discovered it  through all their data mining and so forth.  They have a larger percentage of their total sales volume  come from those small demand things.  But there's just so many of them out there  that it adds up to such a large volume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the long tail really is important in an internet sense  when you have massive numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, remember that we all decided that the internet is now not a fad.  Remember, the internet itself was originally,  oh, that's just a fad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think also that Netflix is a perfect example of someone  who's taking full advantage of the long tail,  where a lot of times what you think of is I can go get that at Netflix,  I can't get it anywhere else.  A lot of their whole business model is based on the ability to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So if Amazon didn't have every book or Netflix didn't have every movie,  there'd be no long tail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, it was coined by Chris Anderson at Wired Magazine.  And he did the first article, and he's got a book coming out  about the long tail, which are really important.  Exactly.  But it was literally Amazon was his first case.  And it said a physical bookstore has whatever the number is,  so many thousands of titles, period.  And if a book doesn't sell a certain number a month, you're out of there.  I know that.  As do I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's nothing more depressing is there than seeing your book in the remainder bin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  What I want to know is does every author go into the bookstore  and look in the computer or on the shelves of their own book?  Of course we do.  And I sign them, which is really lame because the bookstore says,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  somebody defaced this book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I write Leo Laporte in mine.  But the idea is that only something like Amazon can afford to service the long tail,  if you will, to basically they can do it by having essentially zero inventory  and supply the things that will sell one a year.  And that there is a whole economy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Print on demand will solve that really, because then you don't even have to have a printed book.  That's right.  You print it when somebody orders it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Probably some of those titles are print on demand.  So you have sort of two layers of it.  Amazon doesn't even stock it and it's not even available in physical print.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Those are the ones that say they'll take a couple weeks to deliver.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's Lulu's model where they print everything on demand.  You buy a book in Lulu and it's printed when you buy it.  And they have such fast printers that they can print it instantly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and a lot of us, especially in the tech area,  I think part of what makes podcasts so interesting is that a lot of us live in the long tail.  I mean, I don't even consider going half the time to the bookstore  to buy the book that I was looking for because I know it's not going to be there.  And I immediately just say, oh, I'm not going to find that.  I just go to Amazon.  If I know what the name of the book is or if I know what the ISBN is that I want,  I'm not going to even bother because I know that there's a 80% chance it's not going to be there.  So I mean, we live in that area, which I think is part of what helps fuel podcasting  and a lot of the listening of the long tail because the information isn't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Podcasting really is all about the long tail.  There's no fat head at the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, there are people who are trying to turn it into a stars and hits system as well.  I hope not.  But they're playing the high end and look at...  Leo, you're in the fat head.  I was just going to say...  I have a fat head.  Is there no fat head here?  I can't give you that.  I mean, if you look at iTunes and you look at the top 100, that's not the long tail,  at least by podcasting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By pad cat, but that's the problem is by normal standards,  everything in the podcasting is onesies, twosies, really.  But it's going to have its own curve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It's a power law curve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course, the presence of Amazon and the creation of the long tail,  it does change the demographics of the physical bookstore  because now there's less incentive for them to have any obscure books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it actually kills the long tail in brick and mortar.  Exactly.  There's no more long tail.  That's right.  Which could be a negative, I suppose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was just going to say one of the things that I'm hoping that people,  that Apple sees from what Amazon's doing is the ability to really...  If you like this book, you might like this book.  If you like this podcast, you might like this podcast.  And it is the cross-pollination that's really missing in iTunes.  People who bought them just also bought this.  Well, we're going to do that today, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's one of the things we're going to do is cross-pollinate as many podcasts  as we can by moving podcasters in and out.  In fact, we'd like to thank you, Digital Bill, for joining us.  Absolutely.  Tell us where we can get Wizards of Technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's my pleasure, and you can get it at wizardsoftechnology.com.  What do you do? I mean, I know what you do.  What do we do?  We're basically geeks so that you don't have to be.  Our whole mission is to make technology simple for people.  We look at the news and explain it in a way,  the stories that we think affect people,  and we do the whole listener mail thing,  people who have an issue or a problem with something, we try to solve it.  So we're doing Call for Help, and we're doing...  It's great. I listen to it all the time. It's a great podcast.  Thank you. I appreciate that.  Thank you, Bill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why don't you stand up?  Darrell, why don't you get ready to come on in here?  While we bring in another podcaster, I want to ask...  This is This Week in Tech.  We should talk a little bit about this week's tech news.  I think the big story is Sony caving.  Well, first of all, there's actually been a number of developments  since last we talked about the Sony Rootkit issue.  I have to say I was stunned in the USA Today yesterday.  They finally mentioned it, and they said,  Sony CDs carry virus, which is completely wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because there is no self-reproducing behavior, which is a virus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a potential security flaw, but it's not a virus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So basically they're lumping this problem into anything as bad as a virus,  which of course those of us who are techie know that we have worms and viruses.  What it underscores for me is that the general public has no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All the tech community is up in arms about the Rootkit,  but I think normal people don't even know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and it is...  A virus sounds a lot worse in many ways.  How do you explain a Rootkit to USA Today audience?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But imagine reading in USA Today that Sony discs have viruses on them.  I mean, that's a really bad thing.  Bad PR for Sony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah.  So we knew that they phoned home last week,  but we found out that there was the first Trojan based on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, there are actually now two.  F-Secure has found a second variant of the first one, so now we have two.  The idea being that there's a backdoor Trojan  that deliberately renames itself $Sys$DRV.exe,  and there's now a second one.  By doing so, it pretends to be one of the Sony installed files,  which Sony's technology disappears from the system.  So the Trojan, I mean a truly malicious backdoor Trojan,  is using the Sony technology to hide from scanners and traditional tools.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That didn't take long, did it?  No, less than a week.  Hackers are getting so lazy.  They didn't even bother writing their own Rootkit.  They just used Sony's Rootkit.  Come on, guys.  Have some pride in your work.  So Sony's given up.  Well, then we heard, and this is unconfirmed, two days ago,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but I did see that the LAME MP3 copyright strings are in the code  that Sony's installing, which is a breach of the Fraunhofer copyrights also,  and the GPL, because it's commercial software.  So they're stealing LAME.  They're stealing the LAME MP3 technology and installing it in everyone's machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How many people here hate Sony?  No, no, no.  A show of hands won't do.  How many people here hate Sony?  Sony baloney.  So is Sony giving up?  Are they going to take this stuff off?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The word in the newspaper today is that they've said,  okay, we're removing all this technology from the CDs.  Victory!  Yay!  We won!  The problem, of course, and the reason you and I are going to do this on Call for Help next week,  is that it's still in all the CDs in the channel, in distribution, on people's bookshelves.  I mean, so the problem is like permanently etched in history now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And of course, if end users don't know what a rootkit is or that Sony's put one on there,  they're certainly not going to go get Service Pack 1 and fix the problem.  So, I mean, it's just basically a nightmare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  But has the door been permanently open for those Trojans?  Yes.  I mean, forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  On any machine that runs one of these, now I know they're not going to do any more,  but one of these existing enhanced CDs...  You can hide yourself for free.  And we don't know how many millions of machines it is, but it's presumably a large number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, it's really getting close to Sony needing to do a recall.  Now, the class action suit is on its way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, three actually.  The government of Italy is classifying this as breaking several of their laws.  Well, you don't mess with the Pope.  I learned that a couple of twitkits ago.  There's a firm in LA that is a major class action law suing firm, and they're suing also.  The EFF is now examining this to see whether this qualifies for them to take some action.  So it's been a catastrophe and hopefully a good object lesson for the rest of the industry  that's thinking, hey, we need to install DRM software too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's the best thing that could have happened, frankly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  You can imagine that within the organization there must have been some debate about this.  So somewhere there's at least one...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think they're smart enough to have a debate over it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I really think a lot of them.  I mean, a lot of people just said, well, we're going to protect the CDs,  but I don't think they got into how they were going to protect the CDs.  I think there was a handful of people that worked that out,  but I think the people that said yes, we're going to do it, probably didn't think of it.  And this is a good wake-up call for the record industry to know that this causes a lot of damage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  DRM good, stealing bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and you can imagine too, I mean, it could have been worse.  Had this not come out and been discovered, other people would have done their own style of DRM  and you'd have layers of this junk installing itself in the system, really destabilizing Windows.  I mean, it doesn't need any help being unstable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've got the Sony rootkit, I've got the Warner's rootkit, I've got the Electro kit.  I mean, that's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And there is a report that I have seen that we haven't tested  that actually there is an installer for OS X as well.  I mean, there is actually, there is an enhanced, it just came out yesterday.  Content enhanced.  There's content enhanced installer for the OS X as well on some of the discs.  On a handful of discs, they don't know which one.  Now I'm mad.  I wasn't mad until this moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  PC users, yeah, you can stay away from my Mac.  Get what you deserve.  Wow, well, and so there's an object lesson for record companies,  there's also an object lesson for users.  If you insert an audio CD or a DVD into your computer  and it asks you to install something, don't do it.  Don't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because you do get the pop-up EULA, the end user license agreement,  and if you decline, you won't get rootkitted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now I wonder if there was ever discussion in the boardroom at Sony.  Do we really have to pop this EULA up?  I bet you anything they said that.  Do we really have to tell them?  Do we're going to do this?  We don't have to tell them that, do we?  They bought the disc, and there's a shrink wrap license.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Sony executives have specifically said,  there is no contact made by this software with Sony,  but we know now it's confirmed that this stuff phones home.  Every disc that people play using this technology  connects to Sony's servers and reports what it is they're listening to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Does it connect to Sony's servers, or does it connect to the company that works for Sony?  I'll know that tomorrow because I bought one of these heinous things from Amazon,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and it's at home waiting for me to infect myself tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's something to look forward to.  I want to introduce Daryl Shandro, who sat down in the hot seat.  We have a hot seat today.  And Daryl, it's great to have you.  I met you earlier at the Podcast Expo.  And you're a blind, but not podcaster.  Are you a blind podcast listener? Is that right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I am a blind podcaster and podcast listener.  Oh, you do a podcast. What's the podcast?  It's called the Blind Access Journal, and I am an accessibility evangelist.  And it can be found at...can I say where to find it?  Of course you can.  Oh, okay.  We all plug. You might as well plug, too.  blindaccessjournal.com

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay. And one of the things Daryl wanted to come on is to talk a little bit about accessibility.  Now, podcasts are accessible for the most part, aren't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Correct, yes. It's inherently accessible.  If you're using iPod or Lemon, which is now called the Juice Receiver,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right. They had to drop the iPod. Everybody's got the cease and desist order now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, and that just came out this morning. It's juicereceiver.sourcforge.net.  So if you're blind, you can use that as your podcasting client to receive podcasts.  Unfortunately, iTunes is not yet accessible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, iTunes is very bad, actually, at that.  Difficult to use because your screen reader won't handle it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. What happens is there's a number of user interface elements  that's the way the program was designed.  It thwarts the attempts by screen readers to go ahead and gain access to that software.  There have been attempts in the past to ask Apple to fix it, and no response today.  I can see it. It's hard for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, I know. There's little letters.  The whole interface confuses the hell out of me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The computer industry basically doesn't consider anybody over 40 as existing.  I can't read half the stuff.  I got a proposal for the web redesign, and these are young guys who are sending this to me.  Great company, Architype. But the font size must be eight point.  I can't read the entire thing, and so I'm thinking,  I hope they understand that you need to make some big fonts on the website  because if it looks like this, I'm not going to be able to read my own website.  You also were talking about CAPTCHAs and how much you hate CAPTCHAs, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  CAPTCHAs are a killer right now because imagine that you would like to post a comment  to somebody's blog or podcast site, or you'd like to sign up for a podcast-related service on the web,  and you're going along through the sign-up process.  Enter a username, enter your email address, enter your password, confirm your password, so on and so forth.  All of a sudden you come to type the characters you see in the picture.  Well, imagine what if you can't see the picture.  You're stopped dead in your tracks right there. There's no sign up for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can see the picture, and sometimes I can't figure out what those things are.  It's like, wait, is this an H on steroids or is this a W?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I find it helps to take acid right before you use those things.  It clears the bell.  So now I have seen some CAPTCHAs that have audible buttons.  You press, listen to this CAPTCHA. Is that something?  No kidding. That's great.  Yeah, I think that's a really good solution.  That's very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I am essentially, at this point, that is the state of the art in providing accessibility to CAPTCHAs.  It doesn't meet everybody's needs, specifically somebody who is deafblind.  So I am asking industry to include the audio playback of the characters  and go ahead and include a link to send somebody an email or call somebody and get some help.  Yeah, that's a great solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So if you can't do this, press this button or mail us an email. We'll help you get on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it should be and. I need at least the audio playback because...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't want to waste time if you can do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I would like to unfortunately say that Yahoo has such an alternative.  You click a link and fill out a form and they promise to call you back.  And about 90% of the time you never get a call back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We can work on that too.  Well, Darryl, I am glad you came on.  I know from doing radio for years that some of the most loyal radio fans are blind.  And I know that that will be true for podcasting too.  It is important for podcasters to remember that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would also like to have been trying to get this done for a long time now.  I'm a user of Blogger, Google's blogging service and also a Gmail user.  I would please Google, fix your visual verification, add the audio link.  We've been asking since February.  And promises were made back in July on internetnews.com that this would be done in one to two months.  And it's still not done.  And the worst part that really kind of frustrates me is that there's nothing coming from Google saying what actions they're in the process of taking to address the issue.  Thank you, Darryl.  The podcast again is?  blindaccessjournal.com  Thank you so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you, Darryl.  Chuck Tomasi, why don't you come in here and you'll be next in our hot seat.  And while Chuck is getting us situated, I'll bring up another news story that I thought was very interesting.  A deal between Yahoo and TiVo.  Did you see this story?  Yeah.  What do you think of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  You know, I haven't deciphered it entirely, but I think anything that helps people I'm in favor of because I don't I have two Tivo's that I bought the lifetime for.  So I don't want to lose them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to say, I think this makes TiVo the number one player out there.  And I'm not in IPTV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So they already had the ability to program the thing remotely.  Yes.  But now my understanding is if I got it right, you can go to Yahoo's program listings.  Yes.  And select a program that you want to record and it will automatically program your TiVo to record it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did I get that right?  That's right.  And the mainstream media is also focusing on this as turning a TiVo into kind of a Web TV.  So you'll have email.  You'll have some Internet capabilities.  But I think that's missing the point.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What do you think, Alex?  I'm not I'm not sold.  I'm not.  The problem is that I think that there are two there are people who think that that, you know,  everyone wants to do the Internet on their TV and there are people who think that everyone wants to watch video on the wrong trail here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The point of this is Yahoo becomes a television provider in order for Yahoo to become a television provider.  What do they need?  They need something in the home that links up to Yahoo that allows you to record television programs,  download television programs and display them.  What do they got?  They got a TiVo box with an interface to Yahoo.  Now Yahoo can go along, buy television programming, offer it as IPTV.  It is a key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we're talking about a next generation TiVo that will have networking built in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not really a next generation TiVo.  It's a current generation TiVo.  You've got Ethernet.  You've got a hard drive.  You've got Linux.  Right.  And now you have an interface to Yahoo.  Yeah.  OK.  Right now you're clicking the Yahoo directory for existing television.  They can download TVs.  Right now a TiVo will download TV shows from the cable only or from your television connection only.  What if it could start downloading from the internet?  That's the ultimate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  But forget about new content.  Think of what they've done to the value of their on-screen advertising because they can put up an advertisement for loss.  Click it.  Click here to record on your TiVo.  That's pretty awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or when you're going through the broadcast and you say, oh look, there's Twitter.  I know that's not a television broadcast, but I can download it and watch it.  And then, by the way, a little Domino's Pizza button pops up and says, we would like to order a pizza while you're watching Twitter today.  And you ordered pepperoni last time.  Can we do that again for you?  I think this is a major development.  And I think people are underestimating what this means.  It's very good for TiVo.  Very good for Yahoo.  And I think it is a major blow for IPTV.  But maybe I'm the only one who does because I don't see a lot of nods.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  As I said, I guess I look at it like I think TiVo is, I don't know, what is the penetration of TiVo right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not that big, but all of a sudden they might be more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, financially TiVo has been in trouble all along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's 2% of the general television audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it's in the, I think it's in the, I want to say 8 to 10?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would be 10 million maybe, but 2% is pretty small.  That's 1 in 50 TVs.  Although it's not a number of TVs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it's a, I guess for me, and I think a lot of people who use TiVo, it's a bigger thing.  I think probably one of my problems is that I don't, you know, I watch everything off of the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  TiVo now has a compelling way to sell TiVos too.  I mean this is, it's not based on the current installed base.  It's based on making TiVo even more desirable.  TiVo with Yahoo TV.  What's wrong with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I guess my issue is that, I think it's on the other side.  My issue is that with, when we're looking at this, I'm looking at the installed base of the number of PCs and Macs and everything else.  And the fact that I don't really feel like I need a TV to do anything.  I mean I plugged my iPod into a TV.  That's a good point. You don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the general mass, let's get back to that long tail.  I still do.  The long tail would sure like this, don't you think?  I mean you're an advanced techie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I would say TiVo in a lot of ways is still the long tail.  It's easier than putting it on your device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you can't get real TV without being a pirate, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right now.  IPTV requires you to break the law if you want the shows that are being broadcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Unless it's Desperate Housewives or Lost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But as that starts to pick up, the big question is, I mean if, and maybe it puts Apple versus Yahoo, but I mean the thing is that the iTunes model is that I don't need it at all.  I can sit there and just click it.  And I am so happy.  I have to say, I've now had the video iPod for a couple weeks.  I don't need it.  I mean I sit there and I walk to work and I watch my little thing.  I don't need that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Most people though are going to want to sit in the living room and watch their television.  And if the fact that they have a set-top box that is a computer but they don't know it's a computer that connects to internet television from all over the world, I think that's a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If the pizza is bigger than the screen, that's a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, we'll make sure the pizza is smaller.  Chuck Tomasi is here.  He is a podcaster with his own podcast, Chuck Chat.  Yes.  But also a member of Friends in Technology and I wanted you to... welcome to Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Thank you, welcome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You had me on your show some time ago and I'm glad to reciprocate.  Well, I appreciate it.  Tell me about Friends in Technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Friends in Technology is a oxymoron actually.  It's a tight-knit group of loose-knit friends.  There's no commitment other than to have fun.  That's the primary objective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it is mostly podcasters, oh yes?  Yes.  How many different podcasts?  Six.  Six.  And tell me what the names are.  I have to look them up.  We're good friends.  You got to give us a call.  You're friends but loose.  And they're all here, by the way, in their fit t-shirts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We're missing one.  Oh, all right.  We're missing one.  He couldn't make it to the expo.  Okay.  We've got behind me Kevin Devon from In the Trenches.  Love it.  Yep.  And his co-host George Starcher is back in the prong somewhere.  Hey, George.  Yep.  Further back in that trench.  We've got myself, Chuck Chat.  Chuck Chat.  We do Technorama.  Craig Stepp is my co-host.  We've got Victor Cajiao from the Typical PC User podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like that because Victor's really aimed at the beginners, the newbies, and really  helps them out.  I think that's a really great thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah.  We've got Douglas E. Welch from Career Opportunities, the High Tech Career Handbook.  Excellent advice for those in the high tech area.  Mike Tech Show.  Mike Smith was not able to make it.  And Steve Holden, who's the extremely tall gentleman in the back from Tech News Radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are a lot of little loosely affiliated groups like this.  Yes.  I was talking to a 14-year-old kid who probably, I think he had to go home, do his homework,  you know, but he has the Teen Podcasters Network.  There's something like 40 or 50 teen podcasts.  No, I think it was 70 teen podcasters.  And I think it's-  Five minutes.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Expect the product presentation will take place on the stage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  My flight's leaving.  I better go.  I know we're doing this in the airport.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just think that this is one way the podcasters- what is the benefit of getting together in  a group like this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Our objective is just to have fun.  We found that we were-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You think the cross marketing or advertising sales?  Yes, it's the cross promoting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We've got projects that are bigger than the sum of the parts.  We did Server Room of Horrors, a Halloween special.  Horrors.  Okay.  I know, the soccer girl we buy later.  We're working on a Christmas special.  We've got a weekly look back at all of the shows that we do, the six of us.  We splice them together, make a 15 minute kind of promo.  We call it retrofit, the look back at the week.  And just small projects along the way.  Fit tips.  That's great.  I think it's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, Adam Curry is- there apparently some sort of feud going on.  We'll talk about that in just a second.  But Chuck, thank you for being here.  We appreciate it.  All the best with Fit and all the best with Chuck Chat.  I'm going to let you get up.  Don Katz is here from audible.com and we're going to talk to them a little bit about their  plans for podcasting and Audible.  But I just wanted to mention that it was in wired and I don't know how real it was, but  apparently there was a little feud going on between the organizer of this show, Tim Workin,  and Adam Curry, the pod father.  Do you know anything about that, Doug?  Or do you want to stay well away from this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I may have to recuse myself being a pretty good friend of both of them.  But let's put it this way, politics has made its way into podcasting.  That's kind of unfortunate.  I hate to see that happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Didn't take long.  No.  Well, that's the problem.  Adam's got this pod show, which is a business and the model, although it's not completely  obvious, seems to be network of podcasts that will sell advertising as a network, support  each other in creating new podcasts.  It's sort of everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I mean, the important thing there is that they've got funding from not just any venture  from Kleiner Perkins, Ray Lane and John Doar actually on their board.  So they have a plan.  They have a real plan.  And I don't know what that plan is.  Well, that's the irony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Obviously, Ray and John do, but they haven't shared it with anybody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  My theory is that this is much bigger than any of us think, which is my vision is they're  going to be the next NBC.  See, that's what scares the hell out of me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not sure I really want NBC or anything like it to be involved with podcasting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  The challenge there is, you know, are they a fathead company?  Are they a long tail company?  Are they both?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can see the advantage, though, because if there is an NBC like thing, it's going to  bring in people to, I mean, new listeners that we're not going to be able to get otherwise.  And so people who are not affiliated with NBC, you know, all of the little guys, you  know, there's as much bet, you know, basically, it broadens the audience of listeners tremendously  if something like that happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but it's also divisive because that what Adam did was he set up across the street  a little mini expo.  And then I mean, he did show up last night for the awards ceremony and he was very gracious.  But I have to wonder if we need that kind of divisiveness in this in this baby community,

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  this infant. Well, you know, money ruins everything.  Yeah. Cindy Lauper.  Yeah. Right.  Yeah. And girls just want to have fun.  Yeah. So I think it's it's inevitable.  We could have seen it. You couldn't have said exactly where things have come from.  But there are other competing interests.  And I think we we know that's going to be happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, speaking of interests, I'm a big fan of books on tape.  One of the things I do all the time is listen to books on tape.  And for a long time, I rented them like a set.  And then I long and about 1997 comes a company called Audible dot com where you can download  these things from the Internet. And it's changed my life.  I love Audible. I've been an Audible member for years.  Don Katz is here. He's the CEO, founder of Audible dot com.  It's great to have you, Don.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Good to have you.  Good to be here.  Yeah. What brings you to have you here?  Yes. Good to have us here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Having you here. What brings you to Podcast Expo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  So Audible decided to open up our platform and try to be as helpful as we could to  podcasters by taking this 10 years of innovation, figuring out what it takes in terms of  the user experience of what the file formats need to do to have a good experience when  you're driving along, listening to your audio, as well as some of the other bells and  whistles which allow you to build businesses, build a rate card, have verifiable  measurement of who's listening, which as this industry evolves, will get ever more  important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. You guys have credit for devising the first portable media player.  Yeah.  Before there was an iPod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah. I give a talk here, just admitting how early we really were.  But it was four years before the iPod came out.  We were commercializing and we had a wonderful audio player that held two hours of  audio. It sounded as bad as audio could do.  It sounded like an answering machine that had bad things done to it.  But we still have people who think of that as the audible sound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, no, it sounds good. You're essentially MP3 with digital rights management built into  it, right? I mean, the type four is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Well, this .AA format has, it does have an MP3 component that is optimized, but we also  have two other codecs that the consumer can choose that are...  You have up to four different codecs that you can choose from.  Yeah, two, three, and four. Basically, you can pick your quality level.  And some people are still up on dial-ups, so it matters to optimize it or they have  devices that don't have much memory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I use type four on all of the things and it's about a 32 kilobit MP3.  But the quality is better because you're optimizing for voice and so forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  That's right. And we don't get any complaints.  For voice, it seems to do the trick.  Although I have to say in Germany, in our operation, they must have different ears  because there actually are consumer complaints about the level of quality.  From where they came from, they know they're...

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I have a question, Don.  Is it true that you have perhaps the only independent Apple compatible codec for DRM  in terms of DRM that you can generate files for the iPod with their DRM that nobody  else can do? Is that right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yes, at this point, the iPod is fully compatible with audible.com and our subscription  service and our RS delivered content.  And so you can also go to iTunes.  So basically commercially, the iPod will go to iTunes where we're the provider of their  spoken word programming or it'll come to audible.com where you can get more of a  subscription service version of what you get at iTunes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're also the only company that allows that can use iTunes with non-Apple players.  I use my iTunes to move stuff to my palm, which I don't know how you got Apple to do  that, but it works great and it's a really nice solution.  Yeah.  I would have thought that you would be threatened, frankly, by podcasting.  If you know, one of the reasons I think podcasting is so successful is it's in a niche  that's not very competitive.  All podcasting competes against is the radio, you know, maybe the cell phone and driving  paying attention to what you're doing or books on tape, audible books.  And I mean, did you not initially see this as a threat to you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  No, actually the original business plan, unrequited to some extent, had a world of  produced programming.  Audio content.  They're free.  It was just anything.  And it was always in sort of part of the dream to have this layer of product of creativity.  And we would be able to kind of bring people up into a paid universe or help them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you wouldn't require them to be paid.  You could offer free content.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I was always thought to be, it would be a world of free stuff, just because with the  ubiquity of usage and devices and people programming their own listening time, we  would just do better.  So we all have been waiting for it basically.  And I think I want to embrace it.  And the tools are a first step, but I'd like to see an environment where people can in  the realm of creating multiplicity of revenue streams use what audible is as a premium  service is yet another channel for the best stuff.  And we're already seeing interesting hybrids where the American public media, you know,  the old Minnesota public radio, their podcasts talk about and drive people to the full  downloads at audible.  We see huge spikes in their in their their revenue because in their downloads, because  the podcasts are making people, you know, they have value in and of themselves, but  they're driving people to another layer, which is premium.  And with your stuff, Doug, there's no question, you know, you could conceivably branch out  of the kinds of things that Jupiter and other people are, you know, getting a lot of money  for if you chose to and then use the, you know, the free channel for other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Now, there's also something new this week for podcasters, is that right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah. So audible wordcast is this this week is that is this application where we'll  we'll host for you. You want to set up commercial services.  We'll set it up for for payment systems.  You want to be able to get build a rate card because you know exactly how many people  are downloading and listening.  You want to qualify people and actually as a creator, you can actually through a  registration, find out where people are, what they've actually listened to.  Does a long form work better than short form?  It's a pretty extensible tool that I think people will enjoy using.  And plus, it allows this a variable risk structure, which at some point the industry  is just going to need. I mean, at some point, you know, some of the things the way it  works now, if you have millions of listeners and you're not prepared for that, the  characteristics of the cost can drive you out of business real quick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're working. Yeah, we were we were working with a magazine that we're about to do  some some podcasts with some video podcasts and they were like, OK, we're all  ready to go. And I said, OK, so just so you know, we're talking about two to ten  terabytes a week.  We just want to make sure you're kind of in the in the ballpark.  And they were like, we'll get back to you.  So, yeah, it's it's.  But the other thing is, is that it's starting to become less expensive to do as well.  Bandwidth is getting cheaper. Yeah. Now, how do you see the the monetization of the  revenue generation? How do you see that really entering the podcast arena from  your point of view?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I'm guessing it's mostly ad supported for most people at first, just because, you  know, we found that, you know, we are introducing original programing all the  time. And because we built up the trust with hundreds of thousands of buyers of  content, we can consistently expose them to great stuff.  Often we'll make it free at first and they'll get habituated to it.  But it's it's not as easy, I think, to that as with with podcasting to just have  an audience that's growing and have people, even if it's local, wanting to  create advertising there.  I'm guessing that that's the primary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When you're talking about advertising, is it something where someone's giving you a  slot and you're putting the advertising in or is it something that they're doing  their own advertising?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  In case of Wordcast right now, it's really just a tool that allows for ad  insertion elements.  And you get the ads and you build the business or just giving you the tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What about a podcast like ours or maybe even like IT Conversations that doesn't  ever want to put ads in it, but would like maybe to set up a subscriber system  or something like that. Is that going to also be possible?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah, well, this tool, if you wanted to just basically start charging, it's it's  ready for commerce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do I have to put a DRM in it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  You do have to use DRM.  But, you know, DRM in our world, our world of users don't know anything about DRM.  I mean, it's well, I have to authorize them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to authorize my device and authorize iTunes to use auto.  I enter in the password.  Right. And you do have some limits.  Do you have a number of limits, a number of machines?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah, it's basically a couple of computers, a couple of devices within different classes.  And, you know, it's usage for, you know, if a large family or, you know, teachers are  using it in classrooms.  It's a pretty big number.  It's a pretty big number.  It's not.  And you allow burning.  We allow burning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you limit the number of burns?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah, theoretically, it's one point five burns.  So it allows for bad media, you know, every so often.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I've got a whole bunch of discs that are half burned.  Half baked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But, you know, we do have a story in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  We do what we have to do to make, you know, the traditional content community feel comfortable.  I understand that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're in a kind of funny position because I would like both to charge for it and to not  have DRM and maybe to give it away as well, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  But don't forget, one of the things with Audible's format is that one of the issues with  most DRMs is it plays on a very narrow band of devices.  And we're really playing between the iPod and the palms and most of the Microsoft based  MP3 players.  It's it's pretty much, you know, the market share at this point.  So you're not really losing anything by using our format.  I think our format is on more devices than anything but MP3.  And MP3 isn't really commerce ready in its native state.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we're just thrilled to have the support of Audible in the podcast community, because  you're right. You've been doing it longer than anybody.  You know more about it than anybody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  And for me, it's just it's about the unleashing of more creativity.  I mean, I think that, you know, the next great creators are out there and starting to make  this on their own. And the, you know, the professional intermediaries do serve a really  important person, purpose for the culture and the industries they create.  But God knows they're not, you know, the be all and end all.  Well, and for knitting.  And for knitting. Somebody's got to support knitting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely. Nick Cast.  Thank you, Don. We really appreciate it.  Don Katz, CEO, founder of Audible at Audible.com.  And as a longtime subscriber to their books on tape, I have to agree that the DRM is not  onerous, but I just I think it's more philosophical than than anything else for me.  It's just I don't want to have DRM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And now that that now now that that's in his business model, he can't ever back away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's stuck with it. Yes, he's stuck with it as would Apple be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  You're right. In my my speech this morning, you weren't there all day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was a little busy doing a radio show.  I would have been otherwise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I've got some issues with DRM and some other things, just fundamentally.  And it came to me through an interview that one of our hosts did with Meg Horahed, the blogger,  when we talked about what it means to put content behind any kind of restriction whatsoever.  Now, this is something that's the choice of the creator, of course.  But when you make content hard to get to in any way, you devalue the content.  I agree. And that's because you can't link to it anymore.  You you're not going to link to content that's only available through Audible.  You're not going to link to something that requires registration.  And therefore, it's taken out of the conversation.  You can't excerpt it. You can't do all these things.  So you have essentially ripped the value out of that content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And one of the things that I mean, as you look at it from the software side of things,  there has been a lot of there's a lot of different ways people do that protect their software.  Adobe had protected it in a certain way.  And really, the reason that Photoshop is where it's at is because they shipped it with every scanner known to man.  And they gave it away. They gave it away.  You know, and the and the I mean, they made some money on it as they moved through it.  But it was essentially free for me when I bought my scanner.  But the thing is, is what's interesting is the companies who predictably were the best at protecting their software.  And there are some companies that it was almost never a good crack of that software are gone.  It was the ones that were actually fairly easy to to pirate.  Are the biggest that they have the largest installed base.  I mean, there were there were there were companies that were steel.  There is really companies that were that would would brag to me how they were they were, you know,  you know, electric image was a good example of three packages that I used to use a long time ago.  You were a big pusher of it.  I mean, the garage sold a lot of copies.  And I was always a big proponent that one of the reasons that they had they had a hard time getting into it was an incredibly great 3D app.  Or still is. I mean, but they have they have they've had a hard time going where something like Maya or 3D studio has gone in a lot of ways.  And I believe part part of it is because specifically because they were so good at protecting the code.  You know, Maya, you know, that it's very, very easy, you know, to to move that along.  And they know that eventually you're going to end up in a place where you're making money, where you're in a big company and you're going to have to buy it.  You know, and a lot of people, a lot of companies will not they won't say that in public, but they'll they'll be kind of like, you know, it's it's you know, that's what's going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ironically, Photoshop and CS2 has now put a very onerous copy protection system in.  They've got you've got to do the thing that you do with Windows.  You've got to phone home and get it authorized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What do you think? Well, the stuff that we've been talking about with, you know, Sony, you know, Toby's been doing for five years.  Well, that's by the way, that's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Every time you run Photoshop, even the older versions, it would phone home and you can and you can take it out.  Now, they wouldn't they didn't prosecute anybody.  They never pursued anybody. But it just gave them statistics about how many pirated software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they just wanted to know what was going on.  So they never actually done anything with it.  But it was there and people noticed it and you could take it out.  I mean, you went in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what I did. Those downloading all files and yeah, yeah, yeah.  No information has been transferred.  Right. Yeah, right. Just your IP.  So you had the fact that you exist.  Yeah. Well, that's really I think what they were looking at.  Yeah. Well, is this a registered copy?  No. Or does this one serial number?  How many copies are registered this serial number?  Yes, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Three thousand. But the thing is, is that as they as they starting to tighten that up, the real question is going to be, does it hurt?  When they start tightening up and if it does, I start to open a window because right now Photoshop is ubiquitous.  I mean, I do when I talk about Photoshop on tech TV, I assume that it's about anybody who's serious about doing photos is going to have it because they can either buy it or they can find it.  You know, and so I just make the assumption that that's there.  If I if I can not no longer make that assumption, do I start showing GIMP on tech?  You know, do I show start showing free or something free or something easier aperture or whatever it is?  I mean, other things start to open up as they start to tighten it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, Doug, you think we should always give away to it without DRM and should always be free?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I'm saying is if you want your content to have the highest possible value in the universe, you give it away because.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that may not be what you're optimizing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think in this case, what about this model?  We always give away the audio for free and then there's other versions like a video version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, in fact, we do a new thing on IT conversations where we'll if you want it fast, we'll sell it to you.  So if we do a conference, we might deliver all of the audio from a conference for one hundred dollars a week or two after the event.  Or it's going to come out for free one program a week over the next six months.  You're doing that with this conference? No, I don't like that.  No, this one's going to be all free. Really? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's not charging for it. No. Are you going to?  But you're not going to offer it all at once. That's the weekly download.  That's right. OK. So if you do and there were some very good sessions at the podcast expo, if you want to get those, they will be available.  And I think we'll be on IT conversations over the next six months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah. And but we did it's been an experiment.  We did accelerating change 2005, 24, 95, 24, 99 for all 25 sessions.  PopTech, which is a major conference a couple of weeks ago, we rolled that out for one hundred dollars for all of them.  Or you can wait and get them one a week. And how are the numbers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, not exact numbers, but but were the numbers reasonable?  Were there a lot of people that reacted to that or was it a handful?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I can tell you it's very low. I mean, it's an experiment for us.  The only one we have numbers on is accelerating change.  We got less than 100 purchasers.  But we didn't promote it very hard.  It was in fact, we tried to downplay it because we weren't quite ready technologically with the payment mechanism.  So it's just happening and we're learning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's a good model, though. I mean, it sounds very reasonable to me.  People will pay a little bit for value added.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, that's why I think the New York Times is it backwards.  They're charging for their archives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what and that's interesting, isn't it? Yeah.  Newspapers tend to charge for the archives.  Today's stuff is free.  You think they should charge for today's stuff because it's more valuable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  On that basis, they should be able to give me the newspaper for free.  Right.  Deliver the Times to me for free.  And if you want an old newspaper, it'll cost you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, there you go.  Yeah, they've got it backwards, don't they?  There must be some thinking behind that.  No, it's a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  There must be a reason they do it, though.  I don't know. I mean, you think of the Times as being sort of the paper of record for the nation.  And it's not any longer.  It's the paper of record for this last two days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Consider your experience is that a link will go buzzing around the net with an article in the newspaper.  Well, you want to read it because it's newsy right now.  That's when it has value.  If you're hit with like a forum saying, oh, no, you've got to log in and this is premium content.  It's like, OK, I'll go find it somewhere else.  Right. I'll get the Reuters.  So perhaps their logic is if they do let people get in on the new stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They get the promotional value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They get connected.  And it's like, oh, OK, you know, maybe this is a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have bought a few articles, but rarely will I buy an older article.  I guess they don't see it really as a revenue stream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Don't people send you links?  You know, there was an article about someone in the Times.  Here's the link. Read it.  And you just go to the page that says just it's free, but just register.  Oh, God, I just can't be bothered.  Bugged me not.  Bugged me not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Speaking of bugged me not, Joseph Klein is here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  A little biblical. I prefer Joe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Joe. Joseph Joe.  He's an interesting business model.  He does voice work for podcasts.  That's right. Tell me about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, I'm like you, Leo.  I'm an old radio hound dog from the old school.  Listen to him. Hey, you give him the good mic.  Yeah, you know, I'm jealous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sitting here. I've been looking.  Come here. Sit over.  This is the aisle that I won.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, come here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Play interstitial music now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I started doing it.  I started doing Christmas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Give the man with the pipes the microphone.  That's the key. Hello.  Isn't that nice?  Can you believe how much better?  Oh, my God. He sounds just like you.  I was jealous. I was sitting behind you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It was so jealous.  And then you sat me down and gave me that little thing.  That is a great. And Adam Curry has one.  That's right. So we'll see if he sounds better.  I use a Rode microphone, the Rode NTK.  It's a great tube mic made by a tube.  It's a tube. They call it a valve now.  It's a tube microphone.  Yeah, it's a valve microphone.  It's being made by an Australian company called Rode.  And I'm sure a lot of podcasters out there are real familiar with the Rode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So do people pay you money to do voice work for them?  Not anywhere near enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  No, no, they do.  And give me an example of the kind of thing you would do.  Oh, OK. This welcome to this week in tech.  There you go. You got it.  You could use that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just bought and we were talking about this earlier,  the guy who does You've Got Mail for for America Online,  Elwood Edwards does for 10 bucks.  He'll work and I just bought it. I don't have it with me, but I'll do it.  I'll email it to you. You can drop it in here.  I'll give you a better one. OK. You've got mail.  I had him record. You've got mail. You tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Anyway, our company, we started a new company.  I'm an old radio hound dog, as I said, and back in the 70s and 80s,  I was the leading producer of commercials for record albums.  All the old Casablanca record and film.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, my America Capital Warner Brothers did all those disco.  I sure did. I sure did.  I won three or four three three Clio Awards and four international  broadcasting awards doing all that stuff.  And it was it was lots of fun.  Don Summer is that's right.  Well, we used Ernie Anderson on all those ads who passed away.  As you know, Ernie Anderson back in 97 and his son is, of course,  Paul Thomas Anderson, as a matter of fact, next to ABC.  You know, he did the love.  I think I did more spots with Ernie for Casablanca.  He was their house and then any other production.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People probably don't know his name.  Those of us in the business do, but they know his voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Do you know who his son is? Paul Thomas Anderson.  That's what I just said.  Yeah, yeah. Boogie Nights. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He he he's also the one who did the visa.  It's everywhere you want to be.  He did so many great lots of stuff. He was he was great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  But I left that business.  I just got tired of it. I got tired.  I was old school and I dropped out of school.  I got tired of it after doing 1200 commercials.  I just got tired of it.  And I was kind of an old school dropout until recently.  Late last year, I discovered podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what does an old radio guy think of this new media?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Absolutely fantastic. It woke me up.  It sent me back to school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, those of us who love audio and I know you're that way, too, Doug,  are excited about this because it's a renaissance of a medium.  Absolutely. That has really been kind of left by the wayside.  That's great. Yeah, absolutely.  And now I'm hoping there are all these young people who are going to start doing audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I'm back in the bedroom.  I'm back in the bedroom studio with my computer.  I don't know if I want to know that.  Actually, you know, my work's in the bedroom.  But my computer does more than a million dollar recording studio that I use to own.  And so what happened was I went back to school and I learned digital audio.  This was a few years ago.  Kind of was getting interested and excited about that.  Then this podcasting thing came along.  And I said to myself, you know, there's a need for some good voice work out there.  And people are amateurs.  They are doing their podcasts and they're amateurs and they're not too structured.  Nothing wrong with having a kind of a very professional voice intro.  Very professional promo.  Can make a big difference. So we started a company.  I have a partner named Bill Fortune, who is a voice guy and former news anchor  person out of Chicago, Illinois, and nationally known disc jockey and voice guy.  And we formed the podcast voice guy.  How much is this going to cost?  How much you got? You know, that's a tough one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You pay by the word. You pay them by the minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You know, people are asking me that all the time.  We're going to probably start with rates as low as seventy five dollars.  But if you need three or four pages read, of course, it's going to be higher than that.  But how do people where do people go?  Www.podcastvoiceguys.com.  And our website's under construction.  It'll be up and running next week.  So be patient.  Yeah. A few twits might be visit.  Look, looks like I'm going to probably need a completely different server than the one I've signed up.  Hurry, hurry, hurry. Oh, well, please don't go there yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Joe, thanks for coming by.  And it just it's really interesting to see there are a number of models for how this how this can work.  The keynote address from Jason Calacanis, who is the guy who made twenty five million  dollars selling Weblogs Inc. to AOL, was a series of business plans that won't work for podcasting.  Did you see that? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  What do you think? Well, well, I like the contrast between Jason's presentation and yours.  Yeah. Well, that was that was the best of all.  We're going to swap seats right now.  If the podcast network, you have to give it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry. Darn it. I have to give this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I mean, as as much as, you know, Jason is probably well known as, you know,  the the aggressive guy in our community, the guy who's makes the money.  He puts it out there and he does it.  And you sort of love him and you hate him all at once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  His company, Weblogs Inc., started in Gadget.  That was the big that was, I think, what made him the most.  Yeah, it was in Gadget. But there were a number of other blogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I think it's still a big one, probably.  Although his his auto auto blog is really popular, too.  But you know what I liked about Jason's presentation was he didn't hold back.  And he said some very unpopular things that were true.  You know, he's willing to say he points out, you know, you're not going to make money  doing this and you're not going to make money doing that.  You know, get used to it. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And he's got 25 million. He could be unpopular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The truth is, I kind of said the same thing, but in a little bit different way.  I don't think people should be worried about making money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, I think what he was he was saying,  this won't make money and you're saying that's fine.  This is what you said. This is what I want to do. Right.  That's why you do it for Twitter.  You know, we're not bringing in sponsors and we're proud of it. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How are we going to be able to listen to your your keynote?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think we're going to podcast. I have to ask Tim Berkwin.  He said that they are recorded and I think I want to be able to put it up on the net.  Do you guys have it? I will have it. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, we should do we.  We have to say Taylor has the video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's kind of cool. Taylor went to a lot of the sessions and and what you know,  I like I respect him working because a lot of organizers said, no,  you can't have independent video or audio recording in here.  I'm going to do something with these tapes. He let people in to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  He gets it. Tim definitely gets it right.  So you're going to offer it. So what should we do? We'll have it. Well,  what we can do. How quickly will you have it?  Because I'd like to put it up. Why don't we?  Well, I have complete control over the sequence of releases.  Well, we can. No, we don't have to do it.  We can link to you. I will be glad to link to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we'll work that out. I'll put it in the radio.  Leo, your radio Leo feed contains everything that I do, and it sometimes  often cross links to other podcasts.  So what I'll do is cross link to IT conversations from that.  And we'll just talk about that.  You just live down the road. So cool.  Another interesting idea for podcasting pod cashing.  Have you ever heard of geocaching? Geocaching.  I love geocaching. You seem like you'd be a geocacher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My my main tech support guy is like a fanatic.  He'll like wherever he is, he'll and if he's called me on the phone, says,  OK, put in this code. And so I'm his interactive web guy on call.  It's like, Greg, where the hell are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So tell us. So in your words, Steve, how what is geocaching?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's this bizarre, serious community people who, well, from my standpoint,  in my words, cookie cookie, who hide random little boxes of things  like behind telephone poles and under literally under rocks.  And then they give they give the GPS coordinates  and sort of make puzzles out of them.  And it's just sort of a strange outdoor hobby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Sonny Portacio is here and he is from geocaching.  I'm sorry, pod cashing dot com.  Pod casher, pod casher dot com, kind of an unusual twist on this whole.  Hey, Sonny, welcome. Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, my name's Sonny.  My wife, Sandy and I have done a homegrown podcast all about geocaching.  So you were geocachers before.  Oh, yeah, we're avid geocachers, one of those kooks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it sounds really cool.  And it's it's a way to use a GPS device.  I mean, you have a GPS device.  It's a way to use it. You get outside.  Is it is it the settings that where these things are hidden isn't always urban.  Sometimes it's in the country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you know, it can be anywhere.  Actually, you're probably driving past geocaches all the time.  They're out under bushes.  They could be hidden in urban settings, though.  You just walked on one and you didn't know it.  Actually, there's one about 200 feet away outside the parking lot.  Is there really? Oh, they're everywhere.  There's 200000 all over the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Oh, so these don't disappear.  It's not like a treasure hunt where someone finds the treasure, takes it away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, the idea is anybody can hide one and then you post the coordinates to a website.  And then once the coordinates are posted, anybody can do a search.  And if you went to the website and did a search by your zip code,  you'd find there hundreds around your home.  And so really what our website is, ours, our podcast is about  is covering all the things about geocaching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So is there any overlap between geocaching and flash mobs?  Flash, Bob's, Flash, Bob's.  Oh, flash bobs is, you know, all of a sudden, you know, 5000 people show up  at the same time at the same place because they got it on SMS.  Oh, no, there's got to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is what is not catching?  Well, podcaching our our site, basically we cover news, tips and tricks,  tools of the trade. And so we're we're avid geocachers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we so it's podcasting for the geocaching audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly. We cover it for newbies and introduce people to the sport or hobby.  And we also do it for the veterans, too.  We give them tips and tricks.  But the one is a twist. There is a twist.  Go ahead, tell them.  The one interesting thing that we've done and more people are starting to do it  is instead of hiding the podcaches and having people find it using a GPS receiver,  we're giving audio clues.  So now what people are doing is downloading our files  and then getting audio clues on how to find these secret hidden caches.  And the reason the caches don't disappear is because the rule is once you find a cache,  you're supposed to open it up, sign the logbook, put it back in there  and then put it back so other people can find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's the kind of nice twist that makes it really makes it work,  because if they disappear, then it's no fun at all.  But this way you look at the logbook and you see all the people who found it.  Exactly. And sometimes you put new stuff in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, the idea with the the little treasures is you switch the toys.  So you pick something out and you can put something in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And also, Greg will call me and he'll say, OK, go to this page on geocaching.com.  OK, now read me the hints again. Yeah.  Because like, yeah, he can't.  He's like been wandering in a field for like an hour.  It's like, OK, wait, was the rock gray or white?  It did. Oh, it's a good.  Well, it says gray, Greg.  And 1900 people have found it already.  I don't know what your problem is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's the other thing is that there's a list online of how many people have already been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly. It's a sport that's really easy to get into,  because if you're just new at it and want to do the easy ones, you can.  They rate them at different levels, but the hard ones, they can be tough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And he'll say, like, OK, when was the last person?  I said, well, let's see.  Two hours ago, someone was there.  Yeah. So it's still warm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Sonny, what's an example of a hard one?  What makes it hard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, there are these things called multi-caches or puzzle caches.  Let me give you a contrast.  And an easy one would be where you just look at your GPS receiver  and it tells you this one's four miles away.  So you get in your car, you drive to it, get out of your car, you realize it's 500 feet away.  You track it down. You look under a bush or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And on the other side of some fence, you get around a difficult one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And there's two reasons why it might be difficult, either because the cache itself is difficult to find  or the terrain is like really difficult, like underwater on the side of a mountain, things like that.  Underwater. Yeah.  They have scuba ones. Scuba catfish.  Do they warn you beforehand? Yes, they do.  And so you can see. Oh, gee, I forgot my aqua lung.  Yeah.  Bring wetsuit.  But a multi-cache or a puzzle cache is where you have to figure out several stages  and use, you know, different things to finally get the final coordinates on it.  So what do you need to get started?  Really, all you need is, you know, a GPS, which they're about $100 now for the cheap ones,  and a sense of adventure. And that's it.  And, of course, podcacher.com.  Podcacher.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because without that, you're not really podcaching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, with that, you've got everything you need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, that's great. Well, congratulations on the success of the podcast.  And I think it's really it's like the knitting thing.  It's a perfect example of how this is long tail stuff.  Yeah. And it's wonderful. Yeah. It's really great.  Sonny, thanks. And where's your wife?  She's right behind you there. Well done.  Don't lose him. OK. Next time.  How many people like the twit logo?  Yeah, I do. Yeah, it's a pretty good logo.  Yeah. The person who designed it is here, you know.  All right. Would you like to meet her?  Yes. All right.  Dorothy, come on over here.  I was going to suggest that.  Come on, Dorothy.  Dorothy Yamamoto.  Now, you know that we had a kind of it wasn't an official competition,  but it was we asked people to submit logos and we got a lot of logos.  And I talked to a number of designers, including Lori LeBeau Walsh,  who is also here. I don't know if she's still here.  But Lori told me now, make sure you consider when you look at these logos  that it might be in all forms and fashions.  It might be a bumper sticker, might be on a T-shirt.  So don't make it too complicated.  It has to be simple and have personality.  And then all of a sudden I opened this file  from Dorothy Yamamoto of TigerBrightGraphics.com and it's TigerBright.com, right?  Yeah. And I went crazy.  I thought this is it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I outed Dorothy on Thursday. Yeah.  She was at the podcast academy and Digital Bill and Mr.  Mark were there and they were talking about great logos and they singled out  the Twitter logo as being a great logo.  And I said, you know, the creator of that logo is here in the academy today.  And she was she was trying to hide in the corner.  Totally unexpected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's also a member of Pixelcore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I have to say that the other thing about it, the logo,  it's not just that it looks cool, but it's well designed.  Like we're having a lot of fun now that we got it in 3D.  But the thing is, the design just continues to work, which is a good sign of a good logo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a good logo. Very simple.  Now, tell me a little bit how it came about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know, initially you indicated you wanted just a simple design  up on your on the blog. Right.  And so I listened to the client  and based on the theme of technology, I thought, well, what's what's very basic?  Electronic symbols.  So I Googled  and found a site that had all these symbols.  And I thought, well, let's find something with sort of a face.  And so this I don't know what you call it, a bell gate or an AND gate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's an AND gate.  Is that what it is? Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, so it's inclusive. I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it had some association with sound.  So I thought, OK, I'll go with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's an AND gate. Yeah.  And now and then we turn it on its side to make it the little twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that was your but it does both.  I saw it worked.  I thought a little bug, a little twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So I actually think of that as being a twit.  It is a that is what a twit is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I'm hoping with thanks to the Pixelcore, that twit's going to come to life  down the road with little movements and its little feet are just scurrying around  with links and stuff. And you're going to see a lot more stuff.  I've also we're also going to start doing twit merchandising so people get twit.  I have some great twit decals that you can put in your window.  I sent them to you, Dorothy, so you'll be getting that box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that box. It's coming. I promise.  And I sent it. I'm sure I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a hat.  There's I mean, it just really works in a lot of different forms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  The sound that a twit makes is a Twitter makes a twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's perfect. There you go.  So, Dorothy, are you a professional graphic artist?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I'm trying to get into it.  You're kidding. Yeah.  Isn't it? Well, I retired from my day job a few years ago.  And then, you know, I hit the recession came on,  so I couldn't get any graphic design work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tigerbright.com.  If you want the twit logo designer to do your logo, we thank you so much.  It is just the cutest little bug.  I just love it and it fits us perfectly. OK.  All right. Now let's bring in somebody.  I want to read you something. This is from Paul McCartney.  You heard of him. Yeah, I went to the McCartney show.  And was that show? It was conservative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah. I went Monday night in San Jose.  Sing a lot of I was in the seventh row.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's old now, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  He's our age. No, he's older than us.  Yeah. Yeah. He's getting on.  It was a low risk event. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, he sang yesterday and I told my wife, I said yesterday is going to be in the

Transcript:  the lineup.  No, what do you call it? The end encore.  Oh, sure enough.  And they'll do Live and Let Die with pyrotechnics. Sure enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've never seen that.  I mean, one of the great concert moments of all time for me was seeing Paul McCartney  and the lights go down on the stage to bring out a stool, a single spot,  a guy on a guitar singing yesterday.  And that's the guy who wrote it.  I don't know. Maybe low key to you.  I didn't see this concert. This was a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I also saw him in 1965.  Well, that's different at the Cow Palace.  Oh, the Cow Palace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anything or you're still ringing from the screens?  Well, this is what Paul McCartney said about our next guest.  He says the band Stedman have the songs, the musicianship, the energy  and the enthusiasm to blow the top off any club arena  or if given a listen, have that rare ability, the rare quality, the ability to deliver.  I like this band.  Paul McCartney said that about Simon Stedman and his band. Simon, welcome.  Thank you. Hi.  And that's an example of you know, you were a signed artist, right?  You had two records to your.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've had actually had two major label deals and both imploded  because of company mergers.  So you decided to go the indie route.  We were we went indie after the first major label deal went wrong.  And then we actually came to come over to America and moved over to America  and got another major label deal with a lecture,  which seems to be the kiss of death for us, the major label deals,  because they then let you doesn't exist anymore.  Basically, we turned up to our label one morning and we're like, where is everybody?  Oh, they've been fired. Yeah.  And we were like, so what does that mean for us?  Oh, well, you're going to be going to Atlantic.  We were like, well, they don't know who we are and they have nothing invested in us.  So we want out.  Twelve months later, we got out.  And then and then now we've gone into again.  And basically, I'm putting up our entire back catalog up to this point,  which is basically one hundred and fifty downloads free, absolutely free for no reason.  I my philosophy is give before you take.  And we I want to just give as much music away free.  And then there are donations set up at the site, which is w w w dot Stedman Band dot com.  It's T E A D M A N. That's right. Yeah.  And you can go to the site, get anything you want for free.  It's C.C. license. Do what you want with it. And we're you know, we're we're getting so much.  So many hits as a result.  We got Boing Boing a couple of weeks ago and that the hits at the site went through the roof.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've talked at the expo to several different artists, Brother Love and some other people  who have really found success through podcasting, through Podsafe music, through giving away music.  Yeah, it's really a model that works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think that for a new band, particularly, it's it's the only way to get your music out there to people  because, you know, who's making who's making the biggest fuss at the moment about downloading?  It's the record companies because they're losing out money.  But the new bands are getting listened to and they're getting heard by people that probably ordinarily wouldn't hear them.  You know, so it's it's a great the record companies need to wise up to the fact that giving away music is not bad.  And it's not about 30 second samples.  It's not about one song.  Give away a whole album because the band are going to make money.  I mean, we as a band made all of our money from film licensing, TV licensing, touring merchandise, but mostly film and TV.  Really? Yeah.  And never from record sales.  You need to make you need to sell 250,000 records before you see any money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's also the classic model anyway for for musicians, right?  Even when they're signed to big labels, they're not making that much money from the label.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You don't make any money from a record deal unless you're like Madonna, Coldplay or U2.  You know, that's the bottom line.  We're in the nature.  Even they have to make money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, I think it's just neat to see a sign, a band that's been signed.  It has a major label, have a major label to to also go this room.  Yeah, if you're young and there's no other way to do it.  But you probably could have found another label you decided not to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Absolutely. I mean, what we could have.  But, you know, labels are in such a hole at the moment.  I mean, they're not signing and they're not and there's no such thing as a publishing deal anymore.  People don't really get publishing deals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's the only way to really make money is if you own the publisher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Pretty much. You've got to bear in mind is publishing and record companies are pretty much loans.  You're pretty much getting a loan.  And with a record company, when you pay back that loan, you're still only earning a minor percentage of CD sales.  So, you know, I was considering doing micro payments at the site, putting up new songs and doing like an iTunes just myself.  I figured first things first, give away as much as you can free.  I mean, one hundred and fifty downloads is ridiculous, really.  But we were like, whatever, it doesn't matter. Let's just do it.  And so we gave all this stuff away free.  Are you getting Airplay, Radio Airplay out of this?  We're getting podcasts going. It's going crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think radio no longer breaks music, but podcasts do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See, the thing about radio is it's all it's all restricted by advertising, corporate payola.  You know, we when we were when we were signed, we were the number three most added in the country.  And we were trying to get played on radio stations.  I was traveling around radio stations playing my guitar.  Basically, you know, you go and talk to people you might not necessarily like and try and persuade them to play your music.  Right. And we were like, are you going to play us?  And he said, oh, well, Blondie played it paid us four thousand dollars to pay their singles.  So they're probably going to get played and you're not.  And we're like, well, and I used to I mean, I was the promo guy right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, not not only was a promo guy, I used to be a music director.  Right. Right. Alternative. I have been a director.  So I was my job was to, you know, when Nirvana and Pearl Jam came out and that was my job was to pick these bands.  And there was an enormous amount of pressure.  I mean, half the time you were picking songs because it was the right thing.  But half the time we were looking at the charts like who's going up, who should we make sure that playing who are we going to be able to self reinforcing?  If you're not in that group, it was all about height because what we would do is we'd be sitting here and I'd be looking at as the as if you saw something moving on the charts.  If it had a bullet, you know, moving up, moving up the charts and you were like, well, maybe I should put that in.  And if you put it in and then reported that, then it would go faster.  And it was it was all on the on the on the turn.  And there were a lot of really bad songs that just got a lot of hype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the thing. It's a lot to answer for.  Full of crap music is out at the moment that's getting airplay.  You know, I mean, that's what's so great about podcasting is that people can play whatever the hell they want without any restrictions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It may be a crappy song, but at least you didn't pay for it.  Right. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I think that also the thing is, is that I think that the record companies are shooting themselves in the foot when they when they won't let anyone like people in part want to do podcasts.  I want to do radio podcasts, you know, of new music, breaking new music.  But you can't you can't you can't you can't put it in because they won't let you promote their bands.  Yeah, that's that's true. And that's the and that's the thing that's insane.  And then you have the you know, you have the groundswell that's starting to start bands like yours starting to just say, you know, we're going to start bypassing that.  Then you also have, you know, the MySpace.  MySpace has been amazing for us. Yeah.  They're selling, you know, you know, and and but it's it's allowing it's allowing the consumers to step in.  And actually start to choose what they want rather than, you know, being told what we're going to buy later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Absolutely. And if a band if a band loves you, they will support you if someone just is a casual listener.  They're probably not going to buy your record anyway. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So yeah. And there's and there's definitely a lot of bands that if I heard their music and I was listening to it, I'd send them a donation.  I'd send them money going. I think it's going to be very good.  I want you to keep on doing that for a lot of other bands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Simon, thank you for joining us. We really appreciate it.  We wish you all the best. Go to Stedman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The first round, one of many podcast celebrities I've wanted to meet have met here.  I was hoping Don and Drew would come by.  It's just been really fun. Hasn't this amazing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's been an amazing, amazing expo.  I'm just completely overwhelmed.  And I've told so many people, you know, a year ago, this wouldn't have happened.  To have this much capacity, you know, this much happened in a year, less than a year really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's my fervent hope that all the people who came here will come back, go out revitalized, energized,  charged up about podcasting, spread the word, tell everybody about podcasts,  maybe even make their own podcasts because that's really what it's all about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, we got to get it outside of the early adopters.  And I think we're on the cusp of it right now.  We're right on the edge.  Lots of tools and technologies coming available.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We've seen such growth in such a short period of time.  And I think we're about to see, I think as fast and as crazy as it's been, we ain't seen nothing yet.  That's for sure.  That's what I think.  Doug K, it's so great to have you.  Great to be here.  Thanks.  Thank you.  Conversations always welcome on Twitter.  And I got to meet Mr. Gibson.  Isn't he great?
