Transcript:  There's something about bloggers that are just there's a little they're a little weird. They're a little different  Is that not the case a little weird when you meet bloggers sometimes, you know, I think of people like Arrington  MG Siegler Robert Scoble people who are really known for being bloggers. They're all kind of twisted  You seem normal Jason, how does that happen? Thank you. Thank you. I don't know

Transcript:  There's also the what makes a good and these are all the most successful blurs  What makes a really good blogger is somebody who's kind of obsessed and has to post like I mean I think look at somebody like MG  I don't know a lot of them in person Scoble and MG. I know they're always thinking about what's my next?  I'm fine. I got to file that I got to file that MGs on vacation. They've been on vacation. They've been in the south of France. He's filing  Yeah, he's battling he is he's in a fight  Like MG take a rest  Apparently he tweeted I made up stuff at TechCrunch as a as a honey trap to catch people  I would make up fed. It's a short tweet. I don't have to find it, but it's a very short tweet  I'd made up facts and then somebody  Would you we won't go into detail but somebody wrote writes a blog post based on the whole thing  like MG Siegler made up made up stuff and that means anything he says you can't trust and of course  MG gets in a big battle with this person  That's to me. That's what makes a blogger is somebody is just like everything's personal

Transcript:  It started with  started with Marco Arment of  insta paper  and  He tweeted he was talking about it. So he wrote a blog post  He was the one who discovered because it happened to insta paper that app store binaries are crashing on launch Apple had trouble  With its app store something was wrong with a server and a lot of applications people would download the update and he said last night within minutes  of Apple approving my four point two point three update of insta paper  I was deluged by support email and Twitter messages from customers saying it crashed immediately on launch  Even with a clean install and so he was worried and so forth and it turns out it was it was an Apple server problem  So he wrote a big long blog post and then as often happens in the blogosphere. Everybody's got a file  And he and he then kind of  Slammed a number of news outlets like the next web  He slammed gizmodo he slammed the verge  All for use basically picking up his story without attribution now you've both been on short leads  You always have worked you worked for the LA Times CNN. I'm trying to mark million and and in Bloomberg  So you've always worked for me kind of more mainstream media. They have different standards. I would imagine

Start time: 385.74
End time: 397.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean it varies from place to place but at least at Bloomberg the the rule is to  Attribute everything and link and right. Yeah, I mean if I tried to do I mean I'm sorry we say it was reported earlier

Transcript:  I'm trying to so I you know, whenever we do a story I say and you know, and you know, Andrew Bojan is writing in pointer  Talk, this is actually a good article at pointer org about this whole  Fura

Start time: 412.18
End time: 422.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a little unusual though, especially for those sites and gadget in the verge. They always put that I mean, it's it's sort of  They'll source it at the bottom. It's like at the very bottom that no one ever looks at it  It's like this is a little link. You know what?

Start time: 422.36
End time: 517.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I really hate and both of the I don't know if the verge does it but in gadget does it terribly  They'll have a link to what they you know, report it in somewhere and it's a link back to their own page  It's always links. Yeah, because they cover everything right they never get back to the original  It's always more links to their sites. I understand page user are the currency here  So, yeah, I don't I don't I'm just looking at the tweet Mashable was decent says Marco Armit adding some original reporting  Gizmodo only cites the verge and the verge of course got its story from Marco  So mg sigler responds their friends  I used to love to plant one really weird bit of random information sometimes even false into stories to catch the rewrites now that by the way is something that map makers have been doing for centuries  You know, cuz you couldn't really map master notorious for getting copied so they put a fake island or place or street  I think they still do it in their maps and then if somebody else came out with a map the same thing  They'd look and see if that island or street or place was there and if it was you stole it  So it's a it's a it's a time-honored thing. Although you got to think in an article you probably shouldn't put falsehoods  Yeah, so then beta beat Adrian Jeffries in beta beat and this was really what got mg upset  Wrote a whole blog post unreliable narrators tech crunch blogger inserted random information sometimes even false into posts  picture of mg  From his LinkedIn not a lot of original research mg get all upset

Thank you. Mark Millian for not to shut it down  I'm just no no, I should but the the the Apple issue that sparked all this is news  I mean they you know Apple really downplayed this technical problem, which was completely on their end developer submitted updates  They tried to put some DRM on it automatically was that what happened? Yes  They have this automatic DRM system that they use submit an app update their servers  inject some code into it and then it goes on to the store and that  That  Mechanism was failing for a little while and they really downplayed this in the in the statements all things D that you just pulled up

Transcript:  And he says that to to to everybody this so easy to make mistakes if you're trying to rush that story out  Yep. Mm-hmm. It's so hard. Yep. I'm reading Walter Cronkite's  The biography of him that just came out which is great. I highly recommend it by a guy named Brinkley, but not the same and  They tell the story early in his career. He's working at a radio station in Kansas City WMCO  And or is it KMCO and he the owner of the station's wife called and said there's been a terrible fire two firemen have been killed  And the owner comes to to Walter Cronkite who is it in his he's I think he's 18  He's very nice 19 very young and says Walter  You got to go on the air immediately report the story and Cronkite says I'm not gonna say it unless I can confirm it  And he said the owner says you have to say this. No, I don't have to confirm it. He fought the guy the guy  Went on the air himself reported it  It turned out that it was a minor fire. Nobody was hurt. Nobody died. It was completely wrong  Cronkite was right fires Cronkite the next day  And and yeah, isn't it? It's a great story from his early days  It's a great story from his early days and that's one of the things Cronkite was so famous for was I am gonna fact-check  This boy we need that kind of standard today. I gotta say yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, not a great way to start your career 19 years old. He's in he dropped out of college  He's working in radio because and this was in the 30s is brand new nobody there's no such thing as radio journalism  He said I'm not gonna say it unless I can unless I can confirm it  All right, so here's now I'm gonna say a bunch of rumors that have no confirmation whatsoever so  Let's start with the Bloomberg Businessweek report  Amazon according to your colleague. Mm-hmm Tim Culpin Olga Kareef and Ashley Vance  planning a smartphone to vie  with the iPhone  This is according to this story Foxconn is working with Amazon on the device  Of course, they're sourcing it unnamed sources  Does that make sense? Does Amazon really want to make a smartphone? They're making the Kindle which is has been a success the Kindle fire for them  Do they want to compete with Apple? What do you think Jason?

Start time: 812.62
End time: 899.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, this is I totally believe that they are or at least I would not be surprised if they are and it makes sense  In a couple ways and it doesn't make sense in a couple others. So obviously it makes sense  They've set up the ecosystem right at the apps they have they have content  That's what a lot of people are doing on these devices. They could do that stuff  well, that's why a tablet made sense and and they got off to a  Decent start with the with the Kindle fire  But the thing is is there's a there's you know, 10 or 20 percent of the things  They're gonna have to do really well that are gonna be just way out of their league where which is working with carriers  Yeah, you know making sure that they have great call call quality on these things setting up a miss messaging infrastructure now cuz like  You know the sort of BBM I move I message kind of thing. You're gonna have to have something along those lines, right?  You there's there's some third party they could promote maybe instead  But anyway, there's these things that they're gonna have to do  That are so tangential to their business model and what they want to be about and being able to sell this device  Inexpensively and basically just make money on the content  You know that stuff is so out of their league and a tablet made a lot of sense because they could avoid most of that  once you get into a phone you have to deal with all this other stuff and  That that I think could be a step too far for them  Of course

Start time: 899.22
End time: 905.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I said that when we heard that Apple was gonna do a phone I said why would they want to get into that business boy was  I wrong on that

Start time: 905.47
End time: 914.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  well  I mean they had some some problems getting the innards right the antenna working and you know  iPhone was a terrible phone for at least the first couple iterations and making phone calls

Start time: 915.22
End time: 958.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, and in fact it was there were the relationships  They only had one carrier because they couldn't get the other carriers to take the iPhone Verizon famously turned it down  There's something though. That's new in the mix. That is a big big part of it and your colleagues in Bloomberg point this out  Now it's all about patents  You look at Samsung Apple is just you know Apple is blocked the Samsung Galaxy Nexus actually that stay is temporarily lifted  They've got a block on the Samsung Galaxy tab  You've got Motorola suing Apple  If you don't have a patent portfolio, do you could this is what's sad because I'd love to see Amazon enter the fray  I'd love to see some competition  I'd love to see some choice, but you can't because you'll see be sued out of existence because you don't have the patents

Start time: 960.46
End time: 984.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a good point. Yes, they are they're addressing that as  As was reported they have some they have made some patents in the small  Gadget space one of the most interesting ones which they won't be able to sue anybody over because nobody is doing this right now  but they filed for a patent where if you drop the phone a  parachute comes out  Jeff Bezos is named on that

Start time: 986.00
End time: 998.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The only patented that because the boss said hey, I got a good idea and instead of saying boss you're drunk  Yeah, right Jeff good idea let's patent a parachute for the phone  What if you're in a plane and you drop it?

Start time: 999.84
End time: 1023.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Amazon doing a phone the best news might be for Nokia Nokia or  Or Blackberry right rim. Yes, you know that those are they're both sitting on  you know gold mines to two gold mines of mobile patents and both of the companies are looking increasingly unable to  Innovate their way out of the funk that both of them are in and that patent, you know could be in a fire sale

Start time: 1024.42
End time: 1061.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's things they've got going and Amazon can't afford could afford to pick it up  They apparently according to the article in Bloomberg hired Matt Gordon  He was the senior director of acquisitions at Nathan mere volts patent troll company intellectual ventures  So this is a guy who specializes in acquiring patents for just this reason  That sounds like Amazon is interested and they do have Pat. They have the one-click patent  I mean, that's a good patent. They've actually done that. I think they've done a nice job with that using it defensively but not offensively  As they could against competing retailers  Yeah, Amazon has been involved in five patent related cases this year and 20 last year

Start time: 1063.92
End time: 1207.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So here's the other thing that could be a problem with with the Amazon doing a phone is the the Kindle fire  You know sold like gangbusters out of the gates  but that thing had sales of that thing has really fizzled and a lot of that has to do with  People are not a lot of people bought them and aren't using them  As you can see sort of the if you look at usage numbers like browser usage numbers  There are not lots of Kindle fires connecting to the web  In as large as numbers as there should be considering how many were actually sold  And so you have this tablet that people aren't really  using and so I don't know that they're not setting the world on fire with  With the device that they've got out there and supposedly they have an a 10-inch  Tablet or at least a revision to the 7-inch  Kindle fire or both in the pipeline  And so this is one of those areas where they may be getting a little too big to you know  Stretching themselves too fast because I think the Kindle fire has a lot of potential  There's some interesting things with that  But they probably should focus on making that really good first before  You know getting hot and heavy on the phone because that you're just gonna introduce so many more so much more  Complexity to and things are gonna have to do well here's the other interesting thing  I thought about the Kindle fire that that's come up with the kind of file  I think the Kindle fire has sold as many ink Kindle's as as tablets  Oh interesting as you look at the Kindle fire  I've seen this a number of people look at the Kindle fire and they're they're asking themselves  Should I buy this because this is you know real inexpensive tablet they look at the Kindle fire and then they say  You know what do I want to do with it's like I want to read and then I maybe read some  Websites and I just want to check some email once in a while, but you know it's like okay  Do I need to use this in full sunlight?  It's like yeah, I do and it's like well you know for mail  I've already got a smartphone if I already have a smartphone I can check my my mail on the smartphone  I can check my you know a couple websites there. I'm just gonna get the regular Kindle because you know  Because that makes sense I can just read on that thing  I've seen at least about half a dozen people go through this  You know I want to say in the last couple months where they've you know  We're thinking about the Kindle fire and ended up getting the regular Kindle instead in almost every case  So I think secretly this thing is actually helping  Them overall

Start time: 1210.00
End time: 1234.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That makes me 70 79 bucks that that little e-ink killed it kills cheap  It's effective does everything you want now  I gotta say that the Nexus 7 Google's new 7-inch tablet's got to be a threat to the Kindle fire. It's the same price  And it's better. It's faster. It's better. It's real Android so you can put real apps on it  So I think maybe Amazon you ought to pay attention to keeping the fire up to date and worry less about phones I

Start time: 1235.70
End time: 1244.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Think they just want to you know have a have a way to keep everyone within their ecosystem  Right as much as possible to the fire was to do wasn't it yeah? Oh, they're selling it at a loss

Start time: 1245.60
End time: 1255.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  According to analysts so that's exactly what it but interestingly Google's doing with the its own kit in Nexus 7  It Google says we don't make any money on it. It's all about the play store Asus doesn't make any money on it

Start time: 1256.12
End time: 1299.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google  Doesn't make any money on Android for the most part at all they don't need to yeah  They make money on other stuff, but the making a phone is really not that big a leap for Amazon they  I'm not worried about messaging infrastructure  They have some of the the strongest server infrastructure of anybody out there  And they're used by thousands of you talk about whisper net or no  You know having the the technical prowess to handle you know messaging and other things that are required for having a phone  They also have the carrier relationship with AT&T for the the  Yeah, and so the pieces are there that carries that network

Start time: 1299.50

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the thing where if you read it on one well first of all you can download it you get 3g  But also if you read it on one it syncs up with the other that's a little extra up front for the device

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I'll go I will go one more on the on the other you know play devil's advocate on the other side of the one  Thing I think Amazon does have going for it  And why do you think they will eventually be a player?  You know in the space even if I think it might be a little early for them to go into a phone is they are  user-experience  Nazis I mean they are so good at user experience you look at the site and  They they really still have the best and they don't get credit for it a lot the best  Ecommerce you know sales  Experience of any company on the web and really just one of the best user  Experiences of anybody on the web and I do think you're gonna see them be able to transfer that  To to the device space and and take some of the stuff  They've done you know you look at that all the things that they've pioneered in terms of you know you talked early about one click  Leo you talk about one click you know  What a brilliant?  Marketing thing that is I mean it's a good user experience. All right. I'm gonna throw

Start time: 1369.00
End time: 1388.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm gonna throw you a monkey wrench  What if the Kindle fire 2 is the phone and what if it's not a phone?  What if what if it's using 3g and Wi-Fi and Skype or something like it tango?  Let's say tango because Skype's owned by Microsoft to provide phone like service. Maybe that's what they're talking about. What about that?  Would that be a good product?

I think I think this is what I think maybe this is the Kindle fire 2  We're we're getting we're getting distracted by the phone part of it  Maybe it's a somebody. I don't know. I think you could do that  I think I would I wouldn't be surprised people people using these inexpensive tablets as phones more and more  What do you think?

Oh, there's a Jeff Bezos is patent by the way  It is not a parachute it's an airbag  Well a parachute I think that'd be a little hard  But an airbag boy you deploy now it must add it considerably to the weight and the complexity of a smartphone to have an airbag  Because by the way you either you have an airbag on every side  Or you have built-in jets to orient it and in fact they've decided to have the portable device reorientation element  to make sure that the  Phone comes airbag side down  Otherwise the airbag just fires it into the concrete. That's no good sure  Side impact airbag no yeah, there's a propulsion element an absorbing structure a real force side and a spring I  Don't think Wow  This is a lot man, and I have to feeling that they will never really I wish there were a picture though I

Transcript:  What did he say he went on a long rant? I don't remember I I do remember  Specifically the the tablet complaint. I think he also you know  Took some knocks at rim  and  Nokia for having trouble in phones and not being able to get developers on but the tablet in particular  He said seven inches is not big enough to do  Good apps on a tablet and that he said users would need to sandpaper their fingers down in order to use a seven-inch tablet

Transcript:  He also said that you'd never have video on a iPod screen is too small  I know I know but this is a little different. This is an analyst call. This isn't like some interview with the press. This is making  So here's the thing now. I've seen a post back. I saw a post today that said oh no  It's if it doesn't mean that they're denying what Steve said  It's just that you know  Steve's lives on and if Steve the guy actually said in this post if Steve were looking down from heaven  He'd be blessing this 7-inch tablet. I don't think so  I don't think so. I think it's much more likely. This is Tim Cook saying hey Steve's gone. It's my company  We see the fire doing well not that well  I iPad is still what 80 or 90 percent of the market, right?  We're worried maybe a little bit about the Nexus 7. I don't know  Why is Apple why if Apple is indeed doing a 7-inch tablet, and I'm not convinced they are why are they Jason?

Start time: 2177.88
End time: 2240.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  One reason cost I think it's it's 300 350 bucks  They if they can sell a tablet at 300 to 350 bucks  Then they would probably wipe up a lot of the rest of the tablet market, right?  I I gotta think that's the reason I also think that maybe  The thinking is that there's some product for them  That's kind of like a little bigger iPod touch where they can get you know  Five inches seven inches eight inches and and maybe they can take a lot of what they can migrate those people that were buying  iPod touches because a lot of those people those iPod touches the top end of that product right was $400 at one point  At the cheapest even it's a lot of it's like 299  I think it's like can we take that market and migrate them to a tablet and you know keep cash and checks?  And basically not do anything different than we're doing with the iPad the regular iPad  Because I think what if they're gonna do this they're gonna make it the same screen kind of resolution to the apps essentially are the same

Start time: 2241.04
End time: 2274.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Nobody has that that's a good point because there's another thing Apple gets takes hit you know hits Android about his fragmentation  There's too many sizes even on that call. Yeah, there's another good reason and so this would this so you're saying what will what will the resolution be?  The same as it would be the same as the old iPad 1024 by 768  Which is yes now the Nexus 7 is 1280 by 720. It's full HD resolution  Is that right 1280 by 720? Yeah, 16 by 9  Yeah, 16 9 so you're saying Apple make a squarish one before 3. Oh, yeah

Start time: 2274.74
End time: 2277.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they've always done the squarish with with the iPad with the

Start time: 2279.44
End time: 2301.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But I think they'll do it so that they don't have to so they're not fragmenting  Yeah, yeah exactly so they'll do it so something like they'll do  Like what Mark said that like the old the resolution of the old iPad so that all the Apple's apps that are tablet apps now  They'll you know you'll be able to run them on the little one if they are doing a little one so that would make sense

Start time: 2301.76
End time: 2321.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it's 1021 so it's 1024 by 768. It's the same size  Resolution is the iPad one and two so all of those apps will work any retinized apps won't work as well  Well, I think the retina can down scale down. Yeah, because it's half. It's one half. So that's easy. Yeah  What about Steve's complaint that the icons in this text is too small you have to

Start time: 2335.26
End time: 2362.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Mean he say he did say tablet apps. So okay fine  You know the apps are a little better, but so many of the apps on the are on the phone or you know people  It's not like a lot of these apps are tablet only, you know, they're also they're they're they're iPhone plus tablet  There are a few that a handful, you know that are that are tablet only but but but most of these are are  You know, they're in two sizes, right and and a lot of them are great on the iPhone or at least almost as good on the iPhone

Start time: 2370.02
End time: 2386.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was skeptical for a while  My colleagues just reported something last week and their sources are solid on that one that the  Apple is doing a tablet and planning to release it and it's going into manufacturing  7 to 8 inches like both in Brazil and China

Start time: 2387.64
End time: 2406.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Foxconn, but also Brazil. That's what Mac rumors is saying or Mako Takara  And you know why they do it in Brazil Apple has a big iPad plant in Brazil too is because  Taxes are cheaper and if you sell it in Brazil Brazil puts a huge tariff if you make something outside of Brazil  Foxconn has factories in Brazil. Yeah. Yeah, so maybe this Foxconn but Foxconn Brazil. Mm-hmm

Start time: 2407.88
End time: 2450.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean just think if they if they sell this thing at $1.99  And you're a consumer that's not sort of ecosystem tied, right?  if you're if you're you're not already sort of locked down in one of the ecosystems and  You have to choose between the Nexus and the iPad  What are you gonna choose right a lot of them are gonna choose iPad just from name recognition  Trust  So I just think if they I think they know that they don't want people nibbling at the bottom of their market share  And they they can do it they could sell it in $1.99 and still make a pretty good or maybe  $2.49 and still make pretty good money on it. So I  Think it probably it makes sense from a business perspective

Start time: 2451.66
End time: 2456.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You got to add the Apple tax though, so it's so you're competing with $200 products so you can sell it for 300

Start time: 2457.78
End time: 2479.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  true, I don't  They wouldn't do what Amazon  Did or what Asus and Google is doing and sell it at loss. I don't see that ever happening. However, yeah Apple with its  Giganticness can undercut everybody because they buy memory  They buy everything in bulk and they have some of the best deals than any of their competitors in the industry

Transcript:  When Microsoft announced their surface  They couldn't make it out of aluminum because Apple had purchased all the aluminum in the world  So they went with magnesium  Wait a minute, they bought all the aluminum. Yeah, I'm sorry Steve. They bought all the aluminum. Well, what else is there? There's magnesium  Okay  Let's do that. Let's do that. It's the same stuff that you use to make road flares. That shouldn't be a problem  It'll be fine

Start time: 2507.00
End time: 2587.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, no what Mark's talking about is like the dirty little secret of this whole thing, right?  I mean it's that Apple is has such an advantage because of all the the the RAM and the flash that they buy  You know, they are they are so far  Ahead on profit margin of all these other companies because of that with the exception of Samsung because Samsung builds their own stuff  But so they're getting it at cost but they're still selling it to themselves in a sense, right?  One division to the other but Apple, you know other than Samsung, you know Apple has this  This huge advantage. It's what it really is  The reason why Microsoft had no choice but to make their own tablet because if they were  You know anything that HP I think they saw the writing on the wall anything that HP or Dell and anybody was gonna sell  Even if it was similar to the iPad it was gonna be 600 bucks  There is no way to get around it because of the Windows tax that they were gonna have to pay on top of it plus  You know the fact that they were not gonna be able to buy all of these things in in huge quantities  Even guys like HP and Dell it by you know already buying plenty of this stuff on their own  They're just not buying it anywhere near the kind of quantities that that Apple is and so  You know, it sets them up for such an advantage  I mean even at 249 they're gonna be making a lot more money on this thing than those other guys are at 199

I  Traditionally and this might be something new  This might be the it is the Tim Cook era  But traditionally Apple does not even look at what the competition is doing. They don't chase the competition  You know you see that now so much Microsoft, you know afraid of Apple Facebook afraid of Google Google afraid of Facebook  They they all seem to you know, Facebook buys  Instagram for a billion dollars not because they want it because they're afraid somebody else will get it Apple's never done that

Transcript:  Well, we'll talk about lawsuits  I do want a couple other Apple stories that are a little upsetting to me  One is Apple is getting out of the EP eat the EPA's  Environmentally friendly program Apple was one of the companies involved in creating the EP standard with the federal government and the EPA for easily recycling and  energy efficient electronics  Apple is now pulling all 39 of its products from the EP  Certification now iPhone and iPad never were because they were glued together. You could not recycle them  They weren't they were not recyclable and the speculation is that it's the retina display  MacBook that's to blame because it's all glued together  The this the glass on the screen is glued to the back the batteries are glued in you cannot recycle these without special tools  And I just think this is you know, I understand they did it because the market demanded it  We want thinner we want lighter we want better  But do we want it at the cut at this kind of a cost to the environment?  and I think I think it's kind of a shame that Apple has  Decided to pull out of these environmental standards and make base what is basically unrecyclable hardware

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do they offer sort of like I know they did this with the iPad you could bring an old iPad in they do donate it

Start time: 2744.14
End time: 2809.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Apple Apple I don't know about the donation  But you know you pay in a recycling fee whenever you buy an Apple product and in theory when you bring it to Apple they recycle  It now this is I don't think Apple wants to withdraw but I think that they they've made a decision here  You know the US government rules require 95% of the electronics it buys to be EP certified  So that's you're losing a huge government market many companies Ford  HSBC and Kaiser Permanente require that their CIOs purchase computers from EP certified sources  So you're cutting off a big market by doing this  It's pretty clear that  Apple has decided  More important that we make thin beautiful stuff and we worry about this recycling and I I think it's a little disappointing  It's a bad business move long term. I just I'm just disappointed. I think I expected better  So, you know, they make a big deal Steve Jobs would always do this. Oh, we're mercury free  We're gonna eat, you know work blah blah blah and they they actually showed that card at the  Yeah, yeah, I'd love to hear their response to this but it sounds to me

Start time: 2810.84
End time: 2837.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like so I don't think they'll they'll stop saying that they're an environmentally conscious company and all that  But on the other hand, you know, are they?  Well, are they is the question a lot of people have been asking but when you go to buy advice or you're researching on your  Computer, do you look to see whether it's EP certified?  I that's what they're saying almost had never heard of this before this is actually what they're saying and they're gonna still say green

Start time: 2838.02
End time: 2847.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because it's a meaning if you don't have a standard it's meaningless and they can say it there is no green standard  There's an EP standard then they don't want to adhere to that. I think it's it's a shame

Start time: 2848.24
End time: 2890.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I do think it's a why I said it's a bad business move is, you know companies like Ford  I was actually just at Ford a couple weeks ago. They're like doing I they're ready to do iPad deployments and  Stuff like that, you know, you also have companies in Europe and Asia, you know  They they actually care a lot about this stuff and and I think you're gonna see more of them  Partly for ma, you know for reasons of self-preservation, you know  Areas where it's it's more people densely populated and so some of these things have real consequences, right for for drinking water and and  Other things and so they really care about these kinds of standards and so  You know Apple I think you know may rethink this at some point

Start time: 2890.90
End time: 2903.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Transcript:  One other negative about Apple the first malware to hit the iOS app store  a program that's available on both Android and  iOS called find and call  It was secretly harvesting data from the users address books a Russian company  only available in the Russian apps Google Play Store, but available globally on the app store the  App would send information to the developer server, which would then spam users with text messages if you've been getting a lot of spam text  Maybe that's why  it advertises itself as a tool for aggregating in simple flame context and  It's a Trojan it's a Trojan the developer in a statement to Apple insider.ru said hey  He's bug we are in process of fixing  Mousse and squirrel are fixing now. Nobody says Natasha  That's you know, it's not a surprise. You cannot when you have that many apps.

It's like there's a moment in everybody  But it's real anyway, so Louis CK he sold a concert online right sold  Tickets direct now. He's fighting ticket scalping  He sells that so you know there's a huge problem with and if you've ever been to a recent concert  You know you can always go to stub hub or somewhere and get tickets for five times the face value  There's people's guys so he decided. I'm not gonna sell tickets through that standard ticket master. Whatever it is  He's selling the tickets himself, and he's putting this on the page  He's saying if you  Try to sell the ticket anywhere for anything above the original price  We have the right to cancel your ticket. We'll give you your money back. We're gonna cancel that ticket  This is something I intend to enforce  He doesn't he says this is this is to keep people from just buying the ticket and just flipping it for twice the price  from a thousand miles away  What's the result? Fantastic. He sold a hundred thirty five thousand tickets to 67 shows  He says that he has cut scalping over to over 96 percent he says of the hundred thirty five thousand tickets he sold  There are very few tickets on less than 500 available on all scalper sites  For more than the face price wow that's just fantastic wow for him. I love this guy  By the way six million dollars in tickets  He can buy that he can buy that seven million dollar Greenwich Village apartment that he was looking at  He's living in the dump he's looking this beautiful apartment. He asked the he says how much she says seven million  Okay  I feel bad for Best Buy cutting 650 Geek Squad employees  Moving on closing stores Thunderbird. I'm sad about Thunderbird.

That's a that's Apple apparently owns that  The big one though and the one that the judge kind of bought into was this 604 patent that lets the user  Execute a search goes out to multiple pages looks for the results and combines the results back into a single page and  Really, I think that's the Siri thing  I think that's really what Apple's trying to protect because Google on both these phones has this you know Google  Voice search capability yeah, and I think that's what anyway the judge  Said yeah, okay that does that's the one there's other there's others, but that's the one and  We are going to issue an injunction that  You cannot sell this phone in the US  Apple posted or was going to post or asked to post 96 million dollar bond  To make that injunction in effect and now the appeals court has said man that you know Google appeals and said wait a minute  Let's we're gonna look at this so you can temporarily at least buy the Galaxy Nexus  This is a this is a bitter fight the court  However said no you can still ban the Galaxy tab 10.1  So Google has put the Nexus back in what do you guys think I've talked enough about this on a Mac break weekly and elsewhere  Let me give you go.

Transcript:  That seems to me boy. That is a draconian solution it is and so but I know somebody that came up to me  A good friend last week and was saying he actually told me about the stories like I just heard about this this patent ban thing  He's like I need to buy the GSM version of the Nexus because I'm about to change jobs  and you know I'm not gonna be able to get it because  Because of this you know craziness, so I think that it really brings up two questions for me the whole Galaxy Nexus thing  one is it is is Apple still going thermonuclear on  patents because Tim Cook has kind of talked and sort of soft-pedaled some of this stuff and and given the impression like he's not real  crazy about all of the  The patent war stuff, and he doesn't you certainly get the impression that he doesn't think it's it's all that good for Apple  Long term, but you know there are these sort of you know hound dog lawyers that Steve Jobs  Hired and said you know go nuclear and a lot of this stuff has been in motion  And is it just that you know it is cook not crazy about it or telling them not go after new stuff  And this is just residual  You know  Cases that have been in the courts for a while  I'm just trying to figure out what what Apple stances on this the whole patent thing and it's a little unclear to me the  Other thing is that Google is are they still this vulnerable? I guess this isn't Google. It's more Samsung  Well, but it's ultimately look. This is Android. It's Android right Android's the problem here is Google still this vulnerable  I mean they bought Motorola  They've got all these patents from from Motorola which is by the way suing Apple  Yes, which is suing Apple and and Motorola has just a wonderful patent you know  Collection I mean they've got great stuff in there  So it just brings up a lot of sort of sticky questions to me is you know where where all of this stands is this?  Sort of the last gasp of some of the stuff that was  Put in motion by Steve Jobs  Or are we started or are these cases starting now to come to to fruition this sort of global thermal nuclear war that  You know jobs talked about that he was going to be doing with with Android  And it's just I don't know it's unclear to me is this the beginning or is this a last gasp of sort of some?  Of that stuff that was in play. Maybe you guys have thought your summer

It's a few million dollars  Apple's been sued in the past by Nokia which won  Nokia's suing Google and Asus  Microsoft got Motorola devices banned in the US for infringing patents publicly held companies  Pursue their own interests and the interests of their shareholders the truth is patent lawsuits are trivially inexpensive for big companies to pursue  Compared with the potential benefits. There's no downside to suing over patent infringement if you think you might win  He basically says it's their fiduciary responsibility their publicly held company. They got to sue they have no choice  This isn't about nuclear warfare. It's just what companies do

I love it. I would be very very pissed off  And the judge said well you got a pick because I can't hear all these cases  So which one do you want me to go after and Google or Apple said oh?  Go after that one and so they went after the Nexus, but had they gone after the s3 you might have heard a little howl  right

What if Google what if Google what if I mean and then I'm sure Motorola isn't probably contemplating such a suit  What Mike's point is and I think I do agree with him on this completely  He says it this all diverts opposition from the real problem  Which is a broken patent system and this I think we'd all agree on these suits are there perhaps for good reason  But they wouldn't be there at all if we didn't have software patents  We should not have them this cost of 29 million direct bit. I'm sorry 29 billion dollars last year in direct costs  Patent trolls are killing innovation. It's the patent system  That's broke we should all be fighting that because every every company's not just Apple every company's suing every other company  You might as well just assume that  The hip monk. This is one that kills me. I love hip monk here. He's a monk. Mm-hmm great travel site nice guys  Good product. It's cute  They really bootstrapped this up. They just got 15 million dollars in venture capital the day after a  patent troll called I to Z technology  Told hip monk it has to buy a license for a  1994 patent that covers a method for displaying data in multiple windows on  The computer it's a Texas shell company. It's run by a California lawyer  they've already gone after kayak Google Yelp and Microsoft and  and they waited until hip monk got its venture capital and  Then they said oh by the way, and it's cheaper just to pay these guys, isn't it?  Yeah, yeah, by the way this this patent sounds a lot like the Apple patent that the judge liked in the case against  Sam's against the Nexus a method and system for synchronizing the presentation from different but related sources in different windows of a computer display  We got I know what let's fight this I

No  You don't understand you could be the CEO of Yahoo, I know let me put it graciously no  Okay  We'll talk more we're first I want to talk a little bit about Ford  Ford comm I  Where is my focus electric? I'm buying one  I gotta buy one of these if you go to an EV certified Ford dealer, you could take a look. It's out the 2012  Ford focus electric is out and it is sweetest I've driven them now and I just love it and I really want this car and  Now what I'm really impressed with is Ford saying look where we want to make we want to be a  21st century car company, right we we want to  Do things a little differently here and so one of the things they've just opened a Silicon Valley office for Ford  Because one of the things they want to do they consider the car a platform for for developers  So one of the things they're reaching out to developers saying look we've got an API  This this is a car with an API and we want you to develop for it  And they've demonstrated this with their my Ford mobile app  This is this is almost like a demonstration of what you can do and it's it's for the electric vehicles of Ford focus  The idea is you put this on your Blackberry your I say Blackberry because it's in there  I don't know if anybody has a blackberry on your Blackberry your iPhone or your Android phone  It has a website the my for mobile website, but you can do things like find out  It tells you where your car is it tells you what the charge state of the car is you can tell the car  No only charge at the off-peak  Prices and it knows it has an API for the utilities to tell the I don't know if it's the app or the car  What their off-peak hours are and then the card in this knows don't charge until then  You can do things like precondition the cabin temperature you say I want to be 72 degrees when I go  They call them go times when I'm ready to go  930 in the morning tomorrow, and it will do that and reason they do that by the way is the electrics you do it  While you're plugged in it's much more economical right to do that  Heat it or chill it now in the days and days like we're having in back East now  This would be a nice thing to say I'm gonna have the car be 60 degrees when I get it  I want it to be a refrigerator. I want it to be ice  I want to be shivering when I drive out of the garage wouldn't that be if nice ah  It's freezing  That would be nice. They could find out where the charging stations are you can they have this like leaderboards who saved the most co2 this week I  Think this is just great for it is really  You know they're really rethinking  How what a vehicle is what it means what your apps mean and you could find out more if you visit the website ford.com  Slash technology or better yet take your smartphone bring it to your ev certified Ford dealer and say I want to drive the focus  But I also want the app on my phone because I want to try it out, and they'll do that for you  Ford.com  slash  Technology it's this car is so green  even these seats are  made out of grass  Really it's made with a  Fiber the cloth seat fiber is produced from 100% recycled materials the cushions are a bio based form derived from plant  Seed oils you have to mow it

They're really into using um  You know recyclable materials  In everything they do I tell you something really interesting I learned about Ford  I actually have a series of I was I was there the week before last and I have a series of four-part series that I'm  Doing on there sort of what they're doing with technology  that we're doing and  One of the really interesting things I learned from a sort of technical hacker kind of standpoint in their whole open platform thing is  They have this open source or sorry open platform hardware thing that they do  Where you can get a piece of equipment from bug labs?  And you can plug it into you know the interface in your in your Ford vehicle  And it collects all the data right it talked about how sharp you're turning about how often you're breaking  About all of that stuff so you can take that you can pull all the data from your vehicle  Then you can connect it to your computer, and you can create your own apps and your own  You know program to analyze that data to awesome. You know do your own stuff. I thought that was really cool from a geeky standpoint  That's a really sort of neat thing that they've done to partner up with bug labs so that you can  You know you can do this kind of thing  I'm gonna have that in one of the articles that I'm writing is gonna talk a little bit about that  And then I'm also talking about the fact that they're um  They really see themselves wisely I think not as just a car company  But as a personal mobility company so they see themselves as not only  About selling you a car, but connecting you to transportation and helping you visualize  transportation and you know the fact that especially in urban area  You know you may be driving in the future and get an alert that oh up ahead  There's a there's a you know really bad traffic situation pull over here get on the train  And you know take that the rest of the way to work and then take this back. You know helping you sort of really  You know be smart about the ways you do this in the future, so there's some really cool stuff  That's the sort of the last article in my series is gonna be talking about some of that stuff

I've talked to the very highest levels. You know at Ford grassy really  Not just great. You know what the we went that the so we went to the Rouge plant  Which is Henry Ford's original plant where they made the model teases stolen  It's still working and thank that we went to the Ford f-150  assembly line the roof is  It's made. It's like an it's like a succulent or something the roof is alive and  They and it keeps the place cooler in the summer and warmer in the way  I mean this it is not just lip service. They're really kind of committed to this whole idea, and I think that's great  I think it's bill Ford you have to get bill Ford. It is bill Ford. Yeah, he really cares about this stuff  It's like you know I love seeing founders like Sergey Brin who really you know he they care about this  They want to use their wealth and power  Not just to accumulate more wealth and power, but to kind of make the world  Maybe a little bit better place you got to give Bill Gates credit look what he's not sure you know yeah

There was nothing of our data on the computer  He said what's a PST file? I?  Said what he said well the guy backed up by PST file so well. That's good  That's your outlook he said but it only goes to 2008  He said I said the guy back  He said he backed up my data, but all he got was one file my email file from 2008  I said you didn't have any other backups. He said no I said what are you insane?  Why would you bring in a broken computer if not have any backup at all?  Anyway unfortunately, I didn't get to mention carbonite because we ran out of time  But let me mention it now if you're not backing up you need to back up  Especially because the time comes you maybe have to bring a computer in they don't give you your data back  Apple said Apple says I think any good computer store will say hey back up before you bring this in  Carbonites great even if you're getting a new computer say let's say you are upgrading Windows 8 no problem  You've been using carbonite you log into your carbonate account on your new computer. You say restore my data  It's all there and all and it's so convenient so easy. It's automatic continuous internet backup  $59 a year for everything on an individual on your personal computer on a single hard drive  They have multiple hard drive accounts a business accounts in fact. They have very good small business account  small business account  Multiple computers starts at $229 a year the unlimited a personal online backup $59 a year per computer. That's a five bucks a month  So you can try it free in fact one of the reasons  I think they do the home trial it's great is two weeks free and  What it does is it gives you a chance to get that first backup set done two weeks is enough depends on your bandwidth  But if if you have normal bandwidth two weeks is usually enough to back up all your data  And now it's just continuously keeping it up to date whenever you're online it uses SSL  So you're secure in fact it supports strong encryption, and they don't have the password only you do so you have complete privacy  If you want to try this free just visit carbonite calm and  Where it says offer code down here just use the word twit  Twit you could try it free for two weeks. You don't need a credit card just your email and password and the offer code twit  Risk free if you decide to buy use twit again because you'll get 14 months for the price of 12 that is a very good deal  Carbonite dot com secure automatic online backup starting at just  $59 a month of course I put it on every laptop laptops are the ones you really want this  All right, let's see here try let me show the Jeremiah video  Because it's cute so Jeremiah.

Um the record industry does so when so they don't get any of the money from the digital downloads  So what are they doing? They're rerecording their songs  So they get the rights  Deaf leopard most famous for their 1987 hit pour some sugar on me. Oh, I remember that

End time: 5740.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Are going can they do that? I mean they can do that they can rerecord them and then the performances  But don't they get this get this this is how this is the loophole

Start time: 5741.26
End time: 5815.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So they've been negotiating with universal music which owns their rights. They cannot get a suitable royalty for for digital downloads  So instead they're taking advantage of a law which protects cover versions  from copyright claims  You can make a cover version of a song  And you're not violating copyright, right? So they're holy crap  They're covering their own covering their own songs and releasing them in itunes. They describe them as forgeries  Our con Joe Elliott says our contract is such they can't do anything with our music without our permission  Not a thing. So we sent him a letter saying no matter what you want. You are going to get no as an answer  So don't ask  And we're going to make cover versions of our own songs  How old are they now? Oh, they must be 80, but that's good. Yeah  Pour some sugar on me. That's it. That's a problem. You're right. They don't they may not sound exactly the same  I just I love that  So microsoft has announced that uh, no matter what version of windows you've ever used 40 bucks to upgrade to windows 8  Is that low enough?  Yeah, that's a pretty good price  But I mean is it low enough for somebody to actually upgrade to windows 8?

Start time: 5821.16
End time: 5871.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I have no before you say that the upgrade on windows 8 according to paul therata windows weekly guy is is you know?  Normally what you want to do is clean install. He said no, it's really good on windows 8. It's essentially a clean install  So an upgrade is not a bad thing to do windows 8 pro is basically going to cost 40 bucks  Even if you still only have xp  You'll be able to download it from windows.com  You can add windows media center from the add features option for free  Of course, you can get a new computer that comes with it  But if you buy a computer between now and the release of windows 8 15  Dollars  If you want packaging 70 dollars, they have never  Had such a low price for windows ever 40 dollars not in this country  Is this is this is this microsoft saying we don't think eight's going to sell so we've got to make it cheap  Or is it them saying we've got to get everybody to go to eight. We're committed to this

Start time: 5872.90
End time: 5895.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a little bit of that. It's certainly a little bit of it is them, you know  Knowing that this is a big gamble for them, right windows 8 is a huge gamble  Maybe the biggest gamble that windows has made since they were trying to get everybody over to windows 2000, right?  And that kind of bombed and xp so they sort of did xp and xp caught on  so

Start time: 5896.38
End time: 5902.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is a big bet for them. So I it's a gamble in the sense that a lot of their revenue comes from windows, right?

Start time: 5902.36
End time: 5984.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. Exactly. And I mean that's not going to change  They're just it's just gonna you know on new computers is where they're gonna most of windows 8 is gonna happen  So few people really do the upgrade  Do upgrades consumers?  Do upgrades in very very small numbers. They just get a new machine, you know now the enterprise does upgrades  Obviously and they make lots and lots of money on on those  but  You know  I think that they are realizing that they have to create some buzz around windows 8 and they're they are wisely  Doing everything they can to do that  And this is one of those things that is helping them  Them, you know look like a company that really is cares about consumers and is trying to get stuff out there  At a real aggressive price for the people that do want to do upgrades, which is a lot of the technophile audience  Which you know a lot of those folks are are  You know kind of ambivalent about windows right now, um, there's a lot that are still  Uh big on it, but but you know, they will do some upgrades and at 40 bucks  They'll be happy about it. Now. I do think if I remember this right that it's kind of time-bombed, right?  They're saying you can do it with what by the end of?  Within the first four months or by the end of january 2013 or something  So they're basically saying that the price will go back up to what 69.99 or something cheap

They're they're they're betting on one thing  Really ultimately and that's sort of the convergence  They're gonna bet that you don't want to buy a tablet in a laptop and that you're gonna want to do it  Um, you're gonna want to use their device  And so they're betting on convergence and the thing is is they're making a lot of compromises both ways because that even more so  On the sort of traditional desktop side, but they are so are making some compromises on the tablet side, right of certain things certain even  settings and  apps you have to go into  Uh the the desktop version or the the full desktop in order to run them like this is the biggest mistake  I think they're making is not doing just a a metroized app of office  Um making you when you go to office you have to go into that sort of desktop  Environment to run it and on a tablet that's not going to be a good experience even on the ipad  I think apple went way too much on pages and and all those um, their apps  They're too desktop like I don't want them  I end up using simpler word processors and stuff because it's too much  And so I think microsoft's making the mistake mistake almost even worse  And uh, and I think that could hurt them from the tablet side and then on the desktop side  you know having to navigate metro to  You know do your desktop stuff is is really annoying and and they're betting that you're going to have this converged device and you know  During the daytime when you're working you're going to use that sort of just standard windows environment  And then at the night time you're going to sort of flip it back or just use the screen's going to pop out or whatever  And you're going to use metro and you know, it'll have all your data and everything and your apps on the same device  That's what they're betting on  And whether consumers accept that or not is going to have a lot to say about not only the future of windows  But the future of microsoft

Transcript:  Ken from chicago had an interesting point in our chat room  He said maybe what microsoft's doing is offering is is moving completely to the apple model where they'll do yearly  upgrades and at 30 or 40 bucks  Uh, and then jason that kind of makes sense with what you're saying  I mean, I I agree with you microsoft needs to be and i've kind of thought that they were all in on this  They can't say well  We're going to hedge our bets and have a little bit of desktop and a little bit of metro  They need to really commit maybe if they're planning yearly upgrades, they're going to say one year and then the desktop is going to be gone  You know, I I agree with you. I think that it's risky  But if you're going to do it, you have to you have to go 100 you can't  You can't hedge your bets you have to say we're committed

Transcript:  Yeah, but but even even a lot of the stuff that you do to configure stuff and maybe they'll fix this in the final version  But probably not right a lot of you go to configure things configure  You know a lot of the settings and stuff and it like takes you into the desktop environment on a tablet and it's just like  It's not a good experience and I think people are going to be confused  I mean trying to do your finger and like  Tap the little window to close something just just simple things like that that are annoying  Um are are going to really turn off a lot of consumers  I think if they they should just can focus on a metro tablet and then they should still try to make their desktop os  Solid and and you know, I there's still plenty of market for them to do that  But obviously this is the bet they're making and this is you know, windows is going to live or die on on how?

There was a it was a gang in estonia that had been doing it  They entered paul and the fbi arrested these guys threw them in jail  But instead of turning off the server the dns so what happens with dns changers it changes your dns settings  So that instead of you using your normal dns or your isp's dns you use their server and that gives them a chance to  Misdirect you to affiliate sites make a little money on the site put some different ads whatever but you got malware on your system  So the fbi arrests them instead of taking their malware server offline as would normally be done  They said no, you know, we should keep this running for a while  So they kept it running and they're going to turn it off on monday.

They should have shut the servers down or better yet  Or better yet  They should have kept the server up and put a big sign when you use your computer.
