Every time we'd walk around and go to some different booths and we'd be back and John and I kept running into each other.  Yeah, we ran into each other quite a bit.  He said, see that bottle of scotch back there?  They shouldn't even have this out here.  I'm not going to tell you that they have this bottle of scotch out here.  You need to go get it.

End time: 272.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I kind of, they don't really make me.  I offer it up and to me, it ends up being, you know, I think a lot of people sort of look down on the show lately I think.  But I mean really a lot of the stuff that ends up driving my coverage for the rest of the year, I end up seeing for the first time here.  And sort of informs my decision stuff I'm going to cover over the summer, into the fall, certainly the holiday season.  I think I did like 15 different segments during the holidays.  And I have to say most of those different devices and gadgets, save for a few Apple devices here and there, were all launched at CES this past year.

Start time: 274.25
End time: 275.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 290.88
End time: 298.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll tell you one thing we saw last year that we never did see were the OLED TVs from LG and Samsung.  They never shipped them.  Right?  We should have one there today.

Start time: 299.04
End time: 314.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is interesting if you run down like sort of the laundry list of things that you, that are announced at CES and that you never end up actually seeing.  More than half.  Oh, absolutely.  And I think about all the Android tablets we were promised and all the things that we're going to take off.  It was going to be the year of the tablet last year.

Start time: 314.72
End time: 318.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but ironically what we didn't see much of is Windows 8 tablets last year.  Right.

Start time: 319.72
End time: 332.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we'll probably see a couple of those.  I mean, there's going to be a whole bunch of things that I'm interested in seeing, of course.  We'll see the TVs and right there's going to someone's going to release one of those giant televisions.  They always try to outdo each other every year by two inches.

Start time: 333.26
End time: 338.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Westinghouse has a 110 inch 4K display.  Westinghouse?  What the hell?

Start time: 339.08
End time: 341.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Of course it isn't really Westinghouse anymore.  Who is it?  Yes.

Start time: 342.94
End time: 357.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They call it Westinghouse Digital.  So there is a Westinghouse that still makes appliances.  And I presume that's the original Westinghouse.  And then there's Westinghouse Digital, which makes just TVs.  And I'm figuring that's a Korean or a Chinese or something.  I think it's Korean, isn't it?

Start time: 357.90
End time: 361.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not dead sure, but I know it's not George Westinghouse's old company.

Start time: 362.46
End time: 371.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They are headquartered in Orange, California though.  I don't know if they're, but I've got to think they're making, they're kind of the house TVs for a lot of big box stores, things like that.

Start time: 371.88
End time: 383.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I have the press release from the DEG Awards, which I'll load up here.  And we can talk about the specific award winners for the CES show, even though the show hasn't even started.

Start time: 384.10
End time: 391.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the other thing that gets me is they all have these badges.  Winner, CES Innovation Award 2013.  They're already awarded all the awards.

Start time: 391.72
End time: 413.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the show hasn't even started until Tuesday officially.  I mean, we have the press night tonight.  So the big unveiled event that I like to go to these smaller events at night where I can really interact with some of the companies.  Spend some time with these different gadgets, see if it's going to make it on my air eventually.  So, but, you know, those press events take place two nights ahead of the show even launching.  So I've got to get out here two days before the show even starts.

Start time: 414.06
End time: 439.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact, most of our coverage of CES is going to be the CES unveiled event tonight.  Robert Balliser will be there.  Dick DiBartolo will be at the Digital Experience tomorrow night.  The so-called peep shows that Jerry was talking about and showstoppers on Tuesday night with Dick DiBartolo will be there.  That's that's like 90 percent of our coverage.  But that's kind of seems kind of unfair because that's at most one hundred hundred fifty products that pay an extra fifteen grand just to be at these peep shows.  Right.

Start time: 441.22
End time: 451.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or some that don't even go to the main show.  I know last year when we were at Pepcom, I think, you know, I don't know if you were were you there last year, Leo?  I mean, it was a year before.  Don't ask that question.

Transcript:  Yeah, because God knows you don't have any coverage.  They wouldn't let me in.

Start time: 465.82
End time: 484.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think we screwed up because we had a bunch of people in there and I think they said, oh, no, you've got too many people from Twitter in here eating our food.  They're all different shows.  Eating our food.  Oh, the food.  Yeah, it's for them.  It's for some reason showstoppers.  Steven Leon is always very nice.  But for some reason, a digital experience, it's like they're guarding the Fort Knox in there.  And I think it's the food.  I really do.

Start time: 485.82
End time: 511.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think I got kicked out of I snuck in early during that year that Clayton's referring to.  Somehow I got in.  I snuck in because some guard was looking the wrong way.  So I got in there.  The whole thing was filled with the vendors and I started going around from vendor to vendor getting some early coverage because there wasn't anybody else in.  Then I got kicked out because the I robot people turned me in.  What?  Why would you do that?  You tell me.  I don't get it.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I guess everything has changed.  I of course, I my major experiences with these things were back in Comdex days when I used to give the best of show award.  And I didn't notice any problems with people.  Why would you know what?

Start time: 541.42
End time: 543.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why did see a yes survive in Comdex?

Start time: 544.20

Transcript:  Not well, I think it's a child and made so dang much money out of it that he turned to something else.

Start time: 551.88
End time: 568.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I know they put him in debt when they sold it and sold it and sold it a couple of times more.  There was so much of a debt load they couldn't keep the thing going without going broke.  So it wasn't lack of interest that killed Comdex.  It was just mismanagement.  No, it was not. It was finances. It was a financial problem. It wasn't really a management issue.

Start time: 568.88
End time: 583.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  CES will get they say one hundred fifty thousand attendees this year.  I think that's low actually.  So, I mean, it's clearly flourishing.  I just I just wonder why we need it in an Internet age.  Why do we need a consumer electronics?  Well, it's maybe it's not that we it's not and maybe it's not that we need it.

Start time: 584.86
End time: 603.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I'm certainly I get a lot of great coverage and it's great for me to see these things up up close and to sort of make these relationships for later on so that I can feature different things.  And work with different companies and see what they have to offer down the line for context.  But really, it's for them. Right.  I mean, it's to make the deals in the back rooms and to have the lunches and to make.

Start time: 604.57
End time: 608.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But do they really do that? Do they need to do that in person?  I guess maybe they do.

Start time: 608.92
End time: 626.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it's it's the same thing that Ted, you know, the famous analogy of the Ted talks.  Right. It's that, yes, they can put it out there for free online so that we all we can all enjoy the Ted talks.  But to be in that room to pay the ticket to go to a Ted talk yourself.  I mean, you're in the hall with Al Gore having, you know, rubbing elbows with with Bill Gates.

Start time: 627.10
End time: 630.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 634.02
End time: 637.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 642.36
End time: 663.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, obviously, you know, I'm going I'm going to leave after the show.  I'm flying out there, but I'm going to New Media Expo.  I'm going to speak there and give the podcast awards.  Then I'm going to do some work for Stitcher at the Ford booth.  And I'll wander around. Stitcher is a podcast app.  You should know about it. Oh, yes. Sure.  They have no agenda on Stitcher. I hope so.

Start time: 663.80
End time: 672.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stitcher is great. Yeah, Stitcher does a lot of stuff for our podcasts.  And they are plus are built in.  I mean, now Stitcher is what built into Ford.  And that's right. That's why they're going to be there. Yeah. Yeah.

Start time: 672.72
End time: 683.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 683.92
End time: 689.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 689.74
End time: 728.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Number. Well, that, of course, is because unless they've changed things a lot,  anybody who had a web camera was a per was bloggers are press.  Yeah, bloggers are press. So I mean, I can remember a couple of years ago  going to it and getting to an Intel press conference at seven thirty in the morning.  And I couldn't get in. Yeah, because it was full.  The halls were full outside of people with press badges.  Yeah. And I'm looking at people's badges.  That's one reason I don't go anymore. Yeah.  It's one reason I don't go anymore because if everybody's press, then nobody's press.

Start time: 729.27
End time: 744.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's what gets me.  The the insulting press badge nowadays in a lot of these events says press slash blogger.  You don't like that. Well, I think you're either press or blogger.  You guys sound like the old school.  I don't want to see blogger on my thing.

Start time: 746.41

Microsoft said that we're going to do our own thing in October and that's Windows 8.  We don't need to go to CES.  You got to wonder how long before Samsung decides we don't.

They're good at that. Make.Believe.

Transcript:  Blu Ray came out this year. Yeah. In any event, let's talk about Share File.com.  If you have been trying to share large files over the Internet, maybe you started by emailing them and you get the bounce backs crazy.  Maybe maybe you've been trying to, I don't know, use one of the commercial file sharing programs.  Fine. But I have to say you can run in trouble. I used to use one of the other programs and I had a guy.  This is how I used to share their commercials on the radio show with the radio stations.  And the guy I was sharing it with would would just delete it.  And I say, you know, you can't delete it because it deletes it for everybody else.  No, it's just taking up space in my heart. I'm going to delete it. It just it didn't work.  So finally, I found Share File from Citrix. And I have to say this is the way to share files.  No email bounce backs. It's secure. So it complies with regulations in almost every industry.  If you're a physician, for instance, it's HIPAA compliant.  That means it's secure. It's safe. You could send patient records. You could share patient records.  If you go to Share File.com, you'll see, in fact, when you click that green start your free trial,  you'll see a bunch of different industries. You can customize Share File to work with.  The one thing I'd like you to do is add that promo code twit because we want to make sure we get credit for that.  It is a fantastic way to share files. 30 days free.  I strongly recommend it to you for your business. If you are sharing files.  Let me just show you. This is my share file here. And this is what it looks like.  Can you see that, Jason? Yeah. So it's customized.  So it looks like you're, let's say I'm, this is, I'm doing, I do this actually every, every week.  I share commercials. There's no commercials this week. Let's go to KFI's folders.  These are folders on my hard drive automatically synced. I'm browsing through it on the website.  Let's say I want to send this file to you. I can do this via plug-in and outlook, or I can use the Share File web interface.  I can even send an email like this. It looks like an email. It's not.  Or I can get a special link. And I like doing it this way. And look what I can do.  I can have it email me when the item has been downloaded. Let me make this a little bit bigger.  I can require recipients to enter name and email before downloading so I could track them.  I can expire the download after a day, week, month or never.  I can say how many times they can download. So you really want to restrict it.  You could say they can download this for one week. They can get one download.  I want them to enter the email address and then I send it.  I'm going to get a special link that I can include in an email. I can send it to them. I can text to them.  And let me show you what happens when they enter that link in because they don't have to sign up for Share File.  They don't have to do anything. They just go to that link and they get a customized site that looks...  Oops. Remember I asked that they have provided this email information and so forth.  They get a customized site with my logo on it. I'll just put this in. These are all required.  And I'll click continue to download page. They get a link. It's very simple.  Download button. It couldn't be easier.  Even the least sophisticated people that I deal with all the time have no trouble using Share File.  That's why it's the best way to share files with clients, colleagues.  All my Share Files are always visible not only on my other computers via my Share File account,  but also on the smartphones, the laptops, the tablets via the special Share File app.  Mac or PC, this is a great way to share files. Please try it free today.  Visit ShareFile.com and use that promo code TWIT from the great folks at Citrix.  We thank them so much for their support.  I guess Westinghouse Digital in the chat room they tell me is licensed from Westinghouse, which is owned by CBS.  Yeah, the name is licensed.  And so there's a Westinghouse licensing and they licensed the name out via CBS.  I didn't know CBS owned Westinghouse, but it makes sense.  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right.  So let's before we wrap completely on the CES story, Clayton, is there anything you're particularly looking for this year?

And there's been a lot of speculation online as to what it's going to be.  Some sort of transparent screen, which seems asinine to me.  Yes.  Because, I mean, you don't want to look through at all your wires.  I mean, if you see the TV in my house and you're looking through this thing, you're going to see surge protectors and Apple TV cords.  You don't want to look through it.

And when you pull in some of the web apps, you know, it puts it pushes the screen over or you've got the stuff coming up from the bottom and it's all over the screen.

See, you crap on it, John.  But I think you're crap on it because we have this past few years experience of not seeing anything.  Right. Or seeing things that are so ridiculously expensive and don't make any sense and don't have any practical use.  Then I saw, you know, then you start to see the things like the Nest.  You start to see things like the Wemo from Belkin.  And which, by the way, I used for all.  Did you get a Wemo? I ordered it, but I haven't gotten mine yet.  It's great. And in fact, we used it for our Christmas lights.  So I set it up so that every day at four p.m.  Christmas lights outside would turn on and at like twelve thirty in the morning, they would turn off.  The Christmas tree would go on at four. That's astonishing.  How does it work?  Well, it's great, too, because we were waiting for it.  And we were waiting for a week.

And two of the kids have been arrested already.  But what happened is apparently he also had a clapper on the Christmas tree and the kid accidentally turned on the Christmas tree.  And you can see on the video he jumps and then he starts looking around and then he sees the camera.  He hides his face and he goes over and he pulls it down.  Yeah.

You know what I'd like to see very much, Clayton, is some sort of agreement on standardization for these things.  Because there isn't any way to kind of universally control them.  They need to all be controlled.

But while there are whole packages, though, now you actually have those people are able to lock their dead bolts now.  Right.  You know, using your smartphone.  So you've got eight, you're right.

I mean, with lots of memory and lots of drives.  And I think I'm going to convert it back to Windows 7 because it just isn't that useful.  But for something like a tablet, a real touch type of thing, Windows 8 looks like it's going  to be pretty good.

Start time: 1808.52
End time: 1816.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

And of course, I want to reach up and poke around on my screen when I'm typing.  It just does that way.  So I'm going to convert that into a Windows 7 machine and make it one of the master machines here  because it's a good machine.  But I don't need Windows 8 on it.  But Surface may turn out to be what I'm looking for.  Look, I don't know.  You guys act like you spend a lot of time in a room with a TV in it.  I don't.

I mean, this is the missing link and it's still been scattershot.  You have different companies making different content deals.  You have different apps, different web apps.  Last year we saw from Samsung that thing where you stand in front of it and you wave your hand up.  Yeah, that went somewhere.  I forgot about that.  And people were walking by it at the Best Buy and they were trying to wave their hands or it's accidentally turned it on and off because you have morons turning it on and off.

And it's like, just give me a mouse for crying out loud.  It looks like you're swatting it flies the whole time.  It's so horrible.  Anyway, yeah, I agree with you.  We need a better set top box.  Intel, I don't know why they did this.  They announced or they leaked that they were going to have one and then they pulled back very fast and said, but we won't do it on CES.  We won't do it till later this year, like June.  The real problem for Intel is you can build it.  But if you don't get any content creators to support it, you got nothing.  And Apple's having a hell of a time.  All Apple could do is rent and sell movies and TV.

Isaacson said that the way Steve was able to get the record companies to go along with a carrot and stick approach, saying, first of all, you're losing your shirt to piracy.  And that was true at the time.  Remember? And second, we have a way of selling it.  And then the third key ingredient was we're just little old Apple.  We're not going to threaten you in any way.  Well, the music industry has learned that lesson.  As soon as iTunes became the number one seller of music, it was all over.  And I think the TV and the motion picture industry, you're right, aren't aren't pressured by pirates in this as much.  But more importantly, have watched the experience the music industry had and said, we're not going to let Apple run this show.

But he's signing up for one service and it's because, you know, you have you have Showtime, which is I guess maybe it's smart.  Right. You can't get Dexter Dexter season seven just wrapped up.  I don't have Showtime. Right. So I wait for it to come out on iTunes or on Netflix and I buy it when it's available.  But of course, they want to soak up as many DVD sales as they can.  So at what point what is the tipping point for for DVD sales?  You know, you go into a Best Buy now. They have like one rack of CDs left.  That's it. It used to take up the whole was enormous at a Best Buy.  Now you walk in there, it's one little rack. I was in there just the other day.  DVDs, of course, are shrinking.

Transcript:  I didn't look at it.  That's exactly what I did. This was sad and I felt bad about it.  But I mean, I'm not going to apologize for three hundred dollars difference.  So I was staying at a Best Buy. My wife and I were there.  We wanted one for our living room that was going to be big.  I talked her into a fifty five and she wanted like, I don't know, twenty five inches. Who knows?  And I wanted a big one. We were there for like an hour and a half looking at.  I wanted two hundred and forty Hertz. I wanted the whole thing.  We were spending there talking with a guy at Best Buy for a long time who actually knew his stuff, surprisingly.  And of course, my wife knows her stuff from the CNET Labs, of course, where they would test all these things in those dark rooms.  So we were there for quite a while and we thought, OK, this is the one we're going to get.  And I just quickly I'm just going to jump on Amazon here to see the difference.  It was a three hundred dollar difference.  I mean, I might have done some charity if it was like fifty bucks because the guy spends a lot of time with us.  But three hundred dollars. It was absurd.  And then I didn't have to worry about lugging it out to my car. Right.

Yeah, that's why they're doing that's why one of the things you're going to see.  What do you think you see more and more at CES is a desperate industry  trying to convince people that there's some reason to buy a new TV.  And they tried 3D three years ago that that tanked.

Transcript:  See, nothing yet. Look, when we first got into this racket, in order to become a record industry, a recording artist,  you needed a couple hundred thousand dollars worth of equipment.  Now anybody can do that. It's talent only. You don't have to pay a producer to do anything for you.  Well, we're getting there with movies. My friend, the director, tells me that for about $15,000 in equipment,  you can now make production quality movies.  Now, you're going to have a hell of a lot of talent coming up with different things.  You know, Affleck and his buddy did Good Will Hunting. You're going to have, but now imagine that you could do that in your garage.

Start time: 2430.72
End time: 2456.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that's interacting with new screens, right?  But that's why I think that may be the tipping point.  Because to get back to what I was saying is the key, the friction-free solution is for content creators to sell directly to their audience.  So you get a Ben Affleck selling directly to his audience. You eliminate the movie company. You eliminate the cable company.  You eliminate the cable channel. All of those guys are just a drag.

So that's where you're going to see the disintermediation. And then maybe an Intel will have a chance.  Then maybe an Intel or an Apple can go directly and provide some sort of marketplace.  Like you did on Roku. Roku's already got this figured out.  But what you need is a marketplace, right? You need a way for me to go to Ben Affleck and say, yes, I'll buy your movie.  An Apple or an Intel could do that. I mean, Intel doesn't want to be in this business. They just want to sell chips.  I don't know what Intel's thinking.  They want to sell chips. It's a reference.

What happened?  Yeah, independent from the Daily Beast. Now he's going, taking it back to andrewsullivan.com.  And if you like him and you subscribe to his, if you want to want to read his content, you can subscribe and pay.  I think it's 19 or $20 a year or something like that. Yeah.  And then otherwise on the RSS feed, it's still free content.  They're not. He's not going to put that behind a paywall, similar to sort of what the New York Times does.  If I share out an article to the New York Times, you still have access to it for free.  But are we creating sort of these little niche communities now where we're loyal to just certain content and it's, as you say, disintermediated, where it's all over the place?  And we get our news from Andrew Sullivan and we pay a subscription to him. I subscribe to Marco's The Magazine.

And as for a good half of my income now comes from self-published backlist books.  That's great.  My old books are making me thousands a month just out there on Amazon mostly.  iStore probably brings in 5% and maybe Nook brings in 10% and the rest of it is through Amazon.  And the nice thing about Amazon on paying for books that you publish yourself is they not only pay 70% royalty, they pay it monthly, two months in advance,  and they send to a check rather than with their traditional big line publishers who pay just on credible threat of lawsuit.

So we're free media supported by ads. I don't think it's so different in that you still have to have the best content.

Well, I mean, I just I think it's one of those things where I'm confused by sort of like what Time Warner did.  Right. I mean, Time Warner pulled off.  It was sort of a Trojan horse thing.  Well, we're not going to put Al Jazeera on these particular channels.  We're going to keep an open mind and maybe we'll go back and do it later.  And yet in New York City, Time Warner cable is is showing Al Jazeera.  But they're doing it because Al Jazeera ponied on the backs of another cable company.  They sort of came in like a Trojan horse and got on.  But, you know, what Time Warner and these other cable providers are saying is, hey, we've got, you know, eight hundred, nine hundred channels or whatever.  And these top tier channels way, way up high.  If no one's watching your channel, we're going to bump you off now.  We're tired of fooling around and we're going to bump you off.  And they're starting to rotate in new and different channels all the time to try to give other people an opportunity.  The problem I have with it, though, when you say that no one's watching current, I bet more people watching current TV than we're watching some of the ridiculous.  There's like a random Filipino history channel or something way up in the nine hundred.

Nevertheless, I thought it was a little disappointing that Time Warner just cut, you know, said, OK, by the way, this was in the deal.

If everybody watching this show right now goes to... let's say Photographybegins.com.  Everybody goes to Clayton's site. Let's everybody go there now and try to bring it down. You can't.  And there's a reason for that because... Oh, we just brought it down. Oh no.  Squarespace is hosting plus content management system. It's got the greatest software running on their Squarespace.  Running on their great hosting platform. And by integrating the two, they've done some very sophisticated stuff.  That means these sites are instantly responsive when more bandwidth is needed. Squarespace just automatically...  You don't have to have somebody go, Oh, let me go down to the basement. I got to turn a switch. Turn on another server for Clayton.  No, it just happens automatically. And that's why you just cannot bring these sites down.  I don't know of any other hosting that is this good, this reliable, and has this great software on top of it.  Because they host the software too, it's always up to date. There are absolutely no security issues with it.  I want you to go to Squarespace.com and take a look. There's a get started button if you want to try it free for two weeks.  You don't need a credit card. You don't need our offer code. Just try it free.  Try the templates. They're gorgeous. The auto responsive design that makes sure that you look great on any size screen.  It's one of the reasons they... When you upload an image, they make seven different thumbnails.  So there's always an image that's the right size for the screen that is visiting your site.  They have great integration with all the social media, Twitter and LinkedIn and Facebook and on and on and on.  It's just so easy. Try to bring it down. Photographybegins.com. You can't because it's a Squarespace site.  Now, after the two week trial, if you want to try Squarespace, let me tell you, the pricing is right.  They've got two plans. That's it. They simplified this. Two plans.  There's an $8 a month plan and a $16 a month plan. Don't even worry. Just go to the $16 a month plan because it's such a deal.  Unlimited pages, galleries and blogs, unlimited bandwidth, unlimited storage, unlimited contributors.  When you buy that year plan, you're going to get a custom domain name and they're automatically going to hook it up as part of the deal.  It's free. You get all this stuff plus the best support, lots of webinars and help forums, all that stuff.  Squarespace.com. If you do decide to buy, use our offer code TWIT and the number one, TWIT1, and you'll get 10% off that first purchase.  Squarespace for your exceptional website. That's pretty good testament that both No Agenda and Photographybegins use that.

Transcript:  That's an education. Yeah. Awesome.  All right. Moving along. Let's see. Jerry, did you know that NASA was going to move an asteroid into orbit?  I don't know exactly what the purpose of that is.

Start time: 3545.94
End time: 3632.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the purpose is not the same.  To begin with, the story says that some people are thinking about it.  Oh, okay.  Considering that I wrote about doing this in 1982, it's probably true that they're still thinking about it.  And eventually we'll do it.  Because 90% of the resources available to the human race are not on this Earth.  And you're going to have to have to have them at some point.  I mean, Arthur Clarke said it pretty simply.  If the human race survives, then for most of its history, the word ship will mean spaceship.  Right. Otherwise, we're just not going to be here.  Right.  But as to whether or not you could do it for $2.6 billion, I don't think NASA could do anything for $2.6.  NASA can't even pay its own salary for $2.6 billion in a year.  That's been the big problem.  They have this huge standing army of people who don't do anything but think.  If you want to have that done, if the Congress were to say a prize of $4 billion for the first company that put an asteroid in orbit outside the Moon's orbit around the Earth,  you'd probably find somebody could do it for that price, but NASA can't do it.

You can't privatize it thoroughly without some supervision because, think about it for a minute,  an asteroid big enough to be useful, moving at several thousand feet per second is a city killer.  You can't let somebody just do that without some supervision because you don't have to make much of a mistake, and you've got a disaster of proportion.  You can't leave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's worth doing because you need the resources.  I think the first big space resource, and it looks like China and India may beat us to this, is you use chemical rockets to put up a solar power satellite,  and now you've got an enormous amount of electrical power which you use to power laser rockets to put up more rockets, and that starts getting cheap.  After a while, you get a positive feedback loop out of it because you can always sell electric power to somebody.

Transcript:  But how do you get back to Earth?  What, do you beam it back to Earth?

Start time: 3715.06
End time: 3778.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, it beams nicely.  We tested this.  Again, we tested it 40 years ago.  Yeah, you have a satellite that basically picks up solar power.  The trouble with ground-based solar power is the sun doesn't shine at night, and power storage is very expensive.  That's the same problem with windmills.  The wind doesn't blow enough.  So you have a, you beam the power down, and it's received on a grid that's maybe, oh, I don't know, say 10 square kilometers would be a huge one.  And the grid is just a grid of wires about two meters, four meters above ground, and caps can graze on grid.  It's not dangerous under there because the power density is only a few milliwatts per square meter.  And when you're finished with it, you can get an awful lot of power down that way.  And once you've done that, with cheap electric power, you can do almost anything.

I mean, you've got to remember, I started in this racket as the science editor for Galaxy Science Fiction magazine, which is quite a while ago.  I love that.  I wrote about this sort of thing all the time during the 60s and 70s.  It's all feasible.  It's all possible.  But it isn't happening right now.  I can tell you how to make it happen.  You want a moon colony?  Yeah.  Congress in the United States has determined that a lunar colony is in the best interest of the United States.  The first American owned company to police 31 Americans on the moon and keep them there alive and well for three years and a day will be rewarded the sum of $10 billion tax free.  We could do that.

Now they have to face the European Union and the EU says we're not going to pay any attention to that.  But you know the big issue of course was the idea that Google search results favored Google's own products.  FTC said no.  I think that this changed.

I would notice that if that websites that used AdSense would get higher rankings in their search results than those who did not use AdSense.  And I noticed this consistently for a couple of number of years.  And then one day it changed.  And I think that what the investigation was looking at was what's happening today.  And I think Google got a clue and pulled the plug on this trick whatever it was.

There's always going to be YouTube videos that are going to pop up right at the top.  It seems like every time I do any sort of a search those you know anytime I do a search for Kim Kardashian those videos come right up.  Me too.  Me too.  Which is what I'm looking for.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you Google.  God I don't know what I do with that Google.  Let me please devils advocate on this though.  I mean who cares.

I think they're actually saying what you're saying Clayton is it's since it's not a monopoly it's not an issue.  Right.

Yeah about two months beforehand I got to play with it for quite a while and while it was still in beta.  And I have to say I really I really liked it but I just don't.

Transcript:  All right.  But now now having said that Google does something that is obviously anti-competitive.  They block maps on Windows phones.  I mean that is so now they said well we did it because we test browsers and on the old Windows phones the browser experience wasn't good enough.  Yes.  All Microsoft tactic by the way.  So we've decided to block it now and then of course as soon as the articles came out you know people using Windows Phone 8 said what the hell like not only is there no Google Maps app but I can't do it on the browser.  Google said oh now they're saying it was a product decision but we've reassessed the browser speed on Windows Phone 8.  It's fine.  We're to turn it back on.  Ah sweet.  Do you buy that.  Google's been acting a little bit anti-Microsoft.  Remember they turned off exchange active sync which means that you can't use Google Calendar and Google contacts with the Windows Phone.  Microsoft they had a license EAS from Microsoft and so it's not an unreasonable thing for them say we're not going to pay for this.  Right.  Why should we pay for this.  Use IMAP use CalDav use CardDav these are open standards.  We support those.  Why are we paying you a license fee.

Transcript:  There's no real explanation as to what version of Windows Phone or Internet Explorer on Windows Phone wasn't it wasn't compatible with because their argument was it wasn't WebKit based and therefore it wasn't compatible.  Google says this is going to change.  But I think was it Windows Phone 8.  It was a 7.5.  Because that goes back to sort of what Danny Sullivan was talking about as part of Google's weird statement on this is that maps compatibility with mobile browsers to make sure that you can use the same browser speed.  To make sure that they deliver the best experience for their users and the IE mobile test on mobile browsers the IE mobile test wasn't a great maps experience according to Google.  But that's not really true and they're not really talking about exactly what version it was.  Some part of the experience apparently was was was faulty.

Start time: 4283.92
End time: 4391.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They supported Windows Mobile.  That's what's interesting which is really a crappy browser.  Yeah Google hasn't said I mean they haven't said was it you know a nine for mobile and why all of a sudden now Mary Jo Foley who hosts our Windows Weekly show said she asked Google and the Google representative said the redirection for Windows Phone users has always been in place.  But she and others said wait a minute no I've been using it.  For at least the past year plus.  So what is going on.  So Danny wrote and posted the article at midnight.  That day.  And he has actually a postscript on it.  And he says if you if you if you go to maps.google.com on an HTC 8x or a Lumia 900 you go you don't get maps you get routed to Google.  However if you go to maps.google.co.uk you get maps.  You go to the British version.  And as Mary Jo Foley said he said yeah I was pretty sure I've been to Google Maps on these phones as well but the problem is nobody took a screenshot.  I don't you know it's a puzzlement.  In summary Danny says I don't think Google changed anything I just think a few realized it was this way before including myself.  Hello.  Hey Jerry still no luck with Jerry so this would be a good time to take a break.  What do you say we're going to talk about land trucks.  We do not have believe it or not.

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by Lantrax.  If you ever done this have you ever tried to get your USB printer working with your network.  Or maybe tried to print from an iPad or an iPhone to your printer.  It is not easy as it is is complicated.  Sometimes you have to get special software.  I've got a way to do it that is so great.  It's so easy.  The Lantrax X print server.  And I know I've spoken to a lot of people now who have because of us talking about it on the air.  Tried it.  We had an administrator of a school network who said it had been a nightmare.  She has all these network printers all these USB printers.  Bam.  Everything worked just kind of out of the box.  There's no configuration.  It just recognizes all the printers.  It just works.  Now there's two versions of the X print server.  There's the home edition for $99.95.  And that will handle up to 8 USB and 2 network printers.  And then you've got the slightly more powerful office edition for $1.99.95.  And that's 8 USB printers and unlimited network printers.  So in a home you don't really probably need the $200 version.  The $99.95 version is just fine.  And I'll tell you you don't need any special software on your iPad or iPhone.  It just prints easily.  It converts any USB printer into a network printer, which is fantastic.  So you don't need to go out and buy a new printer.  And that USB printer can be shared over the network with every other computer and not just your iPad.  Supports more than 4,000 top brand network printers.  Automatic discovery and setup couldn't be easier.  It's really just one push of a button.  Open it up, plug it in, and you're printing.

Any printer you've got this will work with.  There are other companies, a big company with two initials makes something like this.  It's four times more expensive.  This is better and easier.  You're going to love it.  It's the Xprint server.  Go to xprintserver.com slash twit.  You'll get free shipping on your order at checkout.  You got to use the offer code twit when you check out.  So offer code twit, xprintserver.com.  We have, since they started advertising, we've sold hundreds and hundreds of these.  And everyone, I get emails all the time.

And that's a smaller, that's for the ladies, and this is a little bit larger.  So you go like this.  Oh, my eye!  Well, that's exactly what I thought.

It's earlier than ever this year.  And...  They always say that.  It's 90% effective this year.  Last year's dosage of the flu shot was like 35 or 40% effective.

They have lots of torque.  Well, you know, that's a new engine.  EcoBoost.  Well, no, no.  It's a Lewiston.  I can't remember the name of it, but it's an old engine from the 1890s.  All the hybrids used because it's very compatible with electric motors.  That's very interesting.  But anyway.  So what was I going to talk about?  I forgot.  You were going to talk about Waze because you used Waze to get to...  So here I go.  I'm using Google Maps.  I'm using the thing that's in the car.  I'm trying it.  I cannot use Waze.  Why not?  Because this guy just always wants you to do stuff.  You're trying to drive and it wants you to do this and it wants you to do that.  Oh, please send us a note about the cop that's standing there.

You start like, I'm going to add a little construction hat to the guy and I'm going  to let people know that there's a cop over there.  And then before you know it, you're a part of the accident.  And you get points for that.

Transcript:  Oh, it's everywhere.  But it is all about the data.  I mean, and this is something that Apple's maps are terribly lacking in, of course, and  so as they try to iterate.  But, you know, at the beginning, I mean, they had been partnering with Waze in the beginning.  And a couple of the companies, of course, they were partnering with TomTom, Waze, and  who else?  There's somebody else that they were.  They had in the mix.

Start time: 5173.22
End time: 5219.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apparently, they offered half a billion dollars.  Waze said we're worth 750 million.  At least that's what people are reporting.  We don't know what really happened.  I think it would be a mistake for any amount of money to go to Apple because I think that  they would be subsumed and ruined.  Ruined, just as LaLa and Siri have been.  I think Waze is doing great.  Now, by the way, you know that you can just wave your hand and then talk to it.  You don't have to touch it in any way.  I read that on the chat room, too.  Well, I use Waze.  That's how I do it.  You wave your hand at what?  At the phone.  I have my phone on my dashboard.  I'm using an Android.  Same thing.  You wave your hand at the phone, and then it says, what?  And you go, report an accident.  And you can interact with it.  You don't have to touch it.  Yeah.

And they'd like to say that, look, we've got millions of iPhones out on the roadways  and soon enough we'll have the same sorts of data that we're being able to pull from  these other companies.  But you wonder if it ends up being sort of like it's almost like a Dropbox scenario,  right?  Right.  You know, they make the offer.  You're you're a service rather than a than a platform.  And you're just a for you're a feature.  Isn't one of the Steve Jobs said to Dropbox, you're a feature.  Yeah, I said, yeah, he was wrong.

What programming flaw is there that would cause this thing to fail January 1st through  7th?  That is a good challenge.  You know, what could that be?  And it turns out there was a really interesting article, Ask Ours.  Jackie Chang figured it out, I think.  It has to do with the ISO weak numbering system, which is a standard system for numbering  the weak.  And apparently it's not an unusual bug.  The reason most phones don't suffer from this is people program around it.  It's a known flaw.  And apparently Apple's programmers just didn't know that or didn't fix it.  That's not good.

So they used, apparently they used lowercase yyyy instead of uppercase yyy.  You know, I've been telling them that for years.  Why are you using the lowercase yyyy?  What a blunder.  In most cases, yyyy is the same as yyyy, except, you know, in some cases.  Apparently this one, this case is one of the examples.  Apparently yyyy is the Gregorian calendar.

I guess if you're not Verizon and AT&T, you got to find an angle.  Judge can't order, of course not.  Judge can't order a Yelp user to edit his negative review.  That's funny.  A Virginia woman after firing a contractor left a scathing review of the contractor.  A Virginia Supreme Court has overturned a preliminary injunction.  The contractor sued saying you've got to change that review.  The original court said yes.  The the high court said no.  Judges shouldn't be able to edit or halt speech before illegal cases run its court.  So the injunction is no good, but they will continue the suit.  The court had ruled in December last month that the homeowner was required  to edit her harsh comments on Yelp and Angie's list.  Well, that's not a great precedent.

There are a lot of trolls out there who think that it's a great thing to  just do a big negative review of anything, something that gets them some attention.  I'm not sure they have much effect on readers because I think readers finally  I think we don't pay that much attention to the reviews anymore.  Well, we throw out there are so many of of of the just silly  bad reviews written in bad grammar.  And you begin to think, well, that's the way this guy writes.  Then why do I want to pay attention to his opinions?  But it's a real problem sorting out libel from  you know, some books deserve a bad review.  I suppose I may have even written one of them.  But I don't think that books deserve bad reviews simply  because somebody doesn't like the views that the author has on some subject  utterly irrelevant to the book.

I wanted to be able to, you know, just read tons of articles  as much as I could for for for work.  You know, I mean, have to be up on every possible angle of the news.  And and so  wanted to do it quickly.  And I've been a fan of speed reading since I was a kid.  I was always obsessed with the science behind it.  So partnered up with with Instapaper and Pocket  and a great design team at Wondersauce helped me sort of realize that  my friend Pablo is a great programmer.  We built it.  And so you can bring in your whole instapaper list, your pocket list  and read it one word at a time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. So it's not, you know, it's not it's not splashing it up there  in a sentence format or doing anything else.  It's one word at a time.  And so your comprehension, you'll start out at like 250 words a minute.  Pretty soon you'll be up to like five hundred and fifteen words a minute.

Transcript:  It's a thing. And then if you want to read just in normal  parsed text like you would an instapaper or pocket,  you just simply hit view source and it takes you right to the web  if you want to read it that way.  But for me, you know, if you have for doctors and for individuals  who want to be able to have to read like tons of articles every week  in the medical profession, I want to plass through all these things.  And your comprehension actually goes up because you get your  your verbalizing of the words out of the way.
