Transcript:  Bandwidth for This Week in Tech is provided by AOL Radio at AOL.com slash podcasting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is TWiT This Week in Tech, episode 59 for June 25th, 2006.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And joining us now on the TWiT Roundtable, which is actually not round. If I were to draw it,  it's probably more like a map of the internet. Very good. It would be a star topography. I was  thinking maybe geographically, but you're right. It's more like a cloud, isn't it? John C. Dvorak  is here, Dvorak.org slash blog from his home in the East Bay. Robert Heron is here from,  are you at your home in the East Bay as well? I am. So that's a really a big bump we've got  there over in the East. From the city of San Francisco proper, we've got Mr. Patrick Norton.  And I think Roger, are you in San Francisco too? Yes. All right. And we're hoping Kevin  Rose will join us a little later on to talk about, to crow about Dig 3.0. But meanwhile,  it's kind of a back to roots edition of Dig because we've been on the road, we've been  traveling. We did the hated... Did I say dig? I did. TWiT, I'm sorry. I'm just wishful thinking.  This is the back to the roots episode of TWiT. But we are after the hated 57, I thought. No more  interlopers. Roger, 57 was really hated? You obviously didn't visit the website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I have such a pathological sort of hate relationship to comments on boards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  These are the most vile, insulting comments. Oh, man. Did you have to censor any of them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I censored a few because there were a few that were gay bashing, which I got rid of. But the  people really hated a couple of the participants. I won't name names on the show, but I take the  blame because I think it was really a sound quality issue, frankly. And as you know, John,  and Patrick, because you were there, you couldn't hear, nobody could hear anybody. So of course,  we were all talking over each other. Right. That wasn't anybody's fault of mine. So I take the  blame for that. You know what we did though that was kind of fun is I posted the raw tracks,  because we ate tract it and asked people to remix and we've gotten, unfortunately, we got so much  response. I have dozens of these remixes. I haven't had time to go through them all. So I'm  gonna have to, as soon as I get a chance, I'm gonna post them and give people. There's probably one

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  with a bunch of like fart noises overlaid. No doubt. Subliminals. I mentioned last week,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  there's one funny one that's a minute long. It's just the open and the close,  which was kind of a commentary. A true fan. So we've all been playing before the show started  with windows live because Robert, I guess, uses the traffic reports in windows live.  And it was, yeah. And I kept calling it local.live.com because that's the web address,  but it's actually live local. They should switch those two words in the URL.  Windows live is the registered trademark, right? But you're right. The URL screwed up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The URL on mine says local.live.com. Right. But on the page, it says live.local.  Live.local. It's completely one or the other. Anyway, I'm looking at this traffic thing right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  now. What's so special about it? John, for those of us who actually leave our homes on a regular  basis and travel in what would be considered prime commuting hours, the opportunity to afford  a greater knowledge of what misfit has, you know, side swiped a semi rolled three times and block

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  traffic on 80 for four hours is incredibly useful. But I do have to say one thing. I agree with John  in one respect, at least in the Bay area, there aren't any alternate routes. So all you do is-  Actually, there are. Well, they're not many. It's not like LA where you can go in three different-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's the alternate route across the Bay Bridge?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For me, though, it's- It's not how bad it is and where you're going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the choice between the 580 and the 880. Like if you're looking at the map right now,  there's a slowdown around the Coliseum for probably a game or something. So I'd know  just to jump over to the 580 and roll to the 80 that way.  Now, Robert, when you do that, you should pound your chest.  This is Captain Robert in the Twitch Skybird. And we can have our own traffic report. The  first podcast with traffic reports. Real time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, I mean, when I brought home the traffic gauge, when I started doing testing for that one,  which is like a handheld regional version of this for LA and the Bay area and Seattle, my wife,  who had just finished a, you know, two years of a 500 mile a week round trip commute down to Santa  Clara, she liked actually watching it to see all of the traffic jams she wasn't running into

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  anymore. I do the same thing now because I no longer drive into San Francisco like I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's a nice cheat because you can do a quick eyeball and figure out if the Bay  Bridge is screwed up and maybe you'll leave an hour later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. It's just cool. We should give the URL. It was in the show notes, but live.local.live.com.  And then it's the traffic. Where does this traffic information come from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Traffic.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  So there is now universal traffic information?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, there's actually regional like Caltrans generates the traffic data. Caltrans generates,  and I don't know the name of the organization that does it up in Seattle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then traffic.com aggregates the official information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. They've got it for like Seattle, Portland, Salt Lake, Denver, Minneapolis.  And if you go to traffic.com, they've got a list of all the major areas they hit.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, it even provides event information as well. Like they're talking about the Knights

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  game for the Giants and the Gay Pride Parade happening right now and what streets you'd  probably want to avoid if you're trying to drive into that area.  So there's a Giants game and the Gay Pride Parade?  Yep.  Wow. They belong together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They should, the Giants should maybe get some of those guys to play on the team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It would be cool if they could integrate mass transit, like how full a car is or how soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think in some areas they do. I mean, if you, you know, it barts on time,  it probably indicates it's someone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I'm looking at this map and I see the 880 going past the Coliseum, but it's got like a green  color and an orange color. I mean, what is that supposed to mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's because they do, they monitor sections of the highway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you can see where I'm like right in the middle of the highway, I go fast or slower.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I go slower.  No, it means, John, it means if you're think about it, how many times you run into southbound on,  on one way is okay.  Crush in between Alameda and Union City.  Different directions.  Basically you can tell when the airport's getting hammered in Oakland.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Zoom in, John, then you can see that it's actually different lanes.  It's one, one different directions. You have to zoom in.  Robert was pointing out that the zoom, the scroll wheel works with the zoom,  which is very cool. And it works on Firefox on the Mac, which is kind of surprising given it's  an Microsoft product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I zoomed in and the thing went dead out.  You zoomed too far.  No, it turns, it's just a solid beige screen. Wait, wait, wait,  just three of us are looking at it. It went down. Is that what happened?  We killed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Zoom back, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pull out.  Right above the little compass thing, it says road and aerial. You click on aerial to get the,  the satellite view, which is kind of cool.  So as long as we're talking about it, any, but any other, any other websites,  everybody's now trying to, it's funny that we're back to the portal page, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Satellite view is giving me a black screen with some cute lines running down it.  I'm not happy with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're at like eight feet above the ground, John.  Are you in dial up?  No, he zoomed. Look at the lower right hand corner and tell me what the little,  the little gauge down there that says the scale. What does it say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I zoomed out to one mile.  It's okay.  Zoom out a couple more miles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's starting to sound like, you know, we're talking to grandpa.  Hey, you kids, get off my lawn.  John, John, John.  Kids in your traffic monitors and your portals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, uh, no, I hear all these raves from you guys and I look at this thing and I don't,  I'm not seeing what the rave is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't, you know, I wouldn't, I'm not sure I would make it my start page on the internet,  but I guess if I drove a lot, I would.  It's a useful tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm supposed to have to die.  Public transit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Avoiding all this traffic completely.  I'm avoiding going to the news because we have a,  our associate news editor, Fred F from the UK has been putting in stories and there's like  8 million stories in here.  There's quite a few to go through.  We can talk about Blu-ray.  Let's talk about Blu-ray.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cause we've got, we're still waiting.  Our Blu-ray box is supposed to show up Friday, so hopefully it'll be in Monday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  First Blu-ray players are now shipping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  From Samsung, Sony's are delayed another month or three months or six months,  or they're going to drop it to push PS3 sales.  But we've actually, we've had one of the desktop bios and a notebook bio in house.  And I got to tell you the Blu-ray software that they ship with the bios  really needs some more time in the oven.  Oh, what's wrong?  What goes wrong?  It doesn't work.  Yeah.  The one on the, we're still waiting for Sony to get back to us to explain why the stuff on the,  the desktop doesn't work.  You would think that if they-  Architecture issues on the notebooks for its occasional slowdowns while playing video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Patrick, can you ask Sony a question when you're,  when you're going through the discussion on this thing?  I'd like to know exactly how their primary competitor in consumer electronics,  Samsung manages to roll out what's essentially Sony's product before Sony.  Good question.  Just ask them, just ask them, say, you know, ask them, see what they say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, I, you know what I think it really is?  I think Samsung's trying to grow in the consumer electronics market in the United States  and they're willing to take entry level risks with stuff like the ultra mobile PC  and the, and the initial blue ray players.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're just throwing a bunch of stuff out and see what sticks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, according to PC world, Samsung is considering a dual format player later this year.  I would-  So is LG.  They already have them ready to go.  So this is, we've talked about this before.  John's contention is that they signed secret agreements preventing them from doing that.  Totally.  I have a conspiracy theory about the whole thing.  And that's that Sony won't let anyone release a blue ray player for under a thousand dollars  until the PS3 ships, which will make that the cheapest blue ray player.  This is according to a PC world, an assistant manager in Samsung's home  platform product planning division said, we don't have plans to make an HD DVD only player,  but are considering a universal player.  We're preparing HD DVD support now.  If we launch a universal player, it'll be the end of this year or early next year.  Samsung thinks blue ray will be HD DVD, but they will consider a dual format player  and Primera is shipping now a blue ray duplicator, which will make it much easier to pirate movies.  50 discs at a time.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We actually have the pioneer blue ray disc burner.  How much?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So these blue rays are the, are a higher data density than the HD DVD.  I mean, they're better.  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah.  25 gigabytes.  Let's forget the movie aspect of it.  How are they as backup devices or copy?  You know, how's the burner?  Is it, is it good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The phrase slow comes to mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is a lot of data you're putting down.  I mean, is this slow relative to the amount of data or is it actually slower than a DVD  burning the same amount of data?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's slow relative to what you're used to with existing optical disc.  I remember the same thing happened when you went from CD to DVD is it seemed really slow,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but you're burning 10 times the data.  Yeah.  You know, or eight times the data.  It's expensive, but you know, how does it look?  Has anybody seen a movie on the blue ray yet?  Not yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's exactly like an HD DVD disc only with a different logo.  I mean, it's, it's a little more purple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now the Samsung does support 1080p, which the blue, the HDs do not yet.  Supposedly.  Again, supposedly this is all spec, but are there any 1080p play movies to play back?  They're all 1080p.  They're all they are.  All the HD DVDs are 1080p, even though the players can't support it.  Isn't it cruel and ironic?  May very well have digital out at 1080p, but that'll be simple.  Try immediately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the other thing is we've, we've got a, we've got a Toshiba HD DVD player coming in  again, hopefully on Monday.  And they're supposedly they've done a firmware patch on it that alleviates a lot of our  frustration with the first generation Toshiba HD DVD players.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you see the argument?  And I thought it was pretty coherent from, let me see if I can find the source.  The guy saying, forget it.  It's, it's, it's, they're both going to lose.  The war is over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who wins?  I think internet too, to the fiber, to the curb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's, oh, that's coming tomorrow.  Right.  No problem.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, if they take any longer to get this stuff, stuff out, it's from audioholics.com top 10  reasons why high definition DVD formats have already failed.  Should I run by the reasons?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Number one, dramatic enough compared to DVDs.  There's not market saturation.  There's competing formats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or you could, you could write this article yourself.  This is what they say.  Nobody likes false starts, which I think is probably true, but it's not going to kill anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's been plenty of them that have done very well.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Number two, format wars don't sell players.  I think that's compelling argument.  Yeah, they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That creates competition with the lowest prices, which does sell players.  But it scares consumers.  I can rebut everyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know you can.  And by the way, you could also have written this article.  It doesn't matter to John.  I take either side.  Either side.  HD, DVD and Blu-ray are not quantum leaps in technology in the way that I guess DVD was.  In other words, I guess he's saying they're not, and I've said this before, they're not that much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  DVD over VHS was, was significantly more dramatic.  You start going into multi-layers, you can store a lot of data on one of these disks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You'll never be able to store on a DVD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A lot of people are looking at these on smaller monitors and going, huh, looks like my DVD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm talking about in terms of raw storage capability for backup purposes.  We got terabyte drives coming out.  We got that data someplace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a different conversation.  That's the data storage conversation versus the movie format.  Hi John.  I mean, I think this is all about whether this is a movie format, not whether it's the highest  quality consumer format we've ever had.  Yeah, but our people have been buying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I haven't been on for a couple of weeks, so I'm argumentative.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's good.  He saved it up.  He hasn't wasted it on anybody else.  Studios are conservative, greedy and unmotivated.  Well, that'll never change.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, well, no offense, but they were greedy and unmotivated when VHS came out and Betamax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they're conservative as a result.  They won't miss out on this.  Pervative.  You have to say that the list of titles we talked about last week, the list of titles  are not impressive unless you're a Milla Jojo.  And by the way, I found out it's not Jovovich.  It's Joowowich.  So unless you're a Milla Wojowich, man, or is it Wojowich?  I don't know.  There's 90 titles out, 96 titles out now for HD.  But for Blu-ray, there's only a handful.  It's 75 listed right now, but yeah.  PlayStation 3 cannot save the world.  Those who ignore history, dot, dot, dot.  People want technology that's 15 minutes ahead of its time.  Enthusiasts are getting tired and smarter.  A skeptical news media doesn't help.  I guess that's us.  Broadband and IPTV to compete?  That's the argument.  Any place but the USA.  Debunked.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think AT&T and Comcast would like to crush the DDD where it lies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you see the video of the Comcast technician sleeping on the guy's couch?  I don't blame the poor guy.  He was on hold for an hour with Comcast.  Doesn't even have a special number to make it any quicker on his own end.  He falls asleep.  He's got his laptop on his knees.  Poor contractor.  Yeah, he's probably not even an employee, right?  He's just a contractor.  No.  Fast asleep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We should put a website up with that stuff,  because I had a guy fall asleep in my driveway once from Sprint.  Really?  Yeah, I went out there.  I was wondering what was going on because I was waiting here.  And the guy went outside just to get something.  I went out there.  He's dead snoring.  And he's right in the front seat.  Unbelievable.  Sorry, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I sent a major kegger last night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're an overwhelming client.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just...  It happens in every industry.  I think John's fallen asleep during Twitch.  So, you know, I'm not going to say.  Don't encourage him.  According to Radio Sweden,  the White House ordered the Pirate Bay website closure.  In fact, they've got documents to prove.  I love this story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a backstory on that because I saw the title,  but I couldn't find the link to the actual article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What are they saying?  All right, I'll tell you.  They claim they've got the documents that show the US threatened to go to the World Trade Organization.  This is the same thing the US is doing, by the way, to Russia over all of mp3.com  to impose economic sanctions against Sweden.  If the site, Pirate Bay, which is of course a big BitTorrent tracker, was not stopped,  it came through the American embassy in Stockholm.  According to the documents,  chief prosecutor from the Swedish government was called to the justice ministry and ordered,  ordered to take action.  They take action.  You take action?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You make them down.  I gotta ask you something.  You know, Pat, you said you couldn't get, you know,  I found that that link died too.  And I'm wondering if that in itself isn't kind of suspicious.  Suspicious.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They only told to take down the site, but take down references to it.  Or references to the White House order of closure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It proves, it proves the contention.  That's all I needed.  I know it's true now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just the thought.  Probably what they would have done is thrown up  tariffs for all exports out of Sweden to the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the sad thing is the Swedish police are now going to just eat  crow because they're getting sued by all the companies they put offline by taking their servers.  The whole thing looks terrible and Pirate Bay's back in operation from Sweden.  So accomplished absolutely nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it disrupted a lot of other businesses.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So where do you think Larry Ellison stashed that $115 million?  He said he was given Harvard.  Did you see that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tell us the story.  That's a great story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Larry Ellison, a year ago pledges he will give $115 million to Harvard.  The single largest contribution in the university's history.  Harvard finally gets tired of waiting, goes to the press on Wednesday, says,  we haven't gotten anything.  In fact, school officials have spent months trying to get Larry to talk to them.  Larry never paid us, said Harvard spokeswoman Sarah Friedel.  He didn't have to pay.  I already got the publicity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He got everything he wanted.  He did this apparently once before.  Really?  Yeah.  I heard the reference on one of the broadcasts that he apparently stiffed somebody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's working because in October, Forbes magazine listed him as one of the top 10  philanthropists in the business world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Based on the nonexistent donation to Harvard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, good work, Forbes.  Nice job.  It looks good on paper.  Oracle is declining to comment.  So maybe there's some truth to this.  Did you see that Warren Buffett, this was actually announced today and I don't have  it in our notes yet.  Warren Buffett has said that he's going to give 85% of his fortune away, just like his buddy Bill  Gates, the number one richest man in the world, Warren's number two.  And of that, about 30 billion will go to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.  Isn't that great?  Cool.  That foundation will now have, well, he's not going to do it all at once, but he's pledged,  just like Larry Ellison.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The United Way is putting together an antitrust suit as we speak.  I wouldn't be surprised.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We want some of that.  He's pledged what will be basically double the endowment of the foundation, which is  pretty amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do love the fact that Berkshire Hathaway stock price is per share price is $3,071 on  Friday.  He doesn't believe in splits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apparently.  No, not at all.  Love that.  The first installment will be, is currently worth about 1.6 billion at today's Berkshire  Hathaway price for this year.  1.6 billion.  I think that's pretty impressive.  That's a good tax right off.  Ted Turner promised to give the UN a billion, whatever happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think he actually paid off our, what the US debt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He paid off that portion of the debt.  He did.  And he actually did it.  Yeah, good for him.  I think that was a one time because, you know, like all payments, the UN dues are annual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's not taking it on forever.  Just the old stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Take care of the back rent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, Warren Buffett, the real connection between Warren Buffett, I think, and Bill  Gates is that they both love to play bridge.  In fact, whenever they're together, I understand they hole up together and just play bridge for  hours all night.  They love playing bridge.  They love bridge.  Have you ever noticed that?  That they're big bridge.  Are you a bridge?  You seem like you'd be a bridge player, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, that's funny to say that because when I was in the University of California,  one of my roommates was the state national champion and I could have learned the game  from him.  But what did I do instead?  What did you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't want to say.  He was part of the free speech movement, I think.  You were out there making speeches and rabble rousing, weren't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I should have been learning bridge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, it'd be interesting if someone could do an analysis of all the great philanthropists,  you know, Carnegie and Morgan.  Rockefeller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If they played bridge.  Maybe there's a connection.  I think they played Wist.  Wist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Canasta.  There's a game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, it's hard to play Canasta because you have to hold like four  decks of cards in your hand.  It's a huge number of cards.  So where did you learn all that hearts and spades?  You learn so many interesting things on Twitter, don't you find?  There have been this week alone three zero day Excel flaws.  What's going on with Excel?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Three.  There's a security hole.  It's being exploited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who cares what they're what?  What kind of security hole can you have an Excel?  Well, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can have a problem because if you use Internet Explorer in Windows,  it is by default, it will open office documents from websites.  It'll open Word documents and Excel documents.  So if I embed an Excel document on a website  and somebody's foolish enough to be using Internet Explorer.  Pam.  I got them.  They're mine.  Larry Ellison has dropped out of college twice, by the way.  I don't think he went to Harvard at any point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are we going back to the Larry Ellison story?  I just like Ryeball Tales about Larry Ellison this week on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are there Ryeball Tales about Larry Ellison?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, basically, Ellison has never graduated with a degree from college.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No degree.  And that's held him back considerably.  I've noticed.  Obviously.  Yeah, obviously.  He'd be so much richer.  What's it?  What do you think?  What do you make of this Dan Rather story?  He's going to mark Cuban's HD net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, it sounds a lot like Good Night and Good Luck, only in a much mellower way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, interesting because apparently Rather, and this is very Nixonian.  Rather, rather.  Dan Rather has been going to watch by himself Good Night, Good Luck.  He's apparently seen it four or five times now over and over again.  But moaning the good old days of Edward R.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think he's trying to look for the frequency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the frequency, Kenneth?  That's an obscure.  I guess essentially he's been fired because CBS just won't let him do anything.  And we can blame the blogosphere for that because it was  Rather's now tainted story about Bush's service that was exposed by the blogosphere.  And really, I think, God damn rather fired.  And now, you know, a year or two later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wasn't it more an issue of his ratings and them trying not to muddle the  audience or trying to redirect?  Towards CBS News.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And what is I haven't seen network news in years, but I think CBS now is what are they doing?  They keep changing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've got a guy in holding pattern until Katie takes on the ratings.  The ratings on the new guy are up.  And then, you know, unless they change their mind, Katie Cork takes over later this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can't see that working out personally.  She's too chipper.  Well, yeah, she's not, you know, it's not I don't want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know what you're going here.  I know where you're going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sybil the soothsayer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He knows where I'm going, so I'm not going there.  I won't do it.  I won't do it.  I won't go there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know where you're going, John.  He's going to say.  Are you mad as hell?  Are you not going to take it anymore?  He's going to say no woman can be credible as a network news anchor.  That's not what I was going to say.  But that's pretty close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think that's what it is.  I just don't think Katie Couric is the one for that job.  I don't.  Well, when did she when did she become a talking head?  She's a personality.  That's good.  Well, maybe that's what the news needs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Walter Cronkite was a personality.  Yeah, I guess he was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess that's what was when it was Katie ever a reporter in a true sense.  Probably in some local station.  You mean like a journalist?  Probably.  I'm not I'm not convinced this is a good idea.  Nokia.  And by the way, though, that's not where I was going.  Oh, really?  Where were you going?  I was going to talk about somebody at Tech TV.  That's a kind of a personality guy.  They put him into the anchorman slot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Victoria Recano should be the next anchor of CBS 90 News.  Victoria.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is she still doing current affairs or something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, you're kidding.  She's like a hot shot on that news show Insider.  You're kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, John Corax reporting career brand.  She was hired by Stan Hooper as a desk assistant for the ABC News Bureau in Washington, DC.  She became an assignment editor at CNN,  worked as a general assignment reporter for WTVJ in Miami, Florida,  WRC TV and NBC station in DC.  Just looked up where she won her Associated Press Award and an Emmy.  She joined NBC News in 1989 as a reporter from 89 to 91.  She filled in for Bryant Gumbel as host of Today.  I think she's got some skills.  At least according to Wikipedia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So he's saying go to go to the I'm not seeing the same kind of bio  that you hear from get out of Rathers background or he was a real news guy.  This is floating around local stations.  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know, but you're saying this like like the whole integrity of the news reporting  mechanism in national television still matters.  Forget that.  I hate to say it.  I think it does matter.  I think it should, but I don't think it does in the eyes of the people making the decisions.  It's entertainment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they put Runa Arledge in charge of news at ABC.  It's become an entertainment division.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think Katie Corey can read his teleprompter just as good as anybody else.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not sure that either.  You want to go look at Victoria's Wikipedia article.  Victoria Ricanio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's so funny.  You know, if you ever watch that show on E called the soup,  they're on her case constantly.  It's hilarious.  Really?  Yeah.  She's like a highlighted person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apparently in May, she appeared as herself in an episode of CSI Miami,  but I'm just loving this picture on Wikipedia of her.  I mean, there's a news anchor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  By Francis Bertrand.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'd hire her.  Hey, have you guys seen the XGL running on open Seuss?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, let's get back to the topics here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what about this?  Did you this broadcast flag that they want to sneak sneak into  Senator Stevens telecommunications?  But what happened with that, by the way?  It's the latest on that because I only saw on Wednesday they were going up to the committee.  Did it pass through committee?  Senator Stevens, who is one of the three oldest men in the Senate.  We have the oldest Senate, by the way, in the history of Alaska.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's that jerk from Alaska, right?  Stevens is Alabama.  Oh, there's a guy from Alaska that's pretty, I thought it was Stevens, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stevens is kind of in the pocket, I believe, of the telecommunications industry.  He co-wrote the original 96 Telecommunications Act says,  we made some mistakes and they're redoing it, but they've snuck in a broadcast flag.  Remember the broadcast flag was overturned.  The FCC wanted to put it in.  By the courts, by the courts.  By votes, by.  FCC wanted to put it in.  This was a device that would go into all analog, all TVs, all computers that would allow a  broadcaster to set a flag on any programming saying you may not copy this.  And the FCC was going to enforce it and the court said you can't.  So now the Senate is going to send out a bill,  the new Telecommunications Act to make it into law requiring that you put these things in.  So I guess the committee marked it up this week and I don't know what the latest status is of it.  How many times do we have to shoot this down?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.  It's a terrible idea.  When they want to get something through, they just keep running it at you until you're stuck with it.  You can't wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We should be highlighting these politicians who keep doing this.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Most of the guys are in incumbent areas where they can't get voted out of office and they've  already gerrymandered their place in such a way that, except for the senators,  but all the house guys have all, you know, they're pretty much,  they're locked in, we can't get rid of these people.  Turn limits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, this got me.  Stevens has been in there forever.  I'm just trying to see what the latest is on this.  Maybe he's Alaska.  No, I thought there was a Stevens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a Stevens in Alaska too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  I'm confusing which.  Yeah, Alaska is terrible.  I'm not sure which Stevens it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  From Alaska should be ashamed of themselves.  Oh, you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is Alaska.  I thought AAAL was Alabama.  I'm sorry.  I apologize.  I was completely wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You should apologize to the people from Alabama.  They haven't got a guy that bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I take back the accent.  What's the Alaska accent?  Was this an Alaska AK?  I don't know.  I'm confused.  You're asking too much of me.  Making the FCC the role of gatekeepers of new technologies.  Yikes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, apparently the FCC approved taxes for VoIP on Friday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really?  That was something that was there were long opposed to.  Interesting.  Moving these specific kinds of bits across the internet are now suddenly taxable.  This is net neutrality once again.  That's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where's my CB radio?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Federal Communications CNET is reporting that the FCC voted unanimously at its monthly meeting here  in DC to require all voice over internet protocol services that connect to the public  switch telephone network as opposed to using peer-to-peer technology like Skype to contribute  to the universal service fund.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So wait a minute.  If you use Skype, you'd have to pay...  Oh, it's the universal service.  That's right.  Yeah.  So you'd have to pay the tax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what subsidized telephone service in the middle of nowhere back in the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Skype to Skype calls wouldn't be affected and...  But Skype to phone would be.  Skype to phone would be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Anything that...  If any time a VoIP connects to a POTS, you get charged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anytime a VoIP connects to...  It sounds like something my parents told me about the birds and the bees.  When a VoIP and a POTS like each other and they connect, you get taxes.  Any other stories anybody wants to bring out?  I can talk about CEOs earning 262 times the pay of workers  according to the Economic Policy Institute.  It has been going on for years.  Who cares?  They deserve it.  Give them more money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They especially deserve when they start laying everybody off.  That's what I really get their money's worth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How about wireless USB?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a mess.  The story behind wireless USB is at the last ultra wide band meeting,  somebody was like, it's time to start shipping products.  And everybody went, her, her, yes, we should ship products.  So someday we'll see wireless USB products.  And wireless...  That's a good product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Part of the issue is spectrum is that if you're going to make it something  that you could sell everywhere, you've got to get the spectrum approved everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ultra wide band is fundamentally a US only technology because of the bandwidth in place.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you can make it, but you can only sell it here, I guess.  But isn't that particular type of frequency allocation very robust in terms of you could  have lots of overlapping devices and...  Well, why don't they use 2.4?  Why don't they use the unregulated bandwidth?  Is it just too crowded now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's not like you're not on a band with ultra wide band.  It's a bunch of, it's a whole series of frequencies and it's a bunch of sputtering that goes on.  And you have to, it's a time based kind of thing.  It's not a jumping thing either.  It's all at once.  Like frequency hopping spread the spectrum.  But that's different.  Ultra wide band is also used to be called low detection radio and it used to be called  pulse radio and it's a sputter.  It's a very strange type of radio that some people think is just bogus.  It's been around for a long time.  So it may never work.  No, it does work.  The military apparently uses it, but they have to crank up.  They don't give them enough because everybody else that has those fixed spectrums or these  fixed frequencies, they're upset with the fact that ultra wide band has to take a whole  bunch of this stuff and then they make a bunch of supposedly the ultra wide band people say  it's all below the noise level, but these other guys say that's bowl.  It interferes with the global positioning satellite frequency and everything in between.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's right now it's a three to 10 gigahertz.  So we're very, very high.  And right all at once.  It's all over the place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so it's, and it's a, so they, so the FCC said, well, we can let you guys slide,  but we, you don't get a lot of juice.  So they won't let them have much power.  So the best that you can do with it is stick a device, you know, in an ultra USB device  and then shoot it over to the printer like 10 feet away.  Or for a cell phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But so is it better than Bluetooth?  I guess it's faster than Bluetooth is the whole point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it's super fast.  It's 400 plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Bluetooth is going to run over it and a wireless 1394 is going to run over it.  And wireless USB is going to run over it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's just, it's like a cable almost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a, it's a, essentially it's ethernet only without wires.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Interesting.  And I guess you could do is on low power devices like cell phones.  And that's why they're interested.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've had people in the business tell me that it's, it's really kind of, it has certain  flaws.  In fact, even Intel has been playing with it and they've had to kind of redesign the  theory.  And it seems to be, it's a little iffy and there's a lot of money that's gone down the  drain in this particular technology.  It may never actually get very far.  Although I'll get a letter about that tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's the IEEE spec is vaporized amidst the battling between the Intel crew and the  FreeScale crew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there's a coffee shop in Vancouver, Washington called Brood Awakenings.  And there's a guy in the coffee shop.  He's not in the coffee shop.  He's using the coffee shop's wifi is actually sitting in his parking lot.  He's been there for three months.  Right.  Using using the great story using their wifi.  So finally the manager of the store says this creep, he's been stealing our wifi for three  months and he hasn't bought a coffee.  So she calls 911.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now this story, yes, more to it than that.  Leo, this story is interesting because there's a, because the coffee shop apparently let  the guy do this for a while.  Then they went and went out and asked him if you just buy some coffee because they're  getting sick of it.  And so the guys refused to, I mean, if the guy had bought some coffee, I think this would  have never happened.  And so now we have this precedent after this, you know, they, they call the police, told  them that this, they've told the guy to buy some coffee, wouldn't do it.  And so the police came up out and gave them that, that kind of citation for stealing,  you know, whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I know it's not locked down and they don't, do they have anything that when you  log onto their, their wifi, it puts up a splash page.  It's a conditional for using, you know, you know, if you think about it, it's, once you

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  start abusing anything, you know, eventually even the most altruistic person is going to  get kind of irritated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's, it's the tragedy of the comments, Roger, right?  But you know, the flip side is if you don't put a fence around it, what are you going to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What, what does he kill?  I mean, he's not killing their bandwidth.  He's just sitting out there and surfing.  Maybe he is killing their bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe you say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I think they, they called the cops, the deputies came, they said, knock it off  to the guy.  He came back and so they arrested him and now they find out by the way, he's a level  one sex offender, but that's.  That's another matter.  Oh, that's an unrelated matter.  Creepy and disgusting.  You think if you were a sex offender that you wouldn't kind of be so contentious in  a situation like this.  What he was wearing.  Well, what he was doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So anyway, the, the, the, this whole thing, you know, the fact is, is a lot of these coffee  shops, they put the systems up and you're right, Patrick.  They should, I think, I feel the same way.  If you can't, if you let the signal go out into the street, it belongs to the public.  But, you know, what does it take to have some little nerd that probably comes in there  and has coffee anyway, to, to set the, you know, to go into this router and then just  find the guy's Mac address and then block him.  I mean, this is not rocket science.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah, but this is, this is a classic case of, you know, somebody not bothering to do  their homework, you know, getting exploited and then calling a fire.  I mean, calling nine one one and police have better things to do than browse the guy out  of your parking lot, you know, call up the ISP is providing your information, read the  manual for the system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, they're really clever.  They'd have hacked him.  I mean, they just, they, they, I mean, you know, bring in a hacker.  It's not even being clever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's being responsible.  Well, you wouldn't be like, is this the fire department?  I can't operate my coffee machine.  I mean, come on, if you're going to sell a service, have a clue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But let's say they didn't use, let's say they didn't use nine one one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's say use the non, the non emergency number.  Do they have the right to call the police if this guy's using their wifi?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's really the police felt.  So they gave the guy a citation or they busted him.  So they must have been had the reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, did they give him a citation just to warning the wifi or did they give him a citation

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  for sitting in first thing they did is they gave him a warning.  They said, get out of here.  He came back.  And then of course, at that point, now they're mad at him.  And so they, they either arrested him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is going to happen more and more until I don't know what's going to happen.  Well, it's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A lot of, I mean, the cap days are shutting it off on the weekend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's what I'm afraid of.  I mean, I hope they don't start locking it down, shutting it off.  I mean, I was, I'll be honest.  I was in a beach house this week.  There was no internet access.  But when I went upstairs, I was able to get on somebody's system and I use it.  I know it's wrong.  It is wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're a bad person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not wrong.  What's wrong about it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Someone leaves their system.  I agree.  It's not wrong.  As far as I'm concerned, it's like, it's, you know, once it gets into the,  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Leave your front door unlocked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was invading my house, my space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, it's different than coming in the house or being outside.  If I started throwing stuff out into the street and somebody picked it up,  what am I supposed to, hey, you're taking my stuff from the street.  I mean, that doesn't make any sense.  It's not the same as going in the house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I liken it to, I'm walking down the street and I have some,  I've just finished my Fritos and I got a bag and there's a trash can on the street.  I open it up.  I throw the Fritos in.  Now I'm using their utility, but it's a de minimis usage.  It's not hurting them in any way.  And if it did, they have methods and steps you can go through that are pretty simple.  They could lock the garbage in it.  Lock the trash can.  Or if you're a business and you know you're going to have a lot of users and you don't  want to deal with using a custom login for everyone, you could simply get a decent router  that provides throttling for all the users.  And it's just like that way no one user can be like hogging all the bandwidth.  What's missing from this story that I wish that we're in it is what was the guy doing?  I mean, if he was just checking his email and some occasional surfing,  in other words, not doing anything that a customer wasn't doing and not  tying up the network, then so what?  I think it was annoying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it was just annoyed by the guy because he kept,  he wouldn't buy the coffee if you had just bought a cup of coffee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they didn't like the guy in their parking lot too, obviously, right?  Now you can arrest him for being in your parking lot.  How many hours was this guy sitting in the parking lot?  Three months.  Three months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay.  He helped me a little bit, Patrick.  Because he just towed his car.  He lived there.  Okay.  He should have just towed his car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they do have the 72-hour loss in most places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Australia is going to give every family in the country free internet filtering software.  It's the smart.  It's the centerpiece.  The centerpiece of $116 million crackdown on internet porn,  but the centerpiece is here's some software.  They're not really cracking down on the porn.  They're just saying here to use this software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Australia is great because anybody can be as raw and in your face as the entire country.  I love it.  I love it.  Especially listening to the parliamentary debate and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Any debate.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Communications Minister Helen Coonan said,  this is the single biggest commitment to protecting families online  and the history of the internet in Australia.  It's not bad.  I don't know.  It puts a safety.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is also the woman, didn't she refer to one of her fellow cabinet  ministers as a grub and would ask to apologize?  She said she apologized if she had offended grubs in any way by associating them with the minister  and then was censured from the parliament for one day.  We need more of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is she a senator?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, she's a minister.  They're going to.  Oh, she is.  It says Senator Coonan.  Yeah, they have a Senate.  Yeah.  So she's both communications minister and a senator.  And they expect 2.5 million families to take the software.  They don't see what the software is though.  I'm curious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll probably be all around in New South Wales.  I'm just like the internet connection anywhere outside of actually,  no, I take that back.  I am sure Western Australia has pretty good, but I don't know.  I mean, this is a country with legal brothels.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're a country with legal brothels, Roger.  Certain.  It's called Nevada.  Certain areas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, I mean all of Australia.  It's, you know, the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a, they have Australian football.  They export fosters because they refuse to drink it themselves.  Smart people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fosters is what tourists drink.  I think they were really committed to this though.  Wouldn't they work with ISPs to do the filtering at the ISP level  than just giving, you know, handing out software?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you see, if you do it at the ISP level,  then you're centering what your citizens have available, right?  In the United States, that would be a First Amendment violation.  Okay.  You know, if you give people the ability to software,  if you make the software free and available,  instead of telling people, you know, go to your ISP or go buy some software.  That makes sense.  You're putting hands in the tools of the people.  I mean, think about it.  I mean, what would make more sense?  The Child Online Protection Act or giving everybody access to filtering software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, you're right.  You're absolutely right.  Don't we try to require libraries to run filtering software?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the whole Copa thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was Copa.  Okay.  But at the same time, Copa had other issues.  Well, the filtering, there's all sorts of issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's issues with filtering software.  You know, if you run most of the filtering software,  you can't search for, you know, breast cancer.  You know what I mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although one of the things they are going to do is use these in libraries.  So that's similar in that respect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, excuse me.  It was a House of Representatives in Australia where the,  it was Julia Gillard who called the Minister of Health.  I moved at the sniveling grub over there not to be further heard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You sniveling grub.  I love it.  Has anybody tried Opera 9?  They claim six million downloads in the first day of availability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's really nice.  I like it.  We're actually showing it on Tuesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's got BitTorrent support, really good search engine customization.  And they've added now, I guess in response to Firefox,  you've got skinning that's very similar to Firefox skinning,  and you've got widgets which are essentially extensions.  Of course, they don't have the same number yet of extensions as Firefox has.  And it's free.  Do you like it better than Firefox?  They're not charging at all?  No, they've gone free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you like it, Patrick?  It's pretty impressive.  Are you still using Firefox or are you?  At the moment, but I may be considering switching.  There's some other browser activity going on,  so I'm kind of running a mini, mini browser environment  on my notebook for the next few days.  What does that mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You'll figure it out eventually.  Not necessarily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or I can have my Dvorak moment, or you can watch DLTV this week  and find out the mystery of the next generation browsers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have mixed feelings about their RSS handling.  They basically have a RSS reader built in, which is pretty cool.  And it's got BitTorrent.  Yeah, but is it the latest version of BitTorrent?  And how long would you have to wait for that to be upgraded?  And how do you tell?  Because he just released that version 4.2 that has...  Well, it's not open source, so that's exactly right.  You're at their mercy.  It's nice that it's there.  That way you have one less thing you have to worry about if you click on a Torrent.  At least you know you have something on your computer that'll work with it.  I'm still waiting for...  I guess Kevin probably isn't going to join us,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He apparently is trying to log in, but I can't see his ID that he's calling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't see him.  I see him online.  Oh, do you?  Yeah.  He said he tried IMing you.  Oh, I didn't see anything.  It's our...  Oh, I don't want to say that.  I know what it is.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  But it looks like that handle is offline now, so...  He has to approve it.  He's invisible.  Well, we have the other issue, which is we don't have enough room for him.  So who...  How much do you...  Just quickly back to that Australian porn software thing.  How much...  The government's spending $116 million on this crackdown.  Yeah.  How much do you think they're spending on that particular piece of software?  Well, they said they expect to hand out 2.5 million copies, so...  Is it a shelf software or is it...  They don't say and I wish they did.  I don't know what software they plan to use.  I mean, are they suddenly now going to support this for life and spend money on that as well?  Well, that's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's really, in my opinion, more up to the internet service providers to at least offer

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  tools like that if users want them or for the users themselves just to take it upon themselves  to either use an inexpensive or low cost tool.  I don't know.  I just...  It just seems like a waste...  Something the government shouldn't be doing.  Giving out software doesn't seem like the first thing they should be up to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't even know how to...  Creating desk jobs.  I mean, look around you.  I mean, you talk about subsidies and look at water subsidies.  I mean...  I can't point the finger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does anybody by me think the energy is a little low this week on the show?  Are you tired, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or you want to take a nap?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do you want to talk about something really controversial?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Set up a video camera and we can...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You guys are boring me stiff with this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, John, are you running Linux at all in any system?  Linux?  Yeah, I am.  Is he really?  Have you checked out XGL running on Compiz, the new Windows manager?  I thought you were joking.  What is XGL?  It's really...  It's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's an extension to the X window, like the X server.  So you can basically do what Quartz Extreme does for the Aqua interface.  You can accelerate the interface through OpenGL accelerated 3D part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have you installed that anywhere, Patrick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we actually ran it on Thursday's show.  It's really pretty.  We about killed Roger.  Oh, you had to set it up, Roger?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but it was actually kind of cool.  Once you kind of figured out the quirks in SUSE, all the pieces fall into place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's from Novell, so you have to use SUSE for this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, they've actually got packages, XGL packages available at Free Desktop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cool.  Well, I'll have to try it.  It does look pretty cool.  I'm looking at it.  It's a lot less resource intensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is this the future?  Nah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just iCandy.  What's the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I was arguing that it was a nice toy, but Robert actually had a couple of good reasons to use it.  For gaming, maybe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, for hiding porn at work.  Because you could rotate the desktop immediately.  Maybe Australia should give vision.  And then have your Excel sheet on one side of the cube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We could also point out iCandy on top of a solid platform is pretty much the entire  OS X and or Windows Vista.  Oh, I agree.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, does Apple just do really good cooling on their systems?  Because that's one thing I'll notice on these new 3D desktops is that my 3D card is now in 3D mode  all the time and...  It's hot.  The fan turns.  That fan kicks up and that's now becoming the single loudest component in the system.  Interesting.  Apple solves that by not putting...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think Core's Extreme is that intensive.  Yeah, I think that's exactly right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Still, it looks gorgeous.  And I don't know.  It is a lot of iCandy, but there might be some usefulness there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I actually blogged it when it was first introduced.  People can look it up on the dvorak.org slash blog.  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, way to undercut me, John.  Thanks, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He blogged it, but Patrick's got video.  Yes.  Video.  Video is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We still got the working machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's an advantage.  I'd recommend people out there go to both sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, I like that even better.  While they're out of there, they can go to crankygeeks.org.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's go plug all the time.  Plugfest.  I got nothing.  I got nothing.  Okay.  You got Twitch.  We're going to launch the...  Yeah, you're listening to my show, so I can't plug anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, you got your other million shows.  You got like nine shows on Twitch.tv now.  Yeah.  With the new website...  Oh, so we can probably name it.  Security Knot.  Thanks, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  MacBreak.  Outside the net.  MacBroken.  MacBroken.  MacDaddy.  Well, don't do anything with the Daily GizWiz because that's just too obvious.  We do have a website launch coming up.  It's not Dig 3.0, but the new website is ready to launch.  And we're going to tie it into the Dell campaign, which was supposed to launch  today on this show.  And I got lazy.  And I just said, hey, guys, can you put it off because I want to take a vacation.  So I think the Dell thing will launch in a couple of weeks.  And with it, the new site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What are you using for a content manager?  Drupal.  Again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I like Drupal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, what's different about it?  What are you going to do that's different?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's a new design and it's got a lot more capability.  Or you have outside people working on it or are you doing it?  I do.  Oh, God, I couldn't do this.  No, I have...  You can't do Drupal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Drupal's pretty brain dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I can run our site, but the redesign came from Amber McArthur's team at archetype.ca  and the folks who are working on the Drupal engineering are really a great team called  Lullabot.  And they've done a great job.  It's very nice.  Lullabot?  Lullabot.  L-U-L-L-A-B-O-T.  Look, it's not Dig 3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you paying them or are they doing it for just the plugs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I'm paying them.  And it's not Dig 3.0.  I mean, that's a major...  More than just a redesign.  I mean, that's a major...  This is just going to be a different looking site with some additional features, but not...  Not significant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What new features are we going to have here?  Mostly for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, great.  The workflow is built into the website.  You'll see some differences.  Not much.  You know, the comments are moved around in a different area.  You'll be able to see all the episodes.  It'll be a little...  There'll be a Flash player on every episode so you can listen from the website, things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who's paying for that bandwidth?  Is that pricing?  AOL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It all comes from AOL.  It all comes from AOL.  Okay.  Yeah.  AOL.  Well, it depends.  AOL's doing some of the shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you worried about your cut being diminished?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no.  I mean, to be honest about it, the reason I'm asking is because I think a lot of people out  there who listen to this show are in the content managers.  They use one of the blogging software packages, Wordpress or Drupal or Joomla  or any of these other things.  And I think we should probably discuss it a little more in detail so people out there  can say, oh, that's interesting.  No wonder I can't do that at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've actually been woefully behind in writing up how we record the shows now because we've  changed it since the last time I wrote it up and how it's produced and all that stuff.  And I will do that.  There's going to be a fairly long talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're talking about the regular shows, the Skype shows, the local shows?  The local shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's all different everywhere.  And I do like Drupal.  Drupal's been great.  One of the things Drupal will give us the capability.  Right now it automatically handles the PayPal and stuff, the donations.  But one of the things it's going to allow us to do is a much more e-commerce and private,  not private, but sites.  Part of the site will be open to members only and Drupal handles that very well.  And also it has each of you have a blog on there if you want it.  Yeah, we never use it, do we?  No, you know, but that's all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Didn't we replace the passwords?  Get replaced when you moved on to Drupal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think so.  No, we've always done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You never told us anything, though.  You're keeping us off the blog.  You're keeping it secret.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I still have your wacky icon.  What else?  We're going to have new album art.  There's a lot going on behind the scenes.  Laurie Lobo watches doing our album art from illustrations, original illustrations by  Nitro Sack and Snaggy of The Joy of Tech.  I got to get a picture of you, Roger, actually.  If somebody out there wants to see the most interesting Drupal implementation I've seen

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  for a while, you should go to the last redesign of The Onion.  Are they Drupal?  Yeah, I know.  You look at it, you go, my God, it looks like the New York Times redesign.  It's amazing what you can do with Drupal.  Well, the new 47, which just came out, is incredibly powerful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which one?  Drupal 4.7 is just very nice.  I didn't realize they were using Drupal on The Onion.  Yeah, I found that out when I was doing some research on the Drupal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well, one of the nice things, and I don't want to get too inside baseball here,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  one of the nice things about 4.7, the new version of Drupal, is it's not columnar anymore.  You can have arbitrary regions anywhere of any kind.  And that's going to help us a lot.  Dippin's all over.  Yeah, that's going to help us a lot.  All right, let me see.  I think if I dump you, Roger.  Yep.  Yep.  Go ahead, just dump me.  I don't care.  Poor Roger.  Poor Roger.  I might be able to, thank you, Roger.  Sure.  Always great to have you on.  I'm really glad you could be here.  Always great to have you on.  I'm really glad you could be here.  But goodbye.  Goodbye.  Goodbye, Roger.  Goodbye.  He's glad to go.  Are you kidding?  He's glad to be off this podcast.  Back into the hot tub, man.  Back to the hot tub.  You know, he's got, he was picking up chicks.  People could see this on the video at 57.  They could see him going off and picking up women.  Maybe I shouldn't say that.  Roger's a player.  He's a good operator, baby.  He's very, very smooth.  Well, Kevin's not answering, so I guess I punted Roger prematurely.  You before we get Kevin, if we can get Kevin on, I'll try.  I'll continue to try.  Any thoughts about Dig 3?  You went to the party, didn't you?  I was there.  Were you there?  Patrick and Roger and I both went.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Roger?  Excuse me, Robert and I.  Robert and Roger and I, all three went.  What did you think?  It's pretty.  It's smart.  It's going to be interesting to see what Calcanis' responses.  Calcanis is not copying responses over at...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I loved Kevin's line.  Oh, Jason should have waited to steal our code because we're going to make some big changes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's clean.  They've done a lot of stuff with actually allowing you to track what your friends are doing  inside of Dig 3.0 that I think is going to be pretty popular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Community-oriented stuff.  The visualization tools, I think, are the highlight,  even though those won't be out for a couple of months.  Can we talk about those or are they hush-hush?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, they've already been blogged.  Publicly, yeah.  I don't know if...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Has anyone put a video up actually showing them in action?  This is the flash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've got a video but we haven't run it yet because it was after the last show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the flash tool that you were talking about?  Right.  Yeah.  What does it do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, boy.  It's kind of an...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One put up a series of bubbles that each bubble represented stories that were currently being  dug and it would also show you the people in real time who were digging them.  And the bubbles rise up as they're getting...  Or it becomes kind of like that linked view where the bigger the bubble,  the more activity currently is surrounding it.  And then interconnected lines would tell you how people jump from one story to the next.  And by the thickness of those lines, you would see how many people were reading that one story  and then jump to the secondary story.  It was just lots of cool visualizations like that in addition to a variable top,  say, top 10 to top 100 view of the front page as people are digging on all the content that's  currently available.  Kevin, can you tell what we're talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And we have Kevin Rose in a bucket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hello.  Yeah. You're on your laptop mic, I guess, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. Sorry about that. I'm at the office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's okay. Your new cavernous office is obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. It's crazy. Everyone's around here doing last minute preparations for our big push on Monday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Monday, the new site three is coming out, but not the features that we were just talking about,  which are these kind of real time flash, you know, digs, kind of super dig spy on steroid stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. So that stuff is coming out mid July.  We have to ramp up and buy some more servers to have all that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I bet. That's cool. So tell us what's new in Dig 3.0.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's pretty much we're expanding into a bunch of different areas that we haven't been  into in the past. It's expanding outside of just technology based news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Taking some heat from the, you know, the dig regulars over that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, it's actually we've gotten a lot of push from the users of dig right now.  They've been submitting stories about, you know, world and business or world news and,  and, you know, movie related news and music. And it's one of those things that the community  will moderate that stuff down on the existing site because they know it doesn't fit into any  given topic on the site. Right.  And so we're expanding to a bunch of different other areas. But one of the things we really  want to do is make sure that that the core community of the people that use dig today  still have the experience that they, they know and love. And so we've given every single user  on the site, the ability to remove any of the topics that they're not into. So if you could care  less about any of the stuff that we add, all you have to do is uncheck a box, click on save,  and then you'll have just that technology view that you did the day before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the people who are complaining, which obviously is just a loud minority, they don't have to worry.  It's good. It could look exactly like the old dig.  Exactly.  Yeah. They don't have to see all the new stuff.  Are you worried? I guess some of the concern is that you might dilute the audience because  right up to now it's been a geeky audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, it's kind of strange because over the last year we've really seen that kind  of change and shift with all these new users that we've been adding on a daily basis. So  we get a lot of the, a lot more mainstream stuff than we used to. It used to be hardcore,  just, you know, Linux only kind of stuff going on the site and about creating server clusters  or whatever it may be. But now, you know, we get a lot of videos, a lot of YouTube stuff,  and you know, it's been all over the place. So it's clear that we need to really expand  and push out these other areas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Alexa, according to Alexa, you're bigger than Slash.now. Does that match your  own statistics?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's been pretty crazy. I think that right now we see about a million unique visitors a day.  A day?  A day.  Jesus.  And that results in about nine and a half million pages served a day.  So.  And how many uniques a month?  That's a good question. I'll have to find out exactly. I think it's like nine and a half or  something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I imagine, I mean, I certainly visit every day, but I don't think everybody would  visit every day. So if you're getting a million uniques a day, yeah, it's probably something  like that.  Yeah, I think it's spread around there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. I mean, that's considerably more.  It actually sounds like it'd be more than that. The, you know, the problem that you have with  Alexa, by the way, is that they don't, they don't take into account anybody who has a,  uses Firefox, which unfortunately is where I'm sure Slashdot, for example, probably has  the majority of its people using Firefox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but I'm sure Dig does too.  I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, maybe.  We're, I can tell you, actually, we're right on Firefox for about 65% of the users that  visit the site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's pretty standard with the high tech-  Yeah, that's what our site is as well.  But that's going to change if you start opening it up because you're going to, you know,  these people that do all the kind of entertainment-  Oh, yeah.  Orientated, that Digs, they're going to be all Windows IE users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, without a doubt. I'm sure they'll draw in a whole different crowd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which will actually make your numbers look even bigger on Alexa if you're going to go  by those only.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but we don't need to go by Alexa. We got the numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, somebody should have the same, but subscribe to the Nielsen's?  The NetNielsen's, you mean?  Sort of. The NetNielsen's.  The NetNielsen's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I don't. Do you, Patrick, you know those numbers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I tend to find Alexa to be a very curious choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just the only one that everybody can publicly see.  It's free.  Right.  And it's probably okay for, well, maybe not, for, you know, kind of a sense of scale,  if not actual numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's interesting because, you know, internally when we look at our own numbers,  obviously there's some differences there.  But if you see, if we have a really, you know, a big story hits the wire about Diggers and  like that, and we see a spike internally, it'll also be reflected on Alexa.  So there, it's somewhat, you know, it's nice to have a free tool that you can compare yourself  to other sites and other, so that's all we look at it as, not real hard factual information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think also people agree that the Dig effect now has, you know, completely outpaced  the Slashdot effect. I mean, for a while, you know, getting hit by, you know, getting linked  by Slashdot was deadly to a site and now it's pretty clear.  I was talking to Vincent Ferrari, who was the AOL cancel guy, you know, he's got that video  or audio of him trying to cancel AOL and which is hysterical to listen to because he, the guy on  the other end, John, the AOL call rep just does everything he can do to keep Vincent from  canceling, including asking Vincent, who's 30, if his dad can come on the line.  Talk to your dad, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. I had a similar problem with Vonage.  Those guys are impossible to get rid of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, that's every company tries to keep customers, but there are ways and there are ways.  Anyway, Vincent told me that, you know, he put this up on the site and it wasn't a big deal until  it got dug and just took off. In fact, he was, Matt Lauer interviewed him on NBC and everything.  So clearly Dig has a lot of impact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's cool. Yeah, I saw him on CNN.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, he was on CNN.  It's funny because somebody sent me the phone number of John, the call rep from Ogden, Utah.  John lost his job. You know, AOL fired him.  I feel bad for John because John was just doing what AOL told him to do, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I was going to say, I think they're instructed to actually act like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And, you know, I always take these fire wings with a grain of salt. I'm always reminded,  I'll tell an anecdote here. Pat McGovern used to, when he was running Computer World,  and I think he's almost done this a little bit with InfoWorld, but not to any extreme,  he used to always have these columnists who were like these guys who dug up all this dirt.  And then when it like offended an advertiser or something, McGovern was, okay, the guy's  fired, firing him. But the guy never existed. So they changed the pseudonym and the guy's  working again the next day. I think this guy actually was fired because we called him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I tried to get him on the radio show and he said, well, I've hired an attorney and the  attorney has told me not to talk to anybody. Of course, maybe that was maybe that's part of  the AOL strategy. I don't know. Anyway, in any event, I did talk to Vincent and he he's a big  Twitch fan, by the way. In fact, I didn't. The truth is, I just mentioned it on the radio show  and he called in immediately and we put him on. So, wow. Yeah, it's kind of a fun story.  And I imagine I would guess that because of all the attention AOL has received because of this,  now would be a good time to cancel, right? I mean, it'd be pretty easy to get through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, Leo. No, we work with these people. No, I'm not canceling AOL. I love AOL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey guys, can you hold on for one? Or I'll be back in just a second. Sure. Somebody's smoking  the pernicious weed outside my garage and I need to stop them real quick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would explain the sluggishness that you were worried about, John, earlier.  Maybe. So you had a party, Kevin. First of all, you had two parties, one at the beach house to  celebrate the anniversary. What is it, the second or third anniversary of Google?  You mean the Dignation? It was Diggs and Google. Yeah. I just promoted you to the owner of Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Dove Dig, yeah. Yeah, that was the one at the beach L.A. was just our one year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One year? Yeah, one year with Dignation. No. Oh, Dignation. Got it. Yeah. And then you had  a party on Thursday for the press to show 3.0, which I'm sorry I couldn't make, but we've been

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  talking about. I never even got invited. Oh, that's not true. We sent you an invite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You must have gotten invited because I got invited. John gets no spam and he gets no invites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I would have made it if I had it on the calendar. I'll call you next time, John,  and tell you. I was out of town. I couldn't make it, but it sounds like it was a great party. Did

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  you get big turnout, Kevin? Yeah, there's about 140, 150 people in the press and just friends.  About 105 degrees. Yeah, it was hot. It was so hot. Where was this? Oh, it was in San Francisco?  Yeah, it was in San Francisco downtown. This bar called the New. Oh, on that hot day.  Yes, that hot day. Exactly. It was hot. A really hot day. The one hot day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was at Stinson Beach. It was hot at the beach. So that's how hot it was. It was really hot.  Well, congratulations. It's really exciting. What is it going to take to get 3.0 up? I mean,  it's all done and it's ready and you're just going to flip a switch tomorrow morning?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wish it was that easy. It's actually a very, very complex process. It takes about 45 minutes.  It's going to start at about 5 a.m. tomorrow morning. It's one of those things where there's  a bunch of DB changes that have to be made and a bunch of code has to be pushed. It's all like  subversion. It is insane. Good luck. We're moving to a different type of... We're moving off a  standard kind of MySQL structure to kind of a sharding-based structure. So it's a different  type of file system that... Why are you doing that? Is it more robust or...? It just helps you scale  long-term. Scale, yeah. So it's one of those things where this is a big, big deal for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, man. Are you worried about... It's going to be tricky.  Yeah, it's going to be very tricky. You can be down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's one of those things where you internally, we basically for like the last week  have been doing trial runs every single morning. Fire drills.  And today was our first really successful day of doing the push without any problems. So that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  great. Well, I logged on a couple of days ago and you were down for briefly. Was that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, we did a small little update to kind of accommodate for some 3.0 pushes. So  it's really tricky now. It's at the point to where when you're on, I don't know what we're on now,  but 75 or 80 servers to move and migrate that to a new version and then make sure it all syncs up  and add an additional 20 or so servers. It's a challenge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is this all new code? Are you getting rid of all the old dig code or is it...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's actually, it's all rewritten from scratch because it's taking advantage of the  new file system. So luckily we hired a really good guy here a few months ago, Scott Baker,  who is one of the Apple guys that helped them scale iTunes and whatnot.  Oh, wow. Great.  He came to us from Apple and then the guy that does our DBA stuff came to us from Friendster and  you know, the kind of problems that they ran into. So he's helped solve a lot of their challenges.  Scaling, because they grew very, very fast.  Yeah. They had some major issues back in the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So yeah. Well, that's exciting. Congratulations on your success.  And we're glad you could come on. I won't keep you because I'm sure you have other things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We have, at least we have one guy on the Twitter thing that is super successful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nice try guys.  So what do you think of the Netscape? It really is a clone. I mean,  they really copied you as closely as they could, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they just did a little too early. They should have waited until after we had them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tell me about this. I don't know anything about it.  Oh, you didn't see it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  It's www.netscape.com. What is it? Beta.netscape.com. It's a new portal page and basically they're doing  dig. Well, it's a little different because they do have editorial control of the top part. So they  have editors. If you go to www.beta.netscape.com, they have editors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what do they call the digs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Votes.  I'm sorry, what?  Votes. It's right in the same spot. They've got a button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it a box? Is it square?  Yeah.  Oh, please. Couldn't they make it round? God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a little different because to vote for it, you just check the checkbox. Let me ask you this,  Kevin. Did you look at it and say, oh, I could steal that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no. There's nothing I want from Netscape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is there any look and feel thing you can do here to maybe get a little law firm involved?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, we have stuff that we've filed as far as, not that have to do with the look and feel,  but as far as our promotion algorithms that we've filed for patents on.  Patents? Great.  That's something that we'll be looking to in the future. But right now, it's just like,  Netscape has been going downhill for the longest time and they're just trying to find a way to  revive it. It's one of those things where it's majority of traffic are people that don't know  how to change their homepage and have Netscape 4.0.  So-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's what they talk about. We've got whatever it was, 8 million registered users,  whatever the huge number was of registered users.  Right.  But you're right. I mean, they're not, they're people who haven't figured out how to change  their homepage.  That's who they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know. Netscape, I thought that was the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it was, I thought it was great that for at least the first week,  Kevin Rose was the number one story. That picture of Kevin in the-  That was awesome.  I thought that was really great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is cool though, the fact that AOL is validating the space.  It validates it.  They believe in social news.  So yeah, if you're good enough to steal from, that means you're doing pretty darn well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, congratulations, Kevin. I can't wait until Monday, tomorrow morning.  Yeah, good luck. Hopefully it did.  Cross your fingers.  So when it's done, what time do you think it'll be done?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It should be done by around 6 AM Pacific.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So by nine o'clock, by the time people start showing up for work on Monday in New York City,  Dig will be up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The keg will be cracked at the dig offices.  Are you going to be up all night tonight?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I got to get to bed early so I can get up early. But if it's not up by seven or eight,  you know that we're having some issues, but we'll work through them no matter what they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll be crossing our fingers and thinking about you.  And yeah, it is, as John said, it's nice to know at least one of us is doing okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Congratulations.  I can see Robert and I look at each other across the bay going, huh, how come, you know,  you guys own, no, no, fucking Kevin's smart and he went after it.  He deserves it.  He's got vision.  I'm not complaining.  No, I'm just laughing because you guys don't consider yourself  successes and you guys own homes in the bay area and have careers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I live with three other roommates in a nasty apartment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, okay. Well, your time will come.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you know, Kevin, if you know, if you hired a maid, the apartment would be a lot safer.  That's true.  That's true.  Especially the bathroom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know how bad it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, Kevin. Hey, good luck. Congratulations.  And we look forward to seeing it tomorrow morning.  Thanks guys. Appreciate it.  Right early 6 a.m. You'll be done. I know you will.  That's a scary thing to do, though.  Those things never work out.  Now that Kevin's gone, we can say that'll never work out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It'll be 10. If they get it done in an hour, it'd be a miracle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm encouraged they've been rehearsing all week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's got some really together guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He sounds like he does. He's got really good people.  That's exciting. That's neat.  Actually, the truth is we're all doing pretty well.  I mean, Patrick, it's obvious we just had, you know, I mean, we've talked about the LTV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We all pale by comparison to Kevin Rose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, he's the, you know, did you see that he, I forgot to ask him about this.  Who was it? Was it Business 2.0? Somebody picked him as the one of the top 50 movers  and shakers of 2006. Who was that that picked him?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they were hoping to improve their dick rankings.  Yeah, that's the old media.  It was actually a really nice interview with Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I, that was great. Who was it? Was it Business 2.0?  Business 2.0.  Yeah. And he was up there. I mean, they paired him with who?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was another 50 people who matter Business 2.0, the new, new media, the new, new media.  I mean, he was up there with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's when he gets his picture on the cover of Time magazine. I mean, that's what made it.  This Business 2.0 is a joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We should also point out that the number one in the 50 who matter now Business 2.0 list was you  followed by Sergey, Brandon, Larry, Paige.  Not me. You, you, all of you.  Why oh you everybody.  The consumer is creator.  Yeah.  Rupert Murdoch, Steve Jobs, Susan.  You know what's more interesting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Same old, same old.  The 10 people who didn't make the list like Linus Torvalds and people like that.  I thought that was very interesting. That was to me more interesting.  But these lists are bogus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, you know, we used to do these lists in all these magazines I've worked for.  And I know how they work and Patrick knows and anyone who's worked in a publication knows.  You get about six guys sitting around usually during lunch.  You got the old list from last year. You sit around. What do you think we should do?  We should move this guy to number three.  Yeah, that'll make number six really mad. That'll be really funny.  And then you just do that until you get the list together.  Pass it around a little bit.  And he says, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then they print it. Come on. It's a bunch of BS.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Couple more stories we should get to before we wrap these things up.  Apple, did you see this? The price of Shake?  Apple drops it from 2,500 bucks to 500 bucks.  That's pretty remarkable.  In fact, good news for anybody that does compositing.  That's a very expensive program, very good program.  I can see that none of you care at least.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The problem is we're all looking around thinking what we need is Alex to tell us why this is going  to shake.  Yeah, Alex.  We'll listen to this week in the media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where's Alex?  No, he's shown us Shake many times on Call for Help.  It's really cool.  And for 500 bucks, you're going to see kids doing some amazing stuff.  All right. Another story. Netflix thinking about moving into the download business.  They want to introduce a proprietary set top box with an internet connection.  This is the same thing Disney was doing, isn't it?  Sounds like a Kimbo to me.  It sounds like a Kimbo.  Same idea. That's Will Hurst's company where you put a box on the TV set and it, I don't know,  uses a free band.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're actually moving away. They've given away the Kimbo boxes to RCA and they're pushing  an add-on for the Windows media.  Ah, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's the way to go.  I don't think these are the stand-alone boxes for just downloading stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, who's going to want to buy another set top box?  It's idiotic. Everyone has a computer.  Disney's been doing it for a while. They say that...  Did they ever get out of trials with it?  They did. I mean, I understand they've introduced it in some other markets in LA now.  So it must be doing okay.  The movie beam stuff?  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it sounds like it's exactly the same.  It sounds pretty funny. Well, I mean, the...  Is movie beam Disney only?  Movie beam is like the cousin to the blanking interval.  Right. They use VBI.  I don't think they actually use VBI, do they?  Well, something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Something like that.  They used to use the PBS stations. They use their extra bandwidth on their side bands  or something to do this stuff.  See, that's like close to 20 megabit or over 20 megabit  that they're able to deliver through digital broadcast hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.  Movie beam does not use VBI. It uses a proprietary RF technology from .cast.com.  RF?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, then they are. Then they're probably using the PBS stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Brother.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, it's straight from HDB.com.  This guy's right.  That's got to be true.  Except when they talk trash about Robert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Any other interesting stories or are we just going to go back to Windows Live and watch the traffic?  We've come full circle.  I've done the traffic.  Thanks, guys, for being here.  Dvorak.org slash blog where John is going to rush off and do his story on, what is it, XGL?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I know it's already been on. I know I did that like months ago.  I had one of the first.  Months ago.  Months ago, literally.  I had one of the early demos of it and I blogged it with the movie that they are linked to their movie.  Yeah, they have that cube movie and stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you could also see it with Robert and Roger and Patrick on dl.tv.  That's where they live these days.  I didn't realize, you know, I just realized now the three of you are working together now.  Yeah.  Because you hired Roger.  Yeah.  So now this has become the DLTV podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not quite.  I didn't realize that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you guys still got a cranky geek here.  So there's one cranky geek.  It's all the ZDTV guys.  Annalisa's in there somewhere.  Yeah, Annalisa's.  Yeah, I love that that you hired Annalisa.  That's great.  She's the old producer for GameSpot, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The devil you know is better than the devil you don't.  That's why I hired Roger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He is a devil, isn't he?  Thank you guys and we'll see you next time.  Another twit is in the can.  My friends, my twits, are you ready?
