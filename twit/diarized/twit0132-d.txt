Transcript:  radio at a o l dot com slash podcasting.  This is twit.  This week in tech episode 132 for February 18th, 2008, the flexitarian.  This week in tech is brought to you by audible.com for your free audio book.  Visit audible.com slash twit and by listeners like you.  Thanks for your donations.  Ladies and gentlemen, the Chopin piano sonata number two in B major.  This is in honor of DVD HD DVD, which kicked the bucket this week, dead as a  doornail.  It was just, it was kind of like a dominoes starts with Warner Brothers  pulling the plug.  Then Walmart pulls the plug.  Then Netflix pulls the plug.  I love this music.  They can't hear it.  Then Best Buy pulls the plug and then the final death blow Toshiba itself kills  HD DVD.  Is it over?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's over now.  No, no, no.  Now that now the analysis begins, I have a column running at tomorrow's PC  magazine where I assert that there was never sincere to begin with.  It was just all a scheme by Microsoft to screw over Sony any way it could to get  market share for the Xbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And, and some have posited because if there were a conflict between the two HD  formats that downloads HD downloads would, would prove preeminent.  And that's of course Microsoft, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the days of Microsoft being able to orchestrate that level of conspiracy  are along behind us.  People give Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not a conspiracy.  It's a, it's a marketing error.  I mean, it's like, you know, it's like saying they can't advertise.  It was just a marketing ploy.  I don't think it was much of a conspiracy because there was no real  conspirators.  Who was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was Microsoft and Toshiba.  Were those the two big players?  About it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pretty much.  I honestly, I really, I think Microsoft is sad to say that kind of inept lately.  I mean, their last big marketing attempt was, was Vista capable.  So why HD DVD?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why did, why did all these people pull the plug on HD DVD?  Was there something wrong with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, it's money.  It's a matter of money.  I mean, if Sony's willing to drop millions and millions of dollars on, on  movie studios and, and Toshiba is only willing to drop a half million dollars or  whatever the case may be, or just a tad less than Sony, why would, if I'm Warner  Brothers, why would I want to go with, with a guy who's paying me less?  Simple.  I mean, it's pretty simple.  It's simple economics as far as I'm concerned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think, yeah, not, not the free market kind either.  The backroom deal kind.  Well, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I think maybe the PS3 had something to do with this.  That, that, that nobody had sold as many players as Sony did with  its Blu-ray PS3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's, I don't, I don't think that at all.  I mean, I think the PS3 has been so far.  Yeah, but so far it's an unbridled failure.  I mean, there's no games for it.  People have been saying that it's kind of a joke.  Sony was the head of the video game industry for a long time.  Now all of a sudden it's the loser.  But wait a minute, it's an unbridled failure as a gaming platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nevertheless, they're sold far more Blu-ray players as PS3s than HD  DVD sold at any form factor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  But there was a big study that said that some, maybe upwards of 60% of PS3  owners did not even know that they had a Blu-ray player.  Exactly.  Not the Blu-ray player is pretty bad on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, it's just, people don't use that for that.  I actually had an opportunity.  I was talking, he was off the air when I was talking to him.  I had talked to a Sony gaming exec the other day and he sort of echoed that.  I mean, they're trying like, you know, they're trying as hard as they can to get  the Blu-ray into the home through the PS3, but it's really not working.  And people want a gaming platform and they don't really care about anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, PS3 sucks as a gaming platform, but that's going to change this year  when some games finally come out.  I think, I disagree with you.  It's a very good Blu-ray player.  And it's one of the few that's, yeah, it's one of the few that's upgradable  because it's got a hard drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't really like it.  I mean, I actually, I'm using the Panasonic right now.  Well, I just, I don't like the functionality of it.  I like my Panasonic slightly better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a little weird having to use a game, a game place, you know,  joystick to change movies and to fast forward and stuff.  That is a little weird.  I suppose I could buy a third party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  I mean, you can get a...  There's probably a hack for it, right?  There's a hack to do it with the Xbox.  I'm sure there's a, I'm sure there's a remote control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sure somebody makes a remote control, but it's just weird  because I'm using the game controller.  It's kind of strange.  Yes.  All right.  Anyway, let me introduce all these crabby people.  John just threw away his notes.  He's going off notes, ladies and gentlemen.  You're not going to do the stump speech, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's funny that you monitor these little levels so much  that you can tell who's doing what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know, they're pretty loud.  Throw away the notes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  John C. Dvorak.  He's got to be looking at the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am. I know who's talking.  ...meters. I know.  I'm paying attention.  Hey, you know, this moderation thing is hard work.  People dismiss it.  John C. Dvorak.org slash blog, ladies and gentlemen.  It's the place to go for salacious sex tidbits  with occasional technology thrown in.  He also is the host of a number of podcasts, Cranky Geeks,  which I'm going to be on on Wednesday.  In fact, are we going to have Adam Curry?  Are you working on that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that'd be funny.  It'd be a collectible to have you and Adam Curry in the same cranky geeks.  Yeah, Adam Curry. Excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I'll grow my hair out just for that.  Maybe I'll wear a mullet.  Now you're talking.  He's also does a daily tech news thing called Tech Fives,  which is in direct competition to Buzz Out Loud.  Molly Wood is here.  How do you feel about that, Molly?  Look out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not.  They chat up the news.  I just run through it.  It's a big difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like the chat.  There is no competition to Buzz Out Loud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Listen to John to find out what the news is.  Listen to Molly and Tom to find out, to chat it up, I guess.  I don't know.  Molly, by the way, is a very good writer.  I don't know.  When you read the Twitter novel that we're doing, 140 Novel,  you can tell where Molly's stuff is because it's the only stuff that's well written.  Oh, stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's going to.  I don't know. You've introduced this Barbara

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  plotline that I'm very excited about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have no idea, but you made it happen.  You made Barbara.  Now we have a female lead.  Yeah, I knew we had to get a female in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you should have get me involved in this thing, because every time I would  I would throw in it, it would go like this.  And then I woke up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's exactly why you're not playing our game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You made the argument very well for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Molly, what is the host of Buzz out loud?  BOL dot CNET dot com.  You also see her on CNET TV dot com.  Speaking of CNET, Don Risinger is also here.  And he's got a real URL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How I do it's about time.  Digital, digital home dot CNET dot com.  Woohoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Digital home dot CNET dot com.  I'm going to talk a little bit about digital in a bit,  because, you know, one year from today,  there's two digital stories, one year from today.  Digital TV analogs phased out.  And this week, analog cell phones are phased out.  So those of you still using analog cell phones, John, I believe you are.  I have one.  You're going to have to stop using it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know they keep calling me about it.  Now, the thing is that bothers me is that analog,  even though this is like just one of those burners that happens  to go through an analog system.  I remember back in the day when they switched over from analog to digital,  they used digital as a big promotional tool.  Did the quality just deteriorated like overnight?  And analog has always been better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People hated it when they went to digital  because analog would degrade gracefully.  Digital just drops off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, isn't there the worst thing about this, right, is if you use OnStar.  Oh, is it analog?  Yeah, I think it's going to affect older OnStar vehicles.  They won't work anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OnStar, OnStar, I'm hanging upside down on my seatbelt.  Water's coming in the car. OnStar.  No one's coming to help you, my friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sorry, I can't unlock the door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Your analog.  That's Jason Calacanis, the man behind Mahalo,  M-A-H-A-L-O dot com, the human powered search engine,  and also the guy who pays Veronica to do those great daily video podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Also known as the Yoko Ono of Buzz Out Loud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait a minute, you're the Yoko Ono?  You broke up the band?  Yeah, Calacanis is Yoko.  Did John, I mean, did Jason come in and sit during the recording sessions  and just kind of give Tom the stink eye?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, but he's got that same screechy voice if you actually listen to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jason?  I actually was on, I think, one of the first episodes of Buzz Out Loud  when Veronica went on air, because she used to be,  I guess people don't know this, she was the engineer.  Right. Correct, Molly?  She was the Jason Howell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The audio engineer, the audio producer.  And what happened the time I was on the show?  Nothing.  Veronica has found her true calling as  as audio and video talent,  because that one time and that one time only that Jason was on the show,  we lost the entire episode and had to re-record it.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was heartbreaking.  So then I started like in the middle of the show going,  you know, I think you need a new engineer.  This is Veronica.  I don't know who this is, but I don't have a lot of time.  I'm a very important person.  You can't waste my time.  So what I was like, obviously putting on an act.  And so she got on the air.  And I don't know, we got to find the URL for that.  But it's pretty funny. She was like, shut up, Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that still around? Is that what it was?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know what episode it is, but I'm sure it's still around.  And it should be under audio is, I think, the best way to find the archives.  But wait a minute. That's sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's true. That's sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you can find them all now at BLL.  That's a lot easier than it used to be, but it's harder to search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is audio even doing any? I mean, they sold it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All audio is to me is a little search engine for back episodes.  But it's a little search engine that could for back episodes of Buzz Out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm trying to find.  That that old episode, if I find it, I'll play it.  Well, introduce. We like to say that our computers just.  I just don't digital home that CNET dot com.  All right. I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We eventually I'm not paying any attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pay attention to black dot com slash black blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm actually on a website right now.  I'm actually looking at the mullets as we speak.  I was going to is there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have you been to that?  What is that site? Mullets galore. Have you been to mullets galore?  Now I'm going to seem like a mullet expert on top of this, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everybody go to mullets galore.  And join that, it says, join the mullet.  The mullet. It's outstanding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They have a picture of you on their Mali.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They can take photos of mullets in action.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's Donald Trump's mullet. That's attractive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like the guy at Tool World, appropriate appropriately enough.  You know, now, come on, looking at this, how can you even say  that's not Molly Wood?  Come on, come on, come on, Don Demarac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right, here we go.  Well, I'll have to reassess.  Thanks to the chat room.  It is audio audio three oh six three six nine.  The special visit from Jason Calacanis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm Molly Wood, author of Seen as Buzz Report.  It's the real deal.  Welcome to Buzz Out Loud, the podcast of Indeterminacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to you still sound exactly the same, by the way.  I have to jump ahead to where where is Jason given him a hard time?  Right in the middle, you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's somewhere in the middle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're going to have to keep.  I think right off the bat, he probably starts bitching about how he buying a piece of.  I'm Castor in discussion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'd like to be able to get this as well.  Hey, you know, he was on the phone.  I didn't want to hear it. You're on the phone.  Get some production in there.  Make him come into the studio.  Oh, wait a minute. You guys are all on Skype.  Never mind.  So let's see.  The HD DVD is dead.  Analog is dead in the cell phone industry.  And in one year, we're all going to have to get digital TVs.  Do you think Americans even understand what that means?  I think even the cable companies now are thinking they're putting out ads saying,  that's not us.  Don't worry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, on the one hand, they're putting out ads saying that's not us.  But on the other hand, they're going door to door telling people that they're  going to have to subscribe to digital cable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good point. That's the way around it, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mm hmm. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to get our most expensive digital cable package.  Otherwise, your TV isn't going to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, my God. They're not really doing that, are they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We have a little we've gotten reports of Comcast doing that.  It's like people have written into Buzz out loud and said  that a Comcast agent came to my door and told me this gave me this song and dance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Has anyone got something in writing that they can document this with?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we got an email.  Does that count?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Send us a send us.  Well, see, that's probably probably smart enough not to print this stuff up, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, this is how they do it.  I mean, I remember I bought  Verizon insurance from a sure and they were like,  oh, we'll replace your phone under any circumstances.  So then my phone breaks and they're like, oh, yeah, well, we don't handle software  or or BIOS problems and the person who was in the store  absolutely lied to me about what the phone insurance was.  And, you know, I didn't read the eight page, you know, terms of service.  But I think that's how they do it.  They get like low level salespeople.  They give them spiffs.  So you give them like 50 bucks for selling it.  They do it by any means necessary.  They're college kids or whatever.  There's no ramification for them.  They lose the job. You're doing them a favor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then you got plausible deniability up at the top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, yeah.  It was just like, oh, this rogue kid, you know, rogue trader, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's actually what Blackberry, what Rim is doing.  They're blaming the techies for the outage.  This is their second outage in a year.  Earlier this week, Blackberry is down all over North America.  What is it?  What do they have? 11 million subscribers completely blacked out.  And they're saying, oh, we just we was the geeks did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's always good.  Throw your throw your tech team under the bus.  The geeks did it. Yeah, because they don't have any recourse, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're powerless.  Oh, yeah.  I have any good ideas about  they're going to be like mess things up.  I wonder what happens when the I'm sorry, when the PR,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the PR guys credit rating goes to like something ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, or they're like going to be leaking emails from the CEO or like  looking at the CEOs, like log files on their browser  and sending them anonymously to somebody.  I mean, I love all the salaries will be revealed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love the full page ads that Palm has been buying in the Wall Street Journal  and other newspapers saying they didn't mention Blackberry, but saying  our network is pretty reliable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, except the phone.  Except all the phones, except for the central is pretty bad.  So yeah, I pretty much have to laugh at Palm at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do they have a network going bad to worse?  What is their net? I don't understand.  Do they do Blackberry style stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know. I have a trio.  I never I've never heard of it.  That's why it doesn't go down.  Yeah, nobody uses it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They support Good Link on that.  So they use the good network to enter to interface with exchange.  You use that's what you use.  And that's what I use.  And then they have then they have Windows mobile running on Palm devices, too.  So then they do exchange that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you running a Palm device?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I have a trio of seven fifty five P.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And how have you liked the good link?  Has it been up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The good link is a big fat joke.  Well, the big actually good link is OK.  The problem is, it's basically a hack like it's not native exchange.  I mean, you're going to you know, you may have a hellish experience  running Windows mobile because it's terrible mobile operating system.  But at least exchange is native. Right.  Whereas good link is a weird hack that if you've got  I have terrible service at my house from Sprint because I'm in Hills.  Oh, no. And so the good link is just a nightmare.  Like it has to be off.  It has to be connected online to be composing an email.  So if my service goes out, which it constantly does,  and my phone has to reconnect to power vision, blah, blah, blah.  And the whole thing locks up.  And just, you know, I'm mid email and this happens like three times  in the course of a paragraph long email.  And then I just lose my mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, wait, because there'll be a full page ad in the journal on Monday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Molly Wood of CNET says there is no better email service than BlackBerry.  And if it goes out once in a while, actually,  it's probably good for the people who have them because they learn  that they can survive without their BlackBerry for 60 minutes.  I mean, or that they're completely dependent on it.  There's more divorces than anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, my kids hate it when I pull out my BlackBerry.  They say, no, daddy, no, please don't leave us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I honestly I think that these glitches are not like a service  occasionally going down as to be expected.  The problem is that BlackBerry biffs it so spectacularly every time it happens.  They blame the first. They don't say anything for days on end.  And then they blame the geeks in this like really arcane language  that everybody's like, just just tell me that you broke it and give me a little credit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Done. Just put a picture of a kitten with a screwdriver  and you're done. And I am in the Twitter style.  Breaking your very long.  You know, that is so cute. I forgive you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everybody is very familiar with the Twitter is down pictures.  They just love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I hate that little bird upside down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The worst service I ever used, but I can't get off it.  It's disgusting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, it was another tremendous failure at keeping their servers up. eBay.  If you can't hear, yeah, remember in the early days of eBay,  they like they almost lost, they almost screwed up their IPO and everything.  They were down for like two days and their fans were so rabid  that they were, you know, a causing the outage, which is what happens with Twitter.  And then B, they loved it so much, they were like, oh, we forgive you.  It actually is a good marketing technique.  Well, you speak of eBay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Good, good. I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're going to talk about the eBay boycott starts Monday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I just I was going to say something about different about eBay,  just the fact that it's become such a joke lately.  I mean, they can't run a business anymore.  The site's got awful ugly.  It's just I don't understand what's going on.  Everything there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't you go there first when you want to find something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I don't know.  I mean, my eyes right.  Yeah, I mean, I go to Amazon.  Amazon is always one of my first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But if I want if I wanted a copy of Windows 98 SE, the first place that goes eBay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but you know, I mean, let me I mean, how long will it be  until eBay finally realizes that it's not, you know,  it's so invincible the way it used to be?  It's not what Web 2.0.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is an I just want to point out here, there was an example of Leo  throwing Don a softball.  That Don didn't pay attention to Don.  You got to bring your game up.  I didn't hear he said, what was the softball?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, John picks up these things right away.  But, you know, John, you've been working with me for 15 years.  You know, John's a seasoned veteran.  He's a seasoned veteran.  You're the you're the Callow rookie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm the new guy.  I'm the new guy in the ball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's not Callow.  I haven't. Callow. It's me.  Oh, you're Callow.  He's he's well, what is the word they use with rookies?  I'm green, unseasoned green.  Yeah, unseasoned.  He's unseasoned.  And eBay announced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don Risinger is a raw steak.  eBay announced.  Print that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Copy.  eBay announced a certain fee increases January 12th.  The big sellers are saying there's going to be a week long boycott  beginning Monday, February 18th.  A lot of sellers are angry.  There are pages around this.  Power sellers unite dot com and no listing day dot com.  You think this is just a tempest in a teapot or are these guys  really going to do some do some damage?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think the companies do enough damage to itself.  I mean, this company, it's laughable to watch it try to run itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, Meg Whitman says she wants to leave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can see it.  Yeah, I don't think anybody really cares.  I thought she already announced that she was leaving.  Yeah, she knows.  Well, that's what I said.  What did I say?  He made it sound like she was actively thinking about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, no, she's she's leaving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  Yeah, I thought it was the new boss that announced all these new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right. All right.  Meg Whitman's leaving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's still a pretty incredible business.  I mean, they did over seven billion dollars last year and they have a huge,  huge margin and they have 95 percent of auctions.  I think the problem is they're so successful in what they do.  They can't find a second act.  And they were hoping Skype would be that second act.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that was it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They basically make 99 percent of their money from PayPal and eBay.  And eBay as an auction site is so dominant.  There's no growth left.  So all they can do is raise the fees.  And this is what happens when you raise fees.  It's not going to impact their business in any way, except  all those users will come back.  It's just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I think you make a good point.  What you just said was was something that's interesting because you say  eBay was a great auction site.  But in a lot of ways, eBay has stopped being an auction site.  I mean, you have pay it there, buy it now everywhere you look.  And they have Skype and everything else.  I mean, where's the if this is an auction site, it should be an auction site.  As simple as that.  It's really lost its way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who's the next? I mean, is auction.  I don't agree with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I totally agree with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's bull. You look up anything on there is always buy it now, buy it now, buy it now.  Let me just add one more thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Existence of the button  fundamentally corrupts the entire ethos of the site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's when you go to a page and everything on that entire page  because something you look at it now, these are all retailers.  This is not an auction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Don't people still bid?  Yeah, I buy it now.  Is it mandatory just because the buttons there?  My kid buys a ton of stuff. Let's face it, it's a scam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How many times you've gone to Christie's when they say, oh, yeah, buy it now.  You can buy it right now before you know.  That doesn't happen. We could have an option now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But if you'd like to buy this fine painting.  Well, they just say, no, the added feature to a broader audience, though,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  like I don't I am not interested in auctioning.  I almost never go to eBay because I don't like to buy old stuff.  But what?  But if I do go, then I just want it to be over with because I am a retail shopper.  So for me, buy it now is like something that would bring me to eBay  when I might otherwise never go without.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's your audience.  You can't complain about them not having growth, you know,  and then be against the buy it now.  They added buy it now so they could, you know, sort of encroach  upon the bottom 10, 20 percent of Amazon's business.  But it's not working and there's less listings now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So like what's going on? I mean, it's not working.  There's less anything.  Yeah, I mean, that's it was not the whole part part of it that they're dropping  the rates because they said that we have fewer listings.  We need to jumpstart listings. That was my understanding.  So that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, let me mention something here, which is the second act.  You know, they had in the late 90s and before the collapse,  they were thinking about some stuff that was I thought was pretty aggressive.  They had bought Butterfield and Butterfield in San Francisco,  which is a big auction house.  And I thought they were going to go legit.  And they could have with their momentum, maybe taken over all the business,  which is Sotheby's and and Christie's and Butterfield and a bunch of other ones.  But they just got into the real business of auction.  It's sad. I know we didn't care much for this.  So they dumped it.  And it was just like, you know, and then they just kind of been backsliding  ever since. I think they've lost their aggression.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is the message here that it's really easy to jump the shark in the tech industry?  I mean, I think of a lot of companies that on paper like eBay are prospering.  Microsoft might be another example and about to just fall off the edge of the earth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the message is that in the blogosphere, you have not one  between the blogosphere and your friggin aggressive shareholders.  You don't have an inch of wiggle room.  There is no margin of error.  Like they that you know what their reduction in active listings was.  Two percent in the first quarter of 2007.  That is probably a large number of listings, but it's also one quarter's results.  And it's two percent like it.  And here's Don declared him dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good for you, Don.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The issue is the issue is the issue we're having is you.  When you go from a high growth business to a mature business,  the people who invest in your company change.  And that's what they're feeling right now is that pain.  And that's the same pain Yahoo went through.  And at some point, it's the pain Google will go through.  And that's why they're changing management as well as because you're saying  there's no fire in the belly.  Really, the big thing that eBay could do is classifieds, which they're going after.  They have a site that's been growing and they also in 25 percent of Craigslist  and search and they will launch a search engine.  I guarantee it. They are one of the largest advertisers on Google.  And they've had many debates and back and forth with Google about including  their auctions in the organic results.  They bought StumbleUpon.  StumbleUpon is a search engine in disguise.  If another year or two, StumbleUpon might have a very powerful social search engine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a StumbleUpon surprises me.  They are a lot of members.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They have a 3 million.  That's a lot. I mean, that's a base.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would say probably it's like Mahalo in some ways, because they've got these humans

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  looking for sites. It's a very, very the same way.  Delicious and StumbleUpon.  But they both are do a really good job of discovery.  They're not really good at search, you know, for the top 10 results that you're looking for.  What they're really good for is serendipity.  Serendipity. So you type an iPod, but you want like, will it blend iPod or, you know,  I don't know, funny iPod stuff or interesting iPod stuff, how to hack your iPod.  They excel at that.  So I think that's why they bought it.  I think it's their like little,  you know, tactical nuke where they can say like, hey, you know, Google,  if you take us out of organic listings, we're going to make StumbleUpon a search engine.  Was Skype eBay's broadcast dot com?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that a complete waste?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, they're going to sell it to Google and they're going to make money on the transaction.  You heard it first.  Wow. I got some I got some inside knowledge on it.  You know, for 2 billion, they're going to make money on it.  It's going to be worth more. It's probably three or four billion.  Really? I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. I think there's a good bet here.  There's a good bet here. I think they're going to sell to Google at a loss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they're going to I think they'll make money on it, actually.  It's a very it's a very powerful thing.  If you think about it for Google has huge, no, no footprint in instant messaging.  No conceivable way to compete with AOL or the combined Microsoft Yahoo juggernaut  and I am or just a Yahoo juggernaut and I am.  And it's not an open standard and they could really do some damage with that.  And it also is good for a global presence.  And Google is, you know, the most global of companies.  It's good for Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Aside from that, though, I mean, how is it monetized?  I mean, how do you think they would it would be monetized?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Please do not bring monetization into this discussion.  I mean, that's the most ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're talking about business here.  The idea of making money is completely tertiary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  These are some very valuable eyeballs, young man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I think you can see.  I think there's a much better synergy between Skype and Google  than there ever was with Skype and eBay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a large percentage of Skype users pay money to do outbound calls.  And that's a business right there.  And Google could certainly make money off of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think the monetization is a problem, though.  I think Don brings up a good point because Skype, not enough of its users  pay money to make outbound calls that if they were not owned by if they were not  owned by eBay, I think they would be in trouble right now.  I think Skype is the voice.  And what's Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think Skype is the voice winner.  I think Skype is beating Vonage.  It's beating call vantage AT&T.  It's beating everybody.  It is the if you're going to have voice, you're going to end up using Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's true. But I think they have a huge blanket of eBay protection

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and they haven't made the mistake of trying to give out hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, but they do. There is hardware.  Actually, they do give out hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's true. They give out some little things you choose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You get to choose. And that's the point.  Skype, you can operate computer to computer, or if you want to make it  a complete voice standard.  And by the way, they're they're very smart because they completely avoided  the 911 issue. They just say, hey, don't use this for emergency calls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So let's get back to this insider information that Jason just blew out  of the water here with his with his knowledge that they're going to,  for sure, since he knows, sell the product to Google.  Where did you get that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know people who are involved in the transaction business and it's been  people who know people and it's been hot water.  Not of the shower.  Discussed on and off to talk about it.  I'm not supposed to talk about it.  They don't talk about it.  Listen, you know, it's basically been it's been in discussions for like over a year.  eBay has not been able to make it work.  They've been criticized for it.  And that's why with it, when they change the management,  then they'll probably figure out what to do with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Steve Chen told me that when Google was about to buy YouTube,  that he and Eric Schmidt met at the IHOP down the road from Google.  So folks.  Go look for who are the Skype guys.  Go look for those. Go look for some weird.  Oh, they're not involved anymore.  Yeah, those guys are long gone.  But go look for Meg Whitman and Eric Schmidt having a pancake.  As it were, as it were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a lot. I mean, actually, I think you can make sure.  I'm cake with who?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Even even if it doesn't, even if it doesn't, if you didn't have that rumor,  the minute you said that, Jason, it clicks, it makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's it's it's it's a negotiation right now.  And there's there's like three or four moving parts.  You have the changing management.  You know, so the new person comes on board,  it's got to believe in, you know, doing the transaction versus keeping it.  People have to save face, you know, like Meg Whitman's legacy.  So and then there's also this very this very tenuous relationship  between eBay and Google about the organic listings  and about how much money eBay spends.  Like eBay was going to stop spending money on Google AdSense  because they didn't get the listings they want.  But if they let them have the listings, then like you would see eBay  more often than Wikipedia in Google results.  And so they've basically there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's an interesting kind of currency, isn't there?  Is a there's a whole forget cash.  We'll give you listings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you want to get into the dark stuff, you know, in the back rooms,  there is some backroom stuff going on about, you know, how eBay  is represented in Google results.  And you only have to look at the comparison shopping engines,  which got kicked out of the search engine results recently.  You know, in the last year on their whole businesses,  they got turned upside down by it.  So Google's got a lot of power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe Yahoo will buy them.  No, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, the other opportunity for them would be something like,  you know, MySpace has done pretty well with their instant messaging.  It's you know, if you look at people's communication  within the web browser on MySpace or even on Facebook,  it feels more like instant messages.  Yes. So my kids use them.  I wouldn't be surprised if, you know, a Facebook even,  you know, gave them equity or something like that.  And some sort of Facebook, you know, it would be very hard to do  because Facebook doesn't have the cash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But oh, but wouldn't it be great to embed VoIP into one of these

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  social network services or just instant messaging?  I mean, that's when I was at AOL.  I mean, the biggest paranoia amongst people there was like, oh, my God,  Facebook and young people are not opening AIM accounts,  opening MySpace pages.  They don't feel the need for instant messaging.  They just refresh their page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly how my kids use it.  Now, interestingly, when you try to do that on Facebook, it knocks you off.  It says you're trying to use this to I am you can't.  But that's probably because they didn't have the resources.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So are you wait a second.  Are you trying to say that Google would buy Skype to use it,  Premier or Facebook would take a second just to use it as I am?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's yeah, it would be a great I mean, it's a lot of people use it for just I am now.  And so it would be like that because if you look at AIM,  AOL instant messenger now supports VoIP and that's sort of.  Well, so does Google really Gtalk?  Yeah, all these things are merging.  So if the difference between instant message and VoIP is negligible now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it but it actually it's a good play on all those levels,  because I think it is a good VoIP play.  I really think Skype is the VoIP player now.  And it makes sense. You you agree to me when I said and Molly,  that Android could use something like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it makes sense for them in terms of Android.  But I don't I guess I still don't see them buying it.  I certainly see it as a as a partnership on some level.  And I think it would make sense to have a recognizable VoIP client built into Android.  But I think they can probably accomplish that without buying it.  I guess I just don't see Google wanting to operate that kind of service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They already have it. I mean, Google talk.  Yeah, but nobody. Yeah, but they're not putting a lot of.  No, but you just said that you don't see them wanting to.  And they do want to because obviously, if they didn't want to,  they wouldn't have Google talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they would have launched it.  They built it and they doodled it out there.  And then they haven't put any firepower behind it whatsoever.  It's obviously not one of their like top priority projects.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's that's just a Google culture.  Then you're talking about their model.  That's what you're what you're.  Yeah, yes, because I think they are not committed.  Well, well, no, that's just their.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Goal is not committed to to fully maintaining a service like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, they are. They're they're they have an organic philosophy of product  development, which is it'll break when it breaks, you know, it'll it'll boom  when it booms and they don't try to force any issues.  They have like their monopoly slash, you know, almost a monopoly duopoly  with search ads and search and they'll wait.  They're patient. Wait for Gmail.  Wait for G-talk to rise.  They're not going to shove it down people's throat.  It's not their corporate culture.  That's like a Microsoft AOL Yahoo kind of thinking like we have to get market share.  Google doesn't work, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Speaking of Yahoo, it's been fun.  You mentioned this on Buzz Out Loud, Molly, to watch the Yahoo executives  leave one by one on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and the layoffs mostly.  That's the saddest. Oh, yeah, the layoffs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, executives are leaving, too.  Everybody's leaving. Yeah.  Oh, wouldn't you?  Yeah. The last vice president of Yahoo, please turn out the lights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's my question about it, though.  If you're Jerry Yang and you care so much about the company and the people,  would you do you?  Does he think that those thousand people wouldn't have kept their jobs  in a Microsoft deal? I think they would have.  Microsoft wants more staff.  They want more people. Really?  That not they don't have that knowledge base.  I mean, what half of what Microsoft wants to buy is the brains in search  and the brain. All this overlap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't you think a lot of people would more people would have lost their jobs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In accounting and sales and some other areas, but they don't have any search.  You know, the search group in, you know,  Microsoft is small compared to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the geeks would have kept their jobs.  I think so. But there's still going to be more than a thousand layoffs  in office personnel alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have a different story.  And I'm not going to say I'm right or wrong or Jason's not correct in this,  but I did get a memo from somebody who claims to be working at Microsoft.  And they tell me that they actually have a huge search department  that they set up some couple of years ago with a slew of PhDs  similar to the Google operation.  And they're in a skunk works.  And they've developed one thing after, of course, you know, these promises,  promises, promises with the Microsoft search engine, because, you know,  they bring they always say, oh, we're going to do this.  We're going to do that. They roll out a new version. It still sucks.  Oh, yeah, they got Miss Dewey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what Microsoft's putting all their money into, Miss Dewey.  You know, Miss Dewey, right?  Here comes Miss Dewey. No, I don't.  She's the search engine with attitude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm saying against somehow come.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go to MSDEWEY.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's another one of these lame brain ideas.  But anyway, the point is, is that's where all those people are going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can I help you find something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just don't see the fact that buying the I think buying people  from Yahoo is one thing, but buying  not Microsoft such a not invented here company.  I can't see them buying, you know, the expertise of any company.  I mean, they usually bring them in.  They suck them dry for about a year and then they fire them all.  The guys quit and disgust.  I mean, this has happened over and over again.  You can talk to anybody that came over from like any one of these companies,  like Hotmail, for example.  They were all out of there within no time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, can you imagine they'll keep both Yahoo Mail and the Hotmail people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think this is going to happen. I don't see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right. Now, now, now, now, it's time to take off the gloves  because Molly wanted to be on with Don because Don has a theory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's true. I'm here to pick a fight with Don.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know. Tom Marrow told me about it anyway.  So basically, Microsoft doesn't even want Yahoo.  So my thought and if you trace it back back to the Intuit deal back in 94, 95,  it looks awfully similar.  I mean, basically, Microsoft's getting getting killed by Yahoo,  just like they were getting killed by Intuit.  They don't really want to spend the money.  They don't really want to spend the money to go out and do the things they need to do.  So instead, they'll just go in and say to Yahoo, we'll buy you because it makes sense.  They can capitalize on it now  because right now Yahoo is not doing well at all.  And even the shareholders can't stand the executives and what they're doing in the company.  So they walk in, they say, here, we'll give you 45 billion,  you know, whatever the case may be.  And as soon as the Department of Justice gets involved,  because I don't think anyone can actually believe  the Department of Justice and EU is going to let this happen.  I don't even think Microsoft believes it's going to happen.  So the Department of Justice walks in, says, no,  Microsoft says, OK, you know, in all the while, they've been taking notes on what Yahoo's up to,  what they're going to do in the future.  And they walk away. And now they have a better product,  just like they do with Intuit, you know, when they had Microsoft money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So so Molly, Don says they just want to look under the kimono.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, here's where things start to break down first.  Do you really think that Microsoft is that afraid of Yahoo?  Like, I'm not. I mean, the Google analogy only works.  No, of Yahoo.  Oh, I see. The Intuit analogy works because Intuit was, in fact,  kicking Microsoft's tail up and down the court.  I don't think it can.  No, come on.  MSN is not.  In services, in services possibly.  But I don't think that there's like a technology mojo there that Microsoft can't emulate.  Yahoo may have better brand awareness,  but that is the exact reason that Microsoft would would want to buy them.  Like, there's not some like that.  I really don't believe that Microsoft is trying to acquire a bunch of Yahoo  engineers who have some super secret knowledge of how to build search algorithms  and online email programs that are so much more powerful than Microsoft.  There's another there's another big hole in your argument, Don,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  is that that kind of presumes that they're not going to that they are.  The regulators will stop them. And I don't know if that's a given.  And I don't even know if Microsoft can assume that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that is my second point of argument.  In a world where the regulators approve Google DoubleClick,  not approving Microsoft, Yahoo would be tantamount to basically supporting Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but see, I mean, I don't think regulators are the same way.  I think regulators feel fine with Google DoubleClick because they like Google.  Right. But they can't stand Microsoft.  They never have. The EU really hates Microsoft.  It's true that the EU hates Microsoft.  Yeah. But this isn't a strategy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Microsoft counting on the EU to stop them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I think I think what you're missing is that it goes far beyond email and search.  I think, like, for example, at CES, I was speaking with Yahoo and they're showing me all  their the future of mobile advertising, what they want to do.  And even their Yahoo Go 3.0 and all those other, you know, these other things,  they're really slick, they're really neat.  If you look at Microsoft, there's nothing there.  I mean, so I don't think necessarily it's Microsoft saying, you know, we we need search.  We need email. I think it's Microsoft saying we're getting our butts kicked all over the court  in advertising. Mobile advertising is going to be in a lot of ways going to be the future  of this business. And we have no presence there.  Yahoo is really kind of ahead of the curve in that way.  And if it doesn't go through, look what we have.  We have notes that have notes on our competition.  We have notes and technologies that can affect us going forward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And once again, even with the Intuit argument, you've still like at the at the time of the  Intuit fake acquisition, they were they were making a competitive product that was losing.  If your argument is that Microsoft wants to get into the mobile advertising space and  Yahoo's made all this headway and Microsoft has nothing, then why would they learn how to  build it and then take the time to build it in this world?  There's no time. They would just buy it.  Let's get Jason to Jason to adjudicate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do you think, Mr. Calacanis?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Microsoft really wants the product.  They really want Yahoo.  They really want the staff.  They want to have they want to transform Microsoft into an advertising based business and  they need a transformative purchase to do that.  They know they're not going to do it organically.  They've tried for over a decade.  Are they going to get it?  Yes, of course.  Yeah, they're going to go.  It's a negotiation on price right now.  They're going to get it and it will probably be done this week, I would say.  There's there's absolutely no chance of it not going down because the shareholders are  already one after another.  The large shareholders telling Bomber, OK, we're done, you know, and we'll take the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  money. And interesting point, though, somebody raised I think it was in the journal that  many of these institutional shareholders hold is enough as same amount of more Microsoft  than they do Yahoo. So while they get a bonus by selling to Microsoft on the Yahoo  side, they may cost them on the Microsoft side.  They may not be totally into this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People can I can I chime in?  Yeah, John. First of all, you know, Don, I kind of agree with Don because I've kind of  written the same thing and a piece in my column.  But but I'm sticking with the assertion that the EU is not going to let this thing happen  to begin with. And I'm also on Jerry Yang's side.  That stock was at thirty five dollars a share within, you know, within six months.  I mean, I mean, giving them from 20 because it sunk down to 20 and they give it they offer  them 30 bucks is nonsense.  They've offered them 40 in the past.  They're going to have to cough up at least 40 dollars a share or more to get that company.  And that's going to be a huge hit for Microsoft's bottom line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can they come up with that kind of a lot of business factors involved here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, Microsoft's a company that has never they don't carry debt and they never want  to. And this deal, they're probably going to have to carry debt even though they want to  go 50 50 stock cash.  So, you know, and I'm not I'm not one to believe that Microsoft is dumb enough to not do  the research and say, well, gee, really, honestly, what are the chances of this thing  going through? If you look at it from an objective point of view and you look at the current  tenor of of legislators and even the way these come these legislators feel about  Microsoft, I don't see you anyway.  Objectively, could say that this is absolutely going to happen.  I don't think there's any way to say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not even that it can they say that objectively is not going to happen.  And that's the thing. It's a gamble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you can. I think you can with the EU.  But let me just say something in defense of Calacanis here.  He is expressing the exact litany of everybody in Silicon Valley.  Microsoft has to do this deal.  They're screwed up. They need to own this company.  Blah, blah, blah. I've heard it a million times.  They all say exactly the same thing.  And it makes logical sense when you when you hear it from that perspective.  But the fact of the matter is, I think there is some naivete about about where  the EU stands on this because they've already just made a public comment.  You can listen to the woman who runs the competitive council.  She says, look, we're done with Microsoft for the moment.  We're going to go back after him over the browser deal.  And the fact that they still have the browser linked to the operating system.  And then we're going to go after him again after that.  The they're right in the target, the sites of the EU.  This deal is never going to happen with the EU involved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. And I don't I don't agree with that.  I think the EU.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, Jason, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The EU can't possibly be upset about Microsoft owning such a small percentage of search.  This deal makes them still way behind Google.  And in Europe, it's they're going to be further behind than in the United States.  So there is no real massive monopolistic entity that's created after you combine these two things.  This is a just you have to completely separate.  You have the first and third biggest websites in the world combining.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't care about the search part of it.  Look at the total numbers of web of website visitors between Yahoo and and Microsoft.  You can't take the number one, two and three websites and then you have to combine and say,  oh, there's no antitrust there. It's just a coincidence.  It's not. No, it's not going to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But even if you do that, if you look at the total representation of webpages on the Internet,  it's not going to happen.  You have to have anti-competitive, an anti-competitive revenue footprint,  and you have to have like clients involved in it.  And if you look at the revenue and you look at the clients, which is a lot of the tests in this,  it doesn't pass that test.  I know it might look from a superficial point of view like, oh, my God, it's the biggest in the world.  But even if you put those two together, it in terms of representation of overall Internet  traffic, it's still a small percentage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How much is it going to cost Microsoft? How much is share?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think thirty six, thirty seven, fifty different forty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no, high thirties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they probably wouldn't go to forty on principle.  But I think the US regulatory market is actually more friendly toward this type of deal than it ever has been.  I think if the EU tries to shut this down, I'm surprised they don't get a government grant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you kidding me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and remember that the US was a little upset about the EU going after Microsoft,  continuing to go after Microsoft.  If the EU goes after this deal, I think the US Department of Commerce and the state  department start to talk to the EU saying, get out of our cheese here.  This is a US these are US companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, but they have an international footprint.  I understand. But the ramifications all over the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I understand. If I'm the EU, I say, hey, it's our business, too.  But the US is I mean, look at these are two big US companies.  This is not, you know, I think the Commerce Department and the State Department have something to say about that.  They did they did last time.  Yeah. And I also want to point out one other thing.  Jason picked the Giants.  True. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I picked them by three.  Yeah. Gee, let me guess why he picked them.  But he was right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because I have season ticket.  He had an inside source.  But he was right.  Did I not say did I not also say that News Corp would make a run at Yahoo as well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Now, did they make a run at Yahoo or did Yahoo make a run at Rupert Murdoch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The News Corp has been interested in them from the beginning.  There's no difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  News Corp has been interested in Yahoo is embarrassing itself at this point by going hat in hand every company that has a buck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think that's what it is.  You know what they're doing. They're trying to find some way, I think, to develop a poison pill before Microsoft can do anything really nasty.  And then those guys over at the News Corp would know how to do that.  They can take a piece of the company, do some deal where you can't buy them without doing this and that.  I mean, there are ways of getting around, getting a hostile takeover, managing those ways of getting around, having a hostile takeover.  Take your company.  All right. So Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they're just trying to get multiple offers on the table to make themselves look more like a $45 share kind of buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We might as well stop talking about it because it's going to get done.  We all agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jason says it'll happen.  John, you say it'll happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's not going to happen.  I told you a million times.  Is the EU that's going to kill it?  Don Risinger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  John, where's your bet?  Let's make a bet right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's get us. Let's get everybody involved.  I only bet on politics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bet you my Tesla.  DeVorek has to get a mullet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  DeVorek gets a mullet.  My Tesla versus your Honda Accord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a deal I take.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, the Honda Accord probably runs better.  Is the Tesla just a Lotus with an electric engine in it?  I mean, totally redesigned from the ground up.  Well, it looks like it to me.  I looked at one at CES.  Looks like a Lotus.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it is based on the same chassis, but everything else is different.  Jason says it will happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It'll happen this week.  John says it won't happen.  Don, you say it will not happen or will?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not a chance. Not a chance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Molly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it is inevitable.  I think U.S. regulators will prove it and the EU will fall in line.  All right. If I thank you.  There's a scene at the end.  I can't believe that I just got into Jason Calcantes' Tesla.  This is like a weird feeling for me.  This is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a bad day for Amazon.  A bad day for Amazon and S3.  A bad day for cloud computing.  S3 goes down on Friday and a number of websites, including Twitter,  who use S3 to hold the images.  Forty...  What was it?  The Ruby on Rails guys went down.  Some big sites went down when S3 went down.  Amazon says, oh, no, it wasn't our servers.  We're still 99.99 percent uptime.  We couldn't authenticate people as fast as they were trying to log in.  Does this mean the idea of thin clients and cloud computing  in trouble?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the thing I find ridiculous about this is like,  do people never have their own server farms go down?  Their other or their internal servers never go down?  Like, what is the expectation for cloud computing that it will be 100 percent uptime?  Twitter can't really complain, can they?  Yeah, who even knows why Twitter goes down anymore?  But but really, I feel like some of this was a little bit overblown.  Like, why would it be the death of...  It's still technology.  It's still vulnerable.  Like, your car still eventually breaks down, right?  No.  No?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not your Honda Accord.  Never. Not that Honda Accord.  No, that thing goes forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I... 100 percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Three hours, three hours down is a long time for S3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, parts of it were down.  Not everything was down and it happens.  And it's just it's the first time it happened.  So everybody's like, oh, my God, it went down.  You know, by the third or fourth time it happens, people will realize  it's acceptable risk and the benefit of having your stuff in the cloud  backed up and it costs one tenth of the price.  I mean, oh, my God, you know, people couldn't get to their files  on their Pounce accounts.  I mean, oh, my goodness, those MP3 files were just...  This is if you're if you're doing something with...  This is a first world problem.  Financial data or a travel site or there's nothing mission critical.  Nobody would use it for mission critical apps anyway.  Right. Not 100 percent non-issue.  Tempest in a teapot.  Everybody's been wanting to get, you know, I think everybody's just final point on it.  I think everybody has been wanting to attack it because it's been so successful,  which is, you know, what happens, obviously, in technology is, you know,  this thing has been tremendously successful in saving people so much money.  And everybody's shocked that Amazon could come up with something so innovative  that they had to attack it for all these stupid reasons.  Why is Amazon in this business?  Well, maybe they want to have growth.  Maybe they want to try to do something new.  I applaud them for being innovative.  I love S3. You know what? You're right.  I'm going to continue to use jungle disk to back up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not mission critical. It'll be back online at the end of the world.  And so they just attack.  I think people are just hating on it because it's so successful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We hate winners.  I don't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't care. I think if it's successful.  God, you hate everybody.  Everything.  Yeah, John, we're not talking about you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He hates losers. He hates winners.  He hates everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He hates the losers when they're down and he pulls the winner.  The only thing I don't like is stuff that doesn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I agree with you.  Given that we're human and everything's imperfect,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you've just solidified our belief that you hate every human being.  Yeah, pretty much.  You've confirmed it for us.  Only people that don't work.  I'm becoming a Republican.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  First, the Republican Convention declares Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  their national convention's official innovation provider.  Whatever the hell that means.  What is that supposed to mean?  Innovation provider.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But we're still not bringing that neutrality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I need to be a Republican.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But we're still not bringing that neutrality.  I need an innovation provider.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know what that means.  It doesn't mean anything. It's a crock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It says the convention's website, GOPConvention2008.com,  will eventually feature a full range of Google products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is Google behind this or did they just hijack Google's brand?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, is Google like, no, thank you.  They must have made a deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm guessing that Eric Schmidt is a Republican.  Yeah, somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's that site. What is it? Red versus blue?  Let's see.  Google Apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They'll be on the GOP site.  They'll be Google Apps, Google Maps, SketchUp,  and a customized search tools which will make navigating the site easier.  Seems like that could be a good Gilbert and Sullivan song.  Google Apps, Google Maps, SketchUp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're going to see these guys jockeying for position  for various secretaries of state positions, the ambassadorships.  I think Eric Schmidt would love to be the ambassador to Great Britain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Listen to this.  Chad Hurley, founder of YouTube, says,  we look forward to working with the convention committee  and watching the action unfold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In other news, Chad Hurley is now a super delegate.  I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they're just providing them with...  It's a business deal.  It's what YouTube's been doing for all the debates.  So this means the Republicans are just making a bigger deal out of it.  They're trying to make it seem like Google endorses Republicans.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just hilarious because they're the ones who at first wouldn't even...  Most of the candidates didn't...  Wouldn't even want to do the YouTube debate and said that it was demeaning.  But wait a minute now, according to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now they're all about the Google.  They're all about the Google.  According... That's right.  They changed their mind, didn't they?  That's right.  According to HitWise, poor people are more likely to use Yahoo.  Rich people use Google.  So maybe there's something to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So can we find out whether Eric Schmidt's a Republican or Democrat?  You people from CNET should know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm looking at the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't you spy on him just routinely over at CNET?  By the way, has Eric dropped his ban?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google him off it.  Has Eric dropped his ban on CNET?  Does he now give...  It was a one-year ban.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  So it's up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One year's over.  Yeah.  He was not talking to us for one year.  So what they did is HitWise does those clusters, the socioeconomic clusters.  And the clusters who use Google the most are affluent suburbia, upscale America, and small-town contentment.  The people who use Yahoo the most are struggling societies, blue-collar backbone, and remote America.  All of them spend less money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The reason that's skewed is because they have a big dial-up deal.  So it's sort of...  That's probably the SBC dial-up kind of stuff.  And also they've been around longer than Google.  So it's like AOL.  The longer you've been around, the more you get the laggards.  Oh, that makes sense.  So Google hasn't gotten their laggards yet.  We'll get them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The dumb people will come along.  No, I mean...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think actually what you mean is that pretty soon we will be the dumb people.  That might be.  The people who are currently using Google.  And then the new hot thing will come along and we won't be up on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Explain this study, as long as we're talking about web usage studies.  This is from Starcom MediaVest.  6% of web users generate 50% of the click-throughs on banners.  Yeah.  Those are people who see D.  Well, you know what?  You're not far off.  Because listen, most have incomes under 40,000 and their clicks are not related to any offline buying.  They're mostly mails between the ages of 25 and 44.  And what they click on has nothing to do with brand awareness.  It sounds like they're just punching the monkey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is a specific behavior where people feel fidgety if they're not doing something with their browsers.  I've done a lot of user studies.  And when you're watching a lab, some people will just scroll up and down and highlight text as they read it.  And this is why DIG is so successful because they actually give some people something to do on the site.  It may be meaningless to click all the votes on the homepage because the stuff's already on the homepage.  But it makes those kind of people feel better, like the Atari generation.  I do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm always scrolling and highlighting and running around on the page.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What does this do to the already plummeting CPM issue?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, this is bad news for advertisers.  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no.  But this study was backed by Tacoda and America Online, I believe.  And so you have to wonder why would they do that if they're in the display advertising business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe they didn't know what the results would be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no, no.  There's a specific agenda here.  What it is is they want to increase the value of display advertising.  So what they're trying to say is don't worry so much about the clicks.  It's the impression that matters.  But I think it's a very stupid gamble because if they like the clicks, let them have the clicks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, if I'm an advertiser, I'm saying I don't want these $40,000 a year guys.  Get rid of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, those guys have money too.  But anyway, here's Eric Schmitz, obviously a Republican.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was going to say, no, he's a total Democrat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, he's a Republican.  And he gave his last contribution was to Ron Paul.  And he's listed as Republican by the fundraise 2008 Huffington Post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At politicalbase.com, he's listed as having given $25,000 to John Kerry for president in 2004.  News flash, they give money to everybody.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's Eric Schmitz raising over $125,000 in 45 days for the Republican candidate for Senator Mike Gibbons' soon-to-be-open seat.  Wow, maybe he switched.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's equal opportunity.  I should give everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I would like to see how much they give after they get elected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You give to anybody who's going to win, you give.  And this $125,000 was just posted on January 14th, 2008.  So I don't see him being a Democrat here.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So is Larry Lessig going to run for Tom Lantos' vacant seat?  They're trying to draft him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really? He's in Europe right now, isn't he? Or is he back?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know. But there's a little online movement to draft Larry Lessig.  The problem is you'd have to run again in November.  It's a very brief moment of fame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Draftlessig.org. There's a cool video up there.  I think it's his students doing it.  I like this whole idea of drafting people we like because we know that nobody will put themselves out there to be scrutinized like politicians are.  So if you draft them, then you sort of make them have their lives ruined.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's kind of nice. It's like forced representative government.  So instead of the representative government we have, we're the ones who want to see who's in the first place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's how it should be. Anybody who wants to be president shouldn't be allowed to be president.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So true.  Yeah, we have nobody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want John Dvorak for city controller.  Oh, yeah.  What? You want me to spend money on what?  Pot holes are good.  You guys should run Windows 3.1.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, I hate pot holes.  Well, you'd fill the pot holes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you had a bicycle, you wouldn't worry about it. You'd go around it.  I hate bicycles too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You sound like the penguin.  He does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I could do Dvorak and Adam Curry on the same podcast.  Hey, what's going on Dvorak? Hey, it's on the show.  I don't know about this.  Adam Curry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's exactly what it sounds like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It says Edward G. Robinson.  That's just the Jersey.  That's just the Brooklyn boy.  Chief Wiggum.  That's basically you, John.  Yeah, I don't think so.  Let's get some donuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if this were the Simpsons, John would be Chief Wiggum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Could you just real quick say what's going on here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jason would be Burns, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no.  Wow, that's not so bad actually.  Excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Excellent.  Bring out the hounds.  Molly, who would you be?  You'd be Lisa.  Would she be Lisa?  Yeah, she'd kind of be Lisa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you.  And then Don's clearly Bart, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you would be Burns' assistant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I'm not Burns' assistant.  I'm Homer.  I'm eating donuts even as we talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You'd be that kid.  Who's the kid who laughs at him?  Nelson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Amazon S3 is down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's me.  In related news.  The web is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I totally said Leo, a denim vest.  It's in the mail.  Okay, thank you.  I think it is.  That's me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm Nelson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nelson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The web is scarier than most people realize according to Google.  Google crawled billions of web addresses, found that more than 3,000,000 web pages contains malicious software.  Drive-by-download software.  Is that terrifying?  Wow.  Yes, stay off of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You all get it from IE.  You don't get it from Firefox.  That's true because it's ActiveX.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Although that's not true because if there are exploits, for instance, there's PDF exploits.  There are other exploits that are not just ActiveX.  Yeah, but that's not a drive-by, a PDF exploit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't get automatic download.  You have to click on something.  No, no.  Oh, yeah, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess you're...  Well, no, no, no.  A PDF can be loaded automatically.  The extension is PDF.  Yeah, PDF can be loaded automatically.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you click something that's like, oh, click this to open this document.  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm going to punch the monkey.  Yeah.  Speaking of Firefox, has anyone used the new beta?  Yeah, I love it.  I hate it.  I hate it.  It crashes all the time on me.  It crashes all the time.  Are you using it on Windows?  No, Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you go to 3?  Yeah, I have rolled 3 now.  It's a lot more stable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  3 beta 3.  2 was awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, 2 was terrible.  3 beta 3.  I love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm using that with WebKit, the Safari WebKit.  WebKit's amazing, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dude, it's so fast.  No extensions, but it's fast.  So what I do is I leave my Firefox open.  When I have things I have to use an extension for, like bookmarking tools or whatever, I  cut the URL from WebKit over to Firefox because I know it's going to be slow.  And then I go back to surfing on it.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  It sounds inconvenient.  It's an inconvenient truth, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Technology is hard, John.  Are you using the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have 10 browsers open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You do.  You have a browser for every tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, that's why I use links.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have a browser for every tool.  So Jason, are you still using the Air?  You still loving the Air?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a beautiful machine.  And I love the fact that...  What I'm finding is, you know those moments of sluggishness when you're surfing the web  and you have 20 tabs open and it grinds to a halt for a second, you get the spinning  wheel of death?  Yeah.  I don't get that.  It never happens.  Not just because it's a new machine.  It will.  That's because it's new.  No, no, no, no.  What it is is it's the right time.  It'll happen.  It's the right and the read times.  It doesn't have those moments where it has so many things left to read and write that  the memory runs out and it can't like draw the screen or whatever.  It's a slower computer with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you get the solid state drive?  Yeah, no doubt.  Of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Of course.  You got three of them.  He ordered three before they were announced.  He ate one.  He's eating one.  He ate one.  He fed one to one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is my rule of thumb.  I tell my assistant, if Steve Jobs raises it above his shoulder, buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't get any servers, but you get the light stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, he might hold iLife up at hip level.  I'm not buying it.  No.  But if he holds the Mac Mini up or the Air above his head or the new iPhone will go above  his head, that's when you know.  The higher he holds it up, the more chance you're going to buy it.  He put that iPhone, he touched the sky with it.  I was sold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Air looks more like a proof of concept to me than anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what's weird about the Air?  I have a review one that they just sent me.  It's so thin you don't really feel like there's actually a computer there.  It's like you've got a piece of paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bingo.  Bingo.  That's the weird feeling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like you're in the fourth.  Like the computer must be in the fourth dimension.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have you sat on the sofa and used it while watching TV?  It's like you feel like you have nothing there, but you have a huge monitor and a huge keyboard.  It's a real mind F.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is.  It's the strangest computer I've ever used because we're so used to having computing  hardware attached to the screen and keyboard that this feels like there's nothing there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the revolution.  Everyone should go out and buy one.  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's overpriced.  It's underpowered.  If it were $1,300, I'd say that, but it's $1,800.  I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no.  Go buy one now, everyone.  Why?  They said that no one's...  Did you see the new study?  You guys are just plugging the crap on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I'm not plugging it.  It's an experience.  I think that what it really is is Apple once again kind of forging new ground in hardware  design.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Doesn't it have a chiclet keyboard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's got a great keyboard.  It's actually a really good keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's got a great keyboard.  If nobody was creating these cutting edge products, it's like the Tesla or the Air.  Yeah, of course they were overpriced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How is that Tesla doing for you, Jason?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What kind of mileage are you getting?  Actually, my friend's got the first one.  I'm going to go for a ride in it tomorrow.  He's driving it to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, so they've made one so far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're going to do a couple hundred this year.  It's going to be fine.  If you based building product only on what was affordable to the mass audience, you would  never have revolutionary products.  Well, I think that's probably true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is kind of a breakthrough product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would like a $7,000 laptop.  I would like a, you know, more expensive laptop.  You're a multimillionaire.  Come on.  Not just for that reason.  It's good to have that option out there.  Even when they broke out to buy the most expensive computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm glad I got one free for a month.  It's fun to play with.  I won't miss it when it goes back.  I'll go right back to my MacBook, which I purchased.  But I am impressed and I do feel like it will set a tone.  Look, already Lenovo with the X300 is trying to do something similar.

Transcript:  Solid State is a revolution.  I'm telling you, there's a thing in Tom's Hardware this week about these like RAID cards.  They're putting RAM into computers now in RAID arrays.  So not only are you getting like RAM speed, they're putting it in RAID 0 arrays where  you have like, you know, 128 gig over here, 128 gig over here.  It's like whatever amount.  It's like $5,000 in memory.  But the machines run like lightning.  It's fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See, you know, I just think Apple lost its way with this product.  I don't see it.  I think it lost its way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have you had one for a while?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have you played with it?  I've played with it for about a day.  You know, I agree with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And until I played with it, until I had one for a while, it's a strange feeling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but I mean, even in the recent studies out of I think Piper Jaffrey had it out, they  said that people are really into this.  They go, wow, this is really neat, pretty good.  But oh, gee, it's too expensive.  I don't want to buy it.  I mean, I think what's happening is...  Yeah, I wasn't going to.  I wouldn't buy it.  I think what's happening is we're unable to relate to the average person who doesn't do  the tech thing, who doesn't do the top of the line stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait a second.  Wait a second.  How do you say that when people can buy a Plasma TV today for what, $700, $800 bucks,  or they can spend up to $4,000 or $5,000, and there's a whole range of televisions that  go from $700 to $5,000, let's say, why shouldn't there be a range of computers that go from  $700 to $5,000?  Where are the $5,000?  If there's that range, though, here's the difference, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If my television or my computer costs $5,000, then it damn well better...  Anyway, it better have a lot of thousand whistles.  It better have the boat like...  I'm not getting...  Most people are not going to get the solid state drive model, and so they're going to  get a slow computer that is lacking in fundamental connectivity.  First of all, it's not that slow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Second point is...  Wait, wait.  Go ahead.  It's the slowest MacBook by all...  Yeah, but it's still faster than a lot of...  I mean, it's fast.  It's a lot faster than the computer I used two years ago, and I think people are not  making the equation price equals power.  They may say price equals style, price equals weight, price equals...  That's what Apple likes.  Too high, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think price still has to...  It still has to include utility.  To me, the MacBook is just not useful.  It's useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It works.  It's useful.  It works.  I wanted to throw out a point of history here.  You spent so much time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, Mr. Dvorak, the historian, the veteran.  I still have the original laptop that was made, the first laptop that was made with a solid  state drive.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Any guesses?  Hold on a second.  Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Model 100, TRS-80.  Model 100 from Radio Shack.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, I'm thinking of a genuine laptop with a full size keyboard and an LCD screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And a full size keyboard, it had a little screen, but it was solid state.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I know what you're talking about.  It was more of a typewriter, wasn't it?  One of these...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, no.  ...projectors.  It's the Ultralight from NEC 1988.  The first laptop, it was a collector's item.  One of the greatest machines ever made.  It was a 286.  How much memory did that have, John?  Not much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  John, when I was reading your column back in 1984, 1985...  Not much.  64K?  1984, 1985, when I was reading your column back when you were what?  Back when you were 50.  I was 14.  I was like Don Reisinger.  And where is the computers at that time when I would look on the back page at Gateway or  look at whatever Falcon or whatever was being...  It was like computers were $3,000 to $6,000.  So why is that such a...  Why was it an okay amount of money to spend then and now computers are so cheap?  People are like, oh my God, $3,000 is a lot of money.  It used to be.  Hey, I'm not debating.  I'm not arguing against your concept.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You were paying that for the cutting edge in technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am not arguing against you on this.  I think you're right.  There should be an ultra, ultra machine out there and it should cost a few bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  People are spoiled.  But it should be an ultra, ultra machine.  It can't be something that has hardly any ports on it.  It can't be something when I look at an X300, for example, that can fit into a Manila envelope  as Walt Mossberg showed.  Or if I look at a better equipped MacBook that's slightly larger and I could pay less,  why would I buy that thing?  I think it's nice looking.  A lot of people bought $600 iPhones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you have to.  I mean, there has to be some points given for style and design.  Maybe that's not the, you know, dig or CNET, you know, Uber user who loves to study the  spec sheets, you know, way of buying.  But there are other people.  But think about it this way.  If you spend $10 a day on your computer, it's not about studying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not about studying the spec sheet.  It's about going to a hotel that doesn't have Wi-Fi and requires an ethernet port.  You shouldn't have to look at it and say there are options to be there.  It comes with a little dongle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it comes with an ethernet dongle.  Or you can buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can buy a dongle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The first thing you'll lose, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Right.  It's just ridiculous.  It's totally ridiculous.  And it makes no sense whatsoever.  I mean, yeah, it's neat looking.  But why should I?  How many days a month do you travel?  How many days a month do you travel?  On average, probably 10 days a week, a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really?  Because that's exactly what I do.  And that means you take your laptop out of your bag five times a day, seven times a day  during that.  It's so nice to have a three pound thing that you just open and close and it just works  and it's fast.  I find it delightful to have that huge monitor and huge keyboard.  If you live with this thing for a month, I think you will fall in love with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're saying that a three pound laptop didn't exist before and doesn't exist now?  I mean, it's not about being a three pound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The Toshiba is 2.2 pounds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  2.2 pounds with a drive in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But without a full screen and a full keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's got a full keyboard.  The screen is just the minimum size.  It's 12 inches.  I don't think you need a bigger or 10.  I don't think you need a bigger screen.  The X300 has a 13 inch screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The X300 has a 13.3 inch screen.  I have the tiny.  You can get.  You go ahead.  You go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to say I have it.  You've got one person at a time, please, because Skype doesn't handle it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have the tiny Sony, which is the Viya one.  And it's about the same weight and has a DVD drive.  However, it's got the tiny keyboard that makes your hands feel cramped and the tiny  monitor.  The real mind blowing thing about the Air is that you have this full keyboard, full  monitor experience that's so light and thin.  I know it's not for everybody, but if you're a traveler, you will fall in love with this  thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I own a Mac.  What I'm saying is I do think that the form factor is really awesome, but that you can  get that form factor with more features somewhere else.  Not on a Mac.  Not on a Mac.  The X300 or the PortaJet.  Well, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We know Molly doesn't like Macs.  That's a religious argument that I am going to put to sale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you saying I should run Windows?  Yes.  Did you just say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what she's saying.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, she's not saying that.  She knows it's too hard for you to run Windows.  It's not that easy for her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I ran Windows my whole life and then I just got tired of it grinding.  Your whole life?  How old are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I ran Macs my whole life and I switched the other way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I am opposite switch.  PC Jr.  OK, I'm old school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My first laptop, PowerBook 145B.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My first computer, PC Jr.  I'm old school.  Hold on a second.  I'm writing that one down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, like I meet all these.  I went to, I would meet all these Mac geeks now and I would make jokes about my 145B in  my like OS 7 and they'd go, I don't know what you're talking about.  I never started using it until OS X came out because now it's like a...  I used to like my ThinkPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll be honest, I liked it.  But I just with Windows, it's like after four months after the installation of the operating  system and you install five programs, it just grinds to a halt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You cannot tell me that the Mac does not do that.  The Mac is legendary for slowing down after...  Not the new one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When's the last time you've been using OS X, Leprd and stuff like that?  I mean, it's fine.  Yeah, I have a Mac Mini.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have a Mac Mini that is now a sludge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, a Mac Mini is so underpowered.  That's the hard truth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't want to get in the Mac versus PC argument here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't either.  All I'm trying to get into is...  Isn't this the first time we've had this discussion?  Like, if you call it a MacBook Air, couldn't you put the 3G in?  The Trishiba Porte R500 has built-in 3G mobile broadband and an optical drive and like 3.4G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everybody thought that Apple would announce a Sprint PCS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why would they not put that in there?  I carry around my little USB drive and the door that opens to the USB thing, this is  my only complaint, is so awkwardly positioned that you can't put that in.  So I had to buy a six foot extender cable and like a dork, I plug in the six foot cable,  it sits on the desk three inches away from the USB modem, which looks like it's a piece  of bait on the end of a fishing line.  People look at me like I've got some laser beam, like a whip, a bolero coming out of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  my...  So now, with your dongles and your extra cables, do you think you've added maybe like another  pound?  No, it's not that heavy.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  I think it would be kind of horrible to see Jason Calacanis roaming around with his dongle  hanging out.  Oh, you're nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're going to take a break, but we'll be back with more excitement in just a moment.  John C. Dvorak, Jason Calacanis, Don Risinger and Molly Wood.  I tell you, it's a good crowd.  I do want to mention audible.com.  They are our sponsor audible.com slash Twitter.  Audible.  Jason always does this.  I love audible.  I do too.  You like audible too, Molly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I love audible.  I am an audible subscriber from way back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have either of you downloaded Born Standing Up yet?  Steve Martin's book.  No.  I've heard about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does he read the audible?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, he reads it.  It's so good.  Oh, that's got to be great.  It is so...  I'm loving it.  It's only four hours.  It's short.  I wish it were longer.  It's on a bridge, but it's just not a long book.  But Martin is just talking about his stand-up comic career.  And as you would expect with Steve Martin, it's very honest.  It's very insightful.  He starts when he was a kid working at Disneyland doing magic tricks in the magic store, talks  about his stand-up routine, the difficulty of being a stand-up comedian, working on the  Smother Brothers comedy hour in Saturday Night Live.  It's really...  I just...  I have to say, I love this book.  Born Standing Up, a comics life.  That could be your audible book.  The great thing about audible is no matter what you're doing in the airplane, driving  the car, working at the gym, working in the garden, you can be reading.  You can get some reading done.  And I'll tell you, I read so many books via audible now.  my Kindle or a paper book because everything is on my portable device.  You can use an iPod, an iPhone.  I'm putting it on my iPod Touch now.  It works on the Kindle, works on a lot of portable devices, hundreds of different devices,  tens of thousands of books, 45,000 plus books.  And you download them instantly.  The minute you decide you want a book, you just click and you've got it.  Audible...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Say again?  They have that book, that Tom Cruise unauthorized biography by Andrew Morton.  That I want to hear.  Really?  That's the one where like he wouldn't participate, but it goes into like all the Scientology stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Should we play a little bit of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you can get it, I want to hear that.  I see it.  I'm going to buy it right now.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Click.  Well, you just go to audible.com slash.  Oh, you're already a member.  See, you got to be a new member.  I'm going to start a new membership.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Start a new membership.  He doesn't care.  He'll tell his assistant to buy it.  Yeah, that's what I'll do.  He said get three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I need an assistant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you need two assistants.  If I had an assistant, then I would be the definite MacBook Air customer.  Yeah, see, that's all.  And the assistant carries your dongles.  Yeah, you need to be in the assistant bracket.  You need a dongle shirt.  Assistant's in Teslas, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I have two assistants.  Two assistants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now why do you have two assistants?  Now you're just showing off.  I have one that starts at 8 a.m. and then the other one starts at noon.  So between 8 and 10 p.m. I have coverage because I work from 8 to 10 p.m.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, I can't wait till Andrew Morton writes the Jason Calacanis, an unauthorized biography.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I really wish somebody would do that.  I keep telling people who work for me, I'm like, will you please write a poison pen like  autobiography?  You've got to do the sex tape first.  Here's a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's not going to happen.  Here's Andrew Morton, Tom Cruise, an unauthorized biography, John Hedges reading here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The actor's father, grandfather, and great grandfather were all named Thomas Cruise Mayfather.  Mayfather?  Not only did they keep the same name, they lived in the same place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, this is going to rapidly turn weird.  This is good.  Keep going.  No, you got to buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Play it one more second.  Tom Cruise was Little Tommy Maypother.  Did you know that?  Mayp?  That's his maiden name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here, let's play some more.  ...roots in the rich Kentucky soil.  Over the years, the Maypothers, from both the Amera and Maypother bloodlines, produced  an array of well-to-do professional men, mainly lawyers, but also engineers, scientists,  and even a railway president.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  President Maypother.  Maypother.  See, the problem is I don't want to hear any of that crap.  I only want to hear about the Scientology stuff.  I know.  When they put the...  They always put the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just go straight to the crazy.  the book and they should really go to the juicy parts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's the great thing about Audible.  It's got it in chapters.  If you're going to go steal these things, they're like, you don't know what you're getting,  and then people put voice-over and people are changing the order of it.  You're better off just paying the 20 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  Oh, I'm a believer.  Leo, I don't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Go ahead.  I'm sorry.  I just want to say real quick, I don't want to go on a line here, but one great book,  I'm not sure if Audible has it.  I think they do, but Beyond Banda Brothers.  I don't know if anyone's...  I love Banda Brothers.  That was so good.  Yeah, it's the one actually written by Dick Winters, the major, major winners in the whole  story.  Oh yeah.  Great, fantastic book.  Just read it.  Audible, yeah.  Yeah, definitely, definitely worth checking out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well now, now we got three great recommendations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, wait a second.  They have the Harvard Business Review on here.  I didn't know that.  Did you know they had a whole business review?  That's everything you'd ever want.  Oh yeah, they have a lot of publications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, I'm pretty sure that Audible has gotten its money's worth.  No, no, you know what?  Harvard Business Review is a great...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you're an entrepreneur, this is like a little secret I'll give you.  Harvard Business Review does these massive case studies of businesses, and it's incredibly,  insightful and you'll learn a lot.  And I had no idea it was on...  I haven't been reading it because I've been...  Whatever.  It would really be a great option to get it on Audible.  That's the one I'm going to download.  Because you can buy it for $44 a year.  It's like 12 issues.  Isn't that a good deal?  It's like $3 to $4 each.  That's a great deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like a cup of coffee.  You know, all the guys in first class are listening to the Harvard Business Review.  All the guys in the back are listening to Tom Cruise and unauthorized biography.  I don't understand it.  I don't know, man.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And some of those people are using Toshiba's instead of MacBook Air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm charging them double for this ad.  Audible.com slash Twitch.  We love you.  Love Audible.  Thank them for their support.  Love you, Audible.  Well, you know what we don't love is Insignia photo frames.  Can you believe this?  Insignia photo frames.  No, it's so bad.  They have...  It's now discontinued, but the people were buying it.  Best Buy, Big Box stores, they're those photo frames.  They contained a Trojan horse, a really nasty Trojan horse.  As soon as you put it on the network, it would copy itself over to your PC, any other device.  Now the weird thing is this particular one is called Machmex.  It's a Chinese Trojan horse.  Blocks more than a hundred types of security and antivirus programs.  Kills Windows Firewall.  But then...  But wait, no wait.  Listen to what it's doing.  There's more.  It steals gaming passwords.  For now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, it could be...  It's so weird though.  That's all it does.  It's like a human using only 5% of its brain.  You could bring down the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's a Chinese Trojan and you got to understand that in China they could sell these  gaming passwords for a lot of money, a gaming account.  It's actually a lucrative business for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or gold firms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  Somebody's fragging other people on Inhaler right now thanks to Insignia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is a weird...  We've heard of viruses on cell phones and that was always kind of proof of concept.  Never really did much.  But this on a photo frame, this thing's a nightmare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because the totally unsuspecting will get it.  I mean, it's really like you give a digital photo frame to your grandma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, who's going to run an antivirus on their photo frame?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And even if they're running antivirus on their PC, this thing can beat it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a crazy thing.  They've sold...  And this is the scary thing.  They've sold millions of these things already.  I have no idea how many people have been infected by it, how widespread it is, but you got to  think this is a pretty nasty one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you don't think that's going to get crazy is like, if they can get out to these  edge devices, some of these things have cameras in them.  Some of these things display things.  So what if you throw up a Goatse or a Lemon Party or something on this thing to a million  people?  Oh, wouldn't that be awful?  Before you turn on the camera and you start the audio and start listening to people's  devices.  I have that quick service on my Nokia.  I'm always concerned if I have that thing in my pocket.  It could turn on.  Yeah.  So I power it off.  I'm like, I don't want this thing going on at an inopportune time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Quick is that streaming video that comes up.  That's what Scobel was using at Davos.  It comes off the cell phone.  It's getting better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it?  Yeah.  They've redone the software like three times in the last three weeks and it does like 640  by 480 now.  And you can do audio only and you can like do all these like really cool little you can  name the file, you know, and name the title of it.  And so it's just you can tell that they're on their game.  I think Quick is wow.  Wow.  You know, John, I mean the file.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You got to understand, John, if you go to qik.com, you're watching.  I mean, I just was watching a guy tune his guitar.  I mean, you're watching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fantastic.  Love that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Imagine like, you know, the next time there's some like, I don't know, terrible disaster  or whatever, people are going to be turning on their phones and reporting from that location.  So for like human rights violations or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it needs more phones with better video.  I mean, right now the N95 is the only really decent video, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah.  But I mean, it's again, it's just like we've been talking about with the Tesla and the  MacBook Air and all these other things.  It's going to happen at some point.  It's got to start out at $600 so it can be $60.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's some guys showing us his Twitter account.  Well, that's exciting.  He's showing us what?  His Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought we were trying to keep our rating on.  So what do you stream?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When you do it, what do you do, Jason?  My dogs, of course.  Your dogs?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did one on Saturday where I had about 50 people from around the world watching me make  like a vegan shake.  I'm trying to be like a, I got this thing.  I'm trying to be like a couple of day a week vegan.  Like four days a week vegan or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's good.  How do you do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What exactly does that involve?  I mean, it's a political decision to be a vegan.  You can't do it twice a week.  This is like being a Republican one day.  Not even me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ignore all the food in your fridge two days a week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no, no.  Very simple.  Like I try to eat like, you know, whatever, three out of five meals or whatever.  I try to eat like vegan and that's how I blow out.  And I want to have a cheeseburger.  I don't feel so bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's helpful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  About the animal or about the cholesterol?  I don't care about animals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, whatever.  I mean, we're obviously meant to eat animals, but it's more like flexitarian.  Yeah, but then why go vegan?  I mean, it's very healthy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm a flexitarian.  How is vegan more healthy than vegetarian?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I think the dairy stuff is not really great for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You'll see fat vegetarians.  You'll rarely see a fat vegan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway, if I go to Peter Luger's and have a steak or whatever, I don't feel so bad because  I know that I ate healthy the rest of the time.  I think there are fat flexitarians.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's just crazy, Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, of all the jobs going like it is here, this is going to make him blow his sack.  Yeah, look at that.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, John's like, that's it.  I'm out of here.  I can't work with these people.  I can't take it anymore.  They're crazy.  I've had all I can stand.  I can't stand no more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jason, the flexitarian Calacanis is online all the time at QIK.com.  You can watch him make shakes.  You can also go to Mahalo, which is his human powered web search engine, M-A-H-A-L-O.com,  a great site.  And he's also on Twitter.  All of us are on Twitter except for you, John.  We got to get you on Twitter.  Yeah.  Dvorak.org slash blog.  Would you Twitter?  I don't think he's not the type.

Facebook, from their privacy policy, may also collect information about you from other sources  such as newspapers, blogs, instant messaging services, and other users of the Facebook  service through the operation of the service.  And do what with it?  In order to provide you with a more useful information and a more personalized experience.  Of course.  What the hell are they doing?  Are you doing this for your own good?  I Googled you and I saw on your resume that you went from the University of Montana, so  I thought you might want to buy some grizzly gear.
