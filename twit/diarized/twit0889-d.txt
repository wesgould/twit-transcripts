Transcript:  But number of people pointed out this is kind of a battle between  old hollywood and new media because in two weeks  Lord of the rings debuts on amazon prime  So you have warner brothers a hundred year old, you know motion picture company  I don't know if this really counts as warner brothers. It's been acquired. It's been sold. It's been bought. It's a but uh,  It's now a part of you know warner discovery and all of that  Uh, so this old line media company creating game of thrones spent a lot of money  Uh amazon spent even more money  For the streaming rights to the lord of the rings series and then created their own  Is it a prequel or a sequel? I think it's a prequel to the lord of the rings

Start time: 371.38
End time: 383.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a prequel because I think the the lord of the rings proper the trilogy  Uh and the hobbit that those rights they're gone far as I know remain with warner. Yeah. Oh, isn't that funny warner has him?

Transcript:  It's such a it's such a morass like  We're watching the sandman right now on netflix, but it's so good dc comics, right property  um, and you know, it's like  It's it's such a patchwork of you know rights and like  You know rights and intellectual property  You it doesn't to a consumer. I don't think it makes any sense  Like it doesn't give you any signpost to it like where you're going to find the stories you like. Yeah

Start time: 415.80
End time: 479.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh, it said that amazon spent a quarter of a billion dollars getting the rights alone  For the lord of the rings prequel and committed to five seasons there already but it hasn't even debuted five seasons  Worth at least a billion dollars which would make it at least at the time  most expensive tv series ever  I imagine though that warners is spending a lot on house of the dragon  the prequel  Um, i'm just looking to see if I can find a number  I don't know for how many seasons they've committed to though. That's interesting and remember it's not going to have  Uh the showrunners from game of thrones david benioff and dan weiss after the last season. Maybe people are going to be glad  Um  I just it's a very interesting battle and the new york times today says don't watch either one of them  I think it's link bait to be did I write that man? That's us

Start time: 479.50
End time: 513.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes  Is that how you feel you're gonna admit I could not i'm sure they'll be fine  But I could not be less interested in a media thing than the dragon show  Or lord like I feel like lord of the rings. I feel a the books are still awesome  B the movies to me came out basically yesterday  Uh, I don't I don't understand the point of of this new reboot or the show or whatever. I  I don't know. I don't get it. I'm i'm i'm more of a video game guy anyway, so I really shouldn't even be talking  But yeah, I I personally am not super interested in either property actually

Transcript:  Uh, it's it's kind of life or death. I think at this point for hbo hbo has been going through a lot of  Troubles of late  Streaming viewing is flat. They just cancelled. I think 38 shows  To save money from they just kicked them off hbo including a lot of originals  I think there's a bit of a struggle going on these days  And I wonder because amazon amazon and apple have a big advantage. We've talked about this before  Their business does not rely on the success  Of of a tv show  Right, they can afford to spend a billion dollars on a tv show

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  For sure. It's it is a big advantage. I mean, I don't we just  Finished a redesign that we've been working on for eight months beautiful, by the way  I said this off the air, but i'll say it on the air gorgeous. Yeah. Thank you leo  But because of that, I don't really watch tv. I just see spoilers on twitter. Um

Start time: 579.68
End time: 584.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait a minute. Are you saying that you have been staying up all night doing this redesign?

Start time: 585.54
End time: 701.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, obviously i'm not i'm not the person doing the redesign but we've been no time no time for sleep  But we've been for eight months. We've been really  Really busy and uh, and also working on, you know, we've been doing some hiring and doing other things  So because of that i haven't been watching a whole lot of tv  Uh that said I I do  understand this uh, really evolving landscape we write about it we think about it we we talk about it a lot the evolving landscape of  media  and it it is getting to the point where  It is getting to an inflection point where there's such there's not enough money coming in from the old  streams for for for old media and now  You have uh apple and amazon who essentially throw in their their media buys as part of  Becoming part of this very expensive subscription, right?  For amazon prime or or apple one, I guess apple one you wouldn't call it very expensive  But but still more than what netflix costs, you know, uh, typically so  um  They they have they're just playing a different game. And so because of that  And the numbers are a lot different. They have a built they have built-in audiences  For what they're doing and so all of a sudden you're seeing like really this year  There there's a a changing landscape that's happening in media and now it's starting to affect not just these  Big box sort of films and uh, and and media franchises  But now it's slipping over into live sports  Uh as well, which is sort of the last uh, the last piece of the puzzle that a lot of the traditional media companies  Like my former employee cbs, you know had to uh, you know  They had a corner on the market and that's rapidly changing and so I think we we certainly should be prepared that the game  Looks a little different going forward. Do you think I mean

Start time: 701.50

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We just learned that the cine world  uh  Which owns regal theaters declare bankruptcy  Do you think that it's over for movie houses going out to see the movies?

Start time: 727.36
End time: 739.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that is sad, um, so  No, I I think that when I go by and I have actually seen a few movies in the theater  Uh over the last six months the theaters look pretty crowded to me and it might be sort of the post covid

Start time: 778.28
End time: 800.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's also the studios. It's I think there's a crunch  For talent and the studios are now competing with streaming  And there's a lot of money from coming from apple and amazon  And others, I guess hbo netflix for sure and that's competing with  Movies for uh talent and there's a there's a limited talent pool

Start time: 801.54
End time: 806.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 814.98
End time: 852.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, partly why I don't watch is like I haven't seen a whole lot of good quality things coming out that give me any  Urgency to you know want to carve the time out like i'd rather go exercise or or spend time like playing video like  Like um nicolas mentioned playing video games with my kids or doing something like that than watching the shows because the quality  It's so watered down because these all of these places are buying so much content  And then the quality of content is pretty low because then all of these writers are just having to pump out  You know, it's a it's a golden age if you're a writer with first of scripts because you just get to pump out stuff constantly  Um, but because of that the quality is not great right now in july

Start time: 853.02
End time: 955.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For the first time ever streaming had more viewers than cable tv according to nielsen  And the number one streamer still despite struggles is netflix  With eight percent of the market youtube of course doing very well 7.3 then hulu prime video  disney plus and hbo max with only one  percent  uh hulu uh  Did well thanks to only murders in the building and the bear which I loved the bear was a great show if you like food  and restaurants  netflix  Despite, you know struggling a little bit with stranger things wasn't as big as they had hoped  They spent 200 million dollars on the gray man  Uh, in fact i've already greenlit three two two more movies a third  Second and third sequel with ryan gosling as a jason borne style  superhero  uh, and I I say superhero, but it's actually made by the two guys who did uh,  Avengers endgame so it definitely has that it has a very much of a comic book feel to it  But unfortunately it it did very well its first week and didn't do so well in subsequent weeks  Maybe they people didn't like it. I thought it was fun  uh  So five billion minutes  That's how netflix measures it  five billion  minutes  uh of of viewing time eight percent of the total tv  viewing  We're just you know what? This is just and and you might say well  Is it a tech story? It is a tech story because it's how technology has very much changed  Every part of our lives including how we enter are entertained

Start time: 956.72
End time: 993.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think we even though streaming just overtook cable. I think we may have kind of  already passed peak streaming at least in the  hollywood gold rush sense, I mean hbo  HBO max is cutting back on its production of originals and also like the made for streaming category of movies  So under the new co of warner brothers discovery david zaslav, they you know, they've said we're going to make big theatrical movies  And we're going to make movies for hbo  Streaming and cable but we're not going to make as many. Um, you know hbo max, you know

Start time: 993.40
End time: 996.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they're also merging the discovery plus an hbo

Start time: 998.04
End time: 1020.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And their theory is there I think is you have a lot of cheap unscripted reality tv  Right coming in from discovery, right and the economic model of that is just far superior to like  Putting you know putting out a big splashy movie, especially if you're not amortizing that ip across, you know  physical theaters  um, you know, maybe cable distribution maybe you know

Start time: 1021.14
End time: 1034.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Other licensing not to mention the fact that warner brothers discovery  Has 55 billion dollars in debt  Yikes  That's a lot of debt  Yeah

Start time: 1035.44
End time: 1068.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Netflix is not debt free, but you know, they they borrowed a lot of money at very cheap rates. Um kind of during the  uh, you know  During that long low interest rate environment we've been in  Um, that's obviously changing too. And I think you know like the the economy, um  The macro economy is affecting hollywood too in that sense, you know, debt's a little more expensive  So the the premise that you use really cheap money to like  fund good point  Fund all of this ip creation that you then amortize over time that

Start time: 1069.42
End time: 1103.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The the calculus is different now Netflix debt, uh compared to 55 billion is 14.5 billion  But they also have 6 billion in cash  Uh, and there but their annual interest is seven, you know the  The interest they have to pay every year 752 million  This is why netflix by the way has been having a lot of trouble in the stock market people are people are nervous  About the future of netflix. I don't know. What do you think? What's the future? Is it a  Uh, where do we get our entertainment in the future? Is it just i think nicolas might be a might be a harbinger

Start time: 1104.22
End time: 1194.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just gonna play video games going forward. I'll tell us a fun little anecdote in 2006. I was at gizmodo  Uh, and we had some like consulting thing with time warner  Uh, so we flew out to california and you know, some guys were showing them off  Oh here are the new phones some guys are showing them off here the new, you know, here's the new whatever  I was in charge of video games  But the more important uh or the more interesting conversation I had with them was I was explaining like how I consumed media  How I consume content it was like and I was very frank with them was like look I torrent everything  I have an xbmc. I was 20 at the time. I was like I torrent everything. I have xbmc hooked up to my tv  I have an over-the-air antenna. They did not want to hear from you  Yeah, no, I was like dude i'm never gonna pay for this stuff  And yeah, okay when I was 20, that's perhaps not the most polite way to say that but the point is I was like look  This is kind of the future here. You've got people sitting at home with their own kind of self self-selected media  Situation which is basically all netflix and and disney plus is now today  But they were very skeptical. They're like, oh people aren't going to stay home and want to pick and choose which shows  They want to watch I was like are you crazy? You're what?  So I was so I feel vindicated, you know, however many years later that yeah, that's exactly what happened  Uh, and you know, I don't listen to that nicklaus kid. I mean it's what again I was fairly, you know  Silly about oh very cavalier about my consumption habit  But like this is like why would I do you were right why would I watch linear television?  If I could pick and choose my choose my own adventure and I think they were just very skeptical

Start time: 1194.80
End time: 1284.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was like, okay, whatever at that time  I would think about my kid who would never watch tv watch youtube and when his friends came over  They just had youtube playing non-stop. I mean it was it was a harbinger of the future  And and remember hollywood's response to this was quibi  Yeah, of course, which is now the punchline to a joke like does anybody remember quibi?  Uh, they've fumbled this future to some degree  but remember house  Game of thrones really did very well. So I understand why they're saying well, maybe we can do, you know reproduce that success with house of dragons  Um, it's a I I wouldn't want to be in their shoes at this point. Is it a golden time for creators?  There's a lot of money floating about  Yeah, but I think it's getting tighter. Yeah, it is getting tighter and I and we talked about this. I remember, uh, both  Ben stiller creator of severance on apple tv  and two of the principles, uh in uh,  The ted lasso show saying it's weird doing a show for apple because we have no idea  How many people are watching if anybody's watching they don't give us numbers?  And that's the other thing with streaming you heard what netflix numbers are well, we have 15 billion minutes  Like what what is that compare that to ratings? In fact now for the first time ever amazon and nielsen  Uh closed a deal to have nielsen, which is the classic old tv rating system to give them numbers on thursday night football  Which is moving to streaming this season

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Things are getting tighter unless you're a sports league, uh, you know, those rights don't seem to be  Uh, you know nick kahn who's the co-ceo of wwe?  He was very bullish on the idea of the streamers moving into live. Uh, they had their conference call about a week ago  And he's like look netflix already  Uh reportedly bid on f1 live rights youtube reportedly bid on  NFL sunday ticket, uh, these streamers are coming  And it's just a matter of time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you choosing short-term money over medium to longer term exposure?  And that is a question. I don't think anybody knows the answer to and so nick kahn's answer was like well  We're gonna do everything we're gonna have a streaming package. We're gonna have a broadcast tv package  We're gonna have a cable package. I only bring up wwe because I I like wrestling and I think they're actually  Speaking of streaming business an excellent company to kind of study because they've been kind of navigating the digital media situation  for uh  Arguably their entire existence. Uh, you know, they're they're basically a content or an ip company and they're just selling it to who's the highest bidder  And nowadays these are the highest bidder  So they're actually for the folks listening kind of an interest you wouldn't necessarily think it  But they're an interesting company to study in in this kind of wider conversation

Transcript:  So this is I think it's an opportunity. I honestly think  That the mls deal with apple 10 years for major league soccer, which has not been doing that great  Well in the u.s  It's always been a struggle to get soccer and big in the u.s  It's a real opportunity for on apple's part to show how you can use technology do 4k  Do you know?  You know usfl's been using drones  To take the drone go into the huddle and then zoom out and zoom and i'm just waiting for a player to go get out of here  It's last night the drone  But it's really great as a viewer to see unique angles unique and I think apple could do a lot with stats  They could really be interesting and they I hope they will they haven't done that with baseball  All they've done is minimal with baseball, which is exactly not what I want. MLS is small enough

Transcript:  It's it's is it a major league depending how you're talking to it's a major league, but it's a smaller league  So I feel like it definitely affords apple the ability and i'm sure mls, you know figure this as well  To experiment to see what they can kind of do. This is not the nfl. Well, you're not going to mess with the nfl  That's that's crazy. Yeah. Yeah, they won't let you  Uh and major league baseball feels like they would they would just like not want but like major league soccer  It's like okay cool. Let's see. Let's excuse younger. Anyway, uh the sport at least in the united states  So it's like let's let's see what we can do here to make this  Uh more more exciting or more kinetic and more interesting is a more dynamic broadcast  It feels like mls is like the perfect size league to kind of try to figure that out with

Transcript:  To experiment. I will say the only interesting thing i've ever seen in 8k was a soccer match  On a 98 inch samsung tv  Where where you look and you see the ball goes across the screen and it's not a blur, right?  You actually see the ball tracking like you're looking through a window  And then they also experimented with some different angles down on the field up from sort of the where was this?  So, I mean this was it. Um, this was in korea at samsung's. Uh, there you go  Okay, so it was filmed just to show off 8k. Um, uh, so very  Interesting, but but it made me actually  Feel like soccer was less boring watching it, you know in in 8k  And so which is for the us soccer's tough because you know, a lot of these games are like one nothing two nothing  The ball just goes back and forth  They call penalties and we don't know why what off they flop on the ground and they look like they've been hurt

That's also a question adding subscribers. Yeah. Yeah apple has apple has changed its accounting to arpu  Average revenue per user. How do you get the average revenue up? You get them to buy apple services, right?  You already sold them the phone. How do you get more money out of them? Well, we got football. We got soccer  We got baseball. Would you pay for that?

Transcript:  Uh the will the the bubble burst in terms of sport, uh sports rights fees and this type of thing  This conversation has been going on again. I'm a wrestling fan  So I kind of studied the business aspect of it, uh for a long time  The difference now is is like, you know, let's say a decade ago  Uh, it was it was it was a broadcast networks. It was it was nbcu. It was comcast. It was cbs  Now you've got the streamers you've got youtube and and apple and stuff  10 years from now who will be the new entrance to keep the the bubble rising?  It's like okay for the nfl deal in the year 2040. Who is the new company?  That's going to offer you know, how many multiples of the previous deal that is uh,  That's a very long-term question  but like the reason why the fees have continued to escalate is because of  Uh the youtubes and the apples of the world and if those companies, uh, you know are  This doesn't do well. They don't they don't get the eyeballs or for whatever reason they don't want to be in sports anymore  Uh, who who steps in then that is that is a question for a little while from now

Transcript:  Yeah, they have for years they launched the wwe network in 2014 and they have been  I listened to every single one of those conference calls. They kept trying to be like oh our data is valuable  We're gonna they have these these they thought that 80 million  Americans were had an affinity was a word they used for wwe and I was like 80 million  That is when five million people watch monday night raw on mondays for free  You're going to tell me 80 million people have an interest in this in this so they had like weird  Expectations when they launched their network and yes owen was right  They they sold it the the second they could they that had changed the leadership and he's like this is not  This is not working. They had like a million subscribers, which is fine  But you know, it's a lot easier when you get nbcu to pay you 250 million dollars a year and you basically just have to put on  Basically random matches. They don't have to be good because now you're just providing content  You don't even have to convince fans to buy pay-per-views. You don't have to convince fans to buy tickets  It's just nbcu giving you money for them for whatever the content is. They've got that deal. So it is it is a very  interesting turn of events so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't if you're wwe you have zero incentive to provide compelling matches or interesting matches because you're getting paid regardless  It's like a salary versus being on commission.

Yes retired in disgrace  So whatever but now the question is like who's buying this company?  It's a very healthy business. They make money hand over fist. It pretty much runs on its own  You don't have to do anything again. The matches don't matter  You just put person a versus person b and nbcu's paying you so it doesn't matter  Who's gonna buy this? Yeah, uh and all the it's it's the usual contenders like well nbcu could just buy it  Why would they why would they keep paying rights fees every five years?  Escalating rights fees when they could just own the whole thing from a to z and never have to think of that again

What is more real real if I want to watch real I watch the nfl if I want to watch like i've got two hours  to kill  Uh, who kind of cares how those hours are spent?  So it's like but yes to your point it is it can be viewed as as kind of like yeah  But they've they've done a good job over the past 10 15 years of trying to like, uh increase the caliber of the advertisers  Uh, and so they are they've been working at that and now it is again to me  It feels it's a matter of time until someone buys this thing and then it's just like another  Pnl on on nbcu's kind of like conference call every quarter.

Transcript:  Yeah, and they don't have a relationship anyway wwe has had a relationship with nbcu with the usa network for 30 years  Or however long it's been  So they know each other and they've known each other  So to me if it feels again, it's it feels inevitable like it's a matter of time someone buys because it is it is reliable  Revenue and it kind of doesn't even matter that's been you know, if you ask fans like really hardcore fans over the past  Let's let's say 10 years wwe has more or less been unwatchable. It has been bad and people either  People either hate watch it or they watch it because they've got podcasts and it's content for the podcast or like whatever  But like people really have not liked the product and it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter  The ratings are more or less. Okay, they get paid however they get paid and it is it is like inelastic  It's like it doesn't matter. They could just produce like imagine releasing just like a bad album  That doesn't matter because the fans are going to buy it. Anyway, it's like that's kind of what wwe has been

Uh horizon world horizon world  Mark is horizon world as uh as the twitterverse said 10 billion dollars for that really  Uh, but before we do that and I am so glad to have you guys as my my panel today owen thomas  From protocol from consumer reports nicholas de le√≥n  And the wonderful jason heiner from cdnet  I do want to talk about our sponsor for this segment of the show express vpn the only vpn I use  The only vpn I trust  When you go to the bathroom you close the door behind you, right? They always say oh well, you know, I have nothing to hide  You close the bathroom door. You have something to hide. You don't want random passerbys looking in saying hey  So so why would you let somebody watch you online?  Using the internet without express vpn is like going to the bathroom and not closing the door  Uh, and i'll tell you why your internet service provider  They know every site you're going to when you do a google search. They know they say oh hi leo  Sure, let me record all the things you search for because our advertisers would love to know that  and worse lately we're seeing  governments buy that information from  Data brokers from third parties  Uh subpoena internet information from isps and uh sites like facebook  Uh, you can get a lot of trouble for the stuff you're doing  In fact, we've got a story coming up in just a little bit how google turned a guy's service off  uh  Express vpn can put a stop to this it creates a secure encrypted tunnel between your device  And the internet so that your online activity can't be seen by anyone ad companies tech giants the government  You can use it on your devices. There was just an article about uh, how uh,  There's no point using a vpn on ios because apple has cleverly designed ios to leak  To leak data around your vpn  Well, there are ways in fact to use express vpn on ios and prevent that but even better put it on your router  Then it doesn't matter what your iphone does everybody in the house is protected express vpn goes on every device  many routers  Smart tvs phones tablets desktops, of course  You can protect everybody in your home. It's as easy as closing the bathroom door  You fire up the app you click a button you're protected because they have servers all over the world. The performance is superior  And let me emphasize this because I think it's important to know  It's important to choose the right vpn provider because yeah, sure the vpn is protecting you from your isp  But then they see everything the isp would see right?  So you've got to find a vpn provider that cares about your privacy as much as you do express vpn does it was just a great article  Um about how express does what they do. They have a custom version of debian the linux  distro that refreshes itself  Every day so everything's wiped off when you use the express vpn it fires up  There's their trusted server  in ram  Sandbox so it can't write to the hard drive and as soon as you leave it goes away  And so does every trace of your visit they do everything possible to protect your privacy  No government even if they seize the servers without a warrant as happens sometimes not in this country  But in other countries no government can see what you've been doing with express vpn and we know that too from many news stories  about governments  Seizing the servers finding nothing on them. So very important number one vpn  According to mashable the verge countless others the only one I use  If you want to protect your privacy if you think your online activity should be your business and no one else is go to express  vpn.com slash twit today  exp re ss vpn dot com please use the slash twit  So they know you saw it here and as as a thank you  You'll get an extra three months free with your one-year plan. That's the best deal less than seven bucks a month  And you do want to pay for a vpn because you want to be the customer right not the product express vpn  Dot com slash twit.

Metaverse and then they have quietly  Partnered with pixar and apple there you go  and so  If apple does a headset, you know worst kept secret in tech world, you know in january or somewhere around there  You know, perhaps it's built on this this platform  So that that's interesting. I I do I do agree that people have  uh  Lock in fatigue.

Um, you know at least initially to have an experience that they're really interested in  I think that's why you can argue that maybe  Apple arcade which has been moderately successful for apple  Why it hasn't perhaps been more successful is it's it's never had that one must play  Experience that a lot of people want to go there for even though I think they've taken some swings at that  I think it'll be the same for the metaverse too. Like it's a it's a hits  It's a hits-based business and until there's something that a lot of people  Want to go there and do it'll be it'll it probably won't see much action.

Transcript:  Yeah, that's interesting  Um, all right  Real news real stories. How about this one?  Uh new york times this morning  Uh, wow, what a story  Um, it starts with a young father  who uh has a child who's not feeling at all well  Uh, they call the doctor  The doctor says, oh, what's the problem he says well, you know, you know, there's some swelling in his intimate parts  The doctor says well, uh, send me a picture cashmere hill  Uh had the story  This was a friday night in february of 2021  Uh, the nurse said send photos so the doctor can review them mark's wife as happens by the way all the time, especially during covet  Uh mark's wife grabbed her husband's phone texted a few high quality close-ups of their son's  A groin area to her iphone so she could upload them to the health care provider's messaging system  Uh in one of them mark's hand was visible helping to better display the swelling  That was that with help from the photos the doctor diagnosed the issue prescribed antibiotics the kid's feeling much better. However  However a couple of days later  Uh, his gmail account is shut down  He's a google file user he loses his not only his email but his phone number  It turns out his android camera had backed up his photos to the google cloud google's c-sam child sexual abuse materials  scanner  Automatedly  Recognized it sent it to nick mick the national center for missing and exploited children  Nick mick, of course, it didn't wrap it didn't match anything in their existing database  So they had a human look at it human said yeah, that's c-sam  And google immediately took down his account  Because of quote harmful content that was a quote severe violation of google's policies and might be illegal furthermore. They referred  His name to the san francisco police department  It's kind of ironic because the father was a software engineer  Working on an automated tool for taking down video content flagged by users is problematic  Who better?  You know to understand how this worked. He filled out a form requesting a review of google's decision explaining what had happened  Google said no  That's it your responded we are not going to reinstate the account no further explanation  What he did not know is the sfpd had started an investigation  The sfpd eventually cleared him. In fact, he received in the mail  Uh a manila envelope in december. So this started in february. So eight months nine months later. He got a  Manila actually ten months later. He got a manila envelope in the mail from the sfpd with a letter saying  You've been investigated copies of the search warrant were in there served on google and his isp  They got everything an investigator whose contact information was provided  Got mark's internet searches his local location history his messages any documents  Photos and videos he'd stored with google  Uh, the investigator at least was intelligent enough to look at it and say yeah. No, I understand what happened  I determined this is the quote in the report. I determined the incident did not meet the elements of a crime. No crime occurred  So the father sent this back to google saying can I have my account back google said no  His account was permanently deleted as was his fine number  So he lost his emails lost his fine number lost all the documents lost all the photos everything stored on google  He says I spoke to a lawyer about suing how much it would cost. He says I decided it wasn't worth the seven thousand bucks  I would have had to give the  attorney  Look no one supports child pornography or or child sexual abuse of material  But this is exactly the problem when apple proposed this that that eff and others pointed out this this false positive  That can have a devastating effect  on your life even  Even if you prove if you provide evidence that there was nothing going on wrong  His decade-old google account going on  He was a paying user of google's web services gone and you know, this is the most humiliating he now has to use hotmail for his email address  I'm being silly isn't it? It's it's horrible. It's horrible  The irony is that the san francisco police department is being more helpful than google. They have a copy of one of the parents

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That cashmereville wrote about in this article  Of his google account and they're trying to get it trying to get that data back to him  Which again is more than google is doing. I think you know  This may be a case where regulation is called for where if you can  You know get cleared by a police department or other law enforcement agency in an investigation and present that evidence  You know google should not be able to  Make a determination that's you know above and beyond what the police have found that that seems  You know that seems like google appointing itself as the police  Yeah, it's kind of sad you have to go to the san francisco police department and say can I have my data?  Because google won't give it to me

Start time: 3848.12
End time: 3854.26

Remember when you take pictures on your device, whether it's an iphone or an android phone  You may well be uploading it to servers where it's going to be scanned  And in fact as soon as google saw that they scanned everything else  They went through everything he had on the google servers  And i'm sure apple would do exactly the same thing  Yeah, there there are companies go ahead jason and then and then owen

Transcript:  I was just going to say there are a couple takeaways from this one is just what you said leo like  You have to be really thoughtful about you know photos that you take. Um for for that reason, um  And and I think the other is that this is the kind of thing when these companies  You know act and and don't have a good system for appeals  or a sort of a rational  System for for appealing what is clearly  um a mistaken  uh a bad filter  Uh, and i've been a part of this I could I could tell a story about it  That was kind of just ridiculous on its face with youtube  um, but this is where there's so much so many calls for regulation because this is again where like  institutions running over individuals  Uh, this is where you start to run into people really having the sense that we need to regulate big tech companies  Because they control so much of the universe now  and so there has to be guardrails put in place so that they can't just  um act with impunity do these things to to individuals that have real effects on their lives and then have be  Completely flip about not having a good appeals process for them if they are flagged, you know falsely

Transcript:  So it's interesting i'm watching the chat room and some people in the chat room saying well he did that  Uh, it's illegal what he did and google had the right to go through it. Perhaps they agree that google should restore it now  But but nothing google did was was inappropriate. I disagree  I mean the government couldn't do this  uh without warrants  So that the police department had to get warrants. They had to go to a court. They had to go to a judge  They did all that google didn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That it wasn't a crime. It wasn't a crime and I can tell you right now. I mean i've said  Well, maybe I shouldn't talk about this, but it's not it's not unusual for a doctor to say send me pictures  Uh, especially during covet. This was standard practice  Um  I don't know what you're supposed to do as a parent and it's appalling

Start time: 4022.36
End time: 4062.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think actually there is an opportunity for uh, you know for doctors to create maybe secure, you know  regulated, uh apps that are like single purpose and their safety like  the image never gets stored on a  Server except one that the doctor has access to it's auto deleted after the doctor reviews it  you know, I think I think actually there's some smart technology that could be applied to like  this specific scenario  um, but I think there's also some  some logic to saying  Just bring the kid into the doctor, you know, even if the doc, you know, uh, even if the doctor says oh  Just take a photo like no

Start time: 4064.16
End time: 4117.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, or video maybe do but I know that there are some of these these like cm emr systems  That now have these like encrypted video chat or photo upload which is likely related to some of these  reasons, uh, but I also wonder too like  There's all kinds of opportunities for false positives. What if you're taking a you know  Baby's first bath and you're giving it the kid of absolutely  And you take a photo and you you send it to the grandparents, right?  You can imagine a scenario tons of scenarios like that. Maybe their algorithms are smart enough to know the difference of that  Because I I have to think that's likely very common  but but it still sort of raises the question of like could that become a case where you're um, you know, uh,  Have a false positive for child exploitation. Yeah

Transcript:  Uh to me it's a strong argument against using automated tools for this. I understand. There's a problem with child pornography  I don't know how widespread it is last year google filed six hundred thousand  six hundred thousand reports of child abuse material and disabled the accounts of  270,000 users  Are all 270,000 people?  child pornographers  If it's that widespread, I guess we've got a problem I don't think it is  um  Wow, I just uh, I understand these companies would far rather  Cut off let's say a hundred thousand people  wrongly  Then be pilloried in the press for uh, you know allowing child pornographers  to exist but in fact  I have a feeling there's quite a bit of underground child pornography being circulated on these servers  that uh  They're they're not effectively getting rid of it's just just shocking to me

It will not restate reinstate the account. No further explanation  That is that is a stock response of course child sexual abuse is material is abhorrent that's not what this was

Transcript:  Maybe you want to tell your readers  to stay away  You mentioned your packard bell machine  Yes, you might want to  stay away from laptops from  well a variety of  companies  But older windows xp laptops  Uh  This is from a post by uh raymond chen who was a microsoft chief software engineer  The story of what happens when those older laptops?  Play the music video for janet jackson's rhythm nation now. I would play it but youtube immediately take us down  So i'll just leave that as an exercise for the listener  A major computer manufacturer probably packard bell i'm thinking  Uh, I don't know i'm just saying uh discovered that when you were such a bad computer it was such a bad computer  I wouldn't be surprised. Let's put it that way. Yeah  That when you play rhythm nation certain models of their laptop would crash  And they couldn't figure out why  um  So it also crashed the competitors laptops eventually they figured out what's in common. Oh  It's this particular model of 5400 rpm laptop hard drives  The song has a resonant frequency  That causes a vibration in the drive  That causes it to come to crash  So this manufacturer fixed it by putting in a filter in the audio pipeline that removes that frequency  I don't know if that made rhythm nation sound terrible, but uh  uh  And then uh, he he mentions also  a similar situation that happened  Uh with another laptop  And and resonance  A microsoft developer revealed that playing the game 101 monochrome mazes. I don't remember this one  Would reliably crash the machine  Because the speaker trace  Was so close to the reset trace when it got vibrating would reset the computer  So  If you know what it's so funny because these are such old computers, but I bet you there are people listening and go  Yeah, I I never could play that game. I thought it was something wrong in the game  um  Wow  Wow, so so I would love right now to play rhythm nation and see if any of your computers crash  But let's hope you are not  Still using windows xp raymond chen  Posting at uh microsoft blog the old new thing  I love it when these guys tell anecdotes from the you probably couldn't tell the story then  Because it would have looked bad for that company, but now it's okay  Uh, we mentioned that tonight is the house of dragons.

We will talk lots more to time. We haven't even gotten some of the biggest stories of the week  I can't believe it.

I hope you will use a more modern  a little chubby in the old days and  Maybe you don't want to bring that one back  In fact, you know, maybe wait a little bit i'll get even thinner neum is my secret  I've been on every day, you know anybody's followed our shows. I'm always talking about the latest diet  Finally, I got tired of dieting but more than a year ago  I told my wife I said lisa I want to do neum  And uh because i'd seen the ads as you probably have and I thought this might be a better idea. It's not a diet  It's about learning what triggers you to eat why you eat what you eat and all of that. There are no bad foods  There's no restrictions neum is about learning  So that you eat more healthily and as a result perhaps lose weight  So lisa said okay a couple of days later. Let me do it too. I only have a little bit to lose  Lisa is now on the lifetime maintenance plan. She lost all the weight. She looks  fantastic  Uh, I lost about 20 pounds. She she didn't have much to lose. I think she lost 10 pounds, but she's kept it off  It's amazing neum weight  Is a psychology first approach  It's designed to help you build more sustainable habits and behaviors with lasting results and it's true  In fact on the cruise there was a guy in our chat who I love I won't name names because I don't want to embarrass him  But I I love this guy and uh, I was really looking forward to seeing him on the cruise and he wasn't there  I couldn't find him  I put on discord. I said, where are you?  He said i'm right here  I didn't recognize him because he'd lost 60 pounds since I saw him last  And I said, what did you do? He said no  I said it worked. He said I loved it. He's kept it off  Neither of us gained weight on the cruise actually lisa lost a pound. I don't know how she did that  But that's saying a lot you go on a cruise where there's 18 meals a day and you don't gain weight neum because I learned  Why I eat how I eat i'm a fog eater  I I don't even notice the food i'm putting in my mouth  So neum helped me with their lessons to pay attention to every bite  to to turn off the tv put down the phone and focus and chew and eat and I  My meals are more enjoyable  And I don't eat in a fog anymore to date neum weight  Has helped more than 3.6 million people lose weight including lisa and me every journey is different  And that's neat lisa's lessons were different than mine. They're always personalized to you your goals  It's based on scientific principles well-known  Technologies like cbt cognitive behavioral therapy  That help you understand your relationship with food. So there's no bad foods. There's no restrictions  Whether your health whatever your health goals are. It's a flexible non-restrictive  Program that focuses on pro progress instead of perfection and you get to do it the way you want to do it  Choose your level of support from five-minute daily check-ins personal coaching  You get a group if you want to participate in  Uh, you get a coach  You get an app a fantastic app on ios and android  days off  Fine  They even tell you actually sometimes they'll say you've done so well celebrate today  You know have some fun eat a piece of cheesecake. It's okay  And no matter what happens neum always helps you get back on track active numbers lose an average of 15 pounds in 16 weeks  I lost more  95 percent of customers say neum weight is a good long-term solution absolutely validates that  They've published more than 30 peer-reviewed scientific articles to inform their users and practitioners and scientists about their methods about their effectiveness  It really really works.

This is just  incredibly nuanced and specific and you know, they're they're feel it feels like there's a strategy and a goal that is  more than just like  beat up china like the u.s administration is  thinking, you know, what's  What do we want to accomplish here?

Transcript:  You know, yeah, I don't want to verge to the red scare mentality of the 50s  But at the same time I understand this is a very subtle diplomatic game and sometimes you have to exert pressure. Maybe that's how  The biden administration is exerting pressure. I don't think the tariffs that the trump administration  Used were a very good or effective tool  They hurt us more than they hurt china, frankly  Um, there's but I also think it's so important what we do. I don't want to get in a situation  Where we're at odds  We sort of are right, but let's let's maybe  Tamp it down a little bit  um  I think for instance, I don't know if if we'd had stronger economic ties with russia  Uh, would they have been so uh apt to invade ukraine and and if we did then our sanctions would have been more effective  Etc, etc  I don't know. I'm not an expert on this kind of thing. I just I worry that we if we get too knee-jerk in our response  Everybody is at risk

Transcript:  Everybody loses. Yeah, and we are the the u.s. Economy is so interdependent with china and vice versa  and and the  moves to  separate, you know or to  uh wall off  Is not going to be helpful or or useful now there there is still competition between the two there  There likely will be it's the number one and two economies in the world  um, there there's going to be competition for tech and uh and for  uh, just innovation in general uh as part of this but  you're going to see things like I I think  Keeping technology out of the hands of the chinese unless it has some kind of you're worried about them  um doing something that is  uh, yeah, it is  going to be  Used destructively against someone else  Doesn't necessarily seem like the the best uh idea now at the same time you have china  saying um recently that all of this american like the u.s chips act  Uh was uh anti-competitive. Yeah for global competition. It was

Transcript:  And but but it won in ultimately what the chip what that chips act was  in  Its core was a response to what china and taiwan and south korea  Have already been doing with their chip manufacturers for years for decades  And that the u.s has fallen behind because they haven't made this a friendly environment for those for companies to operate those  Uh kind of chip making facilities here and so they're behind it's going to take you know, five  years at least for the u.s to catch up even with the the chips act and so  you know some of these things are all of that is just to say that some of these things are  Uh stuff that happens  Um that you you know try to win the the war of rhetoric when in fact, it's just really good  There's a lot of really intense competition for things that are gonna, uh, you know shape the future of the economy the future of innovation  And so it's not a bad thing that these companies have  You know are are sort of elbowing each other to to move forward and and compete with each other  We just need to make sure our elbows aren't too sharp.

Employers are closely monitoring their employees  Break time bathroom time and so forth and now they're doing it in schools with something called e hall pass  A digital system that students have to use to request to leave their classroom which notes how long they've been away  It's being used widely in a thousand schools in the united states  Uh very much like the tool used to monitor amazon employees  Oh, I I don't know if I like this idea or not  I don't like it.
