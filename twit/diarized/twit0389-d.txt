That's not to talk about it.  Yeah, I know. I'm sure you're  dying. We'll get into all of  that in a little bit. But first,  we want to go to New Zealand  because that's where Paul  Spain is. He is on the NZ  podcast. He also is writing  this up for Mashable because  he's covering the biggest  website launch in some time.  Kim dot coms mega launched  yesterday. Hi, Paul. Hi. How  you doing? It was exactly one  year ago that mega upload was  shut down. The servers were  confiscated by the feds and  Kim dot com was arrested. He  still has not been extradited.  Right. He's still in New  Zealand, I think. What's the  latest on on his case? So his

Start time: 282.41
End time: 298.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  extradition has been pushed out  to later in the year, probably  September at this stage. So  he's got plenty of time to to  kill before any chance that he  has to face his accusers in the  U. S., which I guess is the  reason why he's started a new

Start time: 299.54
End time: 334.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  business. Why not? The United  States Department of Justice,  of course, shut down mega upload  claiming it was a haven for  piracy. The DOJ statement in  the case a year ago was that  this action is among the  largest criminal copyright  cases ever brought by the  United States and directly  targets the misuse of a public  content storage and  distribution site to commit and  facilitate intellectual  property crime. Kim dot com  didn't help the case much  because he was somewhat of a  flamboyant character. Doesn't  he have a car with a license

Start time: 334.88
End time: 366.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  plate gangster? Yeah, he's got  a one with we had a number of  license plates like that, you  know, evil. He had one with  said police on it. So yeah,  yeah, he's a bit of a  character, but it's I guess  it's sort of unclear really  how how people feel feel about  him. There seems to be really  sort of mixed opinions here in  New Zealand. I imagine it's the  same all around the world.  Yeah, well, there were a lot of

Start time: 366.82
End time: 396.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  people upset about mega upload  shutdown because they had  legitimate files on the site.  It was a file sharing site. It  wasn't up. It wasn't intended  to be a piracy. So maybe it  was, but people treated it like  a like Dropbox or another file  sharing site and had legitimate  stuff there which they lost  access to because the feds took  all the servers. So Kim has  launched a new business. Tell us  about mega launched like it was  like it was D DOS practically by  people trying to sign up. Yeah,

Start time: 397.35
End time: 426.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  they had within the first two  hours, there was a quarter of a  million sign ups is what we're  told. And by by the time of the  press conference in the evening,  there was some 500,000 members  to the new mega dot co dot NZ  website. But there it's been  very patchy in terms of access  to the site. And even you know,  even today trying to access it,  many people have found that that  they just can't reach the site.  You know, he's he's a showman,

Start time: 426.34
End time: 456.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  obviously, and instead of calling  this well, the mega is called  the privacy company, which is  kind of obviously a play on  piracy. Bigger, better, faster,  stronger, safer, I'm surprised he  doesn't say sexier. Is is this  who's signing up? And is it  because they are desperate to  become members of this or  because they just want to  participate in what is  obviously a pretty big show?

Start time: 457.83
End time: 545.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it is a big show. And Kim  has a huge following around  the world. And he's had a  massive amount of media  attention really in the last few  months. And in fact, he said  yesterday that that, you know,  New Zealanders are probably sick  of all the media attention he's  had. And following this launch,  he's going to be pretty quiet up  until up until his extradition  hearing. But he's certainly been  playing on on the notoriety that  he that he's gained through  through his arrest last year and  the raid on the dot co dot  com mansion, which in fact, they  they they they played out a  dramatized version of of that  raid last night for the launch.  So there was a helicopter that  swirled in. There were men  clothed in black with automatic  weapons that that abseiled off  the roof of of the the house and  and then sort of circled around  the the audience. So it was a  pretty entertaining spectacle.  I've got to say. Did you go?  Yeah, we we had a smaller time.  We were the small group session  that that they had for a few  media in the afternoon. There  were about 10 of us. They got to  spend some time directly with  with Kim asking him asking him a  range of questions. And then  they had the broader event in the  evening where there were  probably two or 300 people in  attendance. I don't want to

Transcript:  monopolize Paul. So Andy or  Joanna, I'm going to go to  Joanna or Dwight if you have  questions you'd like to ask.  We've got a man on the ground at  the dot com mansion. He's not in  custody right now. Is he is he  just walking about? Yeah, he's

Start time: 562.06
End time: 603.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  been he's been producing music.  He's been obviously working on  on on this new business venture  with a number of number of  partners and including his three  co accused. And he's found a  number of people to fund this  because most of his funds have  gone up due to what's going on.  Most of his assets were were  seized. Apparently some 100 plus  million dollars worth worth of  assets. So you know he's had to  get outside investors and and he  seems to have a few friends  about the place that helped him  pay his pay his rent whilst he  was in in jail. And some of  those people have have come to  the party and supporting this

Start time: 603.88
End time: 620.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  new endeavor. Paul has the have  the either the the U.S.  authorities or the New Zealand  authorities had anything to say  about mega? Have they basically  said you better watch your step  pal or had anything at all where  they've since he said you look  like you're doing the exact same

Start time: 622.67
End time: 649.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  thing you did before? They  haven't heard any comment at all.  It's possibly too soon for that.  But you know what's come from  from his legal team is that that  this has been the most you know  scrutinized business venture  tech launch in history from a  from a legal perspective and and  they believe that they're you  know they're squeaky clean as  far as stepping over any any  legal lines. Is this guy part of

Start time: 652.78
End time: 671.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  like the pantheon of like the  cast of characters we all know  who are tech CEOs and do things  or is he just like oh there in  New Zealand just thought of oh  well people who are into tech  know of this thing that's  happening on their soil and I  don't know otherwise regular  people don't care. Is he a

Start time: 671.74
End time: 705.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  personality over there? Yeah he  is. I mean he's had just so much  media coverage over the last few  months that everyone knows who  he is. You know to the point  where there are certainly people  that have been saying we are  sick of seeing and hearing about  Kim.com. You know he's he's  been he's had enough time in the  limelight. Yeah so but but  there's another group that are  that are just very excited about  this and you know we're very  very quick to to sign up for the  site obviously with with those  others around the world. Of  course 50 gigabytes of free

Start time: 706.80
End time: 709.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 709.74
End time: 730.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  John. That's my question is do  you really think this this  service has a real shot given I  mean it's a very compelling deal  right 50 gigs free 999 or 9 9  euros a month for 500 and get  500 gigs I mean crazy deal and I  would assume consumers would be  interested but given the history  of the service why would anyone  trust their files on this kind

Start time: 731.59
End time: 777.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  of service. Well I think that  trust their files on the service  because they first you know  first and foremost they love  Doc Kim dot com they love you  know what he stands for in terms  of Internet freedom and free  file sharing and so on. So  there's that audience that I  think will sign up yet straight  away and you know I guess we  have to just wait and see to how  the service performs how long it  takes for all the other  affordable apps to appear on  smartphones on Windows and Mac  and Linux and so on. You know  there's a lot that's been  promised down the track. He also  showed off yesterday on on  Twitter the mega movie service  which they had started  developing ahead of his arrest  and they detailed the mega key  which itself is somewhat

Start time: 779.50
End time: 794.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  controversial. You know I've  tried been trying to sign up  since we began the show and I  think it's not easy at all.  It's not easy to get an account  at this point. The service are  well overwhelmed and it's  interesting he really is a is  you're right. He's a post

Start time: 813.38
End time: 820.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  probably will. I mean I'm still  in the middle of the show  right. What is the New Zealand  government's attitude toward  Kim dot com Paul. Well there's

Start time: 821.38
End time: 883.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  been some some some  controversy there too and  because the the New Zealand  spy agency the G. C. S. B. was  was actually spying on Kim dot  com and they're there you know  by law are only allowed to spy  on people that are not not  citizens and as it happened  they had already become a  resident at at the stage that  they were spying so they had  they had well overstepped their  mark and you know the the  prime minister had been  alerted to to to to some of  this activity. I don't you know  I don't think anyone anyone  maybe joined the dots and  realized that he was a resident  at the time but yeah there's  been certainly been a lot of  comments that the prime  minister is forgetful around  some of the things that he  heard and and has has made some  statements that have probably  got him into a little bit of  hot water around the situation

Start time: 884.40
End time: 921.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kim dot com's career is  somewhat checkered he's  actually German citizen a young  Internet tycoon who was later  convicted of embezzlement went  to New Zealand and has the when  the mega mansion is in fact a  mega mansion. It's a beautiful  place so he's obviously  made some money. The assets  the CNN says the assets that  were served as as price seized  in this action including the  servers in Virginia and  Washington DC were worth 50  million dollars is is is this  was his money all made  legitimately through mega  upload. Well I guess that comes

Start time: 921.28
End time: 937.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  down to you know whether you  believe that point of view  upload is legitimate or not.  You know I you know I don't  think there's any any question  that there was there was a lot  of you know sharing of of  copyrighted content. You can

Start time: 937.26
End time: 943.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  probably say that on Dropbox  and any other site is whether  they they encouraged it and  what they did about it I guess  right. Well I guess from the

Start time: 944.66
End time: 1021.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  encouragement side you know  what they did was you know they  incentivized you know people to  have their content downloaded.  So if you uploaded something  and you know and it was and it  was downloaded a lot then then  then there was some some  incentives. Now interestingly  you know what one of the  limitations around that was  that the files had to be under  100 megs for you to receive  that incentive. So Kim dot com  made it made a point of that  from the stage yesterday and  saying well you know it's  ridiculous that people would  would accuse us of using this  to distribute movies because  and incentivizing that because  the files were too small. But  actually what happened is that  the files were broken down and  people would break them down to  be under that 100 megs into a  into a few pieces and those  files would be would be you  know rad and so then they would  join those files up together  after after downloading them.  So yeah that particular  statement probably doesn't put  you know Kim dot com in a  particularly good good light  because he knew that those that  use the service knew that yeah  he wasn't really a good  person but he was really

Start time: 1022.12
End time: 1058.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  sharing the full story shall we  say. You may remember just  shortly before they were shut  down the controversy over the  song the mega upload dot com song  that had P Diddy and Chris  Brown a lot of celebrities a  lot of musicians performing on  the song and then their record  labels complained saying we  didn't we didn't give them  permission the song got pulled  down and put back up and pulled  down and put back up. It's  currently up right now. It  sounds like artists like mega  upload because it was a great  distribution facility for them  but their record labels didn't  like it so much because they  feared they were losing revenue

Start time: 1060.71
End time: 1063.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  or would you use it to  distribute podcasts. Sure if

Start time: 1064.10
End time: 1087.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  yeah if the price is right yeah  why not and that's the point is  that they're just as maybe there  is piracy maybe even encourage  it but it's also used for  legitimate files as well. Does  he did he say anything  yesterday about attempting to  make the new mega more  copyright friendly. No.

Start time: 1088.20
End time: 1136.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think he said he said all he  said all the right things you  know that they were legal he  said that there were takedown  processes and so on so yeah he  said the right things but he  didn't I guess suggest that  they would be any more you know  restrictive on copyrighted  content than what you know  mega upload dot com was now the  other point I'm not sure we've  discussed yet is that the big  differentiator for this site  from from his perspective is  that it encrypts all the  content that goes online so  they can't actually look you  know the files that sit on the  servers are encrypted so  somebody would have that would  have direct access to the  servers does not have access to  the content without the  encryption keys.

Transcript:  interesting things is about this  is the bandwidth sufficient I  mean yeah he's got you know is  this a rush but if he's offering  50 gigabytes free and you know  500 gigabytes of bandwidth  for a relatively low price and  it's doing this right now is  this is he going to have the  bandwidth to handle the the size  of the content that's going to  be uploaded downloaded from here

Start time: 1207.63
End time: 1240.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  yeah yeah there's so many weak  points here that they could  pinch him off and his money  supply they can pinch him off in  bandwidth they can pitch him off  in server location. I'm  wondering how long it's going to  be before people think that  people will have confidence that  mega upload is going to be here  a year from now because one of  the great things about sky drive  drop box and all those other  services is that you know that  if you put a file there Amazon is  probably not going away Google  also likely not going away anytime  the next two or three years and  you won't find yourself with 40  50 gigabytes worth of data that  suddenly is now locked up by the  Justice Department.

Transcript:  name? One a. Lenni Kaku. Ladies  and gentlemen. Yeah. ABC News  dot com. In the flesh in the  flesh. And we're brought to you  today by our friends at stamps  dot com. You don't have to go  to the post office anymore. I  give you permission to stay  home and print your own postage.  Sounds like something Kim dot  com might have thought up. But  no. In fact, it's completely  legal. It's stamps dot com. All  you need is your printer, your  computer and account with  stamps dot com. You print the  postage you need. You know the  I didn't know this, but they  said the poster rates are going  up. It's like they need more  stamps. What? So anyway, it's  not that, but you don't have to  get new stamps now. You just  stamps dot com automatically  updates unlike a postage meter  automatically updates the  rates. In fact, our free trial  gives you a nice little scale  that you can plop your letter or  package on. It's a USB scale.

What about  the worst name you could give  anything?  There's no human besides those of  us in the industry know what a  social graph is.  Andy, what is Facebook's social  graph search? I'll let you  define it.  Well, we're asked before they

Start time: 1503.82

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  had sort of a lame search  feature that was about as full  featured as what you'd find on a  word processor in 1991. Now the  idea is to make sure that no  matter what's happening, no  matter what's been posted  publicly anywhere in the  Facebook world, that you can  find it.  So the idea is to make sure  that no matter what's happening  in the Facebook world, not only  is it searchable and findable  but also it's a search method  that will also understand  connections between all that  data.  So it's not just for seeing  what happened in last week's  issue of Fantastic Four and  what are people talking about  it.  It's also good for things like  show me and this is almost the  natural language input of this.  Show me restaurants in New York  City that have been liked by  people.  Show me restaurants in a place  that's not just a random  location but here's a  restaurant that some of my  friends have actually liked and  you can get access to the  information.  And it's very, very wide and  broad because you might  immediately start thinking  about it as I want to be able  to get valuable information  from all the data that my  friends are putting in.  But it's also things like give  me a list of alumni of  University of Massachusetts who  now work for Pixar and that  will give you a list of people  that you can say hey, fellow  alumni, give me a job and hit  people up that way.  And I think it's very telling  though that so much of  Zuckerberg's pitch during this  event was saying that it's not  going to be whatever we will  obey.  The search feature is going to  obey whatever privacy controls  you've already set.  So it's not as though a picture  or a like or something you've  written that is only supposed  to be available to your  friends will be visible to  people outside of your circle  of friends or outside of your  family.  On the other hand, it really  does open things up to a much  wider public space.  So I think that's a potential  for exploitation now because  what if it's even if Facebook's  claims of their user base is  halfway true, that would be one  person for every one Facebook  user for every 14 human beings  on this planet.  And if you were trying to sell  anything to anybody, oh, boy,  you just got the Cadbury, an  eight-pound Cadbury cream egg  just delivered right to your  doorstep from Facebook.  So if I think that my own opinion  is that if this were Apple, we  would have a lot of money to  make this, but if this is  interesting feature, a long time  coming, if it were Google, we  think obviously they're going to  make a lot of money out of this  but they're probably going to  deliver a service that's going  to be profoundly useful because  they like to integrate things  from all the Internet at once.  With Facebook, you're like, oh  man, how are they going to make  how are they going to turn this  into a way to make sure that  they take more and more data  from us than we ever intend to  give up.  And how is this going to wind up  being something bad that makes  me regret being a member of  Facebook and we're going to have  to find out what that's going to

Transcript:  Is that what it comes down to,  Joanna?  I'll let Joanna talk for a  minute.  Let me tell you, Andy said  pretty much everything I was  going to say.  I actually think the service is  really useful.  I've got it and it's so much  more powerful than the old  search crap that they had.  So I'm able to find people  faster, able to find, I was  working on a story last week  which is easier to find  information on there.  Of course, I think there's so  much distrust in Facebook that  people's reactions to this were  oh, my God, how are they going  to start making money off of  me?  Oh, I have to go back and check  all my information.  And I wrote a story this week  just basic stuff, go back and  check what you've liked.  Because you might have liked  stuff 10 years ago on Facebook  or ever long, you know, you  started on Facebook.  For me, it was in college.  You like something.  Even I said in my article,  like, let's say you liked  something weed back in college.  Now you're able to surface that  information.  That information is somebody  goes to search for people who  like weed and your name comes  up.  So I think there's a lot of,  yes, Zuckerberg said this  respects all of the privacy  concerns that anyone can have.  It respects all the privacy  settings that we have, but it  also opens it up so much more as  Andy said.  One thing I think they changed,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  That happened about a month ago  where they turned it off, and  this was before anybody knew  that social graph search was  coming.  And so now you simply, you know,  you can't walk away from it.  But I don't recall if they said  when they stopped that feature,  if you had had disabled search,  are you grandfathered in?  So those people who had said I  don't want to be part of search  that they get to stay.

Transcript:  What's certainly the case is  that everybody should start  looking at their settings, their  privacy settings in Facebook,  and make sure that you are, you  know, blocking, because it does  at least obey those, right?  So if...  Yeah.  But any like is, Joanna, are all  likes inherently public?

Start time: 1802.24
End time: 1822.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  I'm pretty sure all likes are  public.  I think you can go back and, I  mean, if you, I don't know if  you go to a like, when you go to  that like page, if you can share  that just with your friends, I  think that's going to depend on  like who can see your profile.  Is it just your friends?  Is it public?  So that's all part of that.

Start time: 1836.10
End time: 1856.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's also a question of just  how good the data that the  graph search will have to work  with.  So for example, a lot of people  will like a brand or like a page  in order to be entered into a  contest.  They don't necessarily actually  like it, but they want to get  something from that brand and  then they are stuck indicating  that they like this page, you  know, so you...  Well, you're not stuck because

You know, if the stuff doesn't  constantly show up in your feed  and you're not annoyed by it and  that can happen, then suddenly  you're, you know, the  information that you have is  what you like doesn't actually  reflect what you really like or  what you really adore.  So you should go to your

Start time: 1876.30
End time: 1911.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  timeline, go to your likes.  I do this kind of fairly  frequently and now they  organize them by year.  So you can go back in time and  see what you liked in 2008,  2009, 2010, 2011.  And I liked Amazon.  I liked...  I don't even know who this is.  I don't know who they are.  Watch it post social reader  doesn't exist anymore.  Apparently there's a page  called Leo Laporte's shirts.  I do like that.  So yeah, I don't remember  liking a lot of this stuff.  It might be really a good idea  to go through these and take  them off because this is part of  the search, right?  Yeah, that's exactly what I

But then someone goes and  searches, let's say you're  looking for a job or whatever  the case may be and you come  up in that search, it's not a  very good thing.  So, you know, one of my  suggestions was like definitely  go through your likes.  Also make sure to set your  preferences to only friends.  You know, when you have that  little box, when you share  your status, it defaults to  friends, but make sure you  haven't switched it to public  and then you're sharing  everything public.  But definitely go through your  likes.  Yeah, good luck.  I know that.  I spent time doing that this

Transcript:  Well, I think as with this,  with the advent of this  feature, people, if they're  smart, will pay attention when  they like something.  I think it could change the  behavior of what people do on  Facebook, which I think is  what Facebook wants.  I mean, they ultimately want  the data that's being pulled  into this graph search to be  of higher quality.  So you're apt to now click on  things that you actually  want to see.  So you're apt to now click on  things that you actually  want to see.  So you're apt to now click on  things that you actually  want to see.

Here's how we know who  anti-United States is.  Here's how we know who  Andy Natko is.  He doesn't want to post  anything on Facebook.  And the worry, and this might  be getting uncomfortably close  to the margin of paranoia, but  if you are competing very, very  aggressively with three or four  other candidates for a job and  whoever's doing the screening  can feel as though they can get  a very complete picture from  three of them because of their  Facebook activity and you're  more of a cipher, maybe that's  at least going to take five  points off of your final score  and if that's enough to deny  you a job, then you're going to  get a job.

As opposed to having it like  me, I have a Facebook account  and I access it maybe every  week or two, chiefly just to  read the status updates of my  nieces and nephews, all this  I talk to my family, but it's  not as though I'm going to call  them every other day to find  out, hey, did you do it?  Did you happen to do a half  marathon last week?  If so, how did you do it?  Is there a picture you can send  me?  But Facebook is good for stuff  like that.  But really for what do I like,  what am I interested in, my  Facebook activity pretty much  leaves me as a cipher.  And so that's suspicious.  Frankly, I think that's...  What do you like?

I work with our journalists who  use social media both in  reporting and in pushing out our  news.  And when the grass roots are  announced, I sent a note to the  staff as soon as I got what it  was and said this is a great  reporter's tool.  And it really is.  In terms of Facebook, probably  should have done something like  this years ago.  You mean for finding sources?  For finding out information  about people you're writing  about.  Joanna mentioned she had done a  story and used it as part of a  story.  And I think every journalist  would be interested in that.  I also am actually a journalist  and I'm interested in that.  I also am active at the  Chronicle in terms of our  marketing and our promotion of  some of the things that we do.  And I can see it on that end  being very useful in terms of  targeting.  I think that will take a while to  kind of sort out for that.  But for journalists, this is a  gold mine, I think.

And if you go look in my Twitter  feed, you can find the link to  the image that shows what it  looks like.  It basically says you have it,  you want to take a tour, and it  gives you some examples.  None of them are like the  Gizmodo examples, but it does  give you some examples.  Let me look at your feed.  I posted one later, and I  posted one later in my feed.  I did Asian restaurants that my  friends like.  And it pulled up several Asian  restaurants that are near me,  some of which I was unaware of.  And so now, you know, I have  some more to try.

And even if I actually did think  it might have something to do  with search, I think it's  something to do with search.  We were all talking about this  at CES last week or two weeks  ago.  What is this event going to be?  And I said, well, maybe search,  but I definitely thought it was  going to have a mobile tie-in.  And there were some really  interesting pieces written last  week, one written by Tim  Carmody at The Verge, you know,  sort of they didn't talk about  mobile at the event, but you  absolutely can see that that is  really the big push with this.  I think it's written, it's  totally going to have a much  bigger mobile tie-in, I think,  than even what you get on the  web right now.  Now, Dwight, I'm looking at

They've ranked it by stars.  You've had the number of people  who checked in the...  It doesn't say how many of your  friends liked it.  No, it just brings it up as the  search.

I mean, I think it's a  question that's going to be  really important.  I mean, I think it's a  question that's going to be  really important.

I see the problems that this  solves for Facebook employees  who want to make sure they can  get their bonuses at the end of  the year.  I just don't see how this helps  like regular people who, if  you've got, even if this were  available on mobile, if you  have an iPhone, Siri can get  you that kind of information  much faster.  If you've got Android, Google  Search and Voice Search can get  you that information much  faster.  Independent apps that have two,  three, four, five years of  pedigree now for giving you not  only just reviews and  information but really fine  grained information about these  places that you want to go.  So I think that I feel as though  I have to write about it again  like six months to a year from  now when people figure out how  to use it and when that unique  graph search flavor starts to  make itself more known.

I think there were some harsh  words, right, last week from  with Eric Schroeder, right,  that they're using Bing as a  platform here.  So I think that's a big  winner.

It might.  You look at Facebook and you're  thinking, okay, this was a  really big desktop web push, but  I do think there's something  really big there going on with  the mobile.  I think all the rumors of the  Facebook phone, I've been  saying, I wrote an editorial  last week saying they're  building this phone right in  front of our face and it might  not even be a hardware phone.  I think we all kind of feel  like it's not.  But they are building the  software and they're turning  our phones into Facebook phones.  And I think this is just another  push in that direction.  And that in itself is a  competition for Google as they  continue to try and push their  social services on the phone.  I mean, it's the war of the  services.  I like Google's strategy in  this.

Transcript:  Google does build phones, but  Google also gets on every other  platform, except maybe Windows  Phone, on the iOS platform by  making great apps that iOS  users use in preference in many  cases to the Apple apps that  come with their phone.  Right.  Facebook is doing exactly what

Transcript:  approach is that Facebook's part  of their strategy is to keep you  inside Facebook as long as  possible.  They are like the casinos that  make sure you can't see outside  the windows, make sure there's a  steakhouse, make sure there's a  hotel, make sure there's Celine  Dion so that you never have a  reason to leave the facility so  that you stay there losing money  to the casino, not to somebody  else, at least of all, cab  driver.  Whereas Google's strategy is  more like we want to make sure  that wherever you're going to  go, we want to make sure that  you're going to be able to  get out of the way.  So we want to make sure that  wherever you're going to  congregate anyway, we're in a  position to help you in a way  that you're going to want to  give us some of your money.  And here money translates into  user data and the social graph.  So it really depends on which  one of these points of view is  more clicked into how people  want to use their services.  Facebook is great because it is  really all there.  There are people who don't  really want to manage multiple  apps.  They don't want to learn about  a new service that just  launched four months ago.  They just want to go to  Facebook every single day to  find out about the  grandchildren, find out about  who they went to high school  with, find out about their  coworkers.  And so long as they're going to  go there anyway, why not just  stay here and again eat at the  steakhouse and see Celine  Delight Dion.

Transcript:  I like Juroko's suggestion.  He says Facebook needs to take  a page out of the Vegas hotels  and start pumping pure oxygen  into their page.  We'll just stay there forever.  It was Stephen Levy of Wired  magazine interviewing Larry  Page.  He asked him, he said, one  place where people say Google  is motivated by competition is  the social realm.  In the past two years you've  been working hard in a field  dominated by a single rival,  Facebook.  That's not the case.  Page says it's not the way I  think about it.  We had real issues with how our  users share information, how  they express their identity and  so on.  That's true.  Google Plus really struggled  with that.  And yeah, Facebook is a company  that's strong in that space,  but they're also doing a really  bad job on their products.  I don't know.  Is that true?

Transcript:  I don't think any of us would  say that Facebook had beautiful  products or has beautiful  products now.  I think we would say that about  some of Google's recent  releases.  But I think Facebook's spending  some time at least focusing on  that.  I think Facebook's, however you  feel about Facebook, they're  clearly doing something right.  They've got a lot of users.  I think we've got to keep

Start time: 2758.76
End time: 2765.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that in mind.  I think the thing that you  mentioned, it's kind of  important that we're all  focused on our own values.  And I think we have to keep  that in mind.

Start time: 2766.85

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So I think Facebook is doing  a really good job on their  products.  Well, if that's where all your  friends are, it really doesn't  care.  It really doesn't matter how  clean the software is and how  easy it is to use.  If that's where all your  family is, all your friends  are, all your coworkers are,  that makes it instantly  attractive.  And all they can do is make  this, grease those rails a  little better.  I don't think that Facebook is  easy to use.  I'm not totally inexperienced  in technology.  And yet I'm still just  routinely baffled by I have a  simple thing.  I want to find out what my  niece is up to.  Last week, I know she had a  game.  I know she's not doing her  best.  But I think that one piece of  information is amongst the  huge scrum of data that it  wants to throw me at me to  distract me is just really,  really difficult.  Maybe social graph search will  make it easier to find this  sort of information.  But no, I would agree that  they aren't very good at  crystallizing what you're  supposed to be here for.  The message from Facebook is  that you're here to stay here.  That's the purpose of you  coming here.  But don't try to come here  with any targeted goal, I  don't think.  Well, and if you look at  Facebook, Facebook just looks

Start time: 2820.03
End time: 2853.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  at the data.  And I think that's where  Facebook is at.  And I think that's where  Facebook just looks.  It's cluttered.  It looks awful.  Trying to find out how to do  anything in it, as Andy said,  is just really difficult.  And Google lately has paid  much more attention to design.  Remember, for years, we talked  about Google being a company  that was purely engineer  driven and design was  secondary.  In fact, reports out of  Google were that designers  were kind of scorned.  That's clearly changed with a  lot of the ads.  If you're an iOS designer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so I think that, you know,  Larry may be looking at what  they're doing and thinking,  you know, this is a mess, this  is a cluttered mess.  But again, if you look at  Facebook's mobile apps, they  were horrible largely because  of the HTML5 lag that they had.  And now they're quite snappy  and they look pretty good too.  And so I think that your mobile  is driving design over to the  desktop at every point in the  world.  It's driven by the desire to  look good at everything from  operating systems to websites  to, you know, to mobile apps.  And I think that, I mean, you  just look at what's going on  with responsive design and  website design.  That's driven by a desire to  look good in mobile and at the  desktop.  And so I think that's kind of  what he's thinking about is  that their kind of Facebook is  now where Google was maybe a  year, year and a half ago.  Speaking of Wired, Kate Metz has

Start time: 2907.16

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  a really interesting article  about Google.  Kate Metz has a really  interesting article in the  Wired Enterprise section on  Facebook wanting a new kind of  flash memory for storing old  pictures.  This is how far they've come  and they have many hundreds of  billions of images are they  storing and they're storing  them all right now on spinning  hard drives using a lot of  power for images that you might  not look at but once a year,  once every five years.  So they want to weigh an online  storage obviously because  Facebook's Director of  Infrastructure, Jay Parikh, says  we can't say hey, you want to  look at that picture from  Halloween five years ago?  We'll go grab the tape, put it  on the drive and send it to you  in a week.  It needs to be there right away.  So they're looking for storage  that doesn't use power, that  just sits there but that you  can basically flash storage  that you can give some low power  to but still have those  pictures available.  That is, it's just amazing.  Just mind boggling the amount of  data Facebook already is  storing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In that story, he talks about  having something that is very  powerful in terms of storing it  for long term and for, but for  writing, it's low tolerance.  And the thing I would worry  about is all you need is that  one bad burp, you know, where  the tolerance is great and you  lose data.  So that would be the concern  I'd have.

Transcript:  They also want to put flash in  a cold storage facility.  I guess it wears better.  I don't know.  And they're using, it's  interesting, they're using  Fusion IOs, cards for their  database software, and  interesting tie in, that's  Waz's company.  He took a job with Fusion IO a  couple of years ago.  They're an enterprise grade  flash drive company.  We're going to take a break.  I'm still waiting to get into  mega.co.nz.  Spinning the beach ball.  They must have known it was  you.  I also am still waiting to get  into Facebook's graph search.  So there.  And I'll probably be waiting to  get into Apple's next event.  So there.  We're going to take a break,  come back with more.  We've got a great panel.  Real journalists.  Dwight Silverman from the  Houston Chronicle, Joanna  Stern from ABC News, and my  friend Andy Anakko from  MacBreak Weekly and the Chicago  Sun-Times.  Our show today brought to you  by squarespace.com.  If you want to build a site  that never goes down, you want  Squarespace.  Their web hosting plus the best  content management system and  that tight integration means  that they can throw server  bandwidth and storage at you  whenever you need it.  That you always secure because  they keep the software up to  date.  And the current version of  Squarespace, Squarespace 6, is  really groundbreaking in so  many ways.  Things like mobile responsive  design, which mean you go to,  in fact, you could try it right  now.  Just go to squarespace.com.  You don't need a credit card.  Just click get started and you  can start setting up a site.  And any template that you use,  customize it as you will, will  automatically be mobile  responsive.  That means it will look great  no matter how big the screen is.  Anything from a 3.5 inch iPhone  3GS all the way up to a 27 inch  Dell display, it's going to look  fantastic.  When you upload images, for  instance, they automatically  make seven thumbnail sizes to  make sure that they can display  that image in exactly the most  effective way.  You don't have to worry about  designing your columns or  creating a mobile design because  these all resize and they can  be customized perfectly,  depending on the size.  I know that's a little thing,  but it's just the fact that they  could do this and still give you  the kind of flexibility they  give you is really amazing.  If you're doing a portfolio, if  you're a graphic artist, if  you're someone who wants a site  to look as good as your stuff  looks, Squarespace is the place  to go.  Squarespace.com.  Click the try it button and you  can try it for two weeks.  Absolutely free.  No credit card, no offer code,  nothing.  Just your address, your email  address, a password and a name  of a site.  It's kind of great if you need  just a site for two weeks, just  create it.  If you decide you want to keep  that site around for a little  bit longer, maybe I think as a  baby gift, design a site for a  kid and get the kid's name,  register it for a year, the name  comes along with it and then  give it to the parents.  That's an awesome gift.  Something like that.  Or for a wedding, for your  business, just for a blog.  They've got great iPad and  iPhone and Android software.  Really, they do nice iOS design.  I must say really gorgeous.  Amazing stats.  Of course, widgets that link you  into all the social networks.  Everything you need.  And by the way, you can  automatically import and export  into all of the main sites so  you're never trapped at  Squarespace.  For example, you can automatically  pull in your photos from  Instagram.  Boom, right there.  Create galleries, instantly sync  pages to Facebook, auto publish  new blog entries on Twitter.  It really is wired.  Beautiful design.  If you're a developer, you do  have access to a lot of  platform that gives you syntax  coloring in the editor and a  whole lot more.  Great for JavaScript or CSS.  Over 300 fonts they're using  the Google Fonts library.  Try it free.  And if you decide to buy, look  at the pricing.  Great deal.  $8 for the basic account.  $16 a month for the unlimited  account.  And that's when you buy a year  plan.  You're going to want to buy a  year plan because I'm going to  show you how to get 10% off your  first purchase for the most  savings.  But look at that.  $16 a month with a year  registrations.  You get the custom domain name  and all the hookup files.  You get unlimited pages,  unlimited galleries, unlimited  blogs.  Great for a photographer.  If you're a wedding  photographer, you can have a  gallery for each client.  Free.  It's part of the deal.  Unlimited bandwidth.  One of your clients is Kim  Kardashian.  Don't worry about it.  You'll never run out of  bandwidth.  Unlimited storage, unlimited  contributors, and a whole lot  more.  $16 a month.  That's hosting and the  software.  You can't beat that.  Now, I do want you to use the  offer code TWIT1 and you can  take 10% off your first purchase  for the first time.  And then you can get a  free free free free free  and you can take 10% off that  first purchase on new accounts.  TWIT1.  That's how they know you saw it  on TWIT and it helps us too.  Squarespace.com.  Your exceptional website is  waiting.  Squarespace.com.  All right.  Number of people.  It's interesting.  Facebook is for unloved.  Number of people in the chat  room said I don't want to hear  anymore about Facebook.  It's like I'm done with  Facebook.  I don't care about Facebook.  All right.  How about Apple?  What the hell is going on  there?  Here's another company people  love that's not doing so well.  Apple's price per share is  slipping down now to 500 bucks  down $200 from their peak.  Some say it's because iPhone  demand is slipping.  Different ways to interpret  that story and I guess we'll  find out.  Is it this coming week that  we're going to get?  Wednesday.  Wednesday we're going to get  the quarterly.  Now that won't be the most  recent quarter, right?  That'll be the last week.  That'll be the holiday quarter.  Holiday quarter.  So I guess that'll tell us how  the iPhone is doing.

Transcript:  I'm trying to figure out what  date it actually ends on.  I know that it will include  some holiday sales.  I'm trying to remember what  that is.  But yes, that's why a lot of  the speculation about the  health of Apple is kind of, I  don't know, interesting.  It's sort of like speculating  about what the next iPhone is  going to be like two days  before the launch event for it.  We'll find out.  Because Apple is always very,  very clear and upfront about  numbers when they have the  things that they feel as though  they have reason to be proud  about.  So if things are going great,  they'll show us the numbers to  show everybody that things are  going great.  If they are suspiciously absent  of details on exactly how, on  breaking down exactly how many  units sold, exactly how much  the iPad mini is affecting  regular iPad sales, how well  the iPhone 5 did, especially  given the accelerated  holiday purchases compared to  other iPhone 5s.  So we're going to have all the  numbers that we need to crunch  on on Wednesday.  By the way, kind of  interesting.  I don't know how they did this,  but they're exactly $500 at the

I was still a little bit  confused, but it has to do with  put and sell options and them  kind of coming at each other so  that it balances at $500.  Oh, really?  So that's how they did it?  I mean, it's not...  It's an automated...  It's a series of automated  routines where when it hits this  amount, buy, when it hits this  amount, sell, and they kind of  hit and stick because so many  are selling at exactly...  Buying and selling at that  price.  One more thing I don't

Start time: 3433.62

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  understand about the stock  market.  One more complete mystery to  me.  And yet, you got to think  there's a little wisdom of the  crowds going on with the stock  market, right?  I mean, admittedly, any given  investor is speculating and has  no idea, but as a group, it  often seems to reflect pretty  well what the prospects are for  a company.  No?

Start time: 3456.74
End time: 3521.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, the stock price is really  a faith index more than anything  else, so it's how much do  people believe that the  valuation of this company is  right where it should be, and  it should not be too high or  too low.  So that's why...  And when you're talking about  a company like Apple that for  so many periods before that has  been just rising, rising,  rising, is it reasonable and  rational to expect that at some  point, inevitably, the stock  price should be 1,000 points.  Now, that's 1,000 points.  The next step is it should be  1,200 points.  And once it doesn't make 1,200  points, that's...  Oh, wait, there must be  something wrong with this  company if it's not absurdly  valued per share.  So I mean, this is one area in  which I have to humbly admit  that understanding exactly why  the stock moves is totally  above my pay grade.  And encouragingly enough, when  I talk to an analyst who  manages a staggering amount of  other people's money for a  living, and they said, yup,  nope, you're exactly...  I don't really know what  happens either.  You just have to react to the  numbers you're seeing in front  of you and hope that it doesn't  hit you in the butt too hard.

And I think everyone says, even  a lot of the people that work  at ABC will come to me and ask  what is the best phone to get,  what's the best laptop to get.  Constantly when they're asking  the best phone to get now, they  go, I heard about the Galaxy S3  and then there's the iPhone,  which is it between these two?  Let's do a poll of our audience,

I think that the iPhone, I'm  certain that the iPhone 5 sales  numbers they're going to give us  this week are going to be  phenomenal, they're going to be  wonderful.  However, I do think they're  leaving money on the table by  not reacting to the popularity  of these larger screen phones.  And I mean, let me add my, make  it a complete, this for American  Idol, we'd be all screaming at  the same time you're going to  Hollywood only you're saying  that phone in your pocket is  probably not an iPhone at this  point in the world.  It's not an iPhone at this  point in life.  Because over the past, I think  it was this time last year that  I really started noticing that  I'm seeing fewer and the people  that I would expect to be  carrying iPhones and using  iPhones are now using not just  Galaxy S3s but any other kind of  Android device.  I think 2012 was the year that  the iPhone really became, even  in America, just another phone  among many that people tend to  like for whatever reason they  tend to like phones.

Obviously, the iPhone never had  one and I got hooked on Android  and now I'm actually considering  getting an iPhone as my main  phone because I've been really  frustrated with Android.

Start time: 3864.44
End time: 3924.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  idea that I don't know anybody  who has a Blackberry who has  just one phone on them at all  times.  It's usually people who have the  one that their company issued  to them and then they also have  their iPhone or their Android  phone.  That's their personal stuff.  And the idea that they've really  made a fundamental personality  aspect of this operating system.  The idea that here is one phone  that keeps your personal life  and your business life  completely separate so that the  IT department gets access to  some areas of the phone.  You personally have access to  other parts of the phone and  that's kept safe and secure.  So for people who don't  particularly care about phones  and that sounds like I'm saying  something mean-spirited about  these people.  I'm saying that normal people  who really just want a  functional device that has a  narrow list of things that help  them get them through the day,  they might get their company  issued Blackberry 10 phone and  then realize that, well gee, I  don't really need to now have a  contract for a second phone  especially if my IT department  will let me use it for personal  stuff as well as for the business  stuff.  Dwight, you're the only one who  hasn't weighed in.

I think the train is left and I  don't think that they have  enough momentum to continue  going on much longer.  I don't have much faith in it.  I do understand now though why  Joanna went to ABC News because  she could get a free Blackberry.  Free Blackberry.  That's right.  I just, I don't, I think it's  too late.  I think you can look and see  what's kind of how Microsoft is  struggling with Windows Phone.  I think that, you know, they're  just now launching this.

Start time: 3967.90
End time: 3987.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  with the words too late.  That indicates that the race is  over and there are now winners  and losers.  It's an ongoing process and all  that has to happen for Windows  Phone to become completely  competitive or Blackberry 10 to  be completely competitive is  for iPhone to sort of tread  water for a year or two.  All that has to happen is for  Android to stop making phone  phone.

Start time: 3987.96

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  lagging indicator.  It doesn't mean that they  haven't been innovating.  It just takes a while for people  to catch on, and that's why  you're starting to see the ramp  of the S3.  But it's a lagging indicator,  which means it's even if Apple  turned it around tomorrow, it  wouldn't necessarily turn around  sales tomorrow.  I think you're going to see a  deterioration of Apple sales  for a while.  You won't see anything.

Start time: 4011.92

Transcript:  The next version will be the  5S, if history follows.  It'll be a tweaked version of  the 5.  That will not be enough.  That will not be enough,  unless the tweaks are done in  software.  So it's very possible, and the  software is what needs to  update.  I think you've seen a lot of  writing.

Start time: 4053.78
End time: 4065.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  And so I think the problem is  that Apple has all these  developers who have a huge  investment in the current  design and the API of the  software.

Transcript:  They're going to have the  problem Microsoft has to  support legacy.

Start time: 4071.35
End time: 4109.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  And so what will probably  happen is you'll see something  similar to what Mountain Lion  is, I think, which is kind of  a hybrid of iOS and OS X.  You'll see that come in one of  these phones, and then they'll  make a big leap and a big  change.  And they'll have to, you're  right, they'll have to have  something that will support  legacy over time.  But the other thing they could  do is with the 6, go big  screen and do away with the  current iOS design and start  over.  And then you support it on the  older phones.  You continue to have iOS on  these older phones, but you  have, say, iOS 2 or whatever  they want to call it.  They want to call it on the new  larger phone.

But nobody really does that  anymore anyway.  We use Bluetooth.  We use wireless.  Who even talks on the phone?  I don't talk on the phone.  I hate the phone.  I text.  I play the Simpsons game.  That's all I do.

Start time: 4154.56
End time: 4277.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I do just think that Apple is  starting to fall a little bit  out of step.  The fact that when the iPhone  5 came out and they just  stretched the screen longer  instead of acknowledging that  people want to use a phone not  just to get email, but also as  a book reader, as a game  device, all of the sort of  stuff, all of those things are  enhanced by having a real  larger screen instead of just  a nominally larger screen.  The fact that they missed that  is kind of surprising to me.  When you compare it to every  other operating system that's  on the market right now, we're  talking about some basic  wonderful features that are  evident to anybody who uses it  on day one or day two, like the  way that on Android and  Windows Phone that applications  can talk to each other and  share information with each  other.  So I think that's a great  thing.  The way that you can get  people to talk to each other  and share information with each  other, the way that keyboards  work a lot more effectively, the  way that the customizability  that lets you, it's important  for the iPhone to be really  easy to use for people who,  again, just don't care and  people who are intimidated by  technology.  But there are weird...  It's your grandma's phone.  Oh, I wouldn't say that.  But what I'm saying, what I'm  getting at is that there are  two different kinds of  categories of ways you make  technology easier.  One way, one category is the  stuff that makes it easier to  use once you get out of the box  and you're learning.  But all of those advantages  kind of end after two or three  weeks once you've learned it.  The other category of stuff  that makes technology easier to  use is the stuff where six  months from now, eight months  from now, a year from now,  when you get to sort of dial it  in the way that you hope this  device to work, and that  actually winds up making it  much, much easier.  The iPhone has a lot of that  first kind of stuff, very  little of that second kind of  stuff.  And I think that now that they  have real competition in the  form of alternatives that are  just as elegantly designed to  make things easier for people  who are not used to it, and  that they're not going to be  able to make things easier for  people who are not used to it.  So if they're going to have  things that are just as  elegantly designed, just as  beautiful, and have these  additional features that Apple  doesn't seem to have any  interest in, here's where  Apple's going to have to make  that decision.  Do they want to continue to be  that major, overwhelmingly  competitive platform, or are  they going to be happy with  being more like Mac OS, where  they certainly don't have the  majority of the installations  out there, but they don't care

Start time: 4278.10

End time: 4315.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Go ahead, Joanne.  That may be minimizing a  little bit.  No, no, I totally agree.  I think that is the next place  that they really...  All the services that they  offer on the phone, I think  we've seen this push of people  starting to replace those core  apps with apps from the app  store, whether it's Calendar,  Address Book, any of the main  apps, because they just  haven't been updated.  They don't work, and they're  not as robust as what Android  offers in some ways.  And the customization as well,  not as robust.  So I think this is the place.  Just look at the share menu.  Just a perfect example is the

Start time: 4316.39
End time: 4333.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  share menu.  On the iPhone, it's who Apple  lets you share with, Twitter  and now Facebook.  On Android, it's any app you  install, and now it can get a  very ungainly long list, but at  least you have the choice of  who you want to share with.  Honestly, there's...  And I think hopefully we see  more, like the next version,

Transcript:  Go ahead, Andy.  I was just about to say, as it  happens, I'm writing a piece  for TechHive that I'm going to  file on Tuesday.  I don't know when they're going  to be putting it out, maybe  next week.  That really is all about how  I'm sort of moving away from  the iPhone and towards Android.  And one of the main reasons is  that it's so much easier to  manage information on the  Android device.  I love the fact that I'm driving  to a friend's house.  I pull up their names in  Address Book.  And then the Android app says,  oh, do you want to send this to  Waze so you can navigate there,  or do you want to send it to  Twist so that you can notify  this person your status?  So easy.  You don't have to keep ducking  out of multiple things.  And that's what I'm talking  about.  It's that day-to-day stuff that  Android makes so much easier to  operate than on an iPhone.  And that's what worries me.  When you identify yourself as  someone who uses Apple stuff,  I've had, unfortunately, I shot  my mouth off so many times since  the iPhone came out saying that  the only reason why I use the  iPhone is because it's the best  thing out there for what I like  to do.  And as soon as something else  comes out that's better, oh,  I'm going to switch to that in  my heart.  I'm not an Apple fanboy.  And now it's like, well, no,  damn it.  Now I do have to switch to  Android because it does work  better for me.  Andy, Andy, Andy, I've been

I am a fan of technology, and I  think you should use the best  technology.  And if something's better, it's  better.  Apple's not down and out.  I'm telling you, there's still  opportunity.  But I really wonder about the  iPhone 5.  To me, this encapsulates the  whole thing.  127 pixels taller.  It was either dumb or cynical.  It was either dumb, they kind of  missed the boat on what people  wanted, or it was a little bit  cynical.  Let's eke a little bit more out  of this ecosystem before we move  on.  And either way, I think it was an  error.  And I think this year we'll tell.  A 5S is not going to do it.  It's not going to do it.

Transcript:  Well, except, except, I made the  decision to go with the iPhone  5 after almost crossing over to  the Galaxy S3.  The reason I did not do it had to  do with carriers and also had to  do with the ecosystem.  My family is all users iPhones.  I have a lot invested in this, and  a lot of the things that I do when  I stay in communication with  people involve things like find my  friends and that type of...  But inertia is not a marketing

I thought at the time that the S3  was too big.  I do a lot of things one-handed  with my phone.  I do a lot of things one-handed,  too, but it doesn't usually

Start time: 4559.96
End time: 4595.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I didn't get the S3, and one  of the reasons was it was too  big, because I couldn't do  things one-handed with it.  But then I have been reviewing  the Note, and I love the Note,  because you can't do something  one-handed with it.  You have to use two hands.  You have to use two hands  to do something one-handed.  And I love the Note.  You have to use two hands, and  you make peace with that.  You do.  And it makes it worthwhile.  And so I'm really...  You know, I have to wait another  year and a half or so for my  contract to come up.  But if Apple hasn't come up  with anything that improves the  size of the phone or a much  better, a much more innovative  operating system, I, too, will  probably jump.

Also on Wednesday, the Pebble  Watch is supposed to ship.  Thursday, January 24th, more  earnings. Microsoft has their  report and then Nokia has theirs  as well. And Friday, January  25th, the SimCity Beta  kicks off. Very excited about  that. That's a look at the week  ahead. Back to you, Leo.  This is Twitter.  Tech News Today.  I don't think Apple does  what they do because of  shareholders, but you certainly  don't see shareholders  criticizing Apple for taking  unnecessary risks.  You see them criticizing them  for not paying out dividends  because they have a big pile of  cash.  Ham Nation.

Start time: 4985.62
End time: 5123.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it. It's actually cool.  It it is a DVR that  records all the major networks you  would like. ABC would like it  because it records. But then it  lets you skip the commercials,  which is awesome for users.  So everybody should be happy  except the major networks, which  are all suing dish  for the hopper.  Yeah.  And of course, CNET, we now  have learned CNET lied.  The first press release from CNET  said the hopper was a nominee  in the best of CES, but  due to ongoing litigation between  our parent company, CBS  and Hopper and Dish  over the hopper, we  are going to remove all dish  products from the list.  And then later it turned out  that not only had it been  nominated, but it in fact had one  best of show.  That information got back to the  executive suite at CBS  who immediately said, no  freaking way.  This this story from Joshua  Topolski in The Verge,  who is probably rubbing  his hands with glee.  I can just see him doing that.  Wow.  And apparently it was  very emotional for the  folks, the CNET editorial  staff.  CBS Interactive News Senior Vice  President and General Manager Mark  Larkin was  the guy who had to tell  the staff that the hopper cannot  win, that it would be removed  from consideration and that you  have to revote and pick  a new winner. Sources say Larkin  was distraught while delivering  the news at one point in tears  as he told the team he had fought  CBS executives who had made  the decision.  And according to Topolski in The  Verge, the  word was passed from  Leslie Moonves, the CEO of  CBS.  In fact, Moonves once told  investors Hopper cannot exist.  If Hopper exists, we will not be in  business with Dish.  Greg Sandoval, to his credit, who's  one of the editors at CNET, has  quit. As far as I know, he's the  only CNET editorial  member who has quit.  I'll let you off the hook, Joanna,  because you work for ABC.  It's in a direct competition and so  forth. What do you think, Dwight?

Start time: 5124.80
End time: 5201.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think that it's it's  something probably that every  journalist who works for a big  company dreads  happening. The  head of the parent company coming  down and essentially saying, no, you  can't cover that or deal with that  in that way.  I think it was a mistake by CBS.  And the ultimate question you have  to ask is, was  their credibility  is it worth the cost of their  credibility to not have given the  award to the Hopper?  And I think probably it was  more of an emotional and less of a  rational decision on the part of  Moonvest to to do that.  You know, one interesting thing about  the sling, the Hopper  with sling, it automatically  skips 30 second  in 30 second increments when it  finds commercials.  But the very first DVR  replay replay  did that as well and got sued  out of existence and got sued out of  existence.  So and all of the DVRs let  you fast forward to commercials.  You just have to do it manually,  whether it does it for you,  to me seems like a minor  aspect of it, but it's something that  the networks are very much afraid of.  You know, it's akin to for websites,  it's akin to having ad blockers  on your website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  CBS has nothing but the highest  regard for the editors and writers at  CNET and  has managed that business with  respect as part of its interactive  division since it was acquired in  2008. This has been an isolated  and unique incident  in which a product that has been  challenged as illegal.  Well, that's a little bit of a broad  stroke, was removed consideration  for the award.  The product in question is not only  the subject of a lawsuit between  Dish and CBS, but between Dish and  nearly every other major media  company as well. And that's why it  must be illegal.  CBS has been consistent on this  situation in the beginning in terms  of covering actual news, CNET  maintains. Oh, they say it's not  actual news.  How can CBS say CNET  maintains 100 percent editorial  independence if they were told not  it's, you know what, both companies  have lost, utterly lost  any respect whatsoever.  If I were, I mean, Mr.  Larkin, I'll give you a job here,  Mark Larkin, but you should quit.  If you were in tears, you don't have  to take it. You should quit.  Greg Sandoval, nice job.  I don't understand why anybody stays  at CNET.  Get another job. Go to work where  somebody where you have they have  some respect for you, because CBS  clearly does not.  Shocking.

Start time: 5296.48
End time: 5366.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, that's absolutely clear.  There the role of a  parent company to the news  organizations that they own.  That's a that's a carefully worked  out relationship.  If CBS simply  wanted to give itself some coverage  against a future or an ongoing  lawsuit, if they wanted to make sure  that they weren't essentially  handing Dish Network  a weapon, they could then beat them  over the head with if they're trying  when the litigation ensues,  it is positive that that's the sort  of thing where lawyers get together  from both these branches and agree  on wording that should be inserted  inside the piece to make it  absolutely clear to give them that  sort of cover so that it won't affect  any ongoing litigation.  I don't mean nobody.  Obviously, CBS CBS is not going to  be point for point explaining  exactly why they made this decision.  But that's a very it's it's very,  very curious that they made these  sort of quasi explanations, because  I think anybody who's worked in the  media knows that CBS  had many options available to them.  Far, far short of telling CNET  supposedly a journalistic enterprise  not to not to cover a certain thing  or not to talk about a certain thing.  So that's why this is absolutely  their explanations absolutely ring  hollow.

Start time: 5366.86
End time: 5398.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Didn't CBS also say that  in in another statement that  the that reviews are not journalism?  Didn't they say that this was an  exception because it had to do with  product reviews as opposed to  news?  And, you know, I would I would  strongly disagree with the notion  that product reviews, particularly  at the level at which CNET operates,  because there they are people rely  on them for fair  and detailed reviews, that that's not  journalism. It is journalism.  And so that's just that that's  absolutely ridiculous.

Start time: 5402.45
End time: 5485.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, I just hope that none of this  really applies towards the people  who actually work for CNET, because  it's hard to I'm sure that this took  most of them by surprise.  It's very, very difficult to make  really that decision where they're  going to say moving forward, am I  going to quit this job?  Am I going to say goodbye to this?  You have to get you.  I'm I'm I'm saying that  I wouldn't personally  I wouldn't presume to say what I  would do in every situation in that  sort of situation.  I believe that I would say that  unless I wanted to find myself as an  entertainer who works for the  entertainment side, CNET, I can't go  forward.  But I I  I was very cold for what was  difficult for so many of these  writers is that I feel for them  because there are times when, you  know, I when I when I did a  couple of things, made a couple  appearances appearing on tech panels  on Fox News.  Boy, did I get a lot of my followers  and all my friends. Oh, come on.  You're going on Fox News Channel.  And I say, well, Clayton  is a very, very nice person.  He this we don't have to talk about  Karl Rove while discussing, you  know, the iPhone 4.  I think I think it's going to work  out OK.  So I just I just hate to think that  all these people who work for CNET,  who do who have been doing very,  very good work and doing good  things for the benefit of their  readers. Now they're I hope they're  I hope they don't get tarred with a  brush of, oh, well, of course,  you're just the tools of the  corporate puppet at this point.  And I'm going to disregard  everything you say.  So I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How can they not?  Because we you know, it was one  thing last week we still we covered  this story. We didn't know about the  lies.  Yeah. But now if they're lying  and CBS says they're 100 percent  editorial independence, which  is apparently not obviously not the  case. Only 80 percent.  Yeah. Yeah.  There's 73 percent editorially  independent.  And then and then the scene is  their own release  lied, saying it wasn't it was  in consideration when, in fact, it  had won, presuming that Joshua's  story is correct. And I have no  reason not to believe that.  I think that they've done  an irreparable damage to the brand.

Start time: 5521.74
End time: 5591.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  And that's that's that's absolutely  true. I don't think they have  to do serious damage control  right now by putting in firm  policies in place.  If this if they're claiming this was  an unusual circumstance and a one  off thing, the only way that they  can really move forward after this  is to say we have spent  the next two weeks following that  incident, coming up with a very,  very clear line of here's  what the protocol is going to be,  where if corporate has an issue  with something, here is the  protocol they have to follow,  not to spike a  not to spike a  piece of writing for CNET, but at  least to have their to  give them the opportunity to  include whatever disclaimer,  whatever separate side  bar, corporate controlled  content that they feel as though  they have to do in order to give  themselves coverage at the  corporate level. But as soon as  they as soon as CNET defines  themselves as something that as a  company that an outlet that  only writes things that are  approved by their corporate  overlords, that's when they  they truly do become an  entertainment site. They may as  well become TMZ.  All right, I'm sorry, I just got a  little head up over all of this.  No, you're absolutely you're  absolutely correct.  I mean, it's like it's badly on us

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  No, no, that's brilliant because  they know that if CNET wants to  say that, no, you didn't win this  award. All they have to do is, oh,  why do you because here's this  press release. Why are you saying  we didn't win this award?  Oh, because we're just corporate  stooges who have to rescind with  it. I'm sorry.  Oh, yeah. Congratulations on the  that's OK. You can still say that  you won the award. Please just let  us go.

This is everybody's  greatest fear is that the CEO  is on the line.  Let's move this is on the line.  And he wants you to kill that  story.  You have no choice.  You either kill the story and lose  all self-respect or you walk out  the door.  And it's not a believe me, it's  not a good choice, especially if  you have bills in a family and you  got I mean, yeah.

I mean, I it's it's easy  for me to say that I'm going to be  raising the red banner revolution  and leading the crusade for  successful journalism.  That's OK, because I don't have  kids and I don't  know. I don't I don't have kids  who are not going to be able to  get braces, not be able to get  medical care, not going to have  medical coverage because I  decided to make a principled  stand.  Though what you have to do  remains what you have to do.  But I just hope this doesn't  extend towards people saying  really mean and ugly, nasty  things about people who write for  CNET because that they decided  that, OK, I'm going to have to  eat a little crap because I  really like this job and I really  like the fact that my  kids can get medical treatment.

Transcript:  The story is, is that this  this innocent man who lives in  Las Vegas keeps getting people  who have lost their phone and are  using either Find My iPhone or  another, I believe, actually just  the Find My iPhone, according to  to the original report.  And they are ending up at his  house because it is putting their  phone there, but he doesn't have  their phones.  And this is a glitch in this  system. I believe it's Sprint's  network that this keeps happening  on. And Sprint doesn't even  really understand what's going on.  And they say they've been looking  into it. I know that was the last  we had heard when ABC reached out  to them.  But this poor guy, he just  then people are knocking on his  door and he says, I think there's  a quote, he's like, I understand,  but I don't have your phone.

Because if a phone doesn't have a  good GPS lock, it locates you  in the general area of the  cell tower.  And so he must be right under his  cell tower.

He opened the door, found an upset  young couple demanding  a turn over their phone.  He says, I'm standing there and  what are they talking about?  They might as well have said, give  me my horse back.  After debating back and forth,  they called the police.  He's a 59 year old guy.  He says, I don't know these  people. I don't go where they go.  I don't care about the technology.  These he says these technology  pets they have.  He never heard from him again.  But then a woman's wandering  through his backyard.  Before he could talk to her, she  jumped over the wall.  A few minutes later, here, a knock  on the door, she says, give me my  phone.  I've got pictures of my grandkids.  I can't replace them.  I need them. All I want is my  pictures.  Wow. So ABC is trying to get this  guy. I mean, what a story he must  have.  Now he's got to.

Transcript:  is over his head.  That's got to be it.  Yeah, but this is the sign  on his front door.  It says no lost cell phones.  This location gives a false phone  locator position that  a cell tower is behind this home.  Oh, yeah, there is.  To a cell tower behind this home.  Please contact the North Las Vegas  police and fire all the report.  No lost cell phones.  So the moral is do not buy a house  underneath a cell tower because  it's going to happen more.  We're actually aren't the  Chad, aren't the cell towers  right across the street on top  of the Petaluma Hotel?  Yeah, you can see them on the  corner of them.  So if you lost your phone,  you come here.  We don't have it either.  I'm starting to read stories  about the U.S.  attorney, Carmen Ortiz,  who was prosecuting  Aaron Schwartz, and apparently  she's fairly upset.  The the she you know,  the statement they gave  was pretty bland.  And they said, you know,  we were we offered her  offered him a plea bargain  of six months in a low security  setting where we you know.  But at Aaron Schwartz's funeral,  his family said the feds  killed our son.  There's a petition to unseat her  now that has crossed  twenty five thousand signatures.  She is really  become the poster boy  or poster girl for all of this.  No official comments.  But a very sad,  you know, a very sad story,  a tragic story.  And and and and really, you know,  MIT is is investigating  why they weren't more  forthright in in in saying  drop this prosecution.  You're also starting to have  legislators get involved.

That's why Zoe Loughgren,  who is a member of Congress  from this area,  has proposed what she calls  Aaron's law  to change this.  So it decriminalizes  terms of service violations.  I mean, you shouldn't  you shouldn't be threatened  with 35 years in jail  on a four million dollar fine  because you violated  JSTOR terms of service.  He broke the law, but  and even admitted  to breaking the law.  But to to pursue him  this vigorously really  was inappropriate.  And we have lost somebody  who was, I think, fairly important.  Somebody somebody said,  don't blame Kim Dotcom for piracy.  Go after the real pirates  of somebody in the chair.  Glee.  Those are the pirates.  Our good friend,  Jonathan Colton,  who has a wonderful cover.  We played it when we interviewed  Jonathan not so long ago  for triangulation of Baby Got Back.  He just tweeted, he said, look,  Leon Fox ripped off my cover  of Baby Got Back,  never even contacted me.  He says they even sampled  after listening,  they even sampled my recording,  that duck quack  was in the recording.  So since they stole it from Jonathan,  let's steal it back from them.  This does sound a lot  like his arrangement.  Even down to the banjo.

This is the original version of the song.  I mean, I got to skip the hold on.  I got to skip the commercial  from Kitchen Aid.  Kitchen Aid apparently likes big butts  just as much as Sir Mix-A-Lot.  I don't know if we could play that.  We can't play that beginning part  with the girls talking, probably,  because it's kind of inappropriate.  Not that the rest of the song  is not inappropriate.  But I was taking any excuse.  Here we go.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  OK, don't show the video either.  OK, now you can play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, he did.  He did get a license to record and release that.  Oh, OK.  So because there's there's been so much really like  Neil A. Patel, of course,  anything involving the law, you can say he's on.  Also a formal lawyer.  Exactly.  And so there's so many different opinions  being written about this that  there is very little he can do because excuse me.  Early opinion is that because it is an arrangement  and not the original song,  they can essentially copy his arrangement verbatim.  However, that the fact that they if they take his actual  master recordings, that's something else entirely.  And if he if Colton actually added something to it,  like something as simple as saying Johnny sees in trouble  that essentially that content.  Exactly. That that can that essentially that essentially  is something that he owns that they couldn't take.  But once again, we're in the realm of we're in the misty realm  of lawyers in which everything all the  we're amazed of misty passengers, all alike and all legal,  in which we just simply sit back,  find out who writes a check to whom or if someone just gets  it gets disgruntled.  Although what I would as if to cap it off, though,  the musical coordinator for Glee,  after this started to really become a firestorm on Twitter,  didn't he tweet back something like,  I guess some people don't know how to make to make  advantage of an opportunity when it's presented to them.  That's definitely doubling down on being a.  I don't know what the hell you're talking about, girlfriend.  Oh, yes, indeed, Leo, I did gone, went there.  You gone there. Yes.

Are you certain it's from Glee?  She says, no, I'm just a Glee fan who uploads Glee songs.  I'm sorry for what they did.  And it's from a Tumblr, which links back to a Brazilian fan site  that also links this baby got back is appearing in the 11th episode of season  four.

But yes, you can't steal it that blatantly.  It's just amazing to me that that they don't understand that this isn't just  some guy, a street performer that they decided to copy off.  This is somebody who has a very large following.  He's not Elton John playing Las Vegas, but he has a very serious following.  This is going to be found.

Start time: 6689.02
End time: 6757.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, I wonder if could could they have fixed this by simply saying, hey,  we're fans of your stuff, we really want to use this arrangement.  Our lawyers say that we can actually just use it without compensating you.  We would like to at least notify you and see if we can give you, you know,  see this fine, find yourself a pretty dress in a shop window.  We'll have it sent to your apartment.  At least sometimes sometimes people sometimes people are not necessarily saying,  oh, boy, he's going to use one of my songs.  I can I never have to work again a day of my life because they're going to be  paying me so much money.  They just want acknowledgment that the work that they do has value  and can't simply be copied.  And also, I mean, there's the what really bugged me the most is that Glee  has a larger audience than than Jonathan Golden does.  And now maybe there's good for Johnny.  Well, no, not necessarily.  Well, it's yes.  They had proper credit.  Yeah. But what I'm saying is that now, if you if he if he plays his work  as his arrangement of Baby Got Back in concert now, are people going to say,  oh, look, he's doing he decided to do that track that was on Glee last season.  Oh, isn't that cute?  Without knowing that, no, he created this arrangement.  Now, now it belongs to him less than it would have if Glee had not copied this.  I mean, if this actually goes out on the air that way. Yeah.

I am now on Book 2 of the King Killer Chronicles.  Started with the name of the wind.  Now the new one. I can't put this thing down.  I don't have to because it's in my car.  It's in my gym.  When I walk the dog, when I clean the house, I'm listening to great books,  all sorts of great literature from audible.com.  I just I'm a big fan.  And, you know, every time I go here, I want like this new book,  this controversy about Scientology.  This is the book everybody's talking about about Scientology.  And it's already on audible.

He's he's done he did three or four collections of of essays before he died.  And each one of them, what attracts me is the I read  I read the essay he did about about the movie and the play Rent, which I love.  Yeah, it's it's well, I I've always had the same opinion about that musical,  which is that you're trying you're turning you're turning a terrible disease.  I felt as though it turned a terrible disease into the same sort of thing  that tuberculosis got turned into, you know, in the in the with the the source  material of it where it's a lot of rent is love.

Gilbert famously mocked mocked the idea of highbrow art by saying, well,  we have a prostitute dying of consumption of freezing garrots.  That will make it sufficiently physically heavy for you.  And also you had this, I don't know.  I was also affected by the movie, which you have once again,  one of those documentary filmmakers whose documentary style is sort of like wave  a camera in the general direction of people moving without any idea  of point of view or anyway.  So it was a really cool  cynicism is not a great aspect for for for life,  but it is a wonderful way to write an essay. And I really enjoyed that.  So I don't I don't have a particular book.  I'm choosing it, but it's definitely on my list.  He's got Half Empty is one of them.

I mean, I mean, Microsoft had success with there  because they actively produced it as here is for gaming  where you can actually get interactive with the game.  That's really, really cool.  Until it kind of reminds me of all these companies  that are making like 3D viewer goggles that are-  Oculus Rift got so much attention at CES.

Transcript:  LCD shutter glasses that they work pretty well  but they still can't convince anybody  that they want to use goggles instead of an actual monitor.  And so until that actually meets that critical mass  they're selling it to like dentists  who use that as a way to enhance their services  and to real estate people.  They're selling to law enforcement  and police and the military.  And so I'm sure that they'll find ways to actually use this  people who are actually selling services  where they can build a bespoke application  for which this is perfect.  But otherwise, great.  Here's the amount of money you need to spend for a box  that you can't use for software that doesn't exist.  Oh, and this actually costs money.  It's not free.  Okay.  Thank you for basically.

Transcript:  My camera doesn't go back far enough,  but I recently built for myself a really big wide easel  out of pine that keeps one, two, three tablets  and a phone right here outside the camera angle,  outside of camera range.  And I'm actually finding that this is a wonderful,  so you can't see it,  but it's a lot like the command station on the Star Trek,  the next generation, the data used to work at,  you know, where my hands, it just sort of is at an angle  and on a level where my hands would naturally fall.  And that's sort of caused me in the past couple of weeks  since I've set this up to sort of change my mind  about the gorilla arms concept.  If you're sitting at a desk and the screen is two feet away,  yes, that is very tiring.  If you're in a comfortable chair  and you're at a piece of furniture that's designed  to hold a tablet right where you'd want it to be,  I've got a really nice wall of glass  that's providing a lot more information,  much more interactively and quickly  than a computer where the screen is.  So maybe we're still just waiting for that iPad moment  how to perfectly articulate this idea  so that people will just simply fall over themselves  to start using it.

Transcript:  But I think the Kinect support is more for gaming  than anything else.  Well, it's just not as good.  For Windows 8, I don't think  they're really thinking that people are gonna be using  meetings to say, now, if you look at this report here,  you can tell that our projections are, you know,  I don't think that's what they're intending it for.  It still is a gaming platform until society decides  that we are actually ready to start dealing  with computers this way.  It's difficult enough getting them to interact  with their computers via voice on a mobile device.  When you give them something where they don't even understand  what the UI language is, you know, is there a click?  Is there a drags or a double click?  Is there a swipe?  Is there a tap?  People don't understand what that vocabulary it is yet.  So it's-

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, but even then we understand the idea  of an onscreen button that we actually reach out  and click on.  We're just using our fingertip as a way  of making that interaction.  So what do we, again, what is the analog for?  Are we actually trying to grab something?  Are we actually trying to move something?  It's a fascinating problem that I'm not sure  that we're gonna see a solution to in the next couple of years.

Transcript:  Father of the year, if he then said that,  actually this was actually public.  This was my way of telling my kid  that we're not ready to have a dog yet.  This would not be a fun environment for a dog to live in.  And despite the fact that you gave him 2 million likes,  I'm still not gonna give him the dog  because that's how responsible a dog owner I would be.  The fact that I know that an apartment  which people are going in and out all day  is not a good place for a dog.

Also, it's so much nicer when you know that you have,  eight minutes of stuff written out for you  and all you have to do is use the announcer voice  and read it quite carefully.  Then that's all you have to do.  Is that it?  I think, no.  You already did all the work.  You already wrote.  In fact, that's why I built this deck  so that I can have a good reading platform.  So I'm enjoying it a lot.  I just recorded the fifth episode  and it should be posted sometime tomorrow.
