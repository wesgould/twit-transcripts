Which should be professional sports.  Because they're not student athletes. They're giving them degrees in general studies.  They're ripping off these kids.  That's sad. That's what I feel bad about.  Yeah, the kids think they're going to go to a school to get a degree.  Meanwhile, you go down to Division...

So did you give up the internet?  This is what I see.  But see, I have this paranoid imagination and it just runs wild.  I don't know if other people do this, but given a little bit of information.  Oh, I know they do that because I've been watching CNN all week.  Given just a little information, I will build, I will conflate a giant story around it.  The giant story I told myself was poor Jolie.  She was probably harassed off the internet.  Oh, no.  Is that not true?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you're a young, attractive woman in the world, you get bothered and you can choose to retaliate, ignore, or laugh it off or get hurt.  What do you do?  Well, I used to get hurt and now I just, I can't care.  You just let it.  It just, I don't see it anymore.  So, no, the reason I got off the internet was because of legitimate privacy and security concerns.  Very legitimate.  I think in the wake of certain Snowden related things, everybody's been a little bit antsy about it.  And I just got a little, I'm like, well, I have to put my money where my mouth is.  If I say I'm concerned, I should.

End time: 422.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How did he do that?  Get Hy-Vee to a hospital.  Get an x-ray.  And he did.  He said, oh, good news.  It's just highly bad sprain.  But I slept.  How do you sprain your collarbone?  So that's what I asked him.  Especially at eight in the morning.  He said, I was throwing.  Oops.  Oops.

Start time: 423.27
End time: 427.71

Start time: 435.08
End time: 453.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't even know what it's doing, but it's doing it in Korean.  Yeah.  Suddenly everything's cutesy looking.  I now know how to say Twitter.  Is that Korean?  What is that?  It looks like Hangul.  What is that?  Oh, man, John.  I can't believe you did that.  It was Japanese.  It was an accident.  That's definitely not Japanese.

Start time: 454.57
End time: 481.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's...  No, it's got a lot of O's.  It's Korean.  Because you know the Korean language, the symbols on there are how you're supposed to  form your mouth to say the word.  What?  Is that true?  Yeah.  Because the Japanese destroyed their language and the Koreans had to reinvent the language  based on their...  They already could talk it, but the written language was gone, so they wrote this crazy  language that actually defines the way you move your mouth to say the word.  That's fascinating.  Yeah, it is.  That's why there's a round one.

Start time: 481.68
End time: 487.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's so interesting.  You open your mouth.  It must be much easier to learn how to read as a Korean child if you're just...

Start time: 487.48
End time: 493.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll tell you.  Maybe.  Twitter in Korean, much more compelling.  God, I can't read that at all.

Start time: 542.00
End time: 544.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do you say?  Is there any tech news this week?

Start time: 546.53
End time: 555.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Seems to me there is.  I could be wrong.  Didn't Edward Snowden reveal that the NSA has been spying on 22 world leaders, even as we speak?

Start time: 556.12
End time: 558.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but is that tech news?  That's just politics.

Start time: 559.38
End time: 569.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you think Edward Snowden should reveal that stuff?  Why couldn't he be revealing the stuff that affects us in violation of the Fourth Amendment rather than just the spy activities?

Start time: 570.00
End time: 584.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He gave all the information over to the Guardian and to Greenwell and some other people, and they're picking and choosing what to write about.  I get it.  Snowden is not doing anything.  He's sitting around hanging out with Russian hookers.  Well, that's what I'd do.  I was stuck in Russia.

Start time: 585.06
End time: 588.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know what the big story was this week.  Facebook bought Oculus VR.

Start time: 590.18
End time: 598.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  $2 billion.  Wasn't that a publicly financed company?  Kickstarter.  Kickstarter.  Now everybody, these guys get billions and the Kickstarter people get nothing.

Start time: 598.46
End time: 605.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Notch, the guy who created Minecraft, had put down $10,000 as part of the Kickstarter.  But that wasn't an equity investment.

Start time: 606.00
End time: 607.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So he gets bupkis.  He gets bupkis.

Start time: 610.04
End time: 627.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And he went down and visited the Oculus folks, got very excited, and only last week decided to do a Minecraft virtual reality version.  As soon as the acquisition happened, he said, you know, I love these guys.  I think that it's a great product, but I don't want to do this for Facebook.  So that's it.  We're killing the project.  Yeah, he said Facebook creeps me out.

Start time: 628.26
End time: 676.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So therefore, I don't want anything to do with it.  And he was only the first.  There are quite a few other smaller indie developers who kind of followed suit and said the same sort of thing.  Well, all you have to do is go to the Kickstarter project page and see all the comments.  Yeah, I think that's a little bit premature to be really pulling the trigger on that kind of thing.  I mean, nobody knows exactly what Facebook's going to do with Oculus.  It certainly changes the tone of the conversation about Oculus being this really interesting product.  It's not gaming anymore.  I mean, it could be gaming, but it could be a very different sort of gaming.  I mean, gaming is one of those popular things to do on Facebook, you know, Farmville and all those other great high quality titles.  And people didn't really want that sort of experience on Oculus.  They wanted more of like a hardcore gaming experience.  Now the thought is...  That's upset.  Yeah, it's primarily the hardcore gamers and those who are invested in this product thinking it finally would bring great VR to home.  And now the question is, is it going to... Is the experience going to be as good as it was?

Start time: 677.40
End time: 690.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I kicked in 300 bucks and I got my developer kit and it's still under my desk, never used.  But I feel like that's what I paid for. That's what I got.  And you're right.  Kickstarter is at great pains to tell everybody again and again you're not an equity investor.

Start time: 692.26
End time: 696.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just... I'm baffled by everybody thinking that this has anything to do with gaming whatsoever.

Start time: 697.99
End time: 698.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The rift. I mean, the...

Start time: 699.44
End time: 700.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The acquisition, the deal.

Start time: 701.02
End time: 736.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I don't know what it has to do with.  Mark Zuckerberg said...  I can tell you.  Oh, good.  Let me tell you what Zuck said and you said if he's lying.  Yes.  What Zuckerberg said is that A...  Okay, I'm going to project onto it.  You know, the current big thing is mobile. Then here comes wearables.  And I think they almost missed mobile.  I mean, they were late to the table. They fortunately were able to save it and came back strong and mobile.  He said that he believes virtual reality is the next big platform.  And when you say that big, that's a big word in the business.  I haven't heard that before.  Yeah. But he doesn't... he's being paranoid. He doesn't want to miss out.

Start time: 736.32
End time: 738.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's at the point where he's getting paranoid.  He's got the cash.

Start time: 739.00
End time: 746.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's not paranoid.  They're buying best of class companies. Instagram, WhatsApp, and now Oculus.  It's funny. They're making...

Start time: 746.02
End time: 774.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now you tell me.  They're making two big bets on opposite ends of the spectrum.  One is very, very low end where it's just messaging and it has a global focus that anybody can use.  Even low end hardware, yeah.  When you're looking very far forward in places where quality of life is already really, really high,  it's not about wearing some bizarre scuba mask looking thing on your face.  It's about overlaying Facebook on everything.  And I think that won't have anything to do with hardware and it won't have anything to do with gaming.

Start time: 774.73
End time: 776.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But why would they want Oculus VR then?  Because...

Start time: 777.41
End time: 783.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, isn't that...  Why do you want Facebook in 3D?  Google Glass is one way of projecting...

Start time: 783.00
End time: 786.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I think Mark's worried about Glass.  I don't think so at all. It's a horrible experience.

Start time: 787.44
End time: 797.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think he wants to get to the next level of experience.  Right.  And it comes without a face mask.  He just has to figure out how to get there and why people are so intrigued by the experience of Oculus VR.

Start time: 798.12
End time: 800.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are they really intrigued?  First of all, two billion.

Start time: 801.04
End time: 852.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Two huge, horrible looking devices.  I think Jolie's right. We're not talking about that thing.  That's just a very early prototype.  You know, my generation, and I think a lot of people in technology grew up with two books.  Neuromancer by Gibson and...  I almost said Steve Gibson.  William Gibson's Neuromancer, where the protagonist jacked in to a virtual reality world.  And of course, Neil Stephenson's Snow Crash and the Metaverse.  And I think Zuckerberg probably was a Snow Crash fanatic.  Read the book in 92 when it came out.  And I think that has driven a lot of this VR research.  We want, do we not, a world that we can interact?  Not just gaming.  And wouldn't this be great for Facebook if instead of going to look at it on a screen, I'm in Facebook?  Tim and I are going. You can stay behind.

Transcript:  John and I will move to our cabin in the woods and wear tinfoil hats. Thank you very much.

Start time: 857.30
End time: 886.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I live in a cabin in the woods and I would still love to do this.  He already has a tinfoil hat.  I have a tinfoil hat too.  It is a curious acquisition though because when they bought WhatsApp, when they bought Instagram, they bought a lot of users.  I mean, a lot of users.  Here they bought...  No users.  No users really at all.  And a very simple technology.  I mean, Palmer Luck has done amazing stuff to make this hardware as simple as it is.  And we've seen PlayStation come out of the gate very quickly with something that's not exactly copycat.  And Microsoft.  Microsoft.  Fortaleza.  Microsoft won't be too far behind.  I do think they bought a foothold in the future.

Start time: 887.54
End time: 897.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What you're saying is they both bought red and black.  For an analogy, John will understand.  Yeah, it would be double zero, believe me.  By buying WhatsApp, they bought the low end.  It's not hedging their bets.

Start time: 898.73
End time: 906.67

They don't have a great user base.  They don't have a lot of developers.  I mean, they do have a lot of developers.  Oh, the idea of Facebook being overly on everything you do is the future.  Can they keep those developers?  And that's the thing.  If they've turned off those developers and they've lost half the reason for making the acquisition of the first place.

I threw up almost immediately in Oculus VR.  Bless your heart.  It turns out, according to Dana Boyd, that means I'm a girl.  But we'll talk about that in a second.  Oh, I love Dana Boyd.

With Facebook, we have a long runway to give away VR gear to...  This is Mark Zuckerberg saying,  I want to see this because I believe VR is going to be a platform.  And I'm hoping that's true because it's going to take that kind of money  over a long time, maybe 10, 20 years, for this to become a reality.

Transcript:  But what she did point out is there is a gender difference  in how people perceive simulated 3D environments.  She talks about there's two different ways all of us work.  There's one that we can perceive 3D by shading.  And that's because we do micro adjustments of our eyes at all times.  We're going back and forth.  And we can perceive the three dimensions by the kind of parallax.  And the other kind of depth perception is motion parallax.  So that if I have this coffee mug and it comes towards me,  it's getting bigger, my brain realizes it's unlikely the coffee mug is actually swelling.  So it says, oh, it's getting closer.  That's one way of depth perception. The other is with shading.  It turns out that VR, as we've seen it so far, works very well with this kind,  the motion parallax depth perception, doesn't do the shading very well.  It turns out that women...  Or how do I say this in a non-sexist way?  Females.  Oh, that's even worse.  Females tend, not because I got sick, but tend to use the shading...

Is she talking to male gamers who are used to doing all kinds of first-person shooter crazy?  Because that makes me nauseous.  Not because it's violent, but because you're just...  You're moving too much.  And I think if she was talking to groups of men who play first-person shooters and women...  She went to...

And car sickness, motion sickness, comes from a disconnect between what you're perceiving  and what your inner ear is perceiving.  Yeah, you can get seasick that way.  You get seasick.

The only real long-term use for this sort of thing is going to be for engineering.  People, they've got to, you know, formalize a car.  They've got to see the model in 3D, and they've got to be able to walk around it  and all the rest of it.  What's going to take over, the gaming and the rest of it,  is going to be free-standing display technology that projects 3D without glasses or any aid.

This is the only time.  That's what I want to do.  It's one thing for them to create a profile and for an advertiser to be able to target ads against somebody like you.  But is it okay for Facebook to sell your information to another group and then build a bigger profile?  To what end?  To what end?  To make money.  For better ads.  For example, if Facebook sold their facial recognition database to Target and when you walked into Target, they took a picture of you and knew who you were and were able to track you where you went in the store.  Is that okay?

I don't want to see diaper ads.  That's a waste of my time.  To show me ads for adult diapers because I'm in my 50s.  Hey, yo.  So, but no, seriously, I'm actually being very serious here.  I don't think that is a detriment.  And I don't care if they do that.  Now, John always brings up this, I think, red herring.  What about the insurance companies or the government?

That's a pretty good deal.  Office, in this case, means Word, Excel, PowerPoint.  Do you get ten machines?  Do you think ten machines?  Five computers, five tablets.  Any mix of platforms.  Any mix?

Start time: 2460.06
End time: 2477.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  For me...  It's more about being able to make quick updates.  If you have a presentation that you want to give, for example,  it's a lot easier to carry that into the room than to carry your laptop,  especially if you're traveling.  But the nice thing is you can use that read-only for free.  So if you have documents in the cloud that you just need to read  or you just need to look at quickly, you can get it for free, which is nice.

So you've got full power Office on there,  which is... if you do want to make updates.  But certainly if you just don't want to do read-only stuff,  you want to take a look at presentations,  if you want to give a presentation through your iPad,  you can do it for free, which is, I think, a very nice feature for sure.

What is this thing you have hooked to your iPad?  This is my stand. It turns it into like just a little...  See, isn't that nice? It's a doohickey.  It's the same material geckos have on their feet.  Let's see.  No, I'm right now doing a demo.  And after I'm done, I'll let you see it and change it to Korean.  Because I know that's what you really want.  So, this is Microsoft Word.  The main thing is fidelity, right?  That you're actually going to get something that's...  I could open this in Google Docs. It isn't going to look like this.

Start time: 2578.30

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you may be forced to use Office.  So, they have that compatibility.  Look, I realize that Apple...  I mean, iPad users aren't going to probably, in most cases, go crazy over this.  But I have to say, I am impressed by...  For instance, they've got ribbon functionality without taking over the screen.  The touch targets are a little small.  This has always been a problem with Windows 8 as well.  But usable... You know, you see how small that is?  I have a big fat finger.  It's kind of hard to hit some of these.  And I think the ability to have an iPad with you...  A lot of people with iPads have keyboards now.  And to get some work done is not...  There are going to be a lot of things people want.

They did it on Thursday in San Francisco, a week before Build.  And I think one of the reasons he really wanted to be there and do it separately from Build...  Is I think that this is not something that would have happened.  In fact, it didn't happen under Balmer and Gates.  I think that they were very protective of the Windows franchise and the Office franchise.  That the internal groups there were very tough and protective of that.  And they didn't want, for instance, to offer Office on an Apple platform.

Start time: 2661.99
End time: 2681.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They were very reluctant to do that.  And Balmer didn't want to give up 30% of revenue on any Office sales.  Which is something that apparently Balmer was very, very adamant about.  But now very quickly after, here we are.  And they are indeed selling it on iOS.  You can subscribe to 365.  And we've heard, I think it was Recode who had that first, that indeed Apple gets the 30% cut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I think what's happening is Microsoft, it's kind of a new, gentler kinder,  Microsoft to Microsoft that sees itself more as a services and cloud provider.  Because one of the things this works best with is OneDrive.  If you have your documents on OneDrive, you're working on them on the computer.  They're available immediately on the iPad and vice versa.  You can round trip through OneDrive.  And I think that that's a big part of the selling point of this.  Just like Google Docs, it's really about Google Drive.  I think Microsoft might finally be saying, alright, we get it.  It's a diverse world.  It's a bring your own device world.  There are people who have iPhones.  Remember Bill Gates wouldn't let his kids buy an iPod or an iPhone?  They wouldn't let them have it in the house.  They had to use a Zune.

Transcript:  Absolutely.  Anyway, it works nicely.  It's beautiful.  It's well designed.  I think it was interesting.  I expected that he would talk a little bit about, oh, and don't worry.  This will be on Windows 8.1, too.  There will be a touch forward modern UI version of this.  He didn't mention it.  Even though we know it's in the works.  It may even be a related code base.  He didn't mention it.  And I thought that was interesting, too.  I think this is an acknowledgement.  It's not a Windows only world anymore.

Transcript:  Back to you, Leo.  Thank you, Mike Elgin.  Yeah, and Friday, we will be doing Windows Weekly in studio.  You're invited to come by.  We're doubling down on geekiness.  I just really, really want ... There's lots of technology coverage in the world, but I  really want to just be super geeky.  I just want to get as geeky as we can and give people the information they care about,  what they need, and I feel like we're on the right track.  I think Mike was a great acquisition.  Our show today, we'll get back to the news in just a second, brought to you by Stamps.com.  I want you to start using your time more effectively.  It's tough deciding when you're a business where to focus.  If you're a software developer, do I develop for iOS?  Do I develop for Android?  If you're in a business, there's one thing you do not want to send your resources out  to go to the post office to waste valuable time getting stamps for mailing and shipping.  If you ship, if you mail, and most businesses do, whether it's invoices, brochures, flyers,  or products, you've got to use Stamps.com.  It's the modern way to do fulfillment.  We use it here.  It's fabulous.  It lets you access everything the post office can do right from your desk, and you don't  have to wait until the post office is open to do it.  You can do it 24-7 with your computer, your printer.  No postage meter, no special inks.  You can buy and print official U.S. postage anytime for any letter, any package, any class  of mail.  It's a fraction of the cost of a postage meter.  I'm going to show you how to get that USB scale so you always have exactly the right  postage even when the cost of a stamp goes up, which it just did.  It's automatic.  It's Stamps.com.  You also get discounts you can't get at the post office.  Stamps.com, because it's a computer, can do all sorts of stuff the post office can't do.  You can import addresses from all the popular address books, use cost codes to track postage  spending by a specific customer, get automatic address verification, discounts on insurance,  on certified mail, on return receipt, automatic fill out of international customs forms.  In fact, you don't hand write any forms anymore.  You can print right on an envelope.  It looks great.  It's got the company logo.  It takes the address from QuickBooks or Amazon or Etsy or eBay, wherever you're selling.  Of course, your return address is automatically populated.  I think this is such a great service.  Stamps.com.  Go there right now before you do anything else.  Click that mic.  See that mic up at the upper right hand corner there?  Stamps.com.  Click that and then type in TWIT and you're going to get a special offer, $110, no risk  trial.  Of course, you get 30 days of Stamps.com, but you also get $55 in free postage that  you can use over the first few months of your account.  You get that scale.  You pay shipping and handling.  I think it's five bucks, so we'll give you a $5 supply kit to make up for that.  By the way, you can cancel any time in that first four weeks pay.  Nothing but the scale is yours to keep.  Stamps.com.  Please use the promo code TWIT if you will.  We were talking about Mike Elgin.  He wrote an interesting article.  I wonder what you guys think.  He says Apple should buy Yahoo.  He says what?  I really love the way he put this.  When Google or Facebook has a new initiative, they want to get people together to talk about  it.  They get them together on their social media presence.  When Twitter has something to say, when Apple has something new and exciting and wants its  users to talk about, it goes to the Apple social ... No, there is no Apple social media  site.  There is no way for Apple users to ... There's no way to leverage that social media skill  that Google does with Google Plus or Facebook does with Facebook.  Mike says needs eyeballs and user data.  World's biggest company, huh?

Start time: 3358.96

End time: 3389.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The reason she's Yahoo's CEO is because she has power that she could never get at Google.  She hit a ceiling.  There are so many ceilings at Apple.  She would never go after being CEO of a company like Yahoo.  She'd never go back.  No, I agree.

Ooh, let's talk about that kind of thing.  Tim Cook's a great COO.  They need a lead singer, a front man or woman, somebody who can take the stage with charisma,  confidence.

People tried over and over to register and the website got broken because 9,000 million  billion people wanted to go to I.O.  This year, instead, they're giving you two days, two leisurely days to sign up for your  I.O. ticket anytime you want.  And then they're selecting people at random who get to come.  There's no meritocracy.  It's like Burning Man.  There's no first come, first serve.

Start time: 3563.64
End time: 3578.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's how Burning Man's doing it.  This is done poorly.  They should either charge more and let people pay to get into the thing.  They should stop giving stuff away because that's what causes this.  I think that's why it's happening.  It's people who try to get in.  Stop giving stuff away and see who really wants to go to this thing.

Transcript:  IRS has decided that Bitcoin is not a currency, it's property.  I thought that was a great idea.  I think it makes perfect sense.  It's a little complicated.  So, for instance, I have seven bitcoins in my wallet.  I need to know what they were worth when I acquired them so that when I sell them or  buy something with them, I can pay capital gains tax on the difference.  That's how it's treated like property.  But that doesn't make sense.  It's just there is the onus on the user to figure out what their stuff is worth.  But I guess somebody suggested maybe the next generation of Bitcoin wallets could do this  somewhat automatically.  So forth.  I don't have a Bitcoin.  What it does mean is that the federal government has finally said, yes, this is something.

Transcript:  It's a little bit, I mean, it's very easy to compare the two because we've got Candy  Crush versus Farmville.  We've got a very strong tie to Facebook like we had before, but one of the big differences  here is that King is really focused on the mobile side of things, much more so than Zynga  ever was.  Zynga's very tied to Facebook, whereas King's got a much bigger dog in the hunt when it  comes to the mobile side of things.  They've got iOS apps and Android apps, and they're finding good success there, but 80  percent of their revenue comes from this one game.  Even though they have hundreds of other games.  It's significant revenue.  And 600 developers turning into games.  It's $1.9 billion last year.  It's amazing, isn't it?  And that's up from $200 million the year before.  So that's a huge increase.  It's not an insignificant increase.  I take the money.

And if they could bottle this, they might have some value.  It's one of those games that's...  These are psychologically addictive.  They're really tricksy in how their reward structure happens, how they get you to post  to Facebook to get an extra life.  They've done it very well.  And I think there is some value in that.  If they really understand that...  What's the value?  The value is in a deep understanding of the psychology of gameplay and the psychology  of gameplay in a social environment.

The phone is bigger because it's a 5-inch screen instead of 4.7.  But also, they're using the new Qualcomm 801 chips, which have some really...  Oh, the 801.  Yes, it's one better.  Oh, the 801.  But watch this.  So this is the camera.  I took a picture of Jolie before the show.  And then I played with it.  It has a couple of interesting features.  This is one I like.  The ability to selectively defocus in software the background.  The reason they're doing that is they have two sensors.  So the normal camera sensor from last phone is still there, but they've added the front  camera sensor from the old M7, and it's taking depth information at the same time.  Now, don't you think, John, that's a pretty nice...  I mean, look, it's not a professional.  You get some bokeh effect out of the bokeh.  Yeah, you get some bokeh.  Yeah.

No, this is a case that HTC One is making.  What it does is...  And I don't think this is going to save you any battery life.  It turns on the magic of colored light.  The case has dot holes in it in the front.  And then the screen knows because of the magnet in the case that the dot view case is on it.  It shows the time, the date when calls come in through the holes.  It looks like a light bright.  It's the strangest thing.  It's a great idea.  But at least it's unique.  It is.  The problem is most people don't like flip cases.  Yeah, I don't want a case on this.  But the reason I bring it up is John didn't want to drop it.  It's got a little rubberized texture.  Actually, it comes with a little case in the box.  There's a little shell case.  So maybe they acknowledge it.  But look at that.  See, it shows the time as the alarms go off.  If you swipe it...

Transcript:  Yeah.  And it's nice to have an Android device that has aesthetics as a priority, whereas with  Samsung and with so many other Android devices, aesthetics are very much a second or a third  or a fourth or a fifth thought.  Performance and battery life are really the leading things that most Android buyers look  for, whereas with the One, they obviously spend a lot of time with the design and the  engineering, which is very nice.  But unfortunately, I mean, the One sold really well for HTC, but it didn't sell anywhere  near the Galaxy S4 or, of course, any of the iPhones at the time.

I mean, HTC had so many devices that were doing pretty well for them before, and now  they've got...  This is pretty much the one that they're hanging their head on, whether it's enough.  And honestly, I don't know that there's enough change here to really convert anybody who  didn't like the HTC One.  Yeah, if you didn't like it.

Transcript:  Although they did do one thing that really bothered me, they fixed, which is they've  now got the Google on-screen buttons, the capacitive buttons.  HTC did a non-standard two button thing, which was very confusing, but now they've got the  standard Google.  In fact, Sense 6, which is the new Sense that's on this, is actually very good.  They have the BlinkFeed.  They've updated that to do, I think, a really good job.

Yeah, I love him and I love his mission.  I love his vegetables.  He said, you know what, Kahle, I guess, is the guy who's going to be the best.  Kahle, I get it.  He said that copyright be damned, basically.  He said, you know what, libraries don't ask what's the copyright of the material we're collecting.  We're a library.  We're going to collect everything.  We're going to download all the pages.  We're going to save it all.  And it's going to be a treasure trove for historians going forward.

And so one of the things I like to do is read these classics that many are in public domain.  And so you can get them either in the Gutenberg Project or if they don't have them there,  then you go to the archive.org where they've been digitized.  Horrible. Unreadable.  Sorry.

Transcript:  Well, one thing that Facebook's done, and I think it's bothering brands a little bit,  they've changed their algorithm, they keep changing it, refining their algorithm of what makes it into your newsfeed.  And now it turns out that all these brands have spent all this money building all these likes.  Most of this stuff is not getting into people's news feeds.  So if you're Coca-Cola, you spent millions building a Facebook page and in getting millions of likes,  you would hope that everything you post would at least be seen by people who liked you.  Very little of it is. A small percentage, small fraction of it is.  And I think brands are starting to get a little miffed by this.

I don't think ATMs are a problem because they're not surfing the web, opening emails, clicking  links, and instant messenger.  They're not doing the things that are dangerous.  Presumably, they're fairly locked down.  I'm not so worried about that.  I'm much more worried about the half billion kind of unsophisticated XP users.  And it is almost half a billion.  Yeah, it's crazy.  Who probably won't patch.  They won't do the right thing.  They won't run it as a limited user.  They'll say, gee, my machine's slow.  Yeah, because it's sending spam to 8,000 people today.  So what do you think?  XP explosion?  XP logyn?  Expiration?  Expiration, I think that's it.  All right, Jeffrey Needles, you win the prize.

Transcript:  This was a very interesting scoop from the Jessica Lessons, the information that Amazon  might be launching, and I think they will, a streaming video service.  They already have Amazon Prime.  They bought a European service some years ago, which they've started to turn into basically  a Netflix-like service.  I think this is going to go beyond it.  I'm very intrigued with what they're up to.  Well, didn't they directly deny it?

Transcript:  We'll find out.  8.30 in the morning on Wednesday.  We're going to cover the announcement because I feel like it's going to be something big.  I'm going to be very disappointed if it's like another Kindle or something.  We're expecting a hardware streamer.

Transcript:  I think that's like a Chromecast thing.  I do think that we could see a commercial-based streaming service.  There aren't really that many players out there that give you premium video with commercials.  YouTube is doing some of that stuff for sure.  Hulu, of course.  But there aren't really that many.  That's sort of the model that's worked for everybody when it comes to streaming audio.  All these people launch premium streaming audio services thinking people are going to  pay monthly, and then we'll also give them the commercial-based service just to give  them a taste.  But everybody does the commercial stuff.  They don't want to pay for it.  So it's an interesting opportunity for Amazon, I think, for sure.  How about this for a prediction?  4K?
