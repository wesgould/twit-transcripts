I appreciate happy to help we covered  We've been covering for the last week and it's really been a death march  The night, you know, I have I've never said the guy's name out loud the Google engineer memo  I that's all you have to say. I don't want to give him any  Additional publicity, although he has been now appearing in other media  Wall Street Journal we saw I saw him interviewed on Bloomberg TV Emily. I thought did a very good job actually  But I think we can probably tie a bow on this now he's been offered a job by Julian Assange  He's published an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal  Fortunately, it's behind a paywall  David Brooks in the New York Times do you ever Brooks at the New York Times said he should be fired  Said Sundar Pichar should be fired for firing him. I'm sorry, which is I think the most extreme in the other direction

Start time: 493.34
End time: 500.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Go ahead. I'm sorry. What were you saying? Oh, yeah. I mean now that he's working for Julian Assange  It'll be happily ever after for him, right?

Start time: 503.54
End time: 525.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They belong together, I don't know if he'll take the job but they definitely belong together  So but if anybody has it would be I think we it would be remiss if we're covering the week's news not to mention  That that's been in this news all week long and everybody's weighed in on it  I've heard from every men's right activist in the world on Twitter  Ashley you're a woman I

Start time: 527.45
End time: 529.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what?  Here's the thing. I thought

Start time: 531.54
End time: 543.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think a lot of men read it and kind of went. Yeah, okay  Not necessarily agreeing or disagreeing but just not offended by it like blowing it off ignoring it  And I think every woman I know who read it was infuriated by it

Start time: 544.86
End time: 595.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hi, you know, honestly like my response was just like, uh  like I'm so  This is exhausting. Like it's just  Well, you know, I know a lot of really great men and women coders engineers  scientists, I I think it's  silly for anybody to say that you know  you can't  say that science says  Men are genetically better at the whatever, you know, you can't say these things because you also have to take into consideration  society and history and systematic oppression of you know people of color and women and it's just there's a lot of  different factors that go into this and and to just kind of make this weird blanket statement is I mean, it's it's obviously it's it's

Start time: 595.54
End time: 611.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ridiculous like it's just silly and one thing some people said was well, okay granted  This is whatever how you feel about it's dopey. It's insulting. It's wrong  But should Google have fired him for that shouldn't they tolerate?  speech that they disagree with

Start time: 612.20
End time: 693.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So here's the thing. I mean, I think you can be a company that says  You know if you're Google you should absolutely say, you know  If you have a political view that says we should spend more money on defense even though let's say  Larry and Sergey don't believe that like that's fine. Like I think that's fine  But this to me is not a political viewpoint. Like this is a human viewpoint. This is a discriminatory  viewpoint that is factually incorrect like and so to me that's  the the line crossed like I I think that if you want to donate to if you are anti-abortion if you are  You know if that's a political view if you if you want to get into those things like and be involved in those things  That's fine. But at the end of the day  Even if I was a person who who you know believed in all of  Some very like liberal stuff and then also wrote this manifesto. I would expect to be fired  Like that's it's you're you're literally one  This man did not post this to medium or or write a blog about it  He literally disseminated it via email company email to employees in the company  Which one as an HR person makes you completely you can't be worked with like you've created a hostile work environment for yourself

Start time: 693.56
End time: 708.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like how can you even continue to be employed? It's my understanding. Did he email it was my understanding has been floating around on a Google message board  Well their internal Google plus and before that a Google meme site for a couple of months without any notice  Right. It wasn't until gizmodo

Start time: 708.84
End time: 718.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Noticed it somebody probably noticed it and had reported him  But I would imagine a large company like Google has a has a pretty serious long-running, you know  HR process for letting people go

Start time: 719.70
End time: 826.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, there's nothing wrong with being racist or misogynist privately  I mean certainly there are plenty that exist in Silicon Valley  But I think the problem here was that he wrote this down in a memo and it's the same thing as like if you wrote it in  email even though that is it could be considered a  You know private message something that's sent between two individuals if that becomes public you're held accountable to that stuff  And so really you should treat his name on it  yeah, definitely he put his name on it and and you should treat all internal communications as though they are public and  and so in this case he was he showed his flawed logic and  For Google that is a liability because you don't want to have someone that is  That's just making bad  Logical arguments publicly, especially if he's representing the engineers that work for your company  So like that was a bad look and and ultimately yeah  It caused it, you know caused a huge controversy. And so of course he was fired  I think that it it's kind of silly to argue that he shouldn't be fired because like look at  Amy Pascal from you know, the Sony hacks, you know, she wasn't responsible for the hack  And and sent a lot of weird and wrong messages  privately, but once those were exposed she was held accountable and and this has happened dozens and dozens of times over history, I think  You know, it was right for Google to fire the individual  I think what was weird about his argument was just the pseudoscience that that he used to to elaborate his point for you  Know, I don't know like 5,000 words or something like that. I mean that the memo was way too long  I'm just surprised. I'm surprised that anyone would spend that long writing something for  you know for internal purposes and  and yeah, I just thought the logic was like completely flawed and this guy just

Start time: 827.74
End time: 842.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Had a little impedance mismatch. He thought he was in college still  This is the kind of thing you could pause it in college and then have a Socratic dialogue about and then be shut down or whatever  And I think Google probably for a lot of employees feels like that kind of open campus freewheeling

Start time: 843.24
End time: 845.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Environment they call it a campus. Yeah, you're not wrong

Start time: 846.54
End time: 867.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And he maybe just kind of thought oh he didn't think it was a company  See, I mean I understand from the company's point of view  It's gonna be pretty hard to assign him for instance to be in a team with another woman  If you were a woman you wouldn't want to work with the guy, right? So  I can understand why this isn't gonna work at a company  But but Google kind of fosters this impression that it's a little bit more open and freewheeling

Start time: 868.98
End time: 891.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true  I hope but I also I think that um  This sort of actually plays maybe a little maybe a little bit and I'm curious this to all of your opinions as to this  so my personal story of like the worst I've ever had  Harassment online was I used to be Android Ashley. So that's how I started hosting  I hosted a show called this week in Android and

Start time: 893.28
End time: 895.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See that's why you have to let robots subscribe

Start time: 897.80
End time: 986.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And well the secret is I'm actually a robot so  So the so I one year I was like, you know  I probably should get a second line to see what's going on in iOS because I  Don't really know what's going on there and I don't have any iOS devices  So I got an iPhone as a second line and I I think I tweeted about it or like maybe I posted about it on  MySpace, I don't even remember like no it couldn't have been my space  I think I tweeted about it and and I  Got emails from people saying they hope I they hoped I was raped while waiting in line for my iPhone  They hoped that somebody had written me an email saying that they hoped the battery exploded and disfigured me permanently so that they would never  Have to see my hideous face on on screen again on on their phone  I mean, I got all kinds of just terrible messages many of which use the term I whore which I thought was clever  But also really horrible  But yeah, it's like at the end of the day I think that we  We ascribe it is very easy  To think that these companies whether you're an employee or a customer are our friends, right?  so like  which is why I think so many people get so defensive about the you know, the Apple versus Android war and things like that because they  Really consider these companies to sort of like be their friend and when they do things they that they're that their favorite company doesn't like  They get even more angry than when you know, it's a company. They don't care about a religion

Start time: 986.66
End time: 990.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, they it's a it's a it's akin to a religious war

Start time: 990.30
End time: 1031.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It really is and they get so upset like a devout Android user would get really upset  Maybe about this firing and be like Google. How could you do that?  You know, it's like I don't I don't even know you and but it's it really is this sort of emotional response  And I think that's that's really kind of a big part of the response here  And also the reason he wrote this is you know, you you have this feeling of you know  Well this company I work here and we're all cool and and you know Google's my friend and it's like but Google's also your employer  And it's like and Google's also a business and they're out to make money and it's like you have to remember these things that I  Thing that it's easy. It's so easy to forget you forget. Yeah for employees apparently to forget

Start time: 1031.64
End time: 1213.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know this also touched on something that that I wrote about a lot last year, which is that?  That there is  there's under representation among a lot of groups in Silicon Valley and  You know, this was at the heart of this engineers  Memo the fact that you know that it was considered an anti-diversity memo  So his argument was that it's it's really hard to find talented  engineers and thinkers in certain groups such as let's say black and Hispanic and so that is why  there is under representation among those groups and he argued that to  To hire people or to promote the hiring of those individuals would be to lower the standard for Google  And so that's reprehensible that is what that's such a tired argument  and and and you know, I think that  that the reality is that  That this this really gets to the core of something that's going on in Silicon Valley, which is that?  Companies like Facebook and Google and other  Conglomerates or you know multi-billion dollar companies are hiring from the same  Very selective schools as they should, you know, these are very in-demand jobs  But what ends up happening is that you have small groups of about 20 people at least in the case of the trending topic story  That I read about last year. There was a group of about 20 people that  That were making decisions that influenced tens of millions of people's lives and even hundreds of people  millions of people's lives and and you know since even writing those stories I've been messaged by a number of different contractors and  employees at different companies that are making decisions that they're uncomfortable with and  are and that are unable to really speak out and are unable to  to really hold these companies to account and and  sorry, the under representation side of it is important because  You know you you have this select group of  recent graduates are very young people that are making decisions that  that influence a lot of different people and when you don't have members of certain communities such as  Hispanic or or black or or even a certain gender group such as women then  Then you're not you're not building these  algorithms or these artificial intelligence systems to take into account the  The the lifestyles and the experiences of these different people so you know one outcome for example  Is like Google images used?  artificial intelligence to identify what was in a photo and this was a couple of years ago, but  This was a famous failure for artificial intelligence because Google images identified gorillas as black people now obviously that's a huge problem  But it's something that you can avoid if you have just one black person on the team, right?  Just it's it's it you know you end up inserting biases that you don't actually mean to insert  And I think this is a more prevalent issue than people really understand

Start time: 1215.22
End time: 1236.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  More it will get more prevalent as we move forward with AI and all kinds of different systems that are you know?  virtual assistants and things like that like this is only going to  either get worse or if we choose to  Bring all those voices to the table, maybe it gets better  It's just a pretty good argument in favor of diversity

Start time: 1239.16
End time: 1301.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Along the kind of economic lines that this guy was suggesting we need to follow which is that um?  You know if you compared more diverse teams to less diverse teams the more diverse teams are typically more innovative more flexible more creative  And they produce better results and the I mean  The study study after study has shown that and I you know I think that  As companies come around to understanding that we're gonna start to see you know  I mean not just because it's a good thing or because it's the morally right thing to do which it absolutely is but I think  You're gonna see a lot of companies like Google  And Facebook and Apple you know increasingly  striving to increase diversity for the reasons you know  That you were saying Michael partly because it makes your products more  accessible or more interesting or more compatible or better for a wider variety of people  but also because the teams that you have in-house are just gonna become more creative and  I don't know fertile for idea generating and they're gonna produce better work

Start time: 1302.40
End time: 1340.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I mean like if I now oh go ahead say I was just saying I agree with that and if I were a company hiring  Engineers I would not only want those Ivy League  Engineers I would also want people who you know like we look at we look at these innovators who have started companies Steve Jobs  Bill Gates like look at all these people who have had very different  backgrounds and and ways of learning and so I like I think to count out somebody just because they went to didn't go to  An Ivy League or vice versa is is unfair  I like I and also it just like everybody says it limits what you're actually making and at the end of the day

Start time: 1341.34
End time: 1402.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's challenging because you're talking about groups in a generalized way, but each employee is an individual  And and so you have to hold it in kind of in both ways because you mean you think of the women and Hagen Hidden  Figures who were but not only women but African Americans and nobody thought they could do the math right?  Because because they're black women  I mean that's that's as low as you can get from their point of view as a bunch of white male engineers  but they're individuals and and so  But look at the demographics  I'm sure Google wants to put this whole thing behind it not just because it's good business  But because it's kind of embarrassing if you look this is their most recent diverse kind of look at their  20% women, but it's even worse if you look at  African Americans 1%  Hispanic people 3%  It's it's not a good. This is current the just  Diversity they couldn't this timing of this was bad for Google

Start time: 1402.84
End time: 1432.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, and also it just shows their failure on both sides, right?  like so people like the engineer that wrote that memo are upset because they think there's an active program that is  essentially removing  like-minded individuals, but then on the other side, it's like I  Know a lot of people that are very upset about that these diversity reports because both Google and Facebook in particular  seem to champion themselves as  as these like  Utopian, you know progressive

Start time: 1434.02
End time: 1435.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Progressivism yeah. Yeah

Start time: 1436.02
End time: 1459.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Absolutely. Yeah, and it's like when you're hiring when your staff is like 1% black  That's not on both side in both cases in both cases for Google and Facebook  It's just I mean, I mean it just shows that  Talk is cheap essentially and that you know  These companies are not employing this the ideals that they at least you know tell tell the public  So there's a little bit of why he got fired so quickly

Start time: 1461.70
End time: 1465.74

Start time: 1465.96
End time: 1492.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is bad. What's what's what's really upsetting to me about this story is that um  Pichai was going to hold um, you know meetings to talk with  With Google employees about what had happened and take their questions and you know do the whole town hall thing and they had to cancel those  because people were reporting that they were starting to get harassed online and doxxed and  Yeah, like that. I mean that's ridiculous like become gamer. This is the gamer gate crowd exactly

Transcript:  This is such a weird thing to say I read this guy's stuff his name is film crit Hulk and  It's a really smart guy talks about movies a lot and he wrote this article that I can't recall the name of but he talks  a lot about  How pop culture has really kind of crafted this  generation of  Disaffected young  mostly but not all white men and  Who who do things for the lulls and that that things don't matter that nothing matters everything's a big joke  and it's a it's a terribly interesting article and  he  He kind of breaks down how the rise of you know TV shows like South Park, which I think can be  extremely powerful and satirical  also kind of encourage that that sort of  Not giving it not giving any dams about what happens to anybody like it's sort of this  self perpetuating cycle of like, you know pop culture and then the internet culture sort of like  Makes it this toxic disease and and I think that at the end of the day  I I don't it's weird. I remember when the internet started and I don't necessarily think it's  Worse. I just think it's louder  And it's it's easier more than ever. It's easier for anybody to find other like-minded people  regardless of what that interest is and so  So that can be used for great good or it can also be used for a great  great evil and so  I don't know what the answer to that is. I don't I don't think anybody really knows yet  But at the end of the day, I mean for me like I sign off of all of my stuff on CNET and everywhere else with BNC  Everywhere else with be good humans and really that's all we can do is just be better  Like it's a be more aware and listen to people who are not like us meet them all that stuff  so I that for me like that article is it's really fascinating and  If I'll look up the name of it, but I have it right here.

They're  asocial

Transcript:  I I would disagree with that. Um, I think that  What has happened and and I?  this is what I feel maybe is my kind of hypothesis on this is that um,  boomers and yuppies  Raised two generations of kids gen xers and millennials and gen xers are raising younger millennials now  Um, or I guess what are they gen z now?  Uh, but the ij let's just say let's just say millennials because that's the one, you know  We're killing everybody with our avocado toast or whatever. So uh, we'll focus on that but but like  My parents did not regulate or otherwise  Pay attention to what I was looking at on the internet when I when it when I first got the internet  Like I I remember it very clearly because they had no idea what it was and neither did I  And so it it just was like oh, it's it's like a phone call  But for everywhere or with for everything like and and I think that for a long time  when we first  opened up the internet, um  There there were a lot of really big gaps in oversight  and by parents  specifically  And maybe even teachers  Uh, but at the end of the day like you have this time period where a lot of people who are now  Let's say 25 to 35  Um are have had very little  Uh oversight on what they see online or what they saw online when they were younger  And they know, you know how to find like-minded people they know how to organize really well, they know how to brigade people  um, it's it really is like to me I think and I I hope  That because millennials have so much experience always being connected like we are literally  The the earliest part of millennials is like mid early mid 80s  That's the last generation of people who will ever remember not being connected  Yeah, and I think that

Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. No, I mean prodigy was was big. Um, but yeah  I think like things have changed a lot since prodigy and aol versus, you know  Where we're at with google and twitter and snapchat and a lot of these new forms of communication  I think you you used one word that I completely agree with which is louder. I think that  These social media companies have in many people's minds are still startups  I think people think of them as being run by kids who are wearing hoodies who are um, you know biking to work  And hanging out in san francisco somewhere and that's just not the case  You know, these are these people have more influence than maybe any other american corporation  and uh any other segment of american corporations and so um  You know, I I think that's been the transition that i've seen and that i'm really trying to drill into  You know with with the work that I do which is that  now more than ever these companies have a huge amount of influence more that we more than we even understand and um,  and one way that we're starting to see this sort of bubble up is by giving a voice to people that are ill-informed and  Uneducated and sometimes hateful and um, and you know, it wouldn't surprise me and you know the other  portion of this is that um being anonymous online has become more  More what more?  Poisonous more more you can be more effective and just and spread more hate through the world  by being anonymous now than you could in the 90s with alo and prodigy and so  you know, my guess is that the people that are making horrific comments like you know you the  Like some of the things that you mentioned earlier, um, we're probably done under anonymous handles on twitter or under anonymous  Screen names on reddit and uh and anonymity online  Although I was  I long championed that i'm starting to question the the value we thought it was going to be a great thing and now i'm wondering if we have

Transcript:  That's a lot of responsibility. Give you a small anecdote, you know, like my one of my friends recently  Announced that she was pregnant and you know what I told her was that we were talking about google's  Influence. She has a google home in her living room  And what I said was that google probably knew that she was pregnant before even her husband  And and we were talking about the responsibility of like knowing that type of information  You know these companies use deductive reasoning based on your behavior and search results and a variety of other things to to figure out  What your general disposition is?  The information that you're looking for, you know, sometimes it can be very helpful and and obviously these companies try to do that  But um other times it can be emotionally manipulative. So, you know amazon is trying to sell more products  Day after day more and more products year over year, right?  And and facebook is trying to get you to spend more time on their network  Day after day and year over year and the way that they do that is by toying with your emotions using little red dot  little red dots to show you that you have a notification or  Maybe promoting your you know some girl that you have a crush on in your news feed and there are so many decisions like that  That are happening behind closed doors.

Transcript:  Kashmir hill wrote this story five years ago for forbes how target figured out a team  I remember that yeah before her father did it's because of where she went in the store and what she was doing  Uh, so this is not new. In fact, I remember this from years ago  Just from your zip code people could tell what magazines you might subscribe to or were likely to what kind of cars  Yeah, you're likely to buy but it's just gotten so  Refined  And so good now. I want to take a break, but we come back  Let's I mean who has more data than anyone about you?  I'm i'm gonna you could say google and maybe it's google, but I think mark zuckerberg might have  More data than anybody else about you and I also worry about what he might be doing with that data  We're gonna take a little break  When we come back and talk about mark's latest hire, but first  word from wordpress  WordPress runs 28 of all the websites in the world including my  Blog including quartz including some of the best publications in the world  they run websites for many major companies is because the wordpress platform is  Powerful robust and easy to use if it's good enough for these big businesses. It's great enough for your small business  You don't need to be a web expert to create a site at wordpress.com  You can make it easier for your customers to find you to connect with you  It's really important frankly if you're a bit used to be if you're a business  And you didn't have a yellow pages ad  Well, how was anybody going to find you then it was if you don't have an answering machine  How are people gonna leave you message now? I think if a business doesn't have a website i'm  Even if it's a plumber  I'm much less likely to use them because I can't find out more stuff about them  You gotta have a website and I know you you know  If if you are a plumber or or you know a school teacher a handyman or a restaurant that's not your  Designing web pages ain't your business and you don't want to make it your business, but you got to have that website  wordpress.com start with amazing templates  Experts who can guide you through the entire process they have the best support and wordpress.com is a community  I've run self-hosted wordpress since the early 2000s  But when I move my site to wordpress.com suddenly i'm part of a larger community people follow me  It's there's a front page they can promote your  Your stories on there and and I have half a million followers now on wordpress and that blew me away that happened so quickly  You'll boost your visibility too because of course search engine optimization that's built in and these guys have been doing it a long time  They know exactly what buttons and knobs to put push  Social sharing makes it very easy for your readers to spread the word about your site everywhere else  Lots of wordpress if you have a business site, I I turn on the amp plug-in. I highly recommend that that way  Uh your pages load faster on mobile. Thanks to google amp technology  I turn on a number of really great plugins that make my site better automatically  HTTPS automatically very easy  And I want you to go there right now because we've got a special deal at wordpress.com  Twit you get 15 off any new plan purchase. I registered when my daughter was born 25 years ago  I registered her name.com and I registered it for 20 years. I figured if she doesn't use it by then  I just renewed it  She doesn't use it by then. I could probably let it go but I kept it and now 25 years later. She says  I need that website  I said go to wordpress.com start it. We'll uh, we'll hook it up  It's very easy to connect it to the domain name and uh, and then you'll be  abbylaport.com  wordpress.com  Twitch save 15%  On your brand new site right now  so mark zuckerberg, uh  We I don't we've talked about this before I feel like he's gonna run for president and given the power  That he has with the facebook platform  I think he could just win just by you know, pushing a couple of knobs  Slightly skewing the news feed and it's over  He just hired now. He says over and over i'm not running except that he's doing a 50 state tour to meet people in every state  He's announced that maybe I am a christian after all I i'm not an atheist anymore  Anyway that much I know for sure  And he is now hired  At a pollster  Joel benenson  Who was chief advisor to barack obama chief strategist of hillary clinton's failed campaign now that may not be the best resume builder, but  And he is in his bio  It says he's the only democratic pollster in history to have played a leading role in three winning presidential campaigns mark zuckerberg has hired him  Oh, yeah to work for the charity  Come on  do you guys  a  Is mark zuckerberg gonna run for president 2020 and b  Who could stop him?

Transcript:  When they when they created the charity the mark and priscilla chan sort of charity  They changed the bylaws of facebook  To literally say and should mark zuckerberg take a government job.

Start time: 2636.34
End time: 2667.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what i'm saying. They're not gonna make him divest and he could he could run facebook in the country  What happens if even just a small group of engineers who support him for president decide  Again with the whole you know, very small percentage of people making decisions that affect  millions or billions of people facebook has two billion users not obviously here in the u.s, but  Millions of users to say well, we're only going to show positive stories about uh about mark zuckerberg  You can show it all hands meeting

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean there already made that decision because that was part of the reporting that we did while I was  formerly at gizmodo which was that they they wouldn't allow stories about  Facebook to trend within the trendy news column on the site and similarly they were very strict about what stories they allowed to trend  Concerning mark zuckerberg, so they're definitely controlling the pr around his name. I just think that  You know  People are sort of jumping to conclusions with a lot of this. Um a lot of the decisions made around mark zuckerberg  I think he has to treat himself  Similarly to a politician because facebook is all about trust right the second you stop trusting the network  You stop posting to it and you stop interacting with all of their different web properties  And so I think part of the reason why he's hired so many um  Political experts is because he is trying to sort of rebrand himself after you know  There was a long time when people hated mark zuckerberg and uh, because it was a social network because of the social network, right?  Exactly. Yeah, so you know, I think  We've we've sort of enough time has passed that um that a lot of people have forgotten about that movie  I think but um, but he still faces an uphill battle  in terms of uh in terms of you know getting people to  um to see him as someone that they'd want to have a drink with at the bar and  Ultimately, that's kind of what he he champions facebook as it's like it's all about communities and sharing ideas  And it's essentially this like virtual bar that you can go to and hang out with  Uh to hang out with people and and and talk about you know different ideas, but um, he's got I gotta say he's got dead eyes

Why would he want to he's runs  Facebook is bigger than the u.s. He runs facebook. I think here's mark my words  He will run for president a nation will be desperate will be thirsty for somebody a technocrat  Who seems intelligent who seems like he can solve  Intractable problems that we're facing and he said I have a solution look. I don't need the money. I'm not in it for the money  I just want to make the world a better place. That's all i've ever wanted to do  And uh, and and he's not going to be blatant on facebook. It's going to be very subtle. You won't even know  But it will absolutely  Gently push people and he's going to win  Well, I mean  I'm just gonna say I don't want to offend anybody, but I think we've had our rock moment in 2016  I think the pendulum now has to swing.

How do you feel?  How do you feel? How do you feel and they were able to build a model?

Transcript:  And there are less faces. I believe was another um key point from that study  You know, the thing is that facebook is actively and has published. Um  Research on this type of stuff  Um, so, you know, this is this happens to be an independent. Um  An independent organization, I believe but like but facebook is actively researching this stuff  And they have published publicly, you know information about how they can determine your general  Disposition so like whether you're sad whether you're happy and then also how they can influence it. So by you know promoting more  um depressing stories in your news feed they can actually affect your general disposition and  This is something they openly admitted around like 2012. I believe so  um, we can only guess you know where they're at now, I think that's what what terrifies me is that there's no  um, there's no regulation in place for them to have to disclose any of the  The studies that they're doing on the psychology of their users and on like the the emotions of their users and  This instagram studies reminds us of the fact that a lot can be determined by your behavior online  And um by the things that you decide to post by the keywords that you decide to use in tweets

You can search google for dogs, you know search your google photos for dogs. It's very good. Well  interestingly, uh face instagram users  uh who were depressed tended to choose the inkwell filter and  Happy ones tended to choose valencia.

Transcript:  Oh, no, we're depressed  We didn't even know it  You know and  I think I think we have you have a good article on mashable  Is is I think it was is google eating the world or is it facebook eating the world?  Google eating the world eating the open internet, but I call it the world because what else is there?  That's the world we live in. Yeah, that's the world we live in. I think we are completely  Underestimating what all of this date what all of this data that we're giving facebook and google will be used for for instance  Somebody asked me today on the radio show whatsapp wants my contact list. I don't want to give it to them  I said well what they say they're going to do with that  Is uh, you know store it on their server and if somebody you know in your contact list joins whatsapp  They'll send you a message saying hey your buddy's on whatsapp. You want to connect with them?  but what I think they're really doing is  imagine if you had a billion people's  Contact list and then you crossed referenced it  You would know all all the relationships anybody has you would know who they talk to a lot who they talk to a little  You would know who they work with  Uh there we had rob read on last week his new book. Uh, it's just fantastic. It's called after on  And in it, I don't think it's a spoiler because this happens very early on there's a app called flutter  Uh that is based on machine learning and uh, three of the pro  Protagonists go into a bar and flutter pops up a coupon offer  But it's more than that because they know because of when they arrived at the bar that and that their co-workers that they must be  Having a work meeting  And this is minor right? Obviously they could figure all that stuff out  Flutter actually becomes sentient, but that's that's another  Another matter entirely, but i'm not worried. I am actually not worried about you know  Skynet and sentience i'm much more worried about  What will really happen and it by the way will happen?  I think quickly it will be  Like a catalytic reaction  It will be hockey stick like where all of a sudden the critical mass of data will be reached may have already happened  we just don't know it and  Facebook will know everything and we'll have so much data about you. They will know more about you than you do  Right

Transcript:  This is good for business driving who's driving that growth. It's technology companies primarily and so  um  Yeah, so I think that you know, we're living in a time where you know, it's similar to the 1920s  These are essentially the robber barons of our time they are building businesses that have disrupted entire industries  I mean amazon by purchasing whole foods  Has suddenly  You know is suddenly threatening the entire grocery  Industry, you know, that's that's wild and and and any of these companies can do that by acquiring a certain business or by  Deciding that they're going to put resources into a given area they can completely upend  Industries that have existed for for decades and so you see it with tesla amazon, you know  Facebook is sort of a new like social media is sort of a new thing  But um, but certainly they have the resources to just drill in on on any industry and upend it and even apple, you know  With watches right, you know, that's something that for a long time people thought couldn't be upended couldn't be disrupted and um  And tech companies have the power to essentially flip switch and decide  that um that they're going to take over an industry and that's just the the time that we live in

Start time: 3581.54

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that  in every  major  section of  our history where we've had a  series of technological innovation  Um, like the industrial revolution, I think those people probably also felt they were living in a dystopia  um  And didn't know there's a lot of uncertainty. I think that that's very true  um, but I  Don't know. I mean there's always a part of me that just believes in the inherent goodness of most people  Um, even the people who have all the power a lot of them are decent people who make mistakes sure but  Um, I don't know. I I think i'll still hold on to my star fleet  star trek  Future someday. That's we'll we'll get there. That's not happening. Look like

Transcript:  Yeah, but I believe it does mean that you're you're necessarily pessimistic right like I love technology i've made a career  Playing with it and learning more about it and that will never change. I'm an optimist at heart  However, I have I have access to  things that a lot of people don't and um,  and I think it would be wrong for me not to try to relay some of that information to  Essentially, that's my job as a journalist, right?  it's to talk to people that are working at these companies and figure out what's going on on the inside and then  Hopefully relab relay that information to the public and I think the one thing like there seems to be a big disconnect between  Um people using the services and downloading apps and looking at this, you know, what has been called the black box  um that that runs a lot of these um  a lot of these apps  And what's going on behind the scenes how algorithms work?  How you know the the logic that's used to um to sort this information out, you know  There is a proficiency problem in america right now  And when people hear the word algorithm, I think they just like they don't understand what that means and they get intimidated by it  in a lot of cases over  Definitely and and I don't blame them because it used to happen for me until I  Started learning about some of the algorithms that sort through these things  So like the algorithm the suggestion algorithm in amazon or the trendy news algorithm at facebook, you know  These are actually very rudimentary  Um algorithm problems. They're they're it's it's you know, it's elementary logic, you know  they're not quite as complicated as you might think and um,  And I think that most people don't understand that and also we don't have access to  To the to what that line of logic is and I think that to me is more troubling than anything  We have no idea how  Facebook for example decides to sort our newsfeed. I think  In the long term like in my lifetime, that's going to be a problem and I problem right now

Start time: 3755.08
End time: 3772.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a problem right now. That's why facebook is powerful because they use algorithms to to shade the feed  And we don't know  What they're I mean we could presume they're optimizing for stickiness  But maybe not because remember, uh, they they deprecated the link bait, which was probably very sticky

Transcript:  My money I think we have a lot more ability to affect the direction of technology than than we think we do  um, and i'm i'm really grateful for people who are trying to explain and bring to light and share with the rest of us what's  Going on inside these companies  because I think um  In some cases it turns out that you know if consumers care enough if the users of these products care enough  Even though there may be two billion users of facebook. They can still make a difference  I mean look at the the delete uber campaign, right? Like i'm not going to say that that  That fixed uber's problems overnight, but it definitely has made the company  take seriously its issues in a way that um any amount of negative press coverage or  Or a government action had had failed to do so. I I think they're you know, if people care enough  And they're aware enough about how facebook and google are and amazon are affecting our worlds  I think that we have a lot more power than than we give ourselves credit for

And you know if you if you've used find my iphone, you know, you realize there is a better way  And that's kind of what the tracker is. It's like find my iphone for all of your other stuff  So what you do is you take the tracker. It's it's they're two little ones now  There's a tracker bravo. It's about the size of a quarter but lighter  It's anodized aluminum and they have the new tracker pixel which has it's even smaller and lighter  I think it's the smallest bluetooth tracker ever and it it lights up with pics with the leds around that so you can helps you  Find stuff not just with audio  Signals, but with lights you put it on your keys. That's the first place  I put it my my backpack and then I put it my luggage you put it on the remote control  You put it on the dog. They have it's small enough to put in a collar and they have a little waterproof  Holder for it to protect it  And now once you pair it to your phone  You could see where your stuff is where your trackers are or whatever the trackers attached to on your phone you get a map  But here's the other cool thing  If somebody takes your let's say let's say you put on your keys  Now, you know when you leave the room your phone will say hey you left your keys  And by the way the other way around too when you leave your phone lying around your keys start going weep weep weep  You can also if you say oh, I know I left my phone somewhere around here  Press a button on the tracker that'll make the phone even if it's silence make the phone make noise. That's very handy  I really like that  But also there's this issue because once you get out of bluetooth range out of a hundred feet  You all the tracker software could say is the last time I saw this but here's the beauty part  There are four and a half million actually  It's got to be more now probably might more like five million trackers out there all over the world  And in any time anybody running the tracker software sees your keys with the tracker on it  It'll ping your phone and now your map will be updated to the last time anybody saw your keys  So no matter where they are  Look at this map all over the world  You can find your stuff  The lightest bluetooth tracking device on the market. That's the tracker pixel  Both the tracker pixel and the tracker bravo have replaceable batteries unlike some of these other guys  So you don't have to throw it out when it's you could just put the battery in every year  It's bluetooth la goes about a year  I love it  Take advantage of trackers 30 day money back guarantee  No risk see that you could put the there's engraving you can put on the tracker bravo or a picture  And if you go right now to the tracker.com and use our promo code twit  You get 20 off your order.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I  I don't it won't hurt  Hbo every single hbo fan  Will avoid it as a spoiler or even if they watch it  They will absolutely watch the last episode and nobody's going to cancel an hbo subscription because they saw the last episode on the internet

Start time: 5939.34
End time: 5959.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the real risk is not the shows but the individual and personal information to me  It's emails if i'm rich and emails like yeah, and if there's a richard pepler, you know saying in an email  All that tirian lannister. He's too short or whatever  That could be embarrassing. In fact, that's what cost  uh, amy sony that cost

Start time: 5960.82
End time: 5973.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Scalera job at sony was those emails but surely hbo has a pretty good idea what's in their own emails, right? So  I I my guess is that unless there's something explosive. They're not they're not going to negotiate personal phone numbers of actors

Start time: 5973.78
End time: 5986.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No big deal. You pay a little money you get the actors all to change their numbers. That's not a big deal  Uh, if there were I can't you know  Unless there's unless there's nude well, even if there are nude photos of cersei lannister, what are they going to do? Shame?

Start time: 6000.54
End time: 6029.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Push back a little bit because what you're saying implies that there are no  There's no risk like this this hack is meaningless and that there are no risks involved in this hack  Which is I think a little bit overstated right?  Like there is some money to be lost from hbo and you already said this is the most pirated television show  In the world or I think was was what he said and so, you know if that's the case then  Then you know, maybe there are more people that would watch a leaked episode than than we realize and you know  I'm sure there are

Start time: 6030.40
End time: 6038.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But i'm sure there are but I mean but there but those people here's my argument  Is that those people who are watching leaked episodes are already torrenting hbo? And

Start time: 6039.14
End time: 6047.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, they're the biggest fans now, maybe maybe they don't buy hbo  But if they're not they weren't buying it before either probably right because they're right. That's my that's my argument

Start time: 6048.38
End time: 6051.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Those people are already torrenting television

Start time: 6051.62
End time: 6077.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And if you're a big fan, I think a not insignificant number of them probably still pay for hbo  The only people who don't are people who can't afford it. And so they justify saying well, I can't afford it  But I still have game of thrones fan  But I think if you're a real fan and you can't afford it you pay for it because you want to support hbo  I don't yeah, I mean i'm sure there's consequences. There's not six million dollars worth of consequences  And right more to the point the larger risk is encouraging more attacks

Start time: 6078.86
End time: 6080.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Yeah, I I can't agree with that

Start time: 6080.92
End time: 6090.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean the bigger risk is that six million dollars is paying six million dollars is opening a door to  A lot of other people stealing your stuff and saying well you paid these guys. Why not pay us?

Start time: 6091.00
End time: 6109.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, no, I would the other thing is six million dollars buys an awful lot of network hardening and uh,  You know pen testing and other kinds of security measures that might actually make a significant difference in preventing future attacks  I actually think that one of the reasons is like one of the reasons pascal had to had to quit was because sony

Start time: 6109.64
End time: 6122.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did such a crappy job of protecting their network even in the face of multiple  Threats and they knew that it was a problem and they said man, we don't care about security. That was a spectacularly bad setup at sony

Start time: 6122.14
End time: 6124.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah  So that was part of their problem. Yeah

Start time: 6126.04
End time: 6175.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I just think that you know  There has to be a circumstance in this hbo like if if the hackers truly have 1.5 terabytes of data  There has to be a scenario where this costs hbo more than six million dollars  And it's just something worth considering but I would agree for the most part. You don't know you don't negotiate with terrorists  I think that you would only encourage people to to do this type of to commit this type of crime  more frequently, but I think you know in  If you're evaluating the economic  Um repercussions of this there has to be a scenario where this costs hbo much more than six million dollars because i'm pretty sure in the sony hack  They lost  More than that amount. I I would think I I don't I don't know exactly what it costs them  But my guess is that it was more than six million. Oh, yeah

Start time: 6176.72
End time: 6181.16

Start time: 6207.52
End time: 6278.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think right this the one good thing you say about the sony hack is it got a lot more box office for the interview  I think far more people saw that I watched it because of the hack than didn't you know, yeah  Yeah  Now here's a bigger concern the white house. We know the white house security practices are perhaps less than perfect  There's a guy from the uk and he calls himself email prankster who has had email conversations  with  Anthony scaramoji before he got fired  That wouldn't be a weird thing except he was posing as ryan's prebus  He is all this made me laugh he has sent emails to tom bossert eric trump  He has posed as jared kushner  the the homeland security advisor  Said he thought it was he was talking with jared kushner.

Transcript:  Uh, we have some good news to celebrate the eff continues to beat the podcast troll  I we we received a letter from personal audio some years ago asking us  For I think two and a half million dollars  That was a mistake because you're supposed to if you're let me just a little tip  For uh patent trolls out there you should always ask for an amount  That's less than it would cost to defend the case and in two and a half millions is considerably more  Even than the highest estimate, uh, they did settle with a number of companies which gave them a bank roll enough of a bank roll to appeal  So the eff won with the patent and trademark office. They got them to overturn the patent. So  personal audio appealed it to the u.s. Court of Appeals  And for the federal circuit which reels is the washington dc court that rules mostly on patent law  They've ruled also now in favor of the electronic frontier foundation. I would say yay, it's over  But they could still go to the supreme court if they wanted to no word about whether uh personal audio will continue to appeal it  But that's that's one that really sent a chill a few years ago. They sued adam carola. They sued  Npr sued a lot of uh companies looking for some money and apparently it already won money from apple and others  Uh in other patent troll  cases  Good news for uh a good man and a good friend mike masnick of tech dirt  He was being sued by a guy who claims to have invented email  Masnick, uh pooh-poohed the claim in fairly strong terms  So, uh this guy sued  Using the by the way the same attorney who represented a hulk hogan in his case against gawker  Uh as you imagine mike tech dirt is not a huge company and probably doesn't have very deep pockets  But fortunately a number of people have come to their aid and a quarter million dollar defense fund has been raised from  Of all people the charles coke foundation craig list founders craig newmark union square ventures automatic the wordpress parent our sponsor  And the freedom of the press foundation more than a quarter million dollars. That should be enough  Or at least it should help in mike masnick's defense  Mike said the lawsuit has already taken a massive toll on us and our ability to function and report  And it I have to say it's a fairly frivolous lawsuit. This guy's  Claims are you know a completely nonsense

Start time: 6554.52
End time: 6580.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  leo that that guy actually filed the same lawsuit against uh gizmodo  Or against gawker media. Um, and while it was like a rider to the or a side  Sideshow to the the main hulk hogan one, but he won like that's one of the one of the reasons  He's going after tech dirt is because he won against gawker media  Because they had no defenses. They had already been blown away by hogan. You know, they've already been

Start time: 6581.04

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, well and I was there at the time. I was working for gizmodo. Um, and  It was you know, there was a lot of it was a painful time  I think for a lot of the reporters there because there were only a couple of articles that had to be removed  Following the hogan lawsuit and one of them was this article that called into question  This individual who claims to have invented email?  when you know every  computer expert  That we that that these reporters could contact with said otherwise  and so um, so anyways, yeah, it was a really painful time and you know, and it's not  There you go. Yeah, that that's um, so we're right now  We're looking at the page on gizmodo and the story had to be removed and gawker media had a really strict policy about never  removing any of the stories that were written  Especially if they were true and so um, so in this case, um  Yeah, it was it was it was rough and it's kind of it's sad to see that
