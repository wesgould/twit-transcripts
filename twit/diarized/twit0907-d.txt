Transcript:  Today's the special edition of TWIT for Christmas Day 2022.  Of course we're recording this ahead of time because I can't, you know, I don't want everybody to come in on the holiday.  But I am thrilled that we have a great little panel for us.  We've already done something fun for our holiday at TWIT.  And I think Lisa suggested, why don't you bring in the old men.  We did the women last time. We'll do the old men. I got the all the old men are here. Doc Searls, welcome. Good to see you.  I think I'm probably the oldest.  You might have a pride of place.

Transcript:  It's no longer my bookshelf. My books are on there, but my kid, who's 26 years old and his girlfriend, rearranged them by color.  That's hysterical.  Which is not a literary thing to do. But it's a decorative thing to do.

End time: 374.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's what's so interesting, isn't it? Yeah, we all started when we started.  We were youngsters and now we're the old ones.  Anyway, I thought I'd bring in the people with experience.  How about that? People who know.  What we're going to do this week because it's the only we next week will be a best of before we come back and do live stuff the week after tomorrow.  From tomorrow on will be best ofs.  But I thought we should do what we often do, which is a look back at the year 2022.  So I have picked the top 15 stories from 2022 and I invite you all to weigh in.  I didn't do anything like special, like special.  I didn't mention Windows 11, Paul. I'm sorry.

Start time: 375.02
End time: 377.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_11

Start time: 378.18
End time: 395.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So come back here. You sit right down and do these stories.  Mr. Grinch, I didn't do anything specifically about the Conti gang or anything like that.  But there is actually quite a bit of security news.  How could you not talk about the year without some security news?

Start time: 395.14
End time: 397.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Do you hire out, Steve? I might need you around the holidays.

Start time: 398.81
End time: 466.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's great for children's parties and bar mitzvahs.  Yeah, everybody needs a Grinch in their lives.  Also, not a whole lot of open source news, Doc. I apologize.  But actually the only open source news I found was there is it was one kind of serious Linux security flaw, which was quickly patched and and and it was over.  And in fact, one of the things I noticed when I went through all the old shows to put this together was how many stories we talk about that seemed like a big deal at the time.  Right. That ended up really if I brought them up now, you'd go, well, that never nothing.  For instance, I'll give you a good example. Joe Rogan and Spotify.  Remember, the beginning of the year, that was a huge story that Joe Rogan because of his covid misinformation.  Spotify refused to take him down.  So Neil Young, among others, said, well, I don't want to be on Spotify.  Spotify took Spotify took down Neil Young's music, but didn't do anything to Joe Rogan.  We found out that they'd already paid him 200 million dollars.  So I guess I understand why.

Start time: 467.52
End time: 478.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Shouldn't we still be outraged by this, though?  Which all of it.  That's your Rogan getting that much money.  Joe Rogan spreading covid misinformation.  I think, you know, absolutely nothing about it.

Start time: 479.18
End time: 490.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They kind of handled it by him saying, OK, OK, OK.  And then Spotify saying, well, we'll we won't we'll put a notice on it if it's if it's really bad.  And then it just kind of went away.  Cigarettes kind of thing.

Start time: 491.50
End time: 499.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, it's all it's all snow on the water.  You know, it kind of sparkles on the way down.  It looks fun. It's the water in his gun.  Yeah. It's so now there are 14.

Start time: 500.56
End time: 502.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now there are 14. Yeah, it's our media.

Start time: 503.74
End time: 514.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Plus, plus Joe Rogan got out jerked by Miles.  That was the other thing.  He was kind of the big jerk of media.  And now, of course, we have a much bigger one.  We'll get to it some point. Yeah, that's exactly what happened.

Start time: 514.06
End time: 520.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It became less it seemed mild, in fact, compared to the jerk bar went up way higher.

Start time: 521.08
End time: 532.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  The big it's also it's also human nature, right?  That outrage doesn't last very long.  This is the problem that politicians are always saying wrong with me more, Steve.  Oh, rage can last for a really long time.

Start time: 535.63
End time: 616.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's still mad about ads in the Windows 11 menu bar.  Don't get started here. Don't get started.  The big story that did last and lasted all year started in February,  which was, of course, the invasion of Ukraine by Russia.  And it turned out to be a fairly big tech story.  A lot of, you know, tech companies got involved.  We had stories from The Washington Post about how Google Maps  was being used to track the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  In fact, one of the most interesting things that came out of Ukraine  is that you don't have to be a secret agent to gather information  about what's going on in not only in this war, but in general because of the Internet.  So much stuff is online now that, in fact, the NSA and the CIA created  groups to go out and go through public information for their reports, for their research.  Also in the story, Russia cutting off Facebook and Twitter,  trying to protect their populace from any information about the invasion.  We even had video from Twitter of Russian police asking on the streets  to see Russian citizens' smartphones and see what they were doing, what they were doing with them.

Start time: 619.33
End time: 644.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think one of the interesting questions is, we're seeing all this technology leaving Russia.  We are hearing that the professionals have all left.  And you wonder, like, OK, what will happen when this gets resolved?  Do they come back? Do they go back? Yeah.  And if not, how can Russia, how can any modern large country exist these days without its technological base?  How does it have an economy that functions?

Start time: 644.14
End time: 664.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I talked this morning with a new advertiser who had a team in Russia, mostly composed of young men.  They got them all out because they were worried about being conscripted.  And so they were happy to go, and some of them are in Montenegro, some of them are in Poland.  They got them out, which I thought was quite interesting.

Start time: 665.32
End time: 679.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I don't think this is in the notes, but all of the companies that left Russia because of this,  not just tech companies, but other companies. McDonald's.  McDonald's, right. I was going to say there's some company operating out of McDonald's locations that is not McDonald's.

Start time: 680.88
End time: 705.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But they have a Horosho Mac. I don't know.  The name of the new McDonald's is called Big Hit, and it looks a lot like it.  The new restaurant is in the old Russian McDonald's stores, which I guess I'm told, oh, their slogan is tasty, and that's it.

Start time: 710.00
End time: 711.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I thought it would be tasty and if that.

Start time: 714.07
End time: 716.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't ask what's in meat, but it's like meat.

Start time: 719.91
End time: 721.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There are companies that stayed in Ukraine though.

Start time: 722.28
End time: 762.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  In fact, a lot of our tech companies did. That's right, McPaul. Grammarly stayed in Ukraine.  We had a story this year about a company that did Darth Vader's voice, of course, James Earl Jones, aging out of that role.  That company, which was creating an artificial version of James Earl Jones' voice, was in Ukraine.  In fact, the story was kind of horrific because it talked about the programmers huddling in the basement while Kiev was being bombarded and still working because they were on deadline to get it out.  This is a story that is not over. This is one of those stories that did have legs, absolutely.

Start time: 762.08
End time: 779.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the internet angle to it so much is Zelensky and his use of the internet.  Speak to the world, to lead his country, to keep everybody together.  I think that if there were no internet or if there were no internet there, it would have been very different.

Start time: 780.46
End time: 787.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And showed us pictures of the horrors. We saw in real time what was going on. It's just hard to discount that.

Start time: 789.68
End time: 817.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Zelensky, by the way, Time magazine named as Person of the Year just this week.  And I think rightly so. Quite a leader.  It just shows you sometimes you elect somebody with a TV background. It's a good thing.  He clearly knows how to work in the media. He was a comedian who played in a Ukrainian comedy TV show, The President of Ukraine.  And I guess did it so well that he got elected as actual president.

Start time: 818.94
End time: 827.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think he's also the shortest world leader since Napoleon.  How tall is he? He's shorter than anybody's width. I don't know how tall that is.

Start time: 828.00
End time: 848.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He does seem to be the head below. Although I have to say, Lisa and I visited in the Elysee Palace with President Sarkozy.  And he was wearing lifts and still didn't go up to our shoulders. So he may not be the all-time smallest.  We have to screw those two guys up and see.  Put him head to head, back to back. You know what? He's small in stature. He's huge.

Start time: 849.54
End time: 855.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  He's huge otherwise. He was in there dancing with the stars thing too. He was like a dancer.

Start time: 856.50
End time: 875.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's wild. The Hacker Collective Anonymous, this was in a day after the invasion, declared cyber war against Russia.  They disabled a state news site. But Steve, I don't think that was it. I don't remember reading a lot more about that.

Start time: 877.07
End time: 896.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think one of the interesting consequences of this were the sanctions that were levied against Russia.  And then their subsequent inability to get cyber currency transferred into them,  which caused all kinds of problems for their traditional ransomware operations.

Start time: 897.88
End time: 913.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You remember that ICANN was asked to revoke the .ru Russian Internet TLD and other Russian domains and said,  Yeah, no, we're not going to do that. And that was the right thing to do, I think.  Yes. Yes.  Let's see.

Start time: 914.28
End time: 918.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's interesting, Leo. It's like one thing I'm learning on Mastodon.

Start time: 919.81
End time: 923.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're learning something on Mastodon.  Because you taught me everything I know.

Start time: 925.06
End time: 943.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that reflex to ban? It's really interesting to watch.  There's somebody bad on that server, you must ban that entire server, versus, no, let people have the choice of whom they choose to ban.  And you see that kind of geopolitics play out at a tiny federated level. It's just fascinating.

Start time: 943.42
End time: 958.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's kind of a good point. I didn't even think of that. I get always many reports every day as an administrator of our own Mastodon instance.  I'm meant to apologize about that.  They say, please suspend Paul Gerrard. Please just get rid of him. No, they don't say that.  Or I'm going to suspend the whole server.

Start time: 959.00
End time: 960.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's all Elon Musk jokes, basically.

Start time: 961.50
End time: 973.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, but I do see that. And in most cases, I say, you should ban them from your feed,  but they're not committing a crime that would cause them to be banned from the Fed first.

Start time: 973.00
End time: 979.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And didn't we just hear that the Senate passed unanimously to ban TikTok?  By voice vote. Acclamation.

Start time: 980.00
End time: 981.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We need Ant here for the moral panic banner.

Start time: 982.20
End time: 1054.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. We're going to get to that, actually. That'll be in our in memoriam section. No, no, that'll be...  I'll give you a rundown of what we're going to talk about. We started with Ukraine. We'll be talking about the crypto crash.  These are what I kind of going through all of our old shows thought these were the stories that kind of as a whole had an important...  Steve's hiding his face. He doesn't want to talk about that.  Acquisitions. There were quite a few. Some made it. Some didn't. The metaverse. Twitter and Musk. Yeah, we have to.  Apple. The tech worker revolt. We will talk a little bit about hacking.  Social. That's where we'll talk about TikTok. Pass keys. The streaming wars. The AI revolution.  Science. And then we'll go through a list of some of the people who we lost this year. We're going to cover...  Will you be serving dinner?  No, it's not going to be that long. I'm going to move this along. I promise.  Actually, I was going to ask you, Steve, because talking about Ukraine, one of the things I think everybody feared, certainly I did,  was a Russian cyber war against the West. That didn't seem to happen.

Start time: 1055.72
End time: 1095.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Not against us, although Ukraine has been having huge problems across their border, not surprisingly.  Although it's been tit for tat. They've also been attacking in Russia as well.  So to me, one of the really weird things is how differently we regard warfare, cyber versus conventional.  It's almost like cyber is allowed to go on underneath the cover, but because no one immediately dies when something explodes,  it's like, well, okay, we're going to get back at them. It's just this weird dichotomy we have at this point.

Start time: 1096.02
End time: 1100.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How are the Ukrainians doing at cyber, Steve? At both defense and offense?

Start time: 1100.10
End time: 1121.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They're holding their own. It's really remarkable, I think. They're under attack. You can't really defend against DDoS attacks.  They're being DDoSed and ransomware attacks. So there's a lot of back and forth across the border,  but it seems that they're giving as good as they're getting.

Start time: 1123.10
End time: 1152.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  To some degree, I think Russia's maybe waging a proxy war against the West by countenancing all the ransomware groups within its borders.  They're tacitly saying, yeah, you go ahead. You go ahead and attack American companies.  But it's interesting that both the US and Russia are acting about cyber warfare somewhat like they would be acting like nuclear warfare,  because the potential for mutually assured destruction is significant.

Start time: 1154.70
End time: 1162.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, isn't Russia attacking the US or the West in several ways kind of all the time anyway, to some degree?

Start time: 1163.12
End time: 1196.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  As a government, well, the GRU, yeah, of course, yeah, and the so-called Internet Research Agency,  there was the Russian bots that were using Twitter for misinformation and trolling to that degree.  But what I was thinking more is like taking down the grid, attacking some of our weak spots.  Yeah, that's terrorism.  Yeah, financial system. Honestly, I'm not sure, but I feel like we are somewhat vulnerable in those critical areas.  But what protects us is the fear that we would do it back.

Start time: 1196.04
End time: 1210.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think that it must be the case that we both sides are deeply penetrated into each other's networks.  And so it's as you say, let's just leave well enough alone and let's go look at Ukraine instead.

Start time: 1211.06
End time: 1253.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. Some have said there should be a Geneva Convention for cyber warfare to make some stuff off limits,  as we have done with, for instance, chemical weapons. Doesn't mean you wouldn't have things happening.  Electronic Arts and other reactions scrubbed the Russian soccer teams from its FIFA and hockey games.  That's what's wrong with FIFA.  Really? It cracks me up to watch the Olympics and other sports and see people who are clearly,  it's the Russian team, but they're not allowed to play under the Russian flag.  So they're under the IOC flag. But it's the, come on. It's a thin, thin veil.

Start time: 1256.66
End time: 1270.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah. You know what, though, that probably works pretty well against Putin, right?  That's basically a way to embarrass that country on a world stage without doing anything violent, right?  Yeah, good point. Yeah.  That probably gets under his skin.

Start time: 1271.12
End time: 1300.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  White House took this occasion, the war in Ukraine, to brief TikTok stars.  It's so funny how at the beginning of the year it was like, well, let's tell all the TikTokers about this.  And then at the end of the year, let's ban all the TikTokers about this.  TikTokers literally were invited into the White House. It wasn't just for this.  So here's the TikTokers. The White House invited me and other creators to talk about the Ukraine.

Start time: 1301.50
End time: 1305.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Decades in journalism. But no, this guy definitely gets to go to the White House. No problem.

Start time: 1306.76
End time: 1322.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, so I had mixed feelings about it too. That's right. It's like, well, they'll be easy to persuade, right?  Because they don't have the built-in calluses that a journalist might have.  On the other hand, this is who kids listen to these days. Yes or no?

Start time: 1322.04
End time: 1334.00

Transcript:  I mean, maybe Captain Crunch and Tony the Tiger could go next.  Oh my grubby.  So you said I wasn't old enough.

Start time: 1334.36
End time: 1350.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, no, you're definitely in there. You've earned your stripes.  Finally, it was also an occasion for the tech industry to gather and raise money for Ukraine relief.  For example, Fortnite had a two-week fundraiser within the game, raised $144 million.

Start time: 1354.28
End time: 1356.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Imagine how much they could have raised if they were on iOS.

Start time: 1360.16
End time: 1446.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Actually, we often kind of look down our nose at gamers. But I have to say, when it comes to charity, I don't think...  Paul, not you.  No, Paul loves the gamers. As long as they're playing Call of Duty and they're not tea-bagging him anyway.  He loves some of the games. But no, we often badmouth them.  But really, when it comes to charity events like this, gamers have stepped up every single time. It's really kind of impressive.  The game raised $36 million in its first day alone, the final total.  $144 million going to several aid groups, including Direct Relief, the UN High Commissioners for Refugees, the UN Children's Fund, UNICEF, and the World Food Program.  League of Legends, Riot Games raised $5.5 million.  Humble Bundle, $20 million. Games on HIO, $6 million.  How much did Twitch raise for Ukraine relief? Not a penny.  So there. All right. That's the war in Ukraine seen in hindsight.  What is amazing is that it's still going on. In fact, I saw on PolitiFact, they actually had a post saying, no, the war in Ukraine is not over.  We fact-checked it. Yeah. In fact, it's escalated at this point.  Russia is showing nuclear missiles being loaded into silos as a way of kind of saber rattling.

Steve Gibson and of course, Doc Searle is a great team of grumpy old men on the show today.  Our holiday special. Our show today brought to you by 8 Sleep.  Lisa, I can say this. We slept very well last night, didn't we? It was cozy. It was warm. It was freezing.  It was literally freezing outside. But we were just gently cosseted to sleep by our 8 Sleep pod.  8 Sleep sells a mattress and they sell a pod. We like our mattress, so we got the pod, which is just like a mattress cover.  But it does an amazing thing. It fits like a fitted sheet under your mattress and then dynamically cools and heats each side of the bed.  And so Lisa likes it pretty hot. She even sometimes says, I'm turning it up to 10, which is basically volcanic.  I don't like it quite so hot. I don't have to worry. With the pod, you can sleep as cool as 55 degrees or as hot as 110 degrees.  And you might say, well, that's nice, you know, I guess in the summer and winter, but it's more than complicated.  In fact, the sleep doctor built into your pod cover will notice the room temperature, will notice you and what sleep level you're at and help ease you into a deeper sleep.  That's what's really cool about this. One of the things that really the magical things about the 8 Sleep pod cover.  So I often start kind of toasty warm because it's cold and I get in bed. And then as I fall into a deeper sleep, it eases me and your body does this.  As it gets cooler, your sleep gets deeper. And then in the morning I have it set to wake me up by slowly rise, raising the temperature.  You don't want to raise it too much because then you never get out of bed. It's just too damn cozy. I love it for the summertime.  It was when we had those hot, hot days. We've had ours for a year now. So we've been through all four seasons.  It cools you down. You don't have to turn on the air conditioning at night.  You don't have to turn on the heat at night because you're taking care of by your eight sleep.  And that deep sleep makes such a difference. You can be more confident your mind and body are moving through those restorative sleep changes,  which make such a big difference for physical recovery, but also for mental clarity and hormone regulation.  Listen, it's not a holiday miracle, but it does sound like one if better sleep is on your wish list.  And Santa didn't put a pod beneath the tree this year. Look no farther than the new pod three.

It has continued to come down, of course, but that wasn't the only crypto story.  I mean, there were a lot of stories this year. I think I think it's safe to say NF.  The shine went off the rose on FT's Wall Street Journal reporting.  NFT sales are flatlining, which is bad because if you own an NFT, you bought it with the notion that its value would be going up because that's all you got.

Seth Green had designed an entire TV show around his board ape collection.  And was upset because he thinks the TV show would no longer be able to go forward.  Because somebody stole the rights to Fred Simeon.  Well, now looking back, we can tell you there is a happy ending.  Seth Green's board ape was eventually, a month or two later, returned.  What, did the police raid?  No, Seth bought it back for $297,000.  Schmuck.  Yeah.  Yeah, a hundred thousand more than he paid for it in the first place.  You know what? You know who makes money on NFTs?  That guy who stole it. That's who makes money on it. Darkwing.  What else happened? Let's see. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.  Called crypto transformative.

Nobody, you know, there were people threatening forks and so forth.  But as far as I can tell, Ethereum survived.  And that was good for global warming. That's for sure.  Not so good for El Salvador, which changed its currency from the dollar to the Bitcoin and now can't pay its debts.  And of course, the celebrities who endorsed FTX.  Now FTX is a whole other story.

Transcript:  Having fun with it.  That began in April.  Actually, we found out later, it actually began in January that Musk secretly started  buying up Twitter, probably in violation of SEC rules because he ended up with a 9.2%  stake.  Never reported it until April of this year.  It's funny, the protocol calls it a passive stake.  Not so passive as it turns out.  Remember that Elon demanded a seat on the board, then didn't want it.  He then didn't want to buy it.

Just go to twitterisgoinggreat.com and you'll get the latest.  It starts with Elon Musk buys 9.2% stake.  Then Elon wants to buy out Twitter.  That was in April.  Then Elon might be just what Twitter needs, says the Atlantic.  Then Elon says his deal is off.  It can't happen until the bot account is on hold.  Not off.  That came later.  Until the bot account dispute is resolved.  Then in July, Elon's out.  The Bloomberg headline, Elon's out, Musk lost interest in pretending to buy Twitter.  Then shortly after that, Twitter is going to sue Elon because they want his $44 billion.  Then we started to see the texts come out of all the people like Larry Ellison saying,  how much do you need Elon?  A billion?  Elon says, can you give me two?  He says, yeah, sure, two.  No problem.  All of that came out.  Then the day before, more were going to come out and Elon was going to be deposed.  He said, all right, fine, I'll buy it.

You're trapped.  You're trapped.  And they're just indentured.  Yeah.  You know, and I'm sure there are people there because they are fans of Elon and they're  excited about what Elon might be doing with Twitter and the future of Twitter.  I'm sure there's many.  Although Manu made a really interesting point yesterday.  He said the problem with the way they fired people was they might well have fired many  of the Elon fans because they didn't.  He said you should have done the loyalty test first and then fired people who didn't pass.

And unfortunately, the one for Twitter has fallen on the floor and smashed.  The shop owner says you break it, you buy it.  Did you hear, Jeff, that he says this was inspired by Stacey?  By Stacey, yes.  Our own Stacey Higginbotham said that on one of the shows.  You break it, you buy it, Elon.  And a man has said, oh, that'd make a good turntune.  So this is the one he gave Elon right before he was fired.  He is suing, by the way, because he was fired for cause without a cause being given.  You can't, you can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He actually, he said, I thought it was funny that he brought the sink in and said, let  that sink in and all that.  And so he gave him the cartoon in the spirit of fun, but he thinks he got fired because  he wrote a little script that went into your email and quickly gathered all your performance  reviews, all the things you might need for a future job and saved him out.  And he think he got fired an hour and a half after he put that up on the company Slack.  So he thinks that's why.  But he doesn't know.  And the law does require you have, if you fire somebody for cause, you have a cause.  That's to be a reason.  I mean, we are in at will state, but if they're going to say for cause, they got to give the  cause.  Let's see one more and then we'll take a break.  The meta verse.

I'm going to have to put like a blindfold on it.  Well, pay no attention to that man in green, because our show today is brought to you by audible.com.  Lisa, is Audible our longest continuous running advertiser?  We've been doing that for at least 10 years, haven't we?  Since 2007.  2007. So five? Is that all?  Wow.  Seven is 15 years.  Holy cow.  I've been a member of Audible since 2000, so I'm in the 22 year group.  Audible saved my life with audiobooks when I had a two hour commute every day.  I don't have a two hour commute anymore, thank goodness, but I still listen to audiobooks from Audible all the time.  Audio entertainment, it's your right to choose what you hear.  You don't just listen to the elevator music.  You don't pick an airline for the movies.  When it comes to audio entertainment, choose Audible.  It's the home for stories told by the biggest stars, Ethan Hawke, Kerry Washington.  Lisa and I have both listened to the Kevin Hart audiobooks.  He's hysterical.  It just comes alive, those audiobooks from Kevin Hart.  It's home to epic adventures, chilling mysteries, can't miss comedies.  Let your imagination soar with audiobooks, podcasts, and originals.  I just started listening to this audiobook.  Somebody recommended it. Maybe it was you, Steve. I don't know.  You are not expected to understand this.  How 26 lines of code change the world.  It's actually kind of, the name is kind of a misnomer because it's a bunch, a series of essays about code.  The code in the Apollo 11 spacecraft.  And of course, the title comes from a comment.  You are not expected to understand this code.  It's kind of fun.  Audiobooks from Audible span the gamut of content.  I have, let me see, I think I have more than 500 audiobooks.

I didn't like the narrator of that one.  I hate the narrator, Dan John Miller. You're right.  But the audiobooks are so good.  That's one of the things people do is they choose the narrator.  Steve Love's, I know, The Silver Ships, and there are quite a few of those.  And the narrator on this, Grover Gardner, is one of my favorite narrators.  There's so many wonderful audiobooks.  And it's not just novels or nonfiction even.  It's performances, it's memoirs.  Their Audible plus music series is fantastic about how music is made.  You can listen to, for instance, I was listening to Alanis Morissette talking about how she wrote her songs  and then performing them. It's just wonderful.  And of course, I saw all the Expanse novels behind you.  Doc Searles over your right-hand shoulder, I guess those are your sons.  It's nice to have a giant stack.  Give me the audiobooks, I'll be honest with you.  How do you listen to so many though, Jeff?  Do you do nothing but listen to audiobooks all the time?

Transcript:  Audible is the home of storytelling.  All of your audio entertainment in one app, an incredible selection of course of audiobooks  across all genres, bestsellers, new releases, celebrity memoirs, mysteries, thrillers,  motivation, wellness, Lisa listens to a lot of business, audiobooks from Audible.  As an Audible member, you could choose one title a month to keep from their entire catalog,  which includes the latest bestsellers and new releases.  You also get full access to a growing selection of included audiobooks.  Audible Originals, I really praise Audible because their Audible Frontiers program,  for instance, is recording some of the classics in science fiction that never were made into audiobooks.  You know, if you want to listen to the Asimov Foundations series,  Audible has them all freshly recorded in their own studios and they're really fantastic.  You also have Get Podcasts.

Transcript:  Thank you, Audible.  Thank you, Audible.  Audible was with us before Amazon acquired them.  We've been there since the very beginning.  Thank you, Audible.  Moving along.  We've talked about company topics so much,  but there were some interesting stories about Apple.  Not the products so much, but Apple became briefly the first company to reach a $3 trillion market cap,  which was pretty amazing.  This was also the year Google decided to take arms against Apple,  and the Dread Green Text Bubble.  This is a campaign to get Apple to adopt RCS.  You know that the minute Apple does, Google is going to say,  yeah, we don't want to use that anymore.  Green.  Perfect. The Grinch loves the Green Bubble.  Green.  Apple also...  He's being buried in it now.  Yeah, he's very green.  Apple launched a laughable do-it-yourself repairs program.  You might have seen Micah Sargent's video.  He ordered all of the...  What was it? Hundreds of dollars worth of gear.  You read it, but if you don't send it back promptly,  they will charge you for it.  And sadly, they sent all the tools.  We had them all laid out. We have a video of it.  But they neglected to send the part.  He was going to replace the battery.  So he called them up and said, hey, the part hasn't come.  And they said, no, no, we want the tools back.  So he sent the tools back.  Literally, as the tools are in the car on the way to FedEx,  the battery arrives.

Transcript:  Early in the year, we heard that Apple was negotiating  to buy the Sunday ticket package from the NFL.  In fact, NFL Commissioner Godell, Roger Godell,  even said it will be determined by the fall.  It's now end of the year.  I think it didn't happen.  Or maybe it's going to happen.  The fall of what?  Yeah, right, the fall of Rome.  There is a little bit of a tussle over what to do with the rights,  I think.  Google and others are also bidding, or reportedly bidding.  So we'll see what happens on that.  The biggest story, Apple's story of the year, though, happened this week.  And two things happened.  First, Apple shipped out with iOS 16.2 and Mac OS 13.1  end-to-end encryption for iCloud backups,  which, Steve, you talked about,  and you gave it your green thumbs up, yes?

Start time: 4305.28
End time: 4350.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, it's very much green.  It's the real deal.  It's not on by default, so users will have to turn it on.  But when they do, with some caveats,  because, for example, iCloud.com requires a brief breach of that  in order for Apple to show you the contents of your iCloud through a website.  But if you don't use that and you turn it on,  the act of turning it on rotates the crypto keys,  and then among your devices, you're on your own.  Apple cannot save you if you lose access,  so you have to jump through some hoops in order to create some get-out-of-jail free cards.  But they finally did it.

Transcript:  Although, and, of course, one of the things everybody said is,  well, how is the federal government, the FBI, how are they going to react?  How is the Chinese government going to react?  Is England going to react where it is against the law  to not be able to offer plain text of messaging?  How is Australia going to react?  And that's yet to be seen,  because Apple will no longer be able to comply with a lawful request from any government,  once this is international. Right now it's US only.  But I think the real thing that Apple is telling the FBI right now is,  don't worry, no one's going to do it.  Because you have to be upgraded on every device.  I tried to turn it on, and it got a list of 18 devices,  including my watch and my HomePod,  that had to be fully upgraded before I could turn this on.  So it's my guess people will say, oh, that's great, thank you, Apple,  and then never do it.  But we'll see.  I'm determined to turn it on, but I still have to upgrade a few things.  It's just nuts.

The other thing Apple announced this week, which is a bit more of a shock,  they're going to open...  I'm sorry, take it back. They did not announce it.  Mark Gurman announced it, but that's as good as Apple announcing it.  Because he's very rarely wrong, Apple, according to Gurman at Bloomberg,  will allow outside app stores on iOS.  Now, the details remain to be seen, but Gurman's report had so many details  down to which executives were working on it and what was going to happen.  And the charges are being led by Andreas Vendker,  longtime software engineering vice president, who reports to Craig Federighi.  Jeff Robin, Apple's top engineering manager, is also involved.  They said what...  Gurman said what they would and wouldn't be doing, et cetera, et cetera.  But this is... Paul, you were arguing last week that Apple should be forced to do this.  Were you surprised when they did it voluntarily?

Transcript:  Google said that the average salary of a Google employee, a Google engineer, was $300,000.  This is part of their plan to convince them they don't need a union.  We learned from Vice early this year that Google had a secret project  to convince employees that unions suck.  Project Vivian, it was called.  Of course.  Apple employees, Starbucks employees, Amazon employees, all unionizing.  Amazon bombarding workers with union-busting messages.  Apple is under investigation by the National Labor Relations Board  for coercing, forcing Apple employees to go to anti-union meetings  and coercing them not to vote yes on the union.  Nevertheless, I feel like, is it fair to say this was the year  that the employees stood up and asserted their rights?

Start time: 4677.98

One thing I love about Elon is he's been so willing to have pictures, unflattering pictures taken of him.  Every Elon Musk article has a horrible picture of him.  Here he is at a white tie gala, the 2022 Met Gala.

The economic conditions changed, the balance of power changed,  there's a Democrat in the White House. I think a lot of factors.  But yes, I still buy the premise of your category here.  Is there absolutely this happened in tech and even among highly, highly paid people, they still wanted to unionize.

Start time: 4826.18

Well, we can't hire people. People don't want to work here.  That's universal. It's everywhere.

The other thing that's happening, and it's again, thank you, Elon, is I think we're realizing billionaires are not somehow inherently better than the rest of us.  Oh, for sure.

I mean, if any one of us could say, oh, no, I got 100 million in the bank, we wouldn't be worried about our, you know, where our next meal was coming from.  Certainly, Elon will never be poor.

In fact, it seems to take pleasure in it.  It's funny.  He did a.  That night, he did a private show at the punch line for about 50 people.  My daughter was there and there were a lot of Draymond Green of the of the Warriors were there.  Apparently, Elon was there as well.  And she said he did two hours and killed just Chappelle.  I'm not a fan, but he but she thought he was she'd never seen anything quite like it.  And and I think maybe that's that is that's just part of Chappelle's schtick.  He introduced Elon saying, ladies and gentlemen, the richest man in the world.  That's guaranteed to get some booze right out of the box.  Yeah, it's right there.  Who's going to say yay.  Oh, hey, wonderful.  The richest man in the world.  We love you.  And now he's only number two and he's not the richest anymore.  Right.  What venue was it in the main the main the the Warriors arena?  What does that call it?  Pretty big.  I forgot.  It's about 18,000.  Chase the Chase Center.  Yeah, it's a beautiful arena.

Then number two, Elon doxxed a guy in a car who was complaining at him, arguing that this was because of Elon Jett.  And then Bellingcat, the great investigative journalistic organization, used instated to find out the car was nowhere near an airport.  It didn't work.

Some of them are alleging that it was their fault for not patching and updating their  hosted instances of exchange server.  It's 1% of their business.  They're a $3 billion company.  So, they were only making only $30 million from their exchange server hosting, which  they have now migrating over to Microsoft 365 because they don't want it anymore.

Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, I think you're probably all right at Hover.  And if you need more, I get 100 gigabytes of storage at Hover at Fast Mail for $80 a year.  And I think that's well worth it.  Plus a lot of other wonderful services.  What else happened in the world of hacking in 2022?  Apple, Meta, and Google all were social engineered into giving hackers information.  Because all three had access for law enforcement.  Access, which was not apparently too well policed.  So by compromising the emails of law enforcement agencies, hackers were then able to ask for data from what looked like an official law enforcement.  By the way, this data does not require a subpoena.  They just go, well, you're law enforcement.  So we're going to hand that over to you.  I think that's going to change.  You look trustworthy.  It looks.  That's a good email address.  Apple and Meta both provided basic subscriber details, customer's address, phone number, and IP address in mid-2021 in response to forged emergency data requests.  The reason these companies allow this is because the requests are of an imminent danger to people, supposedly.  And so we're going to we're going to expedite this without a subpoena because we want to save lives.  The emergency orders do not require a court order.  Snap received a forged legal request from the same hackers, not known whether the company provided the data.  I think this was the lapsus gang, as I remember, actually.  Miners located in the US and the UK.  So interestingly, social engineering still is a very effective way to get information.  Cloudflare, I think, had the biggest DDoS attack of the year.  Steve, you reported on this, and I think this was the biggest.  Twenty six million requests per second in a denial of a service attack.  But, you know, Steve, there's always a bigger one.

Transcript:  Yeah, it's large fleets of bots.  And these days, there's so many vulnerable devices out on the Internet, IOT devices, largely, you know, people's routers,  that these bots take up residence and then accept commands from a central server about which IP address to attack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, it was a customer of Cloudflare that they were going after.  And so Cloudflare offers the service of blocking those.  And I'm sure that we've all, one time or another, gone to a site which is being hosted behind this kind of protection at Cloudflare.  And instead of going directly to the site, you get a little interception page that says, hold on just a second, we're checking something.  And then it allows you to go through. And were you a DDoS attack, you would not have gotten through.

Start time: 6099.08
End time: 6205.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think the big trend, we talked about it on SecurityNow two days ago, but worth just noting, is that everything is getting a lot more litigious.  We're seeing Australia and now Japan are both changing their laws in order to be proactive in attacks.  They're saying, we're going to go attack attackers before they attack us. That's all new.  Is it ever happening successfully?  No. It's just started.  So they're in the process of moving that legislation through.  They identify the attackers.  Basically, we knew who the Reval people were. We just had no grounds for attacking them.  I see.  So now they're saying, we're not going to wait to be attacked. We're deciding that we're going to be preemptive.  And we're also seeing, I think it was Turkey that was subject to the Iranian attacks earlier this year.  They're now prosecuting five of their IT staff for being complicit in this attack. We've never seen that before.  So the one thing we haven't yet seen is anyone holding the actual suppliers of the software accountable, like Microsoft, because the operating system is buggy.  And of course, the license agreement says, oh, sorry, it's all up to you. If you use the software, we're not going to be responsible for what happens.  I think we're going to begin to see that changing too.  But right now, mostly, I think the story is that the attorneys are being rolled out much more quickly than ever before.

I look forward to that.  Key of C, please.  Actually, I do want to mention, I'm actually thrilled.  We've had ITProTV as a sponsor for many years since they started, I think, back in 2013.  So it's been 10 years and I'm very pleased to announce it's going to start tomorrow.  We're recording this on the 15th, but this show is airing on the 25th.  Starting on the 26th, we have a brand new studio sponsor.  ITPro is now ITPro from ACI Learning, and we are thrilled that they have agreed to sponsor our studio in the year 2023.  So thank you.  And we're really glad to be participating with this because they have been with us for 10 years since they started.  In fact, Lisa and I visited their Gainesville, Florida studios where they are creating the best training content ever.  Of course, we talk all the time about ITPro and ACI Learning for individuals, but your IT team also needs this training, maybe more than anybody.  Because if your business is going to succeed, if your business is going to continue, you don't want to be hacked.  You don't want ransomware. You need an IT team that is up to snuff.  And it's also a great gift for your IT team.  The kind of training they're getting from ITPro, from ACI Learning, is the best in the business.  They will gain new skills, get better at the skills they already have, and they will love every minute of it.  I can tell you how I know. More than 80% of the users who start an ITPro video finish it.  It's engaging content, giving them information they can use in a way they love.  You're getting the best trainers in the world, people who work in the business, who know the content, but also are passionate about it.  And that passion communicates through every video.  Videos are about 20 to 30 minutes long. They have full transcriptions.  It makes it easy for you to sign even just one video or a portion of one video.  You can search those transcriptions, find that bit you want your IT team to learn about.  And with the ITPro dashboard, the Enterprise dashboard, you have absolute control over all the training.  I like the cheesehead. That's good.  Every vendor, every skill you need, Microsoft, Cisco, Linux, Apple training, security, cloud, more than 6,800 hours of training,  ranging from technical skills to compliance, even to soft skills like marketing.  It's all there and it helps your team be ready for any threat, any system upgrade, any new software release.  They are up to date on everything going on in the business in IT.  And they can watch it at home on their TV. They can watch it on their phone.  They can watch it on their Apple TV or their Roku. That is fantastic.  I really think this is the way to get training done.  The dashboard lets you track your team's results.  You have complete control over the seats are assigned and unassigned.  And you get usage reports, metrics like logins and viewing time, which tracks are completed and so forth.  So you really have control and beautiful visual reports that make it easy to justify the spend to the higher ups as well.  You're going to have an IT team that is ready for action.  And of course, if you're an individual looking to get into the IT or even just an individual working in IT who wants to get better,  IT Pro has individual plans too. It really is the best online engagement ever.  You're going to love it. IT Pro now from ACI Learning.  Give your team the IT development platform they need to level up their skills while enjoying the journey.  It is a great program. We love it. Same address, ITPro.tv slash twit.  ITPro.tv slash twit. And we are really thrilled.  Thank you, IT Pro from ACI Learning. We are really thrilled to have you as a signature sponsor for the year 2023.  It makes a big difference for us for our operation. But also it's a great partnership. We love these guys.  We've been with them for a long time. And I think one of the reasons they want to do it, they want to get the word out.  They've got a new partnership that really is going to make this even better.  IT Pro from ACI Learning. Welcome, guys. And we thank you for your support.  All right. Moving on. We did hacking.  There was some important stuff that happened in government.  It's funny. A lot of times what government does is irrelevant to what we talk about.  But the CHIPS Act passed this year in April. Actually, it didn't pass in April. It passed in July.  But that gave $52 billion to build new US foundries.  TSMC broke ground shortly after in Arizona. So did Intel.  That was a big deal. Really big deal.  And then the other action that made a big difference from government was the US decision to block sale of technology to China,  some chip technology and others claiming that China was using it to crack our encryption and for military uses.  This has been a very big deal for a lot of these companies and certainly a big deal for China.  A success, would you say?

Start time: 6558.76
End time: 6574.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't know how you block technology. That just sort of seems like an oxymoron to me.  In a world of the Internet, where technology is available, if it's in use in the United States, somehow China's not going to find out about it.  That's just ridiculous.

Start time: 6575.30
End time: 6600.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. One of the technologies that they are being prohibited from using is a TSMC technology called EUV.  It's actually manufactured by a Dutch firm.  The Dutch are also blocking the sale of equipment to China.  Without EUV, China can't build the very small 5nm and 3nm processes.  But you're absolutely right.

Start time: 6603.27
End time: 6607.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  China's not going to be able to duplicate the technology on their own if they can't buy it.  They'd rather buy it, but if they can't buy it, they'll make it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Exactly. Or figure it out or steal it, which they have actually done quite well.  Another thing that happened this year was Huawei joined a number of other Chinese companies blocked from US companies for that very reason.  They didn't want Huawei to put spy equipment into the United States.  Anyway, the CHIPS Act, I think, on balance, a very good thing that will make a difference.  One of the biggest stories of the year, of course, supply chain.  Has that eased up? How did supply chain hit the PC market?

Start time: 6652.67
End time: 6663.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_11

Start time: 6664.94
End time: 6667.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Speaker: SPEAKER_11

But of course, there's some concern also about the future of Taiwan, which right now is another place.  TSMC is a Taiwanese company that ships are manufactured.  But is it going to work? Can Apple, which has 300,000 workers in iPhone City in Zhengzhou, China, building iPhones?  Can they somehow move that to the US?

Start time: 6825.94
End time: 6865.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The other really interesting thing is all the saber rattling that China is doing with regard to Taiwan.  China needs the chips from TSMC just as much as the rest of the world does.  And if you've ever looked at the fab inside TSMC, it is the most fragile technology that we have ever created on the planet.  I mean, you can't sneeze within a block of that facility and not have it completely blow your process.  So there's no way that China can be aggressive toward Taiwan without risking totally shutting down the world, the global supply of chips.  And they can't afford that any more than we can.

Transcript:  You know, what's interesting too, though, is it's not just the technology industry.  I was talking to a board member of a drywall company and the pressure on them to disconnect from China.  The entire push over the last, as you said, Paul, 15 years is let's do everything in China.  Let's move everything in China. Let's make it cheaper. Let's help the economy.  And now there's tremendous political pressure to to cut off those ties.  And it's happening across the economy. And it's not going to be easy.  And I don't know that it's going to happen. Does all the gypsum come from China?  I don't know where gypsum comes from. I just know that he cares about white powder from Staten Island.  You know, by the way, one thing I learned is that cowl in is what coats a slick paper stock to make it so slick.

Speaking of fire sales, I'm so happy to report US Cable Companies lost another 785,000 paying  customers last quarter.  It has been a migration away from cable, partly from cord cutting.  But some of it apparently is going to T-Mobile and Verizon for their 5G based fixed wireless  internet services.  Does that work?  Yeah, works quite well.  His daughter?  My daughter has Verizon and because I'm a Verizon subscriber, it's 25 bucks a month for 150  megabits down and 30 up.  But it's also because she's near a 5G tower.

I was amazed.  It's T-Mobile 3CA, three channel aggregation.  It's the mid band spectrum.  Channel bonding.  Channel bonding.  And it's hitting speeds of up to three gigabits on a Galaxy S22, according to 9to5 Google.  So I bet you that's what that is, is a T-Mobile 3CA antenna.  Interesting.  You know, we made a lot of fun over the last few years over 5G, but this was the year 5G started to really take off and is real.

So this was, well, he's really creating a media company and he's the next Murdoch.  And that's what he's doing here.  She goes through the whole long thread.  And I just said that was like reading Duck in Trails.  Musk's, not hers.  And I said, there's one thing left out here for a media company, which is that a revenue.  That's all I said.

Towards the end of the year, I was looking and in April we had the story about Dolly  can edit pictures and then they opened it up to the public and then along comes open  source stable diffusion.  And it's amazing.  It's open source.  The development is very aggressive, very fast, then mid journey.  And then of course, chat GPT, which just was open to the public by open AI a couple of  weeks ago.  And what it looks like is almost a Cambrian explosion of artificial intelligence that  perhaps we are at the hockey stick.  Is that over ambitious, you think?

She's apparently got a boob job.  And then it gets worse from there.  I did not upload pictures with cleavage.  I did not upload suggestive pictures.  I gave...  It was all just headshots.  And for the most part, the headshots are fine.  But there was a sexist element.  Now, it turns out, Anthony, who is running the board today,  thank you, Anthony Nielsen, told me that there is a switch.  He's our stable diffusion local expert.  There's a switch that says no NSFW images.  And I think what happened is, Lenza,  which uses server-side stable diffusion, which is one of the...  And wants to increase sales.  Yeah.  Well, initially they forgot to turn that off.  So the pictures I generated of Lisa were last Thursday,  a week ago, exactly.  The pictures I did of Kim were from Saturday.  I was testing it to see, well, is it going to do that again?  And it didn't.  And so obviously they said, oops, we didn't flip that switch.  Maybe we ought to.

I'm trying to remember the name of the cursive that we learned, but it's ugly kind of, you know, the one, you know, the one with a V with a little hitch and.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  And it's cursed.  It's halfway to calligraphy.  Yeah.  It's no, it's not though.  That's the problem is it's kind of, it's dumbed down.  Yeah.  So I went at one point when I got into a little thing over fountain pens, I went out and I bought, you could buy it on Amazon.  Let me see if I can find the listing for it.  You can buy the old chap books for teaching handwriting, but not from my era, but from your grandmother's era.  Yeah.  And, and it wasn't Palmer.  It was actually a simplified Palmer.

Transcript:  I read a new MacBook Pro Air right there.  It has the it has the MagSafe three connector because there now been three incompatible banks safe connectors.  So so I asked, is there is because I couldn't find one on Amazon.  I want to MagSafe two to three converter.  And it says there is no MagSafe three.  I said, well, there is.  And no, no, everything made by Apple now is usually this thing is safe.  It's losing the fight and it will just make fun of you.  Here's how it lost the fight.  It said, I'm sorry.  I don't know anything since like April 2021.  Yeah, that's why I was trained on through April 2021.  I don't know anything.  It's interesting, though, that it sensed.

Transcript:  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Sam Altman said it costs a lot of money, about 10 times a Google query per chat GPT prompt, an eye watering amount of money.  So at some point, this is going to go back underwater.  It uses a lot of energy, a lot of compute power.  But presumably you could have a chat GPT that is always scanning for more information, getting smarter and smarter.  It would know about Mag3.  Once upon a time, you need a good, you need a constantly updated scrape.

Transcript:  Right.  That's going to feed it.  It's expensive.  Yeah.  The other thing that interests me is that it I think we're redefining literacy in this time.  And literacy used to be to write essays, write full thoughts.  Literacy got redefined with new alphabets like emoji and with new media like memes and short video and podcasts.  And then now you can get the aid of something that helps you write and say, yes, that was what I was trying to say.  Thank you.  And so you're you're expressing yourself better.  Sure.  As a result, this happened 20 years ago with research.

Transcript:  As you're talking, there's an accessibility angle to this that's actually really interesting, right?  Yes.  Absolutely.  Tell me about that.  Also, what?  Well, no, I mean, as he was talking, there are people who can't express themselves because of a disability of whatever kind.  So in other words, yes, you helped me say what I was trying to.  That's exactly what I meant.  Is something that I could use that disability.  But anybody could probably use that help at one point or another.

Transcript:  Here's the other piece, Leo, is that is that what this does for the businesses we're in is that it makes content absolutely and finally a commodity.  There is the idea of scarce content, the idea of scarce writing, the idea of scarce media is completely gone now because a machine can can generate unlimited amounts of it.  That makes sense to human beings.  And that says the value is not in making a commodity called content.  Watch out. That's been the case in Gutenberg.  But it changes to where the value is in things like relationships.  So Elon Musk thinks that Twitter is about content.  It's not. It's about the connections that people have.  That's true.

Transcript:  You know, remember what happened.  Dolly 2 came out. It was constrained.  You had to have credits and then somebody did an open source version of stable diffusion.  And that's when it took off.  And when somebody does an open source chat GPT that you can train with your own models, I despair for any detector figuring out that you're using chat.  Yeah, here is the stable diffusion for your iPhone.  It's free. It's open source.  It's open source. It's called draw things.  And it is if you've used stable diffusion, you'll recognize the interface.  You can download other checkpoints, other models.  It's pretty impressive.

I wish we could just do this show every week, but you got to make it special with your green hands.  Let's just briefly go through a list of some of the people we lost this year.  This is something it's always the sad part of the Academy Awards when they play a sad song.  And they have pictures of your favorites and it's going to be a long list this year.  We lost a lot of people.  But what what doesn't happen is we don't often acknowledge the pioneers in technology who we lost this year.  I try to at the end of Twits.  Maybe that's something that happens with the age.  You start reading obituaries.  You start you start looking at what age they passed, things like that.  But we lost quite a few people because we're getting to that age.  You know, computing is getting old enough now that some of its earliest pioneers are in their 80s and 90s like John Roach, the pioneer of the personal computer.  He was the guy working at Tandy who decided to make the TRS 80.  He passed this year at the age of 83.  He introduced in the late 90s, late 70s, 1970s, the TRS 80 for 600 bucks through Radio Shack stores.  And I know there are an awful lot of us, a lot of you listening who got your start with the TRS 80 or Trash 80 as we used to call them.

But today, Steve Wilhite, one of the inventors of the GIF format passed away from COVID at the age of 74.  That was in March of this year.  He worked on the graphics interchange format for CompuServe.  They were looking for another way to.  It was called CompuServe GIF.  Yeah. And it was encumbered.  It was patent encumbered for a long time, right?  Yeah, because of the compression.  Compression.  Sperry.  I think owned the patent of all people.

The co-founder of Razor and a pioneer of the gaming mouse passed this year.  Robert Cracoff.  He was 81.  He created the gaming hardware company Razor and was the first to make a mouse designed specifically for gaming.  The Razor.  Do you remember this?  I know, Paul, you remember the Razor.  They're still around.  The Razor Boomslang.  Sure.  Yeah.  Razor is still around, but the Boomslang.  Now, there was no.  Yeah, that was a mouse.  The you actually this came from a doc.

Transcript:  I remember back in the in the middle of the in the late 80s, networking was if there was data communications and communications with user fat magazines and they came out weekly or monthly.  And it was all SciTech versus three com versus IBM.  And it was it was a token ring token ring.  Who could ring versus Ethernet wins.  And Novell came along and said, We don't care what it is.  We're going to run the software on that.  And and Novell and that was Craig's idea.  Craig's idea was to go one level above that.  Novell before Craig was basically made yet another sort of some piece of hardware.  And they were actually in the hardware business, but they didn't like to brag on that.  And there was one point where Craig told me, you know, we we are actually the number one seller of Ethernet boards and for PCs.  And I said, why don't you make a thing of it?  He said, because it's going to be a zero dollar business pretty soon.  Is that right?  It's going to it's going to go away.  And he was so full of wisdom on a lot of things.  And after he and his wife, they weren't married at first.  They had kind of an affair.  And then they got married.  Judith Clark, who then became Judith Burton.  She invented Land Times, a bunch of conferences and things, just really brilliant people.  And they became good friends because I, you know, I work with them through the advertising agency I had in the in the late 80s and early 90s.  And and they started a consulting outfit called the Burton Group, which had a bunch of conferences and things.  But he was a really brilliant guy.  And he also introduced me to to Kim Cameron, who died a little over a year ago.  So but Kim is the the lawgiver on identity had the seven laws of identity, which which have guided Microsoft and everybody else for, you know, since 2004.  You know, basically limited disclosure for constrained use, justifiable parties, individual control and consent.  And when when Kim was first at Microsoft is when they were trying to do passport.

Transcript:  It's so easy to forget we focus on the Elon Musk is the world that really those guys aren't doing anything.  It's the people who are doing the real work like Craig Burton that really are making a difference.  And they know they so little so little celebrated, so little remembered.  So it's one of the reasons I wanted to do this is to remember these folks.  Dave Smith passed this year. He created MIDI and sequential.  He also introduced the Prophet five synth. He was the father of MIDI dead at the age of 72.  You know, I mean, how many of us use MIDI? Everybody, right?  And and synthesizers wouldn't exist without Dave Smith.  Are we didn't we were lucky we didn't lose anybody in our family.  Well, we only lost one in our family. And that was John Foster, who was one of the originals on Mac Break Weekly.  He was a Pixelcore member. He was on our podcasts.  He also passed away this year and he later started a podcast about beer, which is probably what maybe what he'll be best remembered for.  But there he is in the original Pixelcore offices downtown on Market Street in San Francisco with Alex Lindsay, probably doing an early Mac Break episode.  John Foster history. Yeah.  And again, you know, I remember him. You remember these people, but often they aren't very well known.  Here's one who, of course, was Nichelle Nichols, Star Trek's Lieutenant Uhuru passed this year.  And her ashes are actually in space, launched out into into space.  Here's NASA's tweet. We celebrate the life of Nichelle Nichols, Star Trek actor, trailblazer and role model.  She said she wanted to quit Star Trek because she had so little to do.  And Gene Roddenberry said, you can't because you are a role model for black people and black women, especially everywhere.  You need to be on.

Transcript:  She passed this year. So did Kathleen Booth, the inventor of assembly language.  Her story is a fascinating. She was 100 years old. She born in 1922.  Her career with computers began during World War Two in the very earliest computers.  She designed in 1946 with her future husband, the automatic relay calculator, one of the very first digital computers.  And, of course, if you've got a digital computer, somebody's got to write the code for it.  So she did. And so I know Steve as a user of assembly language, you probably want to mark.

Start time: 10149.32

That's a that's really amazing. Kathleen Booth.  I know our fans were saddened by the passing of Kevin Conroy, the voice of Batman.  He may not know his name or his face, but you definitely know his voice, which I will not play because apparently nobody wants me to.  But you will remember his voice. Let me see if I can find the tweet. Maybe the tweet will.  It was Bruce Wayne. He was Batman and Bruce Wayne.  Wait a minute. I hope that's not a spoiler.  What? What? No, forget it. Forget what I just forget what I just said.  Also, a science fiction author you and I love. I know Steve Greg Bear passed away. Yeah, yeah, yeah.  This year, he wrote Eon. Yeah, good book. I loved Darwin's radio.  Blood music. Wonderful. Hugo award winning books passed away.  We we lost a great one. One of the great people are not old enough.  Yeah, 1951. That's all these people are younger than me.  I don't like that. Like I said, you get to a certain age, you start reading the no, it's terrible obituaries.  And what do you look at? You look at the age.

I'm going to be on a special Floss, kind of similar, next year, right?  We're doing a special Floss.  It's on my calendar, I think.

Transcript:  We're going to have him back.  We should have you back for that show.  I'll come for the whole show at XM.  Yeah, go for that whole show.  I'll be on the whole round table later, earlier next year.  Thank you all for joining us.  We love our audience too.  Couldn't do it without you.  I really appreciate your patience with us over the past 17 years.  I'm looking forward to a very exciting 2023.  One of the best things about covering tech is it's ever-changing.  It's always interesting.  And it's always, I think, pretty important to our future.  So thank you for participating at Twit.  We have many ways you can do that.  Of course, you can watch our shows.  We send out live audio and video of our shows as we record them.  We make them available for download too as podcasts.  You can communicate with us in our IRC at irc.twit.tv.  We have a Mastodon at twit.social.  We have Discourse Forums, which are great, at twit.community.  And of course, the Club Twit is the best way to participate.  Seven bucks a month, but you get ad-free versions of all the shows.  You get the Club Twit Discord.  You get the special shows that we don't put anywhere else,  like Paul Therotte's Hands on Windows, Michael Sargent's Hands on Macintosh,  the Untitled Linux show with your co-host Jonathan Bennett, Doc.  Yeah, he's great.  Oh, he's wonderful.  Lots of great content on the feed.  But mostly it helps us kind of smooth out the ups and downs.  We are an ad-supported network.  But honestly, if I had my druthers, I'd be a Twits-supported network.  You help us with that when you join.  Twit.tv slash Club Twit.  I know it's Christmas Day,  but if you didn't get that special gift yet for the geek in your life,  there is a year package that would be just right.  Twit.tv slash Club Twit.  Have a wonderful holiday.

So yeah, it's a way of showing your support,  but it's a way of us also getting a better, more intimate interaction with you.  So we're happy.  Now you can say goodbye.  Thank you everybody.
