Transcript:  Bandwidth for This Week in Tech is provided by AOL Radio at AOL.com slash podcasting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is TWiT This Week in Tech, episode 66 for August 13, 2006.  A little dab will do you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I am thrilled.  I am jazzed beyond belief to get a new voice on TWiT.  We've been doing a lot of new folks, which is fun.  Of course, we've got the traditional.  So let me start off with the regulars and we'll get to the new voice in just a bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  John C. Dvorak.org slash blog is here, ladies and gentlemen, in the room.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The original cranky geek.  I have a feeling, I don't know why, but I just get the feeling because I hear John mute  and unmute his mic that he's actually having elaborate conversations in the background  and every once in a while he says something and then he goes back to his real life.  Hello.  I don't know why I get that feeling, John.  Also here, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Robert Heron.  Hey, hey.  The king of the widescreen.  You ain't kidding.  Knee deep.  Knee deep.  You're doing another buyer's guide for PC mass here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, this one for liquid crystal displays, the flat panels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  Well, we'll find out what you think of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Plasma.  Now I got to go show the LCD some love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I told Patrick that he's welcome.  He said, you want me today?  And I said, yes, but I don't see him.  So when Patrick shows up, we'll invite Mr. Norton in.  But let me introduce our newbie.  First time TWiT.  And you may remember from Call for Help, he was a regular talking about the Macintosh.  We met him at Mac World Magazine.  It's Brett Larson.  Hey, Brett.  Hey, Leo.  Good to be here.  Oh, it's good to talk to you.  You're in New York City now.  I'm in New York City.  You still at the job you took, you left us to take?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Still at the job I left you all for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which wasn't that long ago.  And as you look back, probably thought, gee, what a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, it was.  I was correct in my assumption that the band would keep playing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not that, that the whole thing would collapse after you left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and everything would collapse after I left.  So where are you?  I'm now working for CBS News in New York.  And you're their tech guy.  I do technology coverage.  Yes.  And actually, I do it for a local station here and a local station in Sacramento.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Formerly UPN, now CW.  Is that Brandon?  That is Brandon Mercer.  You're working for Brandon Mercer?  Former tech TVer and doing the both the Saturday and weekday early shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How do you do that?  By a satellite?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  That's cool.  I come in on the bird, as it were.  The bird.  It's kind of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Brandon has a little conclave of former tech TVers up there.  Mattie works for him, doesn't she?  He does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kim's up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kim, our former producer, line producer for the screensavers.  That's neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Only faces I recognized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, let's get to the news.  I know you're going to have some stuff to say about the Mac in just a little bit, but  before we do anything, I think we should commemorate, as we have done in the last few tweets, an  anniversary.  Remember, we talked about the 15th anniversary of the internet or the World Wide Web, 10th  anniversary of Flash, August 1981.  25 years ago, something important happened in technology.  Does it have anything to do with IBM?  It might have.  There we go.  The MPC, the 5150, it cost $1,565, but that's because it didn't come with any drives.  It came with 16K of memory and a cassette port.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Woohoo!

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I remember the cassette port.  You know, I always wanted to do it.  Does anyone remember that used the Kansas City standard or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What are you talking about?  Kansas City standard.  You remember that?  Is that a cassette data standard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  John, do you still have your 15th?  It was called the Kansas City standard.  That was the upgrade to the old whatever.  There were some original ones that came out, and then the Kansas City standard were up  the ante, and it was like the high speed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My Atari would make, and I think the Apples would make noises they read in the tapes.  Did the IBM do that also?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know, it was like you could, the drive you want, you could use any drive that  had kind of, you know, you were looking for a monophonic drive like a radio shack, and  you would push the buttons manually and you'd load the data from this thing.  It wasn't like a tape drive that was controlled by the computer necessarily.  It was like, you know, you had it going into this port and you pushed the button and it  would load the data, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was not very reliable, I have to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, I disagree with that.  I never had a problem with the reliability of those things.  If you had the right cassette player, they were quite reliable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fortunately, they came out with a floppy and a hard drive very soon after.  I'm sure that cost thousands of dollars at the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Actually, the floppies were available immediately.  Were they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  These things were built like tanks.  I mean, literally, they were steel, sheet steel.  I had an 8088.  Which one was this that came out?  This was an 8088.  Okay.  It was 4.77 megahertz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wasn't as cool as my Atari, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Four point.  I mean, 25 years ago, this was 4.77, not gigahertz, not megahertz.  And of 16-inch helipods.  Yeah, well, that was pretty fast for those days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The fastest chips before that were like a megahertz or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Less than that.  Yeah, yeah.  The 6509 that ran on the Apple, I think, was one point something megahertz.  That's what the Atari had.  It was like 1.4.  Yeah.  It was really amazing, really.  Anyway, I just thought we'd mention that.  Ray Ozzie said last week, it's the end of the PC era.  Here we are 25 years later.  I don't know if I agree with him on that.  What's he talking about?  What's that supposed to mean?  He told Microsoft shareholders of the meeting that the PC era was coming to an end.  We are now in a new era, said Mr. Ozzie, an era in which the internet is at the center  of so much that we do now with our PCs.  It's important to start them from a different vantage point.  I don't know what that means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He still used the word PC in that sentence.  I don't think he knows what that means.  I'm not a subscriber to that notion in any way, shape, or form, and I don't think Microsoft  should be above all people.  PCs are going to stick around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Microsoft makes us living on PCs.  How could they say that PC is dead?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  See, I kind of think that-  Have the sales started to slide on PCs?  People not buying PCs anymore?  No, I think they're going to.  There's still a growth industry.  How can they be dead?  What do you think, Brett?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, now that my Skype is back, the application has unexpectedly quit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You are with us.  You are with us.  I don't know how you're transmitting.  I'm here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Continue whatever you're doing.  I was going to say, I do kind of think the PC is on its way out only because-  Replaced by?  It's going to be replaced by devices that do specific tasks, like we've seen with the  TiVo, because the whole media center thing, I don't think people want a computer.  That's a bad idea.  Which of course is ironic, because all of us who have DVRs from the cable company and  computers, but the computer part of it is hidden from us.  We don't look at it as though it's the same thing as you have sitting on your desk.  You're saying the appliance computer will take over.  I think the appliance computer will take over.  Hopefully somebody will do it right so they can all talk to each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're talking more specialized software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and hardware too.  I mean, a TiVo is a specialized hardware and software combination.  It's a Linux box, but it's still- I mean, it is a computer, but you don't know that.  It is a computer.  I challenge this.  It's really-  This is nonsense.  This is crazy talk.  Crazy talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is a lot of room for improvement in the software experience for everyone.  Operating systems generally are too complicated.  Or they're just simply-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who here uses Windows Media Center regularly?  Every day.  You do.  Really?  Yeah.  Because he's an early adopter and he's geeky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's also just the cheapest version of Windows you can buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, so do you use it as a TiVo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not here at home.  I have a TiVo for that, but I do use it at work for that very thing.  And it also just happens to link very nicely with the Xbox 360.  Well, I've heard that's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've heard the Xbox 360 links with the iPod too.  I bet you it does.  It's just too damn noisy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Should we move on to kind of a more current story?  Or should we just- I'll leave this to you, John, because you're the conscience of the  group.  PC World did do the top 25 greatest PCs of all time.  And it's kind of a fun list if you're into this history thing.  Should we run through a few of these?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would like to because I'm sure if it's from PC World, it's incredibly inaccurate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll see how you feel about this.  Number 25.  They're the enemy.  Number 25, the K Pro 2.  See, I don't know why not the Osborne, which really the K Pro was just a copy.  Do they have the Osborne on the list?  Well, maybe they do.  Maybe they do.  I don't know if it's a chronological order.  Let me see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it should be an order of importance, it would seem to me.  K Pro 2.  That's coming in at number 25.  I can't find this thing anywhere on here.  This website's a disaster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the tubes.  They're clogged.  Alienware area 51 is number 21.  Gateway Destination, let's not forget that was the first big TV, remember?  Oh, that shouldn't even be on the list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm glad to see Apple's e-mate is on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  E-mate is number 21 or 22.  And long gone, I hope.  The OmniBook 300, that was a pretty cool laptop.  That was the one with the mouse kind of popped out and was still attached.  It was like a lever on an arm.  Toshiba T1000, a great laptop, remember that?  TRS Model 80, you're right, it's not a chronological order.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  TRS 80 was awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Atari 800, my favorite.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, stop, stop, stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hold on there.  Stop the press.  So we're just counting anything that was ever a computer because the Tandy TRS 80 Model 1  was not a PC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, they should say computer because the Atari's on there as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Same thing, it's not a PC.  Wasn't the K Pro 2.  Wait a minute, what do you mean, it's not a PC?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not an IBM PC compatible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, we're talking about this is an anniversary of the IBM PC, so what do we have, you know,  all these machines that have nothing to do with IBM?  What's this one here?  Personal computer.  And number one of the IBM greatest PC is an Apple.  Is that what this list is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's see, that'll be interesting.  The Mitz Altair comes in at number 12.  The Sony Vio 505, which was a really lightweight, slick machine, number 11.  The PowerBook 100, number 10.  Columbia Data Pro...  Wait a minute, Columbia Data Products MPC 1600.  You remember that one, John?  I do, but that wouldn't be on anybody's list.  Didn't Morrow design that one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No.  They should have the Morrow's machines while we're talking about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Morrow should be on here.  TRS Model 100 is number 8.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Another TRS 80, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the Model 100 is important.  Hey John, you'll like this.  Number 7, the Amiga 1000.  It's a good machine.  Number 6, the original IBM PC we were just talking about.  Number 5, the ThinkPad 500.  Number 4, the Apple Mac Plus.  Oh please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that was a great one.  Boo!  I had one of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Number 3, the Xerox 8010.  Oh, brother.  Number 2, the Compaq Desk Pro 386.  And ladies and gentlemen, drum roll please, the number 1 greatest PC of all time according  to PC World Magazine.  John, you're going to hate it.  It's laughable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The Apple II.  I agree.  It's laughable.  What kind of a list is this of the greatest PCs of all time?  They're not even PCs!  It's a PC world.  They should be PC centric.  Where's the Sol 20?  Where's the North Star if you're going to throw in all these old clunkers like the Apple  II?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Come on, this sucks.  You know, PC World's been doing that lately a lot.  In fact, I think they said their favorite PC was a Mac some time ago, didn't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, maybe they should all just go to Macs and change the name of the magazine.  Okay, here's what we have to do.  The crew that does TWIT, the group of us, we're going to put together a little website  and we're going to do the real top 25.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What would your nominees be, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The first one would be at the top would be you have to give credit where credit is due,  which is the IBM PC would be number 1.  The original.  The greatest PCs.  Give me a break, historically.  And what about the PC AT?  That was a very important machine.  The AT is on their list.  No, it's on their list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's on their list.  Somewhere down there.  I skipped it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I didn't go through all the 25.  I think the first IBM ThinkPad, those the big ones that they came out with initially  and then the later ThinkPad.  And where's the ThinkPad on here?  There's a ThinkPad.  Number five.  There's a ThinkPad.  700C.  Okay, I'm sorry.  I got that.  I overlooked it.  Okay, so they got one.  I would put the Moro on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would put the Osborne on there.  I would put.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What about the regular Macintosh, the original?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why the plus and not the first Mac?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, the 1984 machine.  Why is not that?  The Mac 2 should be on there if they're going to put this on there.  The Lisa.  The Lisa has to be on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Everybody forgets the Lisa.  The Xerox Star.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The Xerox Star should be on there.  The Lisa, I would agree.  But you know, again.  PC World, they're just cracked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This was selected by Dartboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I've been to these kinds of meetings and that's what you do.  You sit around.  It's a Dartboard.  A bunch of guys and Dartboard is not too far from the truth.  You sit around and a bunch of guys, whoever happens to be in the office, you throw together  a list and then you try to make it a little annoying.  They've gone overboard with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now what we've seen here, by the way, I just want to point out is a little demonstration  of something that was reported in the news that new research suggests that older people  with above average intelligence tend to be disagreeable.  They're angry.  They're angry.  A study authors noted that superior intelligence does not always go hand in hand with surliness.  Smart young people are more likely to be open.  It's only the old smart people who are cranky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Old farts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Older and cranky may mean smarter is the findings of the American Psychological Association,  a paper at their 2006 convention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Makes me sound like an Einstein.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just wanted to credit where credits do.  Now you know why John is so angry because he's smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, because I'm annoyed by this miserable list that is not even close to being accurate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, I'll tell you something else annoying.  You want to stay annoying?  Where's the Apple III while we're at it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, no, that was not a great computer.  I'm just saying they're going to have stuff like the, what was that crazy one?  The Columbia Data Products machine.  I mean, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You want to get irate.  Look what they're doing.  What about the super brain?  Look what they're doing with the stuff they're confiscating.  Let's talk a little bit about the biggest story of the week.  Of course, the terrorists arrested in Britain, big terror plot to blow up planes over the  US planes bound from London to the United States.  They got the guys so far.  No terrorists were, you know, code red.  And there.  And if you're flying from London, better not bring anything but your boarding pass and  eat the airline meal and watch the airline movie because you don't, you can't even bring  a paperback book on the plane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which I will say people are saying it's you get on the plane.  Yeah, you got to watch out for those binary paperback books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, you put two of them together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm trying to figure out what is it about the paperback they don't like?  Is it that you could conceal something in it?  I mean, can't you just riffle through the pages?  They're already going through your hair gel and they're they want the X-ray if there's

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  anything in there.  I mean, what are they?  Who are they kidding?  When has this ever worked?  What kind of, you know, Metafilter has a pretty good rundown on this with a bunch of people  debating what could possibly be a liquid explosive?  Well, unless you're making nitroglycerin.  Yeah.  Well, if you're making nitroglycerin in the plane, you could walk in with a bottle of  nitric acid to make this product.  I mean, I think you'd notice it.  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But what if you had the this is the question.  You need to have a way of separating the liquids into some non-volatile components, one in  a shampoo bottle, one in a hair gel bottle and mixing them on the plane and then igniting  them.  And apparently they said they plan to ignite them with the electronics from a flash from  a camera flash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's nonsense.  So if you made nitroglycerin, this is a pretty well known fact.  If you've ever had people who are chemists will know this.  The process of making nitroglycerin, if not done right, will just it'll just explode.  You don't need a detonator.  Right.  So you can remember the old days, the old cowboy movies, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The nitroglycerin would be sweating off the dynamite and they could take it with their  finger and throw it and it would explode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that.  And there's been some historical accidents, too, through the post office.  We used to be able to mail this stuff around.  That's a bad idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's here's something to get you upset.  Apparently, according to CBS News, Brett Larson, a man sized artificial.  I'm reading the story.  A man sized artificial palm tree.  I love any story that begins with this is the best, best lead sentence in years.  A man sized artificial palm tree and a sausage grinder have shared space in a state  government warehouse with piles of Swiss Army knives and chainsaws.  Just a few of the things travelers have had to give up at airport security checkpoints.  But here's the thing that's interesting.  The state of Pennsylvania sells these things on eBay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're not the only ones in my understanding.  That's why I am confiscated from me early on.  That, you know, years ago, there was a leather man I just happened to have on me and I  asked him, is there any way I could get this checked or if they take and do something  with it or they could put it in a thing, I'll pick it up on the way back and they would

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  say, baby, baby, it's all on eBay or they hand you an eleven dollar envelope.  Right.  You mail it to yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can mail it.  Well, that's new because originally they didn't do any of that and they sold all that  stuff.  Basically just stealing from you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can put anything in your checked in baggage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport gives gives it to the homeless.  Just what you want.  A homeless guy with a chainsaw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought Phoenix was giving homeless people one way bus tickets to San Francisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, first they give them the chainsaw.  Then they give them the one way ticket to San Francisco.  Say have fun.  So I haven't looked on eBay, but I guess there's probably a glut of Swiss Army knives  now. You probably get a pretty new deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a new section on illegal.  That stuff should just be destroyed.  Well, wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, why should it be destroyed?  It's perfectly good stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because in a sense, it's they give you an overpriced option or you can't get on the  plane. You either spend eleven bucks to mail anything back to yourself if it'll fit in  the envelope.  And then if that doesn't work, OK, we're going to keep it and then we're going to turn  around and sell it.  So shouldn't they give you some sort of voucher?  They should give me eleven bucks and then they can do whatever they want.  Or I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a federal law gives states the rights to get banned or discarded items from the  TSA contractor responsible for removing them.  And it says it belongs to the state.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to break anything they take from me before I get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a good idea. Just break.  That's a good idea.  Five hundred small Swiss Army knives went for a record five hundred ninety five bucks.  According to the TSA, 10 million items have been confiscated or voluntarily turned over  this year alone in the U.S.  10 million items.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This whole thing was liquids, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's my question.  Well, now, let's talk about this.  The liquid thing is, John, you say as the chemist of the bunch that there's there's  nothing that could be in there that could be dangerous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I didn't say that at all.  You could bring in a bottle of there's various peroxides that will literally you mix them  with anything and it's going to blow up.  OK, so I said to themselves often.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's reasonable to collect these bottles of liquid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it depends. You're collecting crest toothpaste.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You correct, you know, I mean, you're going to open every tube and squeeze out a little

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  bit to me. I mean, what are we supposed to do?  You're traveling to London and you're not supposed to adopt the habit of the British  and ever brush your teeth. I mean, what's the deal with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Check it. Just check it.  I'm glad I'm glad Nick's not here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And what's to prevent somebody who's really dedicated to just carrying that stuff on  their physical person? It's not going to send off any detection units currently out  there unless you're going through one of those sniffer machines that might pick it up  if it's not sealed properly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, Brett, you're the hair gel guy in the group.  No, actually, no, I take it back. Robert, you use a pack of hair gel yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I've been shaving my head pretty much.  So it's a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, so forget curly. But Brett, have you been flying lately?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I ironically, I flew back from San Francisco on Wednesday or the day before the big  so you got your hair gel on board.  So I not only got my hair gel on board, I got my laptop, my digital from my iPod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, so there's another you could still carry this stuff, though, in the US.  It's only London to Britain, the US that you can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I mean, they wanted to think about the idea of like keeping people from bringing  laptops on the plane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A member of Congress said it's just a matter of time before carry all carry ons are  banned, which is ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What are they supposed to do?  You're supposed to tie the person to the seat and then shoot them up with drugs.  I mean, how are you going to go on a flight from here to New York and not be bored out  of your mind? Imagine what you're going to Singapore.  What if you have work to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Yeah.  Oh, no, business businessmen would just go crazy with this if they did that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I might want to bet none of this applies to first class.  And of course, none of this applies to anybody who charters a flight or.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. And don't forget the shoe bomber was in first class.  So that is not going to make a lot of sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I see what happens up in first class.  You can pretty much do they don't tell you to turn off your electronics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's ironic because terrorists always buy first class tickets.  I mean, you know, why not fly?  Your last flight. Have a drink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, I've been in first enough to know that you're treated just the same.  You just get more. No, you're not.  Not even.  I know they will turn off your stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They won't.  They won't let me use their bathroom.  I know that they say, no, you can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's if there's other reasons for that, Leo, that's because of people like me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Leo can't use it's not me specifically, John.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was I will throw throw this in as a note about no carry ons.  I know people in the airline industry who thinks that's the greatest thing in the world.  Oh, they hate it because it slows down.  No carry ons. Check in.  You get on the plane in 10 minutes.  Everybody's ready to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But don't you I mean, I have to say, I agree.  Don't you hate people who bring four bags on and they're trying to jam them in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They are people who put their coats in the overhead and take up all the space.  So I can't get my bag up there.  That's what really irritates me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hate the guy's got all the leg room and he's put all his bags up above.  So I can't put anything and he's got plenty of leg room for his system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have many of them.  He's moaning grow.  There's plenty of room all over the plane.  All right.  You fly about somebody as a grump.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I actually the flights I fly for some reason are always sold out.  They're always full flights and there's never enough room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And of course, they're all losing money somehow, right?  Yes. Well, I fly here in Canada, guaranteed to lose money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right. That's a topic for another day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Another day, another time. Mac Pro.  Apple's WWDC was this week in San Francisco.  I guess that's probably why you were out, Brett Larson.  Yeah, I was I was at the expo.  You care about these things.  Steve and you know, no new iPod phone, no new iPod, no  iTunes movie rentals.  None of the rumors panned out.  The only thing that they did announce it was of any significance  was what everybody expected, which is an Intel tower.  But some surprises here.  The pricing, for one thing.  Yeah, very low.  It's actually lower than a competently equipped Dell ProLiant server.  In fact, I think they have the lowest price for these woodcrest  zions on the market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, by nine hundred and ninety nine dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Unheard of for Apple to actually offer the lowest price computer.  Yeah, it won't be for long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's funny that the big news coming out of the conference  is that there was no news and that everybody talks about it as news.  That there is no news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's always unbelievable.  Well, I think the Mac Pro's news.  I mean, this is a nice computer for twenty five hundred bucks.  You're getting a very nice machine.  I think. Yeah, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think what Mac users, myself included, are starting to get frustrated  with with this Intel transition is the hardware looks the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The MacBook Pro looks like this was a surprise.  No, you're right. This was a surprise.  Everybody thought, well, they'll have to redesign the case for the Mac Pro  because everybody will be confused.  And they didn't.  And I think that's the only thing wrong with the case design.  I think it's one of the most beautiful cases made.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The G5 was a nice was a nice looking machine.  But Apple has a habit of updating their hardware every couple of years,  and they haven't with the Intel transition.  No, you're right. Which, of course, it's OK.  It's just it sort of proves the point that it's just it's a processor change  and nothing else. Right.  Or maybe that's maybe that's this.  I am happy to see the transition.  You know, it's over. The transition is over.  Now, now all that power PC hardware is deep, deep discounts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you know, now, would you buy if you could get a cheap  power book or a cheap G5, would you buy it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know.  I don't think I would, because you're going to get two or three years out of it.  We know that Leopard will be backwards compatible with the power PC chip,  but we don't know what 10.6 is going to be.  For all we know, they quickly killed off Classic.  No, you're right. Very quickly killed off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it's nine. They may never never.  Yeah. You know, and you're right.  And how long before universal applications become Intel applications?  Right. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I would bet I wouldn't put money on it,  but I would bet by 10.6 or 10.7, we're going to start to hear about,  you know, support for power PC chips is going away because Apple has a habit  of doing this. Oh, yeah, it's going to be backwards compatible forever  until next year. Right.  You know, and then everything stops working and they get class action lost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You said you were angry about Apple.  What? Why? Why were you angry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was angry because once again, Job snubbed me when I tried to ask him a question.  You say, what is it?  I'm from CBS News.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'd like to talk to you, Steve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I didn't ask him about the failure of the next step operating system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's all he's worried about, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't ask him about this stock thing that he's.  So how did he snub you? Did he just look away?  He just ignored me and his PR flack woman.  Yeah, I've had that happen to him.  Stands between him and my camera and pushes me away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I even know, Steve.  I mean, I've actually hung out with him socially and ignored me.  So I don't feel too bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't feel like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But, you know, I wasn't I just, you know, Apple.  Apple is a victim of their own success.  People go to these things and expect everything in the in the world.  And it's ironic that the rumor sites, everybody in the media reads them.  And the rumor sites actually raise the bar of expectation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the reality is, well, now you know why Apple tried to put these guys out of business.  The rumor sites aren't helping Apple at all.  They're making every announcement looks look disappointing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I will say, you know, the stuff they showed off in Leopard was like,  all right, guys, let's wrap it up.  I don't care about how the rock said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Paul Thurotte said,  now Apple should be apologizing for stealing from Windows.  The shoes on the other foot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You think I don't know if I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  His I agree 100 percent.  All right. Why do you say that? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know. I just thought I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He said, you know, Time Machine is just the Windows server.  I can remember the name of it.  There's some sort of obscure backup technology built into Windows 2003 server.  He said, you know, I mean, it's true.  Time Machine is kind of like system restore on steroids or go back. Right.  I don't know. I think it's everything.  I think it's I think actually it's pretty impressive to to make an easy  to use backup system that's going to work for users is a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you know, Leo, you know how you know it's going to work.  Always advocate. We don't know it's going to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you know, I think Apple's pretty good on their track record about getting.  Now, here's Mike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My concern with Time Machine, though, was, well, how far back is this thing going to go?  And how much space is that going to take?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the same problem with Go Back.  Remember, I mean, Go Back was really a pig.  Yeah. Apple actually a little bit of trouble.  One one last Apple story.  They Nasdaq was going to delist them.  Yikes. On Friday, they got a letter saying that Apple  no longer meets the exchange's listing requirement.  The reason. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not filing a 10 Q. That's the reason, among other things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is all going back to the options scandal, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they got to restate all these.  Apparently, they got to do a ton of restatements.  And this is like, you know, not a good thing for anybody.  And it's particularly not a good thing for investors because nobody knows now  what Apple really made.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I think that the as far as I mean, the revenues and it's merely  that they misstated or, you know, illegally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It affects the profits because they but  because they because they didn't follow the effects negatively or positively.  What if they were negatively, of course?  Why would there be such a, you know, fuss over it?  Why is Steve so worried?  It's going to be a huge negative issue and it's going to probably  I know it may be a buying opportunity because I still don't see, you know,  I mean, it's not their fundamentals, not about fundamentals at all.  No, it's not. And then probably Apple, if they keep up with the  but it does hurt the the morale.  But if they keep up with the way they're going with their iPod  initiative and everything else, I mean, this company is still  maybe the strongest PC company out there, even though there's not really  making their money from PCs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But so that the I will say this, though, and I'm going to put this question  out to you guys with the announcement of that machine, of the Mac Pro  being an inexpensive PC, basically.  Do you think that Apple is going to move in on some of the PC manufacturers?  Because you can buy one of these things and run Windows on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, that's what it looks like, doesn't it?  They're beating Dell at the at its own game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And, you know, when you're when you're selling a  a better looking machine for a thousand dollars less,  I mean, people have got to start to think, wow, maybe I'll buy a Mac.  I'll put Windows on it.  But gosh, if I ever want to use the Mac, it's there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Gee, I wonder who was advocating that this might actually happen some  maybe a year ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You got to remember reading something from you.  You got a lot of heat saying that Apple would start selling Windows.  But really, this is more more what reasonable that they're not selling  Windows, but selling Windows machines or their machines are.  Let's say let's say they're their operating system agnostic.  Just a matter of time. Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, you can buy Windows now, the 24 hour Apple store on Fifth Avenue,  which happens to be in the courtyard of the CBS News early show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I I still don't understand why Apple would prefer to be a hardware company  than an operating system company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They've always been a hardware company.  They every chance they had to become a software company, they refuse to do it.  Why, John? I mean, look at the iPod.  The iPod's a hardware thing with a software.  They use software to sell hardware.  And that's what the iPod's all about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Margins in hardware is lower. I don't understand it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They always had good margins because Apple made a high quality premium product.  And so they get inch.  And it was kind of different than everything else.  So they could always inch out that extra bit of money.  And I still think they can do it.  And if they're selling, you know, you know, essentially what Dell's doing  cheaper because they for whatever reason, maybe the designs newer.  I mean, there's probably a lot of reasons.  I'm sure that their margins are still pretty aggressive.  I mean, I've always said that Apple, if you have a choice  between something that looks really cool and something that looks,  you know, kind of dowdy, that people will pick the thing that looks pretty cool,  even if they have to pay an extra 10 bucks for it, because it looks pretty cool.  May be more than I think a lot of PC hardware is just crappy hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, there's a lot of junk, too.  Yes, the iPod's no better than any other MP3 player.  It looks it looks cooler and it's a little easier to use.  Yeah. Yeah.  And I think I think Apple has paved the road for themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll tell you what we're doing on call for help.  We need new machines. We're not going to buy that.  We're not going to replace the Dells with Dells.  We're going to buy Mac Pros in that way we can run both Windows.  Remember, don't you?  I mean, you must remember all the problems we would have switching back  and forth between Macs and PCs on the set of call for help.  Well, now we're just going to have one computer.  And instead of switching computers to run a Mac or a PC,  we'll just press Alt Enter and switch over to Parallels  and show that show the Windows side of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, this is why part of the reason why I got the MacBook Pro is because  when I've got to go do a software demonstration or something,  I can I got both that both operating systems are ready to go and fully  functional parallels is fully functional Windows,  unless you're trying to format a hard drive.  Then it crashes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Looks like Vista may be out actually on time.  Well, on time, according to the most recent schedule, January 2007.  Yesterday, Microsoft blogger actually a couple of days ago  implied that they were very close to release candidate one.  Well, yeah, yeah, I'm loving it.  I think really we got to see it now.  You're using beta to Robert, whatever the 40 or the 50

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  fifty five days one. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I thought you mean the one that they name it by the fifty five  or five because it takes fifty five point oh five gigabytes to run it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've had no issues. I love the operating system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it looks silly.  I think it looks like shellac on a piece of poo poo.  Can I say I don't know?  You can say, OK, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know what it means, but you can say it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It just it looks like a glossy coating on something that's really not all that great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Beta one expires in May, so you've got a little longer to use it.  But the release can't.  The beta two or beta.  But how are you going to get the one that's on that?  Beta two is the one. Yeah.  Oh, another thing, which is great news is that they may unlock the,  you know, you couldn't you couldn't register beta two anymore.  You know, they closed down the previews.  And apparently they're going to add new users to the CTP program finally.  So if you've been if you've had that beta two disk,  but haven't been able to authenticate, you can do that now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, Robert, why do you like this thing? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's see.  Start to finish just simply installing it compared to any other previous  operating system from Microsoft.  It's it's a smoother.  It's the way it should have been originally in terms of having the  getting getting the little stuff out of the way first  and pretty much being an unattended install hardware wise.  It's just nice to have all of that support on a on a single disk  now where you really don't have much in the way of tracking down  driver updates and things like that.  It's all pretty damn automatic.  The protective nature of the operating system, as far as I've seen anyway,  it goes out of its way to keep you from mucking things up  or from rogue applications from mucking things up.  Well, it's going to be in terms of I can be as well.  I mean, all the great three features and you can rave over that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I don't think we yet know how secure Vista is going to be.  Yeah, no, no one's attached to knowing

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  they'll be they'll be knowing shortly.  I guarantee that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's also just like when I install games now, the default window,  when you bring up Microsoft's games now on Vista,  it gives you a list of like all the games that are preloaded.  But it also periodically scans my system and adds those icons to the list.  That being a part of scanning my system.  Well, I mean, it's like, oh, we realize you just installed another  some nice application that's probably a game here.  Let's make sure it's included in our in our content rating system for parents.  Well, let me let me ask this, Robert, let me ask you this question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What if somebody is an XP user and they're like, you know,  let's just say they got an XP machine just recently and they want to.  I mean, is it going to be important for them to make a switch  and have to do an overinstall, you know, put install of this on top of XP?  I think you're going to want to.  Is the different they're going to want?  Are they going to want to do that?  Is it going to make a big difference to their life?  I mean, how important is Vista in that regard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think anybody should, especially if you just purchased a computer  and it comes with a fully functioning copy of XP.  XP is going to be supported for a couple more years.  Definitely what? Keep it.  I can't give anyone a reason to say yes, you might.  But at the same point, if you were running an older system  and you're about to buy a new computer, you know, it's it's going to be  a compelling feature to have just because it's such a nice upgrade  compared to what was out there before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I want it. I want it.  But, you know, I'm going to wait and buy a machine when I can buy it pre-installed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. As I think most people will, but that's the way they will experience it.  Although the good news for a high end system and you're looking for a new  operating system that's Windows, you know, and Vista is available.  It's the same darn price as XP was when it launched.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The news for a Mac folks like Brett and me is that the new Parallels,  which is now coming out in beta, will support Vista.  That's so we will be able to run it, which is nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm also liking the new version of Media Center, too. Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, so there's a new I didn't know there was a new version.  This is Vista Media Center.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. It's part of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I haven't seen it. It's new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So far, for what I've seen, the big complaint I have about  Microsoft's Media Center Edition is that it requires the TV  tuner side of things, it requires an analog tuner.  You can't go any further as far as TV tuner use,  unless you have an analog tuner in there.  And I never look at analog television on my PC.  It's always with digital, either an IDF or standard deaf.  So just getting that little thing out of the way  initially is a nice upgrade right there.  The other thing being just the user interface.  I love the way the upgrades and changes there.  I think it's more logically laid out.  I think it'll be easier for someone who's never looked at it to use it.  Little things, you know, it's a lot of polish,  but it's also just some basic underpinnings.  The things that was like, OK, why wasn't it this way to begin?  And I was like, OK, maybe it is pretty much just a version, too.  But it's definitely improved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know, you're the only one that I've heard that has nothing but raves.  And I'm wondering, why do you think other people are so  condemnational?  That's even a word.  I like that word.  A lot of people haven't used latest beta, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Only people, not none of the people who were able to sign up in the public  and download have had access to this latest version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This 5505 is not available in different download.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's only that's the thing.  I think a lot of people are dealing with some of those those  those two initial versions that were a little sketchy.  And it was really look, you're playing beta tester for Microsoft.  And don't don't kid yourself otherwise.  Well, they say it.  Helping stabilize and get the thing ready to roll up,  release candidate one.  And here it is now.  And well, it's coming up eventually.  But this latest version in particular, it was just this is the one where it's like,  you know, I've been running it now for about a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I got to ask him of this because when I saw Windows Vista, I thought  and Leo and John, you probably have an opinion on this, too.  Microsoft seems to be stuck in this.  It has to look like Windows 95, like everything.  It still all kind of looks the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. I mean, I think the toolbar, the new the ribbon  is a very big shift in user.  And the whole start menu has been redone.  Yeah, I like the fact that you can search the start menu.  That's a huge help.  Because that was a problem.  You get this massive start menu with eight thousand programs.  You can't find anything in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly. That's been cleaned up significantly.  It's really just when you click on it, when you click on it's not even a start  button, it's a little icon. Right.  Click on that little icon.  It simply shows you what are the last like eight or nine things  you've clicked on before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not going to dispute the usability or the new look  or anything, but I think what we don't know and we won't know for a while,  although they are at Black Hat,  Microsoft tried to give away copies to two thousand of the hackers at Black Hat.  It's really how secure it is.  Yeah, it's got all these new, you know, require you enter passwords  and all these new kind of layers of security.  But I have a feeling that underneath that it may be full of holes.  For instance, you know, Steve Gibson,  we did it on security now was talking about the fact that they've  rewritten the network stack from scratch.  And certainly in the betas, a lot of the mistakes that were made,  even in Windows 95, have been made all over again,  which is a little scary.  Symantec did a report on this now.  Now, of course, they'll get it better before it ships.  But the question is, can you start a network stack from scratch  and expect it to be reliable within a year or two?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you know anybody with a computer that's had their system hacked?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, actually, you know, that's a very good point.  I don't. I mean, people talk about that.  I don't know.  Well, I know. I take it back.  I know a lot of people with zombified computers.  Oh, that's yeah.  And that's hacked in a way.  I mean, I know a lot of Windows users caused by people

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  clicking on something or not paying attention to a dialog box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, what do you mean by hacked then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, somebody is talking about somebody owning your computer  and then abusing you and using your data or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, like what Steve was talking about that, that there's tons of people

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that have had that happen to us, and we know lots of them.  Are you kidding me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Zombified computers, zombified computers, one thing, but somebody who's actually  had their system penetrated by an outside force,  personally, through their router, through their whatever,  and got in and actually got some information off of somebody's computer.  Interesting story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I guarantee if we throw that out to the audience,  we have a high end audience.  There's plenty of people where that's happened.  It's a ridiculous situation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not talking about you clicked on an XC and you had your system taken over  to become a zombie for spamming or DOS attacks or things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You mean somebody coming out of the blue and I think that, you know, one time I left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got in and had my bank records that I kept on my computer.  Take it.  I don't know. I don't keep many people are personally targeted,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but I do think that as a group, when I think randomly, people get hit all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, if you leave an old version of Qt, this happened to me.  I happen to use Qt FTP and I left it on the machine and some little  worm came along and saw the support there and it started next.  I know somebody's like looking at my computer from God knows where.  I just turned off the Qt FTP by sky caught him doing it.  And I suppose this kind of thing goes on all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's one of the things I'm hoping with Vista is that it really  that is a Vista certified applications that are basically.  I forget if that's how they're going to term term that they're more secure somehow.  But it's just OK, it's been looked over and it went and it won't happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Microsoft, which is such a good job of looking over their own  applications, is now going to certify other people's applications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know. It wasn't something they did back when.  I remember some years ago where you had to do go through a Microsoft  approval system and to get on their list or white.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a it's a revenue thing for Microsoft.  They charge thousands of dollars to become certified.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's to say that, OK, look, you write an application and you didn't even take  the time to run a simple scan through your code to say, oh, yeah, by the way,  we have three buffer overflows within your code because you're too lazy to check for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'd feel more sanguine if Microsoft has done a better job doing the same thing  on its own code, to be honest with you.  I don't know. That's going to make no no doubt.  I think the really and also we all are hoping that this will be more secure.  We're praying it'll be more secure if it's not.  It's trouble for everybody, not just Microsoft.  But it's kind of a pop up to it.  What if it's good news for semantic rogue application?  Actually, semantic says it's not good for them.  There's an interesting story going around now.  A semantic and a number of other security companies are actually mad  at Microsoft and the way they have implemented security because  third party security programs won't have the same kind of access  to the system that Microsoft has itself.  They say Windows Patch Guard actually hinders their ability to protect Windows.  It's kind of in effect making it a Microsoft security monopoly.  Well, we've never seen Microsoft do that.  Patch, according to Bruce McCorkindale, chief engineer at Symantec,  Patch Guard is hurting security vendors more than it is hurting malware writers.  There are types of security policies and next generation security products  that can only work through some of the mechanisms that Patch Guard prohibits.

Transcript:  They're just going to have to work their way around the problem.  I get these companies are huge,  multimillion dollar companies that survive on the backs of poor users  who are getting viruses and other problems installed into their machines.  And they're just essentially I don't want to say parasites,  but they're companies that, you know, in some ways,  if you go back to the history of the virus, you find McAfee,  one of the guys who publicized him to such an extreme, they made him popular  with his, you know, the newsletter and all the rest of it.  I'm not a big sympathizer with the guys who make this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I agree with you. I agree with you.  And in fact, if Microsoft can say, well, we're going to establish these policies  that keep everybody but, you know, certified Microsoft drivers out of the.  I don't like that either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But, you know, at the same time, these guys, these guys are creative.  They can get around it.  I'm not going to, you know, shed a tear for Symantec.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If Microsoft said, let's say, for instance, we're going to make sure  that you can't do a root kit on Windows, nobody's going to be upset.  And if a security company says, well, but we need that capability.  Well, I don't know if anybody would be upset by that.  Microsoft has said this is good news for PC manufacturers.  Actually, Microsoft hasn't said this, but a Taiwanese OEM has leaked this,  that Microsoft, starting in October, will offer Vista upgrade coupons  to people who buy new PCs.  So that means if you've been waiting to buy a new PC,  you don't have to wait till January.  Yeah, that was predictable.  They have to do that.  They always do that, right?  Yeah, they always do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't want to come off sounding like I'm just sitting here  promoting Microsoft to no one else.  I figure if you don't have a valid reason, if you don't specifically need  the Windows operating system to run a certain program that you depend on,  do yourself a favor and check out some of the alternatives, too.  I mean, Linux distributions at this point have gotten just as easy,  if not even easier to install.  And it provides a full graphic user interface.  I put Ubuntu on my old Macbook Pro, Macbook, the 15 inch Macbook,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and it's great, PowerBook. It's great.  It was so easy. It was instantaneous.  No problems. All the drivers worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  IBM recently announced that they're installing Suisse Enterprise Edition now  and offering it on their notebooks.  And that's always had good notebook support.  Actually, it's Lenovo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the think books, the think pads.  Oh, yeah, I guess it's not IBM anymore.  So somebody pointed out is the communist.  Somebody actually put this comment in one of our tests, probably on Twitter,  saying it's the Chinese communist government, you know, that owns Lenovo.  I haven't heard anybody call it the Chinese communist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, as you guys do, this is the people who have never been to China.  It's the Reds.  The Reds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Microsoft did have a bad year in security.  In fact, they, according to Information Week, put out as many critical alerts  so far in 2006 as they had in 2004 and 2005 combined.  Maybe that's not a bad thing.  Maybe that means they're being very aggressive in patching their software.  51 security bulletins, 98 patches, 64 of them critical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Whoo. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's good. Yeah.  You know, in a way, I don't think that's necessarily a negative, is it?  It means they're fixing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The most popular software out there on personal computers should be,  you know, should be fixed a lot.  Should be fixed on a regular.  If it's broken, it needs to be fixed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And everything's broken and it all needs to be fixed.  And in a way, I think this is more saying  Microsoft's been more aggressive about patching than in the past.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, at least they're not charging us money every time they come up  with a patch on Tuesday.  That could happen, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're waiting, you know, for a network worm attack on Windows.  Security experts say it appears inevitable.  Microsoft issued the patch bulletin on Tuesday.  It was patched Tuesday for a server service flaw that was critical.  And apparently they expect  the exploits have already started circulating and they expect an attack.  I don't know what they do to any minute now.  They're waiting.  Against a fire, a researcher at immunity said,  these exploits are capable of launching attacks against firewall  protected Windows XP service pack to a worm is coming.  The bug is just too easy to exploit.  We haven't seen a bad worms in Zotop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, you know, there's a thing that's happened.  It's kind of interesting.  It's a sociology that's not really been discussed too much,  which is that most of the guys who write that kind of stuff  have all switched over to writing spyware because they can actually make  there's more there's real there's actual money to be made.  Yeah. Writing spyware.  And it's the same kind of mentality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and you can tell because spyware has gotten really good at hanging on.  It's hard to get rid of.  Really hard to get rid of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. And you can have like five different scanners.  And if you run all of them, you'll find that you get five different results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You bet. And I don't I don't think there's a scanner out there that will clean  or any combination of scanners out there that will clean it of all spyware.  I think most of the time, if you get spyware, you're looking at a reinstall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think we're really bad versions.  Yes. Well, yeah, I mean, you can get rid of most of it  if you use enough scanners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But, you know, that's where virtualization starts looking really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No kidding. We're doing a whole series on security now of virtualization  because VMware's there's a free version versus free virtual PC.  It does look good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's also good for the the the black hats, too, in terms of creating environments  where you can make undetectable very bad things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Don't don't leak out into your system. Right.  Hey, to be completely fair, Apple has released a security patch for its new Mac Pro.  Yes. It came out after it came out.  It came out Monday.  On Wednesday, they issued this fix.  I guess apparently it did.  There were five patches, including a security update  that they didn't have time to put on the computer as they shipped it.  So if you have a Mac Pro, make sure you're running software update on your Macintosh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does it happen automatically by default when you install it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it does. Nice.  It runs once a week on its own. Yeah, by default. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it'll just say, you know, what's interesting now,  I don't know if it's just me, Brett, but I don't run as administrator on a Macintosh.  I don't think anybody should run administrator on any OS if you can avoid it.  But I noticed that the the updates don't seem to run automatically  unless you're an administrator.  As soon as I log in as the administrator, I boom, it says you've got updates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So now you you set up yourself an account that isn't admin accessible.  Oh, yeah. And that's what I use day in, day out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, and you should, too. I always give myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right. You know, I'm not a subscriber to this notion either.  Oh, no, no, no, no, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can't do it very well in Windows, unfortunately,  but you should do it in every any sensible operating system. You can do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I'm just saying if you do it in Windows, you can do it.  I mean, you can set up a. Oh, it's a pain to do it in Windows, though.  Well, yeah, but it is doable.  But right. That's the problem. Nothing works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it worked on Mac or Linux.  It's set up to do that.  And the problem is on Windows, most applications expect to be root.  That's how they were in Windows 95.  That's how we did in Windows 98.  That's how we did it in the DOS days, my friend.  I'm in charge of this computer.  That's one of the changes in Vista.  As it should be, there's games you cannot run without being an administrator.  That's ridiculous.  There's no reason you have to be an administrator to run a game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. But now, Leo, do you have problems when you install stuff  or you just type in the password of the admin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It asks for the password and that's it.  It's you know, I would highly encourage everybody, you know,  you know, nobody in Linux runs as root.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I never run as you should run as the owner of the machine.  I have set up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And then on on on the there is a distinction between root  and administrator on Mac, but it's not a strong distinction.  I wouldn't run as administrator day to day.  And I don't and you don't need to.  There are there are there are very few things you can't do  as long as you're willing to give, you know, authenticate.  You just have to authenticate.  Yeah. Well, that's how that's how Vista is going to do it.  Yeah. You often have to do it anyway.  So it's not such a big deal.  It's little things like the system preference pain is locked.  You know, you have to enter in a password first.  That's all. Oh, that's not it's not a big deal.  No. Highly recommended. And I disagree with John.  I think the reason is that the spyware viruses and other processes  run with the security level you're running with.  And if you're running as administrator, you're given free reign.  In fact, there was, you may remember a few months ago, a Macintosh virus.  It was never really got out in the wild, but it was.  It was a proof of concept.  And and it it required you to run as administrator.  If you weren't running as administrator, you were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm only referring to the Windows users where it's well, I agree.  You can't do it in convenient and almost a waste of time to run anything.  But administrative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, and I agree with you. And I think that's a flaw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's that's one of the things that Vista will fix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know that's one of the things that are really tweaking, too,  because that's my other fear of Vista is that by default,  especially with the early, the two early versions  that were released to the public that you could check out,  there were a lot of pop ups for any time an application  that you were installing required root access or that was a pain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You had to click 18 times to do anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's still a couple of pop ups, but I'm just worried  that people will stop paying attention.  Well, that's right. Because for that. Yeah.  Because if that happens, then there's really  it won't be any different than the current situation.  Other than, hey, you had a bunch of warnings, but you know what?  We assume you're just not paying attention to anything at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You get warned now.  I mean, people just, you know, whenever they go to a website, just go, OK, OK, OK.  OK. Yeah. OK. I'm guilty of that, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've seen the opposite of that, where people freak out.  Well, that's true. Oh, my God, I keep going to this site  and this thing keeps popping up and they don't even bother reading it.  Because it's just. Yeah.  But those are people that are incompetent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  None of them listen to this.  And right then, very few of them listen to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sure. I'll tell you one thing I'm angry about with Apple is damn iTunes  and QuickTime now being bundled and just taking over your system.  Even when you uncheck everything to say, oh, don't take over the associations.  Yeah, I agree. I agree. It's a.  It is a nightmare.  QuickTime is not right.  Your Windows software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but Apple does not write good Windows software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's very clear. I'll give you that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. I'm going to turn it.  They need to work on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Actually, you know, that that's the Macintosh community at fault there,  because over the years, I've noticed that, you know, you have people  who get used to coding for the Mac and then they decide they're going to do  some coding for it. Always a mistake.  And you always see that they got these ideas.  And the same thing happens with Linux coders or not Linux, but the Unix guys.  And they start to your OS. That's the they start doing stuff for Windows.  And a good example of that is open office.  And if you look at the way the menus are structured in open office,  the people say, well, you know, you always use open office instead of  Microsoft Office. No, you can't.  It's like some of the stuff in there is it's like crazy or the GIMP instead of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Photoshop unusable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Although I've never used the game, so I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can actually redo the people have created layouts  that are identical to Photoshop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. And throw it on top.  GIMP shop. Yeah, it's a mold tech TV guy, right?  It was. Yeah. Yeah. What's his name?  I can't remember his name.  It's called GIMP shop. Scott.  Oh, it was a Scott. Tom.  Michelle. Michelle.  Scott, Michelle. That's right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right. Just so to they they've substituted the menu.  So it's like a clone of Photoshop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The funny thing is that Scott is not a programmer,  but you don't have to be a programmer to change the user interface on the game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I come I don't know if it's still there or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. GIMP shop. That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going to one up Robert's complaint on the iTunes.  I'm going to throw in a complaint about their DRM.  Oh, well, we all need that.  To anybody. No.  The squeeze box doesn't work.  That cool other thing.  I know what's that's I guess that's a story for another.  But I installed a window system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The other.  Robert, you're cutting it out.  You got to look at a dot MOV fuzz and I said, don't don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where? Yeah, you've got some running in the background that's tying up your machine.  Robert, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Quit burning CDs while you're trying to talk to us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a there's a telltale sound on Skype when somebody's either,  you know, got the bit torrent running in the background  or all of a sudden starts indexing their hard drive.  No, I'll play that.  While Robert shuts down his background processes, I'll bring up another story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nothing. Yeah, I'm looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm trying to find some background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's by one of those Vista boxes just doing weird stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, Vista, if anything, it doesn't do any of that background stuff.  It doesn't do it nearly as frequently, I find.  And I'm running XP right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you are you on wireless? Yeah.  Yeah, that sometimes happens to the neighbors.  The neighbors bothering you neighbors, damn neighbors.  Always plug in if you can.  AOL last weekend, some over the AOL called them overzealous.  AOL employees released a database of searches from AOL.  Six hundred fifty seven thousand people.  Three months worth of their AOL searches.  They thought, oh, we're protecting privacy.  We'll just assign a number to each search.  What they didn't do is randomize the searches.  You could see any given numbers, complete search sets.  And it took a New York Times reporter all of two days  to track down 62 year old Thelma Arnold.  Of Lilburn, Georgia.  See, it turns out that if you look at people's searches,  it tells you a lot about who they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She is all of vanity searches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah, that would be one way.  Certainly, if you looked at my search results, you'd see a lot of  who is Leo Laporte and why. Yeah, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In fact, I expect most of your searches to be that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She was searching for landscapers in her small hometown.  She was searching for homes sold in her subdivision.  It didn't take very long for the reporter to find her.  And he said, Miss Arnold, you see these?  Are these your searches?  She said, oh, yeah, those are my searches.  Hey, I mean, talk about talk about a privacy issue.  Now, well, pulled the database off.  But of course, there are copies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What were they trying to prove by doing this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  AOL said they were these overzealous staffers  were just trying to help researchers.  You know, here's a big bunch of searches.  Maybe this will help you and help researchers do what?  I don't know. Figure out what people are searching for.  I don't know. Fight terrorism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what that's usually the excuse.  It's a bad idea. Fight terrorism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a bad idea.  But I think it really underscores the fact that people like Google.  Now you know why Google doesn't want to release this information.  It doesn't take much.  Three months of searches and you could figure out who you are.  If you don't mix it all up, mush it all up in a big ball.  She was she was search person number four, four, one, seven, seven, four, nine.  Now, it's been funny because I've been reading the blogs.  Other people have looked at the search results and some of the people.  Sometimes you really don't want your search results to go public.  Let's put it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, especially those those late night Google searches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Number number seven.  Exactly. Number seven, two, six, eight, oh, four, two.  Searched for, quote, fear that spouse contemplating cheating.  Aha. Another person searched for how to kill oneself by natural gas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you got to get the right information.  You don't want to screw that up.  You don't want to screw it up. You'd be, you know, kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now, of course, these are people who are pretty unsophisticated

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  because they're using AOL to do their searching.  But I don't know if this if your Google searches got out,  that would be pretty scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, your Google searches are only associated with IP addresses.  And, you know, you can also.  But this is what you can spoof those.  You can't do that with AOL.  What this points out is that, yeah, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And maybe that's the thing to do is people should start  using anonymizers and spoofing because and maybe mixing things up.  Google said, by the way, Google said, Eric Schmidt said this could.  Does he have a German accent?  I'm going to pretend he does.  Nobody should. I like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Schmidt said this could never happen at Google.  Our number one priority is to trust our users having us.  The answer is it won't happen.  I like Wolfgang Puck.  Yeah, have a pizza.  Because they're good for you.  I would put garlic and artichoke hearts and a little bit of licorice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or voices.  It is it is really that's what you say.  A lot of people say no more voices.  I just really think it's very it's a very interesting fact that we now  in fact, I'm glad they did this because we now know really if you think  about it, if somebody could look at all your searches,  they'd know who you were immediately.  Immediately. And you can download this database if you'd like to have similar fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What was the security option you have?  Leave your wireless access point wide open for the deniability of saying.  There you go.  Using your good idea.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is a good idea.  There have been a ton of great blog postings with people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That keeps you. That's how somebody got out of an RA lawsuit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't read a lot of these on the air, but but  Emo Glasses has the AOL search database is a comedy gold mine.  It really is.  It's kind of fun to go.  So is that a bit so does somebody mirror that?  Is it available somewhere?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Download it.  Where would they look?  AOL search database about the third one down a big zip file.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, I so wish Google would supply the real time unedited what people are actually typing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it may be a little edited, but they don't do it publicly.  But if you go to the Google lobby, there's a wonderful application that you can use.  There's a wonderful application that just shows in real time what people are searching  for.  And it's fast.  Awesome.  The funny thing is people search for things like Yahoo on Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Didn't that's pretty funny.  Didn't Excite or one of the older now defunct kind of search sites do that just routinely?  Who was it?  Was Alta Vista things out to Vista?  It was Excite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was a hot pot used to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it was fun.  You could just sit there and watch.  But Google does not.  They told me that when we don't do this publicly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey, so by the way, this is an interesting story.  So we're talking about these search engines.  I was looking at some blog stats on various blogs, including my own devorat.org slash  blog.  But I'm always tracking the bots that come by because there's a bunch of search bots  out there.  And there's a new one floating around called, I think, a slush or something like that.  And it's a new Yahoo bot.  And it is slamming some sites, like maybe 10 times as much.  Google's always been the, you know, it's always about five to one Google versus Yahoo  versus MSN, with Google being the number one bot indexing.  And then you have Yahoo after them.  And then sometimes MSN is maybe the same.  But now there's this Yahoo, new Yahoo bot out there.  This is really pounding the net.  It's going to be interesting to see if that changes anything in the scheme of things over  the next year, because it takes a while to get up to say, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's the thing.  If you were going to try to start a search engine to compete with Google, you would be  slamming hard for a long time trying to catch up with Google, right?  I mean, you've got a lot of downloading to do.  Right.  Yeah.  Lucy, you got a lot of downloading to do.  Something is up.  Something's going on.  Let me just, I'm going to look at my stats because now I'm curious.  Who is looking at me?  You look at the robots?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, the robots.  The various stat programs have different ways of doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Robots and robots by bytes.  Let's do it by bytes.  That's always fun.  Just just checking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who's the most efficient?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Life Liferia is a big one.  Well, OK, half a gigabyte goes to Mozilla compatible agent, which is obviously a pseudonym  for something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, that's your Yahoo slurp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that the slurp?  That's it.  Slurps the Yahoo slurp.  OK, number one is 190 megabytes from Yahoo slurp.  And then this is just, by the way, the time period is just, I think, a week.  It's a very short time period.  Let me do it for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, this is unreported, by the way, for anyone out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  192 megs it pulled off of your own site.  Oh, let me give you the results from the month of July.  Or megabits.  1.97 gigabytes.  But it's not just one because that's the first slurp.  Then another one, 57 megabytes.  Oh, there's a ton of it.  You're right.  This is the number one search agent right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that the size of the index data that it looked at?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How much data it downloaded from my site?  How much data it downloaded from my site?  Yeah, a lot of it's redundant.  Wow.  It'll be a lot of redundant data.  Yeah, because Twit's not a big site.  Where's all this data going?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a good question.  We don't know.  But I'm telling you, there's something going on right now with this new bot.  Really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really interesting.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ask G's.  I did tell a Google guy about it, so they're on it too.  So we're going to find out eventually what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stop slurping me.  Stop slurping me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In fact, if they are pounding your sites, people out there are running these sites.  There's ways of telling the bot not to hit you so much.  You have to find out.  Usually you can find out from a Yahoo page someplace that will tell you.  You can block them.  Yeah, you can block it if you wanted.  But I don't think you really want to do that because you want to get indexed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can use the robots.txt.  And if it's a well-behaved robot.  I've got, for some reason, PlayStation Portable.  I've got 201 megabytes.  I guess that's just a, it wasn't a robot.  That's a mistake probably.  But Yahoo Slurp and then Yahoo Slurp China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's kind of interesting, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is a URL we can go to.  Shall we check it out?  Help.yahoo.com slash slurch slash slurp.  Help.  Help.  Let me put it.  It's help.yahoo.com slash help slash us slash ysearch slash slurp.  It's FAQ number one.  Why are you crawling my site?  Yahoo Slurp is Yahoo's web indexing robot.  It's just part of the Yahoo search engine, it says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well I'm telling you, I mean it may be true that it's the same old one, but it sure is  a lot more active than it used to be, I'd say three months ago.  Well, and the good-  Because I watch these bots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh no, you're right.  I agree with you.  I've never seen this one before.  I mean, I've seen it, but never this high on the list.  It's to-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe to put more elements out there.  I'm not sure what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The good thing is if you do go to this page, and I'll put a link in the show notes to this  page, you can, it has very specific instructions for using robots.txt to slow it down or to  prevent it or to change things around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I was looking at the, of all things, I ran into the Boing Boing stat page, which  they have published.  That's interesting.  And it was hitting Boing Boing so hard that they're going to have to put something in  that robots.txt because I mean, it was ridiculous.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Apple's servers have downloaded, let's see, Apple syndication has downloaded one  gigabyte.  All of that's pretty minor.  Not too bad.  I can take it.  I'll take it like a man.  So other stories in the news.  This is an interesting news week.  Certainly a week to be irate and upset.  Let me see if I can find some happy news.  Ooh, happy news.  GoDaddy's canceling its IPO.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  802.11n delayed till January.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's not really delayed.  I thought it was not supposed to be coming out until 2007 anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The standard.  So here's the issue.  It's draft right now, right?  And I know Airgo has been complaining because there's interference issues with the current  standard.  Significant interference with legacy 802.11 gear.  So they're going to delay it till they can solve these problems.  So it looks like the ratification.  I'm not sure that this story is accurate.  You don't think so?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, because my understanding, I was given the timeline for this whole procedure and  it was always going to happen in 2007.  So now this delayed to 2007 doesn't make any sense because especially January is not much  of a delay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Network World, John Cox, US online.  A second draft of the proposed IEEE standard for the 802.11.  The IEEE task group is being swamped with thousands of draft comments.  12,000 plus comments filed to draft 1.0.  I think a lot of them having to do with these interference issues.  I know Airgo, who makes the chipset.  In fact, the one you like, right, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but they make the pre-end chipset.  These draft and chipsets are mostly done by the other guys.  Airgo has never really put out a draft.  They never thought it was a good...  It wasn't what they were trying to accomplish and these other guys all jumped the gun and  they all kind of want to be MIMO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is Airgo going after some of these other guys.  The initial crop of products, according to Airgo's senior director of business development,  had bad neighbor characteristics in early tests.  But then arch rival Broadcom says, there's not one issue that Airgo cites that can't  be resolved were anything but stalled.  So yeah, you're right.  It's a fight between these guys.  It's bickering.  Bickering.  When's that ever happened in the IEEE process?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's never happened before.  But I think they'll get this resolved and by mid-2007 we'll all be running it at like  a couple hundred megabits, no problem.  You're still using it?  Yeah, I used the Belkin, yeah, and I also have a new one from Netgear which uses an  Airgo chip that's pretty fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got the Netgear one, the RangeMax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but here's the problem with that.  I just got all the...  I have three boxes from Netgear all say RangeMax and all three of them are like...  It's so confusing.  The RangeMax, unless it's got the little Airgo label on there somewhere, which they do on  the one that just says G-MIMO, that's the one that's the best of the group.  But the one that says DraftAn is probably the one that has the interference problems  but it's not an Airgo chip in there.  It's like very confusing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The problem I was having with it is when you're on the wireless, certain websites don't load.  If you plug into it directly over ethernet, everything works fine, which makes absolutely  no sense to me.  That makes no sense at all.  Yeah, I even went to their customer service and said Google won't load on the Wi-Fi, United.com

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  won't load on the Wi-Fi.  Now these things happen.  You're probably running Norton Internet Security or something like that.  I mean who knows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm on Mac.  Oh, well then there's no excuse at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I have it downgraded.  I set it down to the BG compatible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know a lot of people using these, very, very happy with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's also a cheap way to do personal security too, is to go with the 200 megabit standard  that's not official anywhere and just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nobody can use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nobody's going to hack it because nobody's using it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nobody ever heard of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it'll be resolved by sometime next year and I think then we'll see products from everybody  that are all interoperable.  That's the problem you find with WiMAX.  People say, well, what about WiMAX?  If you really talk to the people that are making these WiMAX products, they're not interoperable.  The Proxim product won't work with the Intel product, won't work with this product, won't  work with...  None of them don't...  I mean they have a spec but nobody...  There's no interoperability at all.  So you have to go with one brand throughout the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think we have a winner because Sprint Nextel just announced a $3 billion plan to use WiMAX  throughout the United States in the 83 markets of the top 100 and using the Intel chips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, we'll see.  As far as I can tell, that's not the best chipset out there.  The Proxim I thought would be the way to go with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you put $3 billion into this and you kind of...  Yeah, it should make a difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That'll make a big difference.  It should make a difference but then again, you don't know for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's an interesting move by the way from Sprint to kind of try to be the fourth generation  network of choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but you got to remember that Sprint was the one that had their...  Which I still have a dish out in front of my...  On top of my house.  Oh yeah, the Sprint Broadband.  For Sprint Broadband Connect, they had this point to point system and then they killed  it about five years ago because they were going to go to this...  You know, where you don't need point to point massive gridded kind of connectivity wirelessly  and they had all these promises and there was demos of this and that and the other thing  and then none of it worked.  And then they, meanwhile, canceled the other product and then they grandfathered it out  so you could keep an account if you had one.  And then meanwhile, something like three or four years have gone by with nothing and now  they've signed this other deal.  This could be money down the drain for all we know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Interesting.  I mean, on the other hand, if it works, they will not only be in a position to have a fourth  generation cell data network but because it's WiMAX, they could have a business as a wireless  ISP as well.  I mean, you're already seeing Lenovo putting in the, you know, WAN stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If they get it to work, it would probably be sold as fixed wireless.  It probably would not be...  Exactly.  Yeah, and so you'd have a little antenna or something on your roof.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're seeing both Verizon and Singular WAN stuff in laptops now.  So it says, well, we do Wi-Fi but if you're a Verizon Evdo customer, you'll also be able  to do that.  Yeah, we'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Our cable modem went out a couple of weeks ago and I brought home that Kyocera EVDO Wi-Fi  router.  Pretty amazing, huh?  It's amazing.  I use it with the Sprint card.  We had the Vonage, Voice over IP phone going, high speed internet, the whole...  It was as though the cable modem was still there.  Now, the sad thing is this...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One of the points of WiMAX was to get rural, unwired rural areas on high speed internet  but of course they're going to roll it out in metros.  That's where they're going to do it.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep.  They go where the money is.  Park last though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really?  We're always last.  Not for wireless.  You won't be for wireless, I don't think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a give way issue.  No, the city parks are going to get Wi-Fi here in New York.  Free Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, it's not IE7 plus anymore.  It's just IE7.  This word brought to you by Microsoft.  Okay, thank you.  Nokia buys LoudEye.  Isn't that LoudEye?  Don't find this sirens.  It's a digital music vendor.  So LoudEye is a digital music vendor.  For $60 million, Nokia becomes a digital music vendor, which is kind of an interesting move.  Although it makes sense if you make handsets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you put it in the handsets.  Like that Verizon service that I'm not fond of.  Have you played with that?  Yeah, and they got mad at me for this, but I think $2 a song is too much.  But you get to download it twice.  It sucks at $2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They should shoot people that sell $2 a song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't have to pay $2 a song and put it on my computer and on my iPod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  $0.99 should be the price.  I agree.  I agree with John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I agree with you all.  I think unless it's a hit, it shouldn't cost a dollar.  Hey, speaking of hits, I'm very excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Duran Duran is going to start performing in Second Life.  Yay.  You know, Second Life is that online 3D world.  British band Duran Duran are creating a virtual island on which they'll perform actual live  concerts in this 3D world.  Are they still a group?  No, you don't have to be.  It's virtual.  Duran Duran keyboardist Nick Rhodes told BBC News,  When I first discovered Second Life a few months ago, I was astounded by the possibilities.  That's actually more like Crocodile Dundee, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's terrible.  But I'm amused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You do concerts in your underwear.  That's the best part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, when they say live concerts, yeah, exactly.  You're not going to see them.  You're going to see their avatars.  And how are they going to make music?  Are they going to play tapes and lip sync?  Oh, wait a minute.  You don't even have to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could just run a DAT right into the system and have it do the lip syncing for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They actually don't even have to show up.  You know, if you really think about it, there's some potential here.  We could see a Jimi Hendrix reunion tour.  Now you're talking.  Keith Moon could join the Who again.  The Doors back together again.  I think this is the future.  Right, we can reunite the Beatles.  The King.  The King, baby.  Elvis has his own island.  Elvis has left the island.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sirius Satellite has this all Elvis all the time channel.  I love listening to it.  You don't actually listen to it.  You don't actually listen to it.  Sam has the Willie Nelson channel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All Willie Nelson all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I could listen to Willie all day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, brother, what's the next news item?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There is no next news item.  Good, it's about time we wrap the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think we ought to stop with Willie, Duran, and the King and thank everybody for being here.  John C. Dvorak, now we know why he's cranky.  He's just smarter than everybody else.  Dvorak.org slash blog.  Robert Heron, you can see him on DLTV and read his roundup.  Tell us a little bit about the LCDs.  Anything exciting to report?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I finally found one that I like.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where are we going to see this?  BC Mag, DLTV?  Yeah, I love color.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Color is one of the most important things to me when it comes to image quality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wouldn't buy a black and white HDTV at this point.  Accurate color.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good saturation, but just accurate color.  It's expensive to do that on LCDs.  I finally saw a good 32 inch model that I'm going to give an editor's choice to.  Also just some buying tips because those for basically under 42 inches, that's the most popular flat panel technology in the world right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sharp Aquos is kind of losing its color actually.  Is it really?  Do they get worse?  Unless it's exceptionally old.  Maybe it's the settings.  My kid might, no, no, it's just a couple of years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe somebody said, you also maybe the bulb in the back is burning out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My kid's playing with the settings probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's actually a Sharp Aquos that I ended up liking so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you gave it away, but good, I like it too.  I've been very happy.  It's okay, well it's just everyone's asking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Aquos has always been popular with consumer reports.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But this is a newer Aquos which is even more colorful than previous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just unboxed their 57 inch.  That's arguably, it's a $15,000 display.  Give it granted, it incorporates the best of every technology you can put into an LCD right now.  And I gotta say, I think it's pretty damn nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My 78 year old grandmother just got an LCD display.  Really?  Nice.  Or she likes to call it her high distribution television.  Awesome.  That's what she thinks the D's stand for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  High distribution?  But Sharp's one of the best panel makers for LCDs.  I tell you, Matlock on high def, there's nothing to beat it.  And that's exactly what she's watching.  Yeah, I know, I murder she wrote in Matlock, I know.  Hey!

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You too, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I watch a lot of Discovery Channel and HD.  I don't watch any of that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I watch that stuff.  I watch Lost.  I've been watching Weeds, I love Weeds.  Oh, Weeds is another one.  That's a real cult thing.  I've never watched one because I refuse to get caught up in it.  It's a cult show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh no, you're going to love it.  It's a great show.  Isn't it good, Brad?  That's why I'm not going to watch it.  It's fantastic.  I actually haven't seen it, you know the new season just started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the big three, NBC, ABC and CBS, the competition they're getting from the cable  networks is tremendous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not to mention YouTube.  Oh yeah, it's crazy.  Where can we catch Brett Larson these days?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you can always find me on BrettLarson.com, a website that probably hasn't been updated  in about six months.  L-A-R-S-O-N, let's not be confused.  You can always catch me on CBS2 in New York, 1010 Wins Radio in New York, the CW31 in Sacramento  and semi-regularly on CBS News, the early show and CBS News, the Saturday early show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You are media maven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, pretty much anywhere there's a camera with a CBS eye on it, I try and get in front of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Eye on this guy, Brett Larson.  It's so great to hear from you.  You've obviously done very well since you escaped the sinking ship that was Tech TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're glad you survived.  Thank you.  I'm glad I did too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's nice to chat with all you guys again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Next time, take the rats with you, will you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Please, I beg of you.  Another twit is in the can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I use very expensive hair gel.  I would be upset if they took it away from me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You've always been kind of a hair gel kind of a guy.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What do you use?  It's like 20 bucks a puck.  Whoa.  You use puck hair gel?  You know, it comes in a little puck.  It's called something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  John and I remember that.  That's the old butcher wax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the guy who does my hair makes me use it.  You don't use butch wax, do you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no.  Pommade.  But didn't butch wax come in a puck?  I think it did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm going to have to Google what you guys are talking about.  Butch wax, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the original pomade that would come in a puck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There was another one that was more popular.  It was for a short time.  It wasn't pomade.  It wasn't butch wax.  It was another one that had a really funny name.  Um, Brill Cream?  No, no.  That was a little dab of do-yah.
