Transcript:  The Fat Middle.  This Week in Tech is brought to you by Audible.com.  For your free audiobook, visit Audible.com slash twit.  And by listeners like you.  Thanks so much for your contribution.  We couldn't do TWiT without it.  This is TWiT, This Week in Tech, the show that covers every week the most fascinating  technology news, and since there's absolutely nothing to talk about, this will be a nice  10 minute show today.  Joining us from Houston in the Houston Chronicle, we've got the great Dwight Silverman.  Hi Dwight.  Hey there, Leo.  How are you?  Great to have you back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you have a great Christmas?  I had a wonderful Christmas, although it's about, it's got close to 80 degrees here today.  No.  Very, yes, it's been very un-January like.  You were just saying you had snow a couple of weeks ago.  We had snow a few weeks ago and then a few days later we were in the low 80s.  It's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do we now believe in global warming?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We believe in global something.  Let's put it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Also here, Mr. Robert Scoble, the Scoble-izer.  We don't usually get Robert in here.  It's nice to have you.  It's great to be here.  Thanks for coming in here.  I'm going to move the mic.  My first time right in front of your mouth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My first time in the studio.  Yeah, usually on Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John, tell him what he'll win when he comes in the studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You'll win a trip to Las Vegas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's Johnny C. Dvorak speaking.  But the price is right.  John, cdvorak.org slash blog in the house also was subjected to snow over the holidays.  It's been a weird winter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, John, where's my hundred bucks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, wait a minute.  He can't hear you now.  Talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, John, where's my hundred bucks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've got it for you.  Okay.  You gotta come on the show again though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  We'll do that.  And we'll film you too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, on Cranky Geeks?  Cranky Geeks, yeah.  Is that where you made the bet?  Yep.  We made the bet.  And when did you make the bet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  It was about eight months ago, wasn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it was about a year ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I give Dvorak a lot of credit for picking McCain to get as far, and McCain got as far as he did.  That's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I picked Obama and this was before he beat Hillary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, you picked Hillary, didn't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I picked Obama.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I bet a hundred bucks on him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's go to the tape.  We can find a tape of that somewhere.  So we are sitting here.  The reason I'm kind of making a joke about the lack of news is that is, you know, this is the, this is the week, the big week before all the news emerges.  This is the week before Macworld Expo and CES.  And presumably there will be some announcements at both.  What do you think, John?  You think the Apple, Apple announced very close to Showtime just a few weeks ago that Steve Jobs would not in fact be giving the keynote that Phil Schiller would be.  Does that mean Apple won't have anything to announce?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know what?  I think that the year 2009 is going to be a year with very little except tweaks.  Because of the economy?  From Apple.  No, no, just because I think they've run out of gas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They got some products they want to maximize sales.  You know, they work on maybe some new ideas.  I don't think, you know, I don't know what, what do they have up their sleeve?  You know, the Apple TV thing, that kind of direction maybe.  And some of these other little minor products that haven't really done very well.  The little Macintosh didn't do anything.  The Apple TV didn't do anything.  There's two or three other little, you know, the thing that took off is the phone.  So let's like work on that a little bit more, I think.  And that's what I'm thinking.  I could be wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Any disagreement, Dwight?  You think Apple's going to make anything big to say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think there'll be any like major new products, although I've seen one rumor  about combining Apple TV and the time capsule to create.  Frankenstein monster.  But the idea, you know, that you'd be able to really do some serious storage and stream,  you know, some of that content back out to say your iPhone or your your Mac  located elsewhere, I think that has the potential.  But that's not like a major new product.  A lot of people don't think this may happen, but I'm kind of thinking you might  actually see an iPhone Nano this time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, come on.  That was just a joke, wasn't it?  What is an iPhone Nano even mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I actually I kind of agree with him.  What? What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We agree. What? Oh, my God.  What do you mean? OK, what is an iPhone?  It's a little teeny weeny iPhone with no screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Smaller iPhone, kind of more stylish, probably less expensive.  It looks like a razor.  Not necessarily a razor, but maybe more like two thirds the size of the iPhone.  You know, they started showing up on some of the case manufacturers  references to iPhone Nano. Right.  And whether those that's real or not, you know, that could be red herrings.  I don't know. But to a certain extent, the fact that they're starting to sell them  at Wal-Mart, they're obviously trying to drive things down to the lower end  of the market. I wouldn't be surprised if you don't see a four gigabyte iPhone  Nano, as well as on the other end, a 32 gigabyte iPhone on the full size.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wouldn't that have leaked by the FCC, though, or somebody would have leaked  a new iPhone? I mean, Apple can't keep secrets anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could do the same thing that you did with the original iPhone,  which is announce it and say, now we're going to send it to the FCC.  You're right, though. Apple's been a terrible doing a terrible job

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  of keeping secrets. At the top of tech meme right now, they said  there's a new 17 inch MacBook Pro coming out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I saw that. That's basically the same as the unibody.  No removable battery, though. What does that mean?  Isn't that crazy? Why would? No.  See, that's why it's a bogus rumor.  Why would you even think of that? Because it's out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're pretty much into no removable batteries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, they got removable batteries in all the other laptops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And they didn't do that with the new 15 inches.  But it makes sense with the mini.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But why would you do it with a 17?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  With this specific with the 17 inch, the rumor is that they're doing a  really super thin battery that has a lot longer battery, longer life  in general so that you don't have to take it out as much.  And and some speculations would be like about as hard to remove as a hard drive.  So those who are, you know, more technically inclined could remove it.  But you just couldn't replace it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The interesting thing is a lot of the journalists I follow  are going to see yes only and not to Macworld.  Is that something that you guys are noticing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not going to Macworld.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's here's my question is how long before Macworld's history?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, look, Apple said this is it. This is the last year.  That's why I'm going to Macworld. I'm not going to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there'll be one more for sure, because Paul Kahn has already said  we booked the hall.  It might be kind of quiet.  There was no Apple, no Adobe, no Belkin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, you can cancel the deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think you can.  This is what happened in Boston, right?  They went one more after Apple left Boston.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Certainly, I'm seeing some interesting stuff come.  I've been briefed on some stuff coming out at CES  at like the Showstoppers show and stuff.  Well, let's talk about CES.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is there anything? What's going on?  What's going to be cool there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's home networking is going to be interesting  and home networking for normal people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the H.P. Media Smart, they kind of jumped the gun on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a little geeky, right?  I'm talking about something you plug into your ethernet  and plug into the wall and it does stuff for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that's how hard is home networking anyway.  It's hard for real people, for real.  Now, it's bullshit. It's bogus.  I mean, you can plug.  I mean, you buy the little router,  you write the little wire Wi-Fi deal,  you plug a few wires and it just works.  I don't have a problem with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When people do that, they have a completely insecure network.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although, well, the new setups for the new routers  and the new adapters all walk you through a security setup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly. In fact, I'll argue with you on that one, Leo,  because I'm on the side of this hill  and I have access to about 25 little networks around here.  I would say two years ago,  at least half of them were wide open.  As of today, all of them are locked down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that surprises me. I still go around in Word Drive  and see lots of Linksys and default and no security.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Those are old because I'm telling you,  anything you buy nowadays is locked down.  Yeah, you're right.  It's horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't borrow Wi-Fi anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, once in a while,  something happens to your connection  and you want to just get your email.  I don't think it's a big deal, so you lock on to somebody.  There's nothing. I got nothing here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How do you like your new setup?  Did we talk about that on the air or off the air?  I can't remember.  You've got a new kind of interesting  internet access situation up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, that's up north. Yeah.  Yeah, up north, we've got a...  Eric had discovered that there was a piece of fiber  on this block below where we live,  which is where his house is, running down the street,  which is wide open and owned by the Public Utilities Commission.  He tracked down somebody who could lease a chunk of it from.  The funny thing was, it's actually not underground.  It's on the poles, which makes it a lot cheaper to get it.  How did he find it? How did he know?  Well, you can look up and see it, I guess.  But he's always been interested in getting some fiber.  So anyway, we got this fiber thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Patrick, would you go look and see if there's any fiber out there?  So we bought a piece.  It's like a truffle dog. It's a fiber finder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We bought a link to it, bought a thing.  Now I'm five up and five down for $150 a month.  That's pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're putting in something called Ethernet in the Last Mile here.  I think we're the first people in Petaluma to get it.  That's 10 megabits up and down, but it's 700 bucks a month.  But 10 up. 10 up. Symmetric.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's nice. And actually, the thing that's cool about this  five up and five down for $150 is that it's a real five up and five.  It's not like there's caps or we can't put a server on.  We can put a server up. It doesn't make any difference.  You can do whatever you want. You can put a bunch of phones on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's ultimately, I think, where the Internet needs to go.  It's a utility. It's not a service. It's not capped.  It's just bandwidth.  Do you think we'll ever see that day? That's what how it should be.  It's like you buy water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's kind of the way it has been up until now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, because these guys are intruding.  I guess you're right. It's getting worse, isn't it?  Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, two years ago, nobody was talking about bandwidth caps  on cable or DSL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but there was always that hidden.  I think they always had them. I think they just never told you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's true. Comcast used to come down on you.  Oh, yeah. But they didn't tell you what you had done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that happened to Dave Weiner. He all of a sudden, you know,  he said they said they sent him a note saying,  You're a hog. We're turning you off.  Yeah. Like what? Right.  Of course, what was Weiner? Did that have anything to do with this bandwidth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We don't talk about what Weiner's up to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have you two had a falling out? What's going on?  You guys were buddies for ages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I talked to Calcans. That's why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's this now. And see, this is an interesting thing.  This has gotten two incestuous.  We all have these relationships, cross relationships now,  and somebody hates somebody else.  And I think that's because of Twitter.  I think it's because of Friend Feed. I think it's all this interaction.  We were better off when we were all in our little closets all by ourselves.  And we'd emerge once a year at CES or Comdex, and that'd be it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, there's more than a few of these guys that like to see stay in the closet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just want you to know that that entire speech I just gave was a straight line  for John C. Dvorak. Absolutely.  That's how long I've worked with him. It was a complete setup.  I knew it from the first moment.  So one of the reasons we're doing... Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go back to home networking and the idea of making it easy.  I've been playing with Windows 7 and Windows 7 has this interesting feature  called Home Groups that tries to make it simpler  to set up specific folders and things that you share among computers at home.  So I think you were talking about the idea of networking being difficult.  I think it's difficult on the computer itself,  not necessarily once you get it set up.  It's figuring out how to make your printer work, how to share files.  That could kind of be difficult, at least if you're on a PC network  and certainly on a mixed PC Mac network. It's a little easier with Macs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's getting worse because normal people are getting digital cameras  all over the place, right? Oh, it's crazy.  And how do you move your digital photos from computer to computer?  How do I get them from my house to my relative's house so they can watch them?  It's really a pain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know it's a problem because I get the calls on the radio show.  I know that people are in pain.  Although I also know there's a huge interest all of a sudden in this stuff.  I mean, everybody wants a NAS.  What they don't know to ask for a NAS, but everybody wants a NAS.  That's what they're going for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're going to get something at CES.  You're going to hear about something that you just plug in.  You don't even... There's no geeky terms about it.  You just buy it, plug it in, and it does all sorts of stuff like what we're talking about.  The other stuff that I'm seeing is stuff to plug onto your HDTV  to make it easier for normal people to show videos and photos on your HDTV.  I think we've seen those for ages.  Yeah, but they've been too hard for normal people.  And everybody in this room all knows how to get a photo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sandisk made a device you plug in, you put it on the top of the TV  and then you just put your little... I never...  Does anybody do that? Do you do that?  Do you go home with your compact flash, your SD card, plug it in, say,  Hey, everybody, come here. Look at all my pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Usually we all surround ourselves on the Mac, you know, or on the PC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's so sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or I put them up on Flickr and I'd call that down and say,  Hey, my new photos are on Flickr like I did last night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think we'll also see this.  I don't know if there's a market for this.  3D TVs. Everybody's talking about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I saw that at Berlin. It's crappy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't want a 3D TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Even if you did, it's crappy.  The quality of the experience is crappy.  Really? Yeah.  And it looks blurry to me.  I don't think it'll go anywhere.  They look blurry. That is the problem.  And there's no content.  And the video networks are still...  There's going to be content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All the movie companies are getting behind 3D.  That's bullshit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't think so?  No, the TV companies are still struggling to get up to HD.  And that's a huge improvement.  3D doesn't get much...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Every game, I was talking to Ryan Schraut, we do a hardware show.  Every game, because it has Z-Buffer information built in the game,  can do... very simply do 3D.  It's not so difficult to flip that switch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the TVs are blurry.  I saw them at the IP show.  Do you put on glasses? How do you do it?  No, you just stand in front of the TV.  Microsoft had a prototype of it when I worked there.  It looks 3D, but it's blurry.  It's using little pixel elements on the TV to make it sort of a pseudo 3D.  It's just not very good quality.  You look at that next to a DLP monitor or something,  or next to a TV at Sony or Panasonic or Pioneer.  It just doesn't look sharp.  Are you off air?  No.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I went, oh, rats.  No, I forgot to turn your microphone on again.  I don't know whether it's about that microphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People aren't going to buy 3D TV until it looks like real TV and is 3D.  As long as there's some kind of compromise, they're not going to go for that.  Or if you have to wear special glasses.  Right.  And there's always this cycle of, particularly in film, where,  oh, 3D is back and the glasses are lighter or they're less intrusive or something.  But it goes for a month or two and then it dies.  It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If I think back at 3D, first you had the red and green glasses, House of Wax, right?  Bomb.  Then it came back in the 80s at Disneyland with Captain EO and Michael Jackson.  Bomb.  Then IMAX.  It wasn't a bomb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They packed them in to see these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you've seen that 3D movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And Honey, I Shrunk the Kid, whatever it was, was quite worth it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, Honey, I Shrunk the Kid.  Do you like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's enjoyable.  But you wouldn't want it in your home.  The 3D effect was fantastic.  The one effect at the end where there's little monsters sitting on the shoulder of the person  in front of you.  I mean, it was really fantastic.  But it's not the same as, I mean, 3D TV is like, what are we going to get out of it?  The screen's not big enough.  But I think 3D in the movie theaters will be a good gimmick for more than, I think it's  going to be more in a few months.  It's going to probably be two years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We went and saw you two, 3D, you two, the rock and roll concert.  Yeah.  Oh, I wanted to see that.  It was awesome.  Was it?  But it was on IMAX in a surround video in 3D with really good glasses on, not the cheap  red and blue ones, but the gold ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just remember seeing Superman Returns in 3D on IMAX.  It was really annoying because the whole movie wasn't in 3D, just portions.  So they put a little icon on the bottom of the screen.  You're supposed to put on your glasses, watch the Superman fly at you, then put the icon  pops up and you take it off again.  And I couldn't even follow the story because I was so busy putting glasses on and off.  It seemed like a bad idea.  But I guess for you two, I guess that'd be fun.  So back to C.  Did Bono come flying at you?  Oh, it was awesome.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He went right over the drummer and when he raised his sticks up, we were all like, whoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll tell you, that's the problem with 3D is that the content companies feel compelled  to do stupid 3D tricks.  So the whole thing ends up being just a stupid, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, do you remember, Leo, the early days when they went from mono phone LPs to stereo?  Oh, yeah.  But even early Beatles that have extreme stereo.  They have extreme stereo.  They have the I remember some of these albums that came out that they would have the music  going back and forth, back and forth.  Quadraphonic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Imagine this in 3D.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you have a quadraphonic stereo, John?  You must have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, the quad thing came and went and I kind of saw it as a gimmick because it wasn't  really because you can recreate quad sound with two speakers.  So I'd never thought much of the idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought you might be the kind of hipster that would have because and they would come  with a joystick so you could rotate the music around the room.  So stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, pretty much if I don't get it for free, I don't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What about POM?  The POM is going to, by the way, there's a classic Dvorak line.  Let me make a mark on that.  POM is going to try to save itself at CES with the Nova operating system.  They've kind of long on the tooth and Nova is going to be a Linux based.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they just got 100 million dollars thrown at them by.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, McNamee's crazy, Elevation Partners, because he, Roger's already put a lot of money  into POM and I think he just he can't he can't pull out of this.  I think it's done.  But I think it's done.  I'm going to the press conference just to see what has anybody seen Nova?  Dwight, have you seen Nova?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I have not.  They've been keeping it under wraps.  I haven't seen any screenshots even.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's kind of sad because POM had that folio, which was a netbook.  Had they had they gone ahead with that, they might have had a hit.  They pulled that saying, no, we've got to focus on our core business, our operating  system, trio tanks.  Now they go, oh, so let's create Nova.  I just don't think there's space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, Dvorak, is there any space in this market for a POM?  I mean, you got iPhone on one side, you got rim on the other side and you got Nokia scrapping  for everything else.  And Microsoft is there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, Microsoft's a distant fourth of all things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they still sell a lot of machines.  But where is the space for a POM in this world?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Those spaces only if they had some knockout product that was just so great.  It'd have to be an iPhone.  The iPhone's the one that knocked them out because there's only so many players that  you can have.  An iPhone is so, I guess, major, would be the way to put it, that I think the iPhone  itself is what knocked POM out of the game.  I would agree with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then there's, well, was it one two punch because Blackberry was beating them, beating  them, beating them, softening them up.  Yeah, but that's where it's been around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was, I mean, this is when new player comes in.  I mean, this is kind of like, you know, how, you know, there's only been so many game  consoles that have ever been in the market at the same time.  And then once somebody drops out like Sega and, you know, you always usually have a couple  two or three, two dominant and maybe, you know, another guy trying to hang in there.  And this is essentially what's happening with Sony being the odd man out.  But at one point, if you remember, when Sony PlayStation one first came out, everyone said,  well, they're never going to make it into this business.  And they pushed out Sega.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's interesting because I was at Nokia World a month ago and the Nokia executive seemed  more freaked out by Google with its Android operating system than by the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They've got somebody hacked netbooks to put Android on.  It looks pretty good, actually.  But is really Android a threat to anybody?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It could be.  Remember, remember 1989 when the Mac and the Mac, too, was way ahead of Windows.  I mean, it wasn't even close.  And then Windows caught up and passed them because they had the operating system and  they had the developers.  And Google, because it's open source and more developer friendly, supposedly, could be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but who has the developers right now?  It's Apple.  Apple, Apple.  If a program like iFart can make millions of dollars, then that's the platform you want  to be on, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did iFart make millions of dollars?  You know that for a fact?  What?  Say again?  This program, did it make millions of dollars or is it just kind of a gimmick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's at the top of the iTunes list.  I saw a story that said they were making about $30,000 a week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So hundreds of thousands.  But it's only three weeks old.  You know, I mean, look, there's definitely money to be made on the iPhone.  People complained at first about how much of the share Apple was taking.  I don't think anybody's complaining anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The thing with Android is that it's built on kind of the same model that DOS and Windows  was.  In other words, instead of pairing in a hardcore way the hardware and the software, it's taking  the software and putting it on whoever wants to run it.  I think Google is taking me.  I think Google is taking me.  Patrick, that wasn't very nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You see, that's why it's the number one selling.  It's a laugh a minute.  It's totally funny.  Once.  Once.  Once, yeah.  Do you think I get one more out of it?  Maybe.  No, you're right.  Once.  Maybe twice, not three times.  All right.  That's pretty good for 99 cents.  What were you saying?  I'm sorry, I distracted myself.  Oh, we're talking about Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Serious tech talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I agree with you.  I think you're right.  I think Android long term is going to probably be the winner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really?  The winner?  No, not the winner.  The winner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think so.  No, I think it's going to do just what you said.  I think it's going to go right past the way because Apple, they lock everything down.  At some points, they always do something that will work everybody.  They'll screw somebody over or they'll do some other thing or they'll bring out an upgrade  that screws a bunch of people or they change the API.  There's always something.  Then the open source stuff starts to sneak up.  It's going to take a while.  I'm not saying tomorrow, but at some point, the open source has a better idea and somebody  dreams something up.  Then you have one killer app and then people go back and forth for a while.  The next thing you know, it's all over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can you name one area where this has happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The Macintosh, the Apple versus the PC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Open source, people coming to it, suddenly beating the commercial closed source product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think Firefox is slowly doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe Firefox.  Okay.  I'll give you that one.  It's not been quick.  It's slow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's very slow.  It's slow.  It's very slow.  It's very slow.  It's very slow.  It's very slow.  It's very slow.  You can use a PC to build all sorts of weird stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apple coasted.  That's what really happened.  Apple coasted from 84 to 94.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Still today, a Mac can't really be used in weird situations.  It's great for being-  What weird situation?  Space?  Running a pistachio factory, for instance.  You have to use Windows if you want to run a pistachio factory.  Well, it was a lot easier back then.  Remembered building a specialized app for doing something like that was a lot easier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Apple's come around on that.  It comes with every tool for developing apps under the sun.  I don't know.  I agree with you that Apple has done some really anti-competitive things.  iTunes is a really good example, the iPod, iTunes axis.  I think the iPhone's going to be pretty tough to beat.  How do you beat-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The iPhone is so elegant and everything on it works so well.  People have been so fed up with their phones, with smartphones, that it's going to take-  John's right.  There's a possibility, because it's open, that Android could give birth to something  that's more elegant, is easier, is more fun to use.  But at the moment, if you use the two of them side by side, after just about 30 minutes,  it's obvious which one you want to use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, actually, to some extent, that's probably true with a Macintosh, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It certainly was back in 1989.  If you go back to 1989-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, well, there's no comparison back then, but I'm saying even today, I think the Macintosh  one put side by side to a new person.  I think that it's much more appealing.  It's prettier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What, is Windows 7 going to save Microsoft, Dwight?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know that it'll save them, but it sure is a lot better than Vista.  It's just polished Vista.  It's what Vista should have been.  It's visually tweaked.  It's a lot nicer to use.  It bugs you a lot less, and you can make it bug you less and still be secure.  It runs pretty well on older hardware.  I've got it running on a Pentium 4 with 2 gig of RAM, and it runs like butter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was the most interesting decision that Microsoft made.  They componentized everything, and I think perhaps motivated by the netbook revolution.  They wanted to make sure it would run on low and slow hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Remember, I worked at Microsoft when Vista was being built.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Take you back to that where- What is your insight into what happened here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What they were trying to do was build a 100-story high skyscraper.  They got to about level 50, and the building started leaning.  They literally had to take the whole thing down.  They were building everything on Longhorn on top of .NET.  All the cool features were built on top of .NET.  That was Gates' big effort.  He wanted to put a lot of cool features and make it possible for developers to build apps  and things on top of Windows in an easy format.  That seems sensible.  Seems sensible.  But .NET wasn't up to the job?  It was not up to the job, and the building started leaning, and they realized .NET's  not up to the job.  We're not going to get to 100 stories.  They tore the whole thing down, and Vista has no .NET code in it.  In fact, there was a rule inside Microsoft that you're not allowed to write anything  on .NET.  You had to go back to C++.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a sterling recommendation for their platform.  You better not write in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Keep in mind, internally, doing stuff on an operating system is different than doing a  little app for your work group or whatever.  They rebuilt Vista.  The problem is they rebuilt Vista in a year and so many months, and they didn't have a  lengthy beta process like they are with Windows 7.  It just didn't get the polish.  It didn't get the fit and finish.  Also, they changed a lot with Vista.  They changed the driver model.  That's why a lot of drivers weren't available when it first came out.  There was all the compatibility issues.  They changed the networking stack.  The networking sometimes didn't always work, but when it did work, it was really cool.  They changed the audio stack.  That's another reason why some of the sound cards didn't work.  Now they've had another two years to polish it.  Now we're seeing the results of that effort to polish it and make it really sweet and  spend some time on the UI in other places that were planned for Vista back in the...  Have you played with 7?  Yeah, it's pretty nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You love it, Dwight, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Robert was talking about the drivers.  They've made sure that the drivers are not incompatible.  The drivers from Vista aren't incompatible with Windows 7.  This is how well they've done it.  I installed it in VMware Fusion 2 on the Mac.  Usually, when you install the new operating system, you have to install these VMware tools,  which are specialized drivers to make it run with the virtual hardware.  The VMware tools for Vista run perfectly in Windows 7.  There's no burps.  I've got all the virtual hardware working.  They have maintained that, and I think there will be a lot more hardware that's compatible  with it than it was when Vista was released.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Steven Sonofsky is running the Windows 7 team now, and he's always been known inside Microsoft  for shipping and shipping stuff that works and not taking on any really radical revisions  or revolutionary things, but making sure that what ships works and that it ships in a good  quality state.  I'm pretty happy with that.  I'm really looking forward.  I still haven't heard Ray Ozzie really articulate what he's doing.  He got close with...  What's it called?  Trebuchet?  Azure?  With Azure as part of it, and then the Mesh is another part of it.  I have a feeling that that's all going to come together later in the year when the consumer  features of Windows 7 get turned on.  You know Microsoft's holding something back.  That's the Ray Ozzie stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's some interesting pieces in here that I haven't seen talked about in Windows 7.  For example, there's a control panel for location services.  So if your computer has GPS in it, and I don't know a lot of notebooks that have GPS, but  if your computer has GPS built into it, it'll use it, and I suspect if you're working with  some cloud services, just as with the iPhone, that could be really handy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There will be more GPS.  I interviewed the guys at Broadcom who make the GPS chip for your cell phone.  That team...  By the way, Leo, you should have those guys on your show and see what they're doing in  terms of chip.  They started in 2000.  I saw your stuff.  It looks really cool.  In 2000 it was as big as a PC, and now it's an eighth of an inch of your thumbnail, and  it has GPS on it.  It has an accelerometer for the iPhone.  And it's not for phones.  Well, they're making the chip for phones, but that chip could go into a laptop, could  go into anything, right?  A notebook.  Because it's cheap to make that stuff now.  They're making like 200 million of them for cell phones a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have a question.  Dwight, you said that it would be handy to have GPS interface with the Windows 7 if you  had GPS in your computer.  Handy in what way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, do you have an iPhone, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I'm not talking about that.  So with a computer, with an iPhone, I can see it would be handy.  You could be roaming around, take a photo, and it gives you some thing.  But I'm not moving around with my computer.  You are with a notebook.  Yeah.  Okay, so even if I am, I'm not taking pictures with it.  It's too big to have kind of walking around town.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it would help you look up Google Maps.  I can do that, generally speaking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have GPS in my notebook, and I have various mapping programs.  I just boot them up and I'm roaming around.  I don't see that as going to be any good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's a killer app in a phone.  I'm not sure in a notebook.  In France, it was great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but see, you're going to get it so cheap because it's a piece of silk in the third  of a size of your thumbnail.  Why not put it in there?  And you're going to get all the same features your iPhone has on your netbook.  I don't know, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As phones get more powerful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm just saying, I'm not seeing what you just said it was going to be.  When you say it's going to be handy with such enthusiasm, I'm wondering how is it going  to be any more handy than what I have already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, certainly anytime I blog, I'd love to have that metadata added automatically to  my blog that I'm blogging from Petaluma instead of Half Moon Bay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know if I use BrightKite or Looped or any of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't.  I already tell everybody where I am anyway.  I use Looped.  BrightKite actually is pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I use BrightKite.  Looped ties to Facebook, so I use Looped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People can already stalk me.  They know where I am.  I don't think we're a good example for these kinds of things because we're semi-public

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  figures.  But I mean, if you're an individual with a group of friends, I think of Patrick and he  wants to know where his friends are and they're all hanging out at one place and he can see  where they are and go there.  I think of college kids that they would love this kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there's an app in the iPhone that I love called Around Me.  It has a list of categories of things that you can, it looks at your GPS and says, okay,  where are all the grocery stores around me?  Near Me.  Near Me.  The app is called Around Me.  Oh, okay, because there's also a Near Me.  Yeah.  They're similar.  There are several of these.  But on a notebook computer, let's say you're in your hotel at CES, where are Chinese restaurants  around me?  And you would see this on the notebook and off you go if you didn't have it in your iPhone.  So I think there's a lot of application for location.  I've been really turned on by the idea of location services on the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that you said a critical thing.  If you don't have your iPhone, I think though there's less market for this because most people  will have this capability built in their phone.  They're much less likely to go to their laptop to do this.  I mean, I'm playing with Around Me right now.  It's pretty cool.  It's pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just going to, to me, it doesn't matter.  It's so cheap.  I love location.  Because the cost of these chips now is so cheap, that might as well put it into a network  and use it and build a consistent UI, consistent experience across all your devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're going to take a break when we come back.  The day the Zune stood still.  Perhaps the weirdest bug in history.  But first I want to mention our friends at audible.com.  They're the folks who make this show possible.  A-U-D-I-B-L-E.com.  Hey, Dane, are we doing Twit 2 or Twit 749 today?  Hey, Dane goes, huh?  What?  Hey, is it Twit 2 or 749?  What are we doing today?  No, no, no.  Standard, every day, every day audible.  Audible.com slash Twit.  Audible.com slash Twit.  Dane said it.  That's the place to go if you want to get a free book.  Okay, show of hands.  Anybody here use Audible?  Anybody?  Daniel, you do?  Robert, you use Audible?  Once in a while.  Barry does.  Once in a while.  I'm telling you why.  Patrick, what is the truth?  He doesn't use it ever?  He's not an Audible reader.  No.  Dad doesn't read, does he?  No.  Dad's too busy Twittering and friend feeding and blogging.  He doesn't have time for a book.  You know, Robert, you're the guy who should be reading Audible books.  See, I bet you there's times that you can't be Twittering, friend feeding and blogging.  Maybe you're driving a car.  It's against the law to drive at Twitter.  You can't do it anymore in California.  Maybe you're gardening.  Maybe you're working out.  Well, maybe you're gardening.  So then you need audible.com because audible is the place where here.  This is one for you.  Audible has this thing called your daily listen.  I love this.  Here's this is your this is your daily listen.  This is your this is your daily listen feature for today.  The art of happiness by his holiness, the Dalai Lama.  Don't you think in your hectic, fast paced day, Robert, I lie.  How do you say it?  Dolly Dolly.  Dolly.  Hello, Dolly.  The Dolly Lama.  Probably none of that is correct.  Probably it's some weird Tibetan word that sounds like boy down to why and Lama.  Anyway, that guy, you know, the guy in the red with the glasses, the giggler.  He has a book called The Art of Happiness.  Actually, I have this on my end.  And whenever I'm a little, you know, whenever I'm down, I'm weary.  I listen to the art of happiness by the Dalai Lama, Dolly Lama, and it makes me happy.  How did I get that wrong?  The Dolly.  It was 1993.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I had first met the Dalai Lama over a decade earlier while I was visiting Dharamchali,  India on a small research grant to study traditional Tibetan medicine.  This beautiful and tranquil village perched on a hillside in the foothills of the Himalayas.  Oh, I forgot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They don't have him reading it, but it's still it's all the words are there.  It's really great.  Just one of many fifty one thousand books you can read or I guess listen to.  John's always a stickler for getting that right.  Listen to some wonderful stuff.  This is actually narrated by Howard C. Cutler, M.D.  He's a doctor, so you know, he's narrating it properly.  Probably even says his name right.  He was the co-author of the.  What are you laughing at?  What are you laughing at?  Audible dot com slash twit.  Go there right now.  You get a credit toward a free book.  You like.  What do you like?  OK, let me ask you, Robert.  Give me a category.  Guy Kawasaki's.  Guy Kawasaki's on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Reality check.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Don Tapscott's on there.  Yeah.  They got business, classics, education, erotica and sexuality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's no fun in audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't listen to that when you drive.  Patrick seemed interested.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fiction, history, kids and young adults, mysteries and thrillers, romance, sci-fi.  I read a lot of sci-fi on Audible.  Audible dot com slash twit.  We thank them so much for their support of This Week in Tech, and we encourage you to  give it a try.  If you've never tried Audible, get your book free.  Listen to it.  You're going to like it too, Patrick.  Stay away from the.  He was arguing about porn with the FCC commissioner.  Oh, I think he knows a little bit about that.  Did the FCC commissioner ask him for advice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Is this Kevin Martin or the new guy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, Jonathan Adelstein.  Oh, really?  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm impressed.  Mr. Commish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  Audible dot com slash twit.  We thank them so much for their support of This Week in Tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Strangest bug.  I think strangest bug in the history of the world.  I think it's the most important thing.  I think it's the most important thing.  I think strangest bug in the history of consumer electronics.  The day the Zune stood still, the Zune decided that 2008 was not a leap year.  365 days was more than enough.  So on December 30th, it just stopped working for a day.  That is so weird.  It's only the Zune 30 gigabyte, however, and that means that only about 10 people were.  Five people?  It wasn't a huge problem.  Actually, a million people bought that, or at least maybe there's a million sitting in the store somewhere, but there were a million shipped.  So that's potentially quite a few people.  Is that a weird bug or what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I found that the whole thing was a peculiar story.  Very peculiar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have you ever heard it?  John, you've been around for a few years.  You ever heard of anything like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I find the whole thing.  I still, it's so screwy that I'm of the opinion that somebody had maybe planted something in the code.  You know, a disgruntled employee.  No, I looked at the code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I actually looked at the code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I looked at the code.  See what I was talking about earlier?  Leo has his hands in code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I looked at the code and it was a kind of bug like a first year programming student might make.  It wasn't Microsoft's code.  It was free scale code.  It's the code, the date, the real time clock code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It happened in the gigabyte versions that Toshiba sells.  See, and that was based on the same hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Same hardware.  Yep.  So it was not an intentional bug.  I mean, the source code's there.  Actually, do you ever read Hacker News?  I love Hacker News.  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  It's great.  It's Y Combinators or Combinator.  It's pronounced thali?  Okay, it's their kind of feed.  It's a really great feed and that's where I saw the source code on that.  You know, it's just a silly little bug somebody made.  But it's weird.  And Microsoft's response was, well, we're checking into it.  It was like, I was watching MSNBC.  It's like a big story, right?  And they had file footage.  The gorillas, they kept showing the same file footage that came out when the 30 gig Zoom first shipped with the gorillas album art on it.  And they kept showing it again and again.  They were showing footage of squirting because that's all they had.  And then Microsoft said, well, we're working on it.  Finally, they said, you know what?  It's going to be better tomorrow.  Just leave it alone.  Very weird.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  And they all came back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They all came back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They all came back to life.  I have one that was not turned on at the time.  I was out of town.  As soon as I got back, it was like on the second and I fired it up and it worked fine.  No issues at all.  It had just been sitting, as you said, in a drawer.  And it works fine.  I didn't see anything in it.  I have one of the newer Zooms and it ran fine on the day that they all were right, you know, were dead.  But this this first one was the one that had the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As did as did mine.  I have a four gig zone.  So it was only the first generation zooms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And actually, soon as you know, people like make fun of it because it's kind of ugly.  And but the software is really nice.  Moving through songs and video is nice.  It plays video better than I think better than the iPod.  And I like the way video looks on it.  So it's not that it's not completely crappy, but people sure like to make fun of it.  Now, I think we were talking about video.  We're talking about phones.  You know, we didn't talk about Microsoft and Windows Mobile.  And I think you may see something as a result of the danger acquisition and the zoom software that Microsoft has.  I think that's a possibility.  I think we were talking about POM and why POM doesn't have a chance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think that's a great example of why it doesn't have a chance because Microsoft still has how many how many Windows Mobile phones sell every year?  Hundreds of millions.  Yeah, I mean, it's not a small platform.  It's not a great platform.  I mean, but they're still selling a lot of phones around the world and they have relationships with lots of companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who build, you know, devices form.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So absolutely, they're going to stay involved in the game and not let POM back into that into that table.  But I don't have any insights there.  I know a new a new device is coming.  Windows Mobile team told me some new stuff is coming.  I'm not sure if it'll be this week, but certainly by the middle of the year, we'll see another another new platform coming out.  What's it going to be?  I don't know.  You know, I think it's going to be a little bit more of a surprise.  I don't know.  You know, the people at HP say it's say it's not an iPhone killer.  So that's the real answer is iPhone still is going to win by the end of the year.  Well, that's what POM says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're not going after the iPhone or the Black Bear.  We're going after the fat middle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, this is ridiculous, which I resent, frankly, these guys are going to have a lot of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Believe me, they're going to get me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, speaking as the fat middle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Go ahead, John.  I'm just saying, why?  You know, this guy's got like a cut.  This is like a football team.  You're in football season right now.  Right.  So, you know, well, you know, I know that's the championship team, but we're not going to go after them.  You know, we just want to kind of come in third.  What kind of attitude is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's a big market coming in third is probably pretty good, but it's not exactly a winning attitude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, it's a losing attitude and this about I mean, you know, I would just seems like they're not competitive.  I mean, to have this kind of a notion within their strategy is ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nokia over in Europe has a subscription music service on a cheap phone and all the kids are going crazy about it over there.  You know, how are you going to beat that?  You know, how are you going to get back in the market?  How are you going to regain anybody's confidence that you have something interesting to pay even go into the store and check out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You saw the N-97.  You seem to really like that.  I want one.  I really think that's to me.  It looks like a tilt or something.  It doesn't look like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's it's not an iPhone killer, right?  So stop stop there.  But it it has a great camera.  It has keyboard five megapixels, five megapixel camera.  It has wide screen video.  So for all of us freaks who want to build content for Facebook or YouTube or whatever, it's going to be a great device for that.  It's a niche device, though, because it's so expensive.  It absolutely is niche, at least in the United States until they can figure out how to get a carrier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How well did the N-95 do?  I mean, it was a geek.  It did pretty well.  It's millions of units.  Geeks loved it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But not in the United States because they can't figure out how to get a carrier subsidize it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why not?  You're Nokia.  You're like huge.  Why can't you?  Why won't the carriers carry these these really smart Nokia phones?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because there's iPhone here.  I mean, if you're if you're at AT&T, you're not going to switch from the iPhone.  Yeah, AT&T carries the Storm and Verizon's Blackberry.  Blackberry and the Storm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The Verizon is the one that's pushing the storm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Verizon, that's right.  Blackberry.  AT&T's got the bull.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But there's already great smartphone devices that already have market share.  Why?  Why would anybody say, well, let's go take on Nokia now?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's their problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, I think I think Apple's going after the fat middle.  I think that they're starting out with the you know, with these high with the high end phone.  They've continually brought the price down.  They're selling it at Wal-Mart.  I think you will see an iPhone Nano.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think that that what the Nano's for is like a ninety nine dollar phone like a step down.  Yeah.  Would you see it having any of the application functionality or is it a smartphone?  Of course it has to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah. It won't have GPS.  I don't think it have GPS.  I disagree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, really?  It's just include.  I you know, what do you take out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have to take out something.  That's never in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Less memory.  You know, maybe a little bit lower quality screen.  Smaller screen, smaller screen, which is lower quality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because, you know, I like my son wants an iPhone, but I'm not going to give it to him because it's all a big glass screen.  He'll sit on it within weeks.  And Patrick's had one for two years and he goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, but I've had friends that have their screens shattered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm careful.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Patrick's also not a skater and my son's a skater and he keeps it in his back pocket.  So actually he he likes to do, you know, thumb boarding with his regular with his phone.  He like flips it in the air and stuff.  So I don't know if the iPhone's the right choice for him to be honest with you.  But a Nano might be if it's a little more robust, a smaller screen.  Does it have a keyboard?  No, it's the same same functionality as the existing iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, that's that's that's the whole problem with the iPhone Nano, even as a rumor, because when you shrink it down, that nasty virtual keyboard gets even smaller.  Unless it only works in what I would do is I would only make it work in landscape mode, not portrait.  That's interesting.  Do a landscape mode phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.  Big surprises.  Any at Macworld?  Anybody?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Steve Jobs will make a surprise appearance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think he's going to show up on stage with Schiller, right?  Because he's got to be like right now.  It's Kim Il Sung.  It's like, yeah, I mean, it's like he's not he's not Apple's done nothing to quash these rumors.  I think we're all agreed.  Steve's fine, right?  Anybody think he's ill?  I think it's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've talked to plenty of people who've seen him around the yogurt shop.  Even not just the yogurt shop.  Other people have seen him around town lately and said he looks fine.  It's Kim Il Sung.  He's got to make an appearance.  They've got our business.  Kim Sung Il.  To tell you the truth, Kim Jong Il.  Yeah, it's the Dalai Lama.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a Dalai.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's none of our business, whether he's good or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it is our business only because Apple's a publicly held company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What's your business if you have shares?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And well, presumably some of our audience might have an investment in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I think I think you're right.  I think it would be crazy for him not to just show up and say hello to the you know, to the kid.  Is he going to be the one more thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, that would be funny.  I think he's the one more thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK.  Or or he's a you know how they'll often do like an eye chat demonstration.  He's who they'll eye chat with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's in the audience dressed as the Dalai Lama.  That could be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they could put a virtual head up there.  I am the giant head of Steve Jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am Jobs, the rich and powerful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, that that actually is a pretty interesting guess.  You know, if they come out with a really cool new chat system, a new Twitter killer or something.  And it's Steve and it's Steve.  And he's in France or France.  You know, he's home, you know.  That would be cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that would be very cute.  All right.  So we I think that's a pretty pretty fair bet.  Bigs.  What is the big surprise at CES?  3D.  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's sad.  First of all, that's not a surprise.  It was at IFA six months ago.  I don't know.  SED TVs.  To me, I'm walking around with Best Buy.  No, it's back to reality.  Back to reality for the consumer electronics.  I think that's the story is how small is CES this year?  How bad is the consumer electronics industry?  And how are we going to how are we going to get motivated to go and buy new gadgets in a time when we're all laid off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Watching the pricing of these gadgets should be interesting, too.  I think you're going to see a lot fewer, you know, two ninety nine and three ninety nine devices and a lot more than ninety nine dollar devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think CES is going to be a dud.  That's why I'm not going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually say that every year, John.  Every year it's a dud.  First of all, he's always right.  He's always right.  That's the one thing that Dvorak actually is right about.  It's the one thing, but that one for sure.  But you know, it's always John always says that he's always says he's not going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then always at the last minute, not all of it, but often at the last minute, you say, I'm going to go and you go for an afternoon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not going because I'm going to do this special thing.  Are we going to do something at the Macworld for the to it?  The Twitch show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, you bailed out on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I was going to do it.  But then Kevin Rose wanted an appearance fee and I thought, no, Kevin Rose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is that how we're monetizing?  Wait, wait, wait.  Tell me that you should be paying you the appearance fee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, I'm just kidding.  Yeah, I was going to I was I've been really agonizing over this keynote and I thought, well, maybe what I'll do is I'll just bring out you and Kevin and a bunch of other people and do a panel or something.  But I think I'm just going to talk.  But come anyway, you know, make a surprise appearance.  You could be like Steve Jobs, just like a peer.  It'd be really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So basically you fired us on.  You're just going to do it by yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I wasn't paying you anyway.  But if you want, you can you can come on.  Come on stage.  I'm talking about the end of the world as we know it.  The I tell you what, can you do me a favor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  And record it and send me the PowerPoint.  So so what would be great?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Take Phil Schiller's keynote and stream it live and get Leo and Dvorak and Cal Canis and Kevin Rose sitting down in front like Mystery Science Theater 3000.  That would be funny, wouldn't it?  And then in real time, react to what I've always wanted to do that.  Apple won't let us do it, but I would love to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm just going to be reading this all on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that how you will follow it?  Is you just absolutely.  In fact, that's how I got my news when the Apple was in the news.  I was people were telling me, how do you just see what Apple and Twitter has really replaced live blogging really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because you get it from a variety of sources.  Do people use hashtags?  Is that how you follow it or partly?  So there'll be a Mac world hashtag that I'll follow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But also just people will start talking if something cool comes out.  You watch the conversation.  Everybody will be talking about Apple.  Look at Apple.  Look at Steve Jobs.  Yeah, whatever.  That's I guess if you're going to go up there on stage and do this, that is what's going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Everybody in the audience is going to be talking about it.  What's going to happen to everybody in the audience is no one's going to be looking up.  I know.  They're only going to be Twittering.  I think it would be kind of cool, by the way, to give a speech because you get this audience full of these bloggers because I've seen this.  I find it very annoying.  You go up there and nobody's looking at you.  So you can be doing some you can make some be making faces or doing some.  I was going to bring my blue ball and sit on that.  It's not going to happen.  Right. So nobody's going to see it.  So they got all down there.  They're all blogging away.  It would be cool if you could like transition from yacking away to a recording and you sneak off stage.  Be very, very quiet and just let this the recording continue until somebody looks up and says, where's Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That would be good.  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you're really lucky, the Wi-Fi won't work like it did.  It didn't add a blog and it or the web over in Paris.  And then and then you have to pay attention to the content because there's nothing to do.  That must have been interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People had to close their laptops and watch you.  We didn't close our laptops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We kept hitting the Wi-Fi button.  Oh, man.  No wonder it never worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We needed a hit.  Oh, man.  There are people shaking in the aisle.  Oh, man.  It was awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they were shaking for two reasons.  One, it was really cold there.  And two, you had no Wi-Fi.  Geez Louise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Last year at Macworld, they turned off the Wi-Fi.  So Daniel was sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Daniel was just at Macworld over at the hall and he says the Wi-Fi there sucks.  So it always bad.  Yeah.  Nobody's there yet.  Nobody's there yet and it sucks.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What were you saying?  I was saying that last year during during the keynote, they disabled it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You could see it, but it wouldn't go anywhere.  And so a lot of people were switching to air cards and doing it that way.  I imagine this year it'll be a lot of iPhones and a lot of Twittering out of there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know why we even bother going because as long as somebody from Engadget's going and MacRumors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's my feeling about trade shows in general now.  I like it into a football game.  It's fun to go for the atmosphere, but you don't see the game.  The best way to watch a football game is at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, it was interesting.  Two years ago we were at the blog house and we got to play with the HP computer as soon as Bill Gates talked about all the press people who were stuck in the hall listening Bill couldn't write about it because they didn't have personal experience with it.  And so everybody who was outside the hallway got a better scoop than the journalists who went to the actual keynote.  Is it over for trade shows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Actually, to stay on that point for one more bit.  I'd like to use the example of the CBIT, which is the big trade show that still, you know, apparently stays in business.  And CBIT has 2500 booths and there are 10,000 reporters that cover it.  And so you have four reporters per booth, assuming they only cover one thing, which they don't.  I mean, it's so over covered and CES is the same way.  It's over covered.  There's so many people like Robert said, you know, just these gizmodo, the other guys, you know, go off and cover.  They, right.  And there's actually a couple of other bloggers that really hit it really hard, harder than I would.  And why would you?  What's the point of going?  Just cover the coverage and you get more out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I agree.  That's what I've done for the last three or four years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm getting around that by following around Best Buy and seeing what they're saying.  I think that's an interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you're going around with a buyer because that's really what CES is all about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Vice president and we're going to talk about the future.  Same idea, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is this is the she's looking at.  What you know, what are we going to stock in our stores this and also what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How are we going to change the store and what are the trends?  What and how are they going to survive?  That'll be on fast company.  Yeah, well, it'll be a summer because I'm going to be doing live video with scobal.  I flip cam, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you're going to do it with quick.  Yeah, Rockets not even going.  Yeah, I can look happy.  I wouldn't want to make Rocky unhappy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Rocky doesn't have to stand in the two hour taxi lines either.  That's a good point.  Rent a car, rent a car.  Actually, this year, by the way, you can get hotel rooms for like 200 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting. That's a telling.  That's telling Stein.  That's like half what it normally you can still get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're taking a bus down on Tuesday with a bunch of bloggers.  But, you know, you can still get a flight down.  It's really crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do you mean taking?  You're getting on the Greyhound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, we got a bus.  Somebody somebody's sponsoring a bus for us.  So we're taking a bus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're sponsoring the bus.  Give him a plug.  It's love sack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, love sack on the love sack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a little sack bus.  And what is a sack?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It doesn't sound right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the fat middle, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that's what is a love sack right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go Google it right now.  S.A.C.K.  Yeah, S.A.C.  S.A.C.  Oh, it's French.  Even worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here, we'll Google it on our iPhone.  S.A.C.  That's not good.  That doesn't.  It's home theater furniture.  You didn't know, did you?  Robert didn't even know.  It's not me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm just I'm just going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It should be a comfortable drive then on the on the bus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we're going to have Wi-Fi and all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are they going to take the seats out and put beanbags all the way up and down?  Something like that.  Yeah, that sounds like fun.  So this is like this is traditionally at CES.  You've got to do something to get the journalists.  So you'll have a limo or you pick them up at the airport.  You make them look at the XM satellite while you're driving them around and around and around.  So this is this time they got you for like hours in a bus.  It's like being on a boat.  Oh, that's the worst.  Yeah, never go to a Christmas party on a boat because you can't get off.  You can't get off.  It's like permanent.  I speak as if I know.  And in fact, I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  So it takes one or two experiences on the on the boat.  And then you realize that you never take an invite to a boat party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've done many of those at Microsoft because that's standard standard fare.  You get get taken up to Microsoft and they take you out on Kirkland out to the Kirkland pier and take you out on a boat tour for three hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's let's end on a an irate note.  The this this story.  Yeah. Angry, angry geeks.  This story.  You have cranky geeks, John.  We've got angry geeks.  The Home Office.  This comes from Times Online in Great Britain by a Dwight Silverman.  The Home Office has quietly adopted a new plan to allow police across Britain routinely to hack into people's personal computers without a warrant.  The move, which follows a decision by the European Union's Council of Ministers in Brussels, has angered civil liberties groups and opposition MPs.  They described it as a sinister extension of the surveillance state, which drives, quote, a coach and horses through privacy laws.  It's called remote searching.  It allows police or the MI5 to covertly examine the hard drive of somebody at his home office or hotel room.  Material gathered in this way may include the contents of all emails, web browsing habits, instant messaging may be used in court.  Police across the European Union have been given the green light to do this warrantless searching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's like being on Leo LaPorte show all the time.  In fact, here's an example that Loic just said, stop talking about only the bad stuff at Loweb.  And there was Mike Arrington's going to storm the castle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, man. You know, and he has a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was other stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, if if if you're secure, in theory, somebody couldn't get in just by hacking or is there a back door?  How do they get in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's a really interesting question.  They must be. They must want to put in back doors.  I mean, they might or maybe they use hacker techniques to get Trojans on computers.  A researcher at Cambridge University's Computer Laboratory, Richard Clayton, said remote searches had been possible since 1994.  An amendment to the Computer Misuse Act of 1990 made hacking legal if it's authorized and carried out by the state.  He said authorities may break into this is legal in the EU may break into a suspect's home or office,  insert a key logger into an individual's computer, collect and if necessary, transmit details to the police.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And they can then break into your house first. Is that right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Police may also for all these privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was always hearing all the Europeans are so they got all this privacy stuff.  We would dig, you know, I'm not seeing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I'm not seeing much outrage over this.  I mean, I've seen story, but I haven't seen much else beyond this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, Britain's notorious for the number of cameras.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  By the way, you know, the FBI has done this here in this country numerous times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Without warrants?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, they probably have a warrant. That's good. Probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. But convincing a judge to give you a warrant, I don't think is all that hard in the current climate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, especially if you have something, you know, nasty that you're studying.  So they can break in your house, put a key logger on your machine or some other technology on your machine or do the usual hacky stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Without a warrant. That's the thing I find interesting.  I mean, they basically are on their own. If they feel like it, they can do it.  They can do mention a probable cause here. There's nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They can do it at the behest of another government.  It says in the story that if the Germans want you want somebody's machine in England hacked into, the home office will do it for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A remote search can be granted if a senior officer says he believes it is proportionate and necessary to prevent or detect serious crime defined as any offense attracting a jail sentence of more than three years.  It's terrifying. Yeah, I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Johnny, you know, I mean, I think it is. I mean, it's just it's onerous. I don't think it's a good thing.  I think it's probably going to end up being used for.  I mean, for one thing, what you know, if you're suspicious of somebody for whatever reason, you can always jack up the complaint.  Oh, I think he's doing this. I think he's doing that. And that's an offense for three years.  Let's go hack in his computer and you go hack into the hot secretary's computer and find out who she's dating, you know, and see if you can get a date with her.  I mean, that's not how it's used. No, I'm telling you, that's what these people do.  And then the other thing is, like you always, you know, say, well, this guy's like a hot shot in the stock market.  You know, let's trump up something. He must be up to something.  And I want to trade with him. So I'm going to see what he's up to. And I'm going to get his IMs.  And if he's going to buy this and sell that, I want to get a piece of it.  I mean, this whole thing is just the worst kind of, you know, intrusions because it's always used.  The good guys are the ones who misuse it. They're not using it.  I mean, when you really boil it down, it's used to like, essentially, you know, compromise people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or for fishing expeditions. Well, Mark Cuban, you know, he seems like the kind of guy that might be doing insider training.  Let's just check and see. I mean, that's something that's always been anathema in the States.  I hope that doesn't. I guess you're probably right. It probably is happening here, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there's certainly watching patterns that you have trading behavior.  You know, I mean, if I know that, you know, if I'm watching your packets go out of your computer and even if I don't know what the packets are and I see that you do a certain pattern of packets and then all of a sudden the stock market and stock goes up and you're making a lot of money.  I know that you were trading on that stock, you know. Right. So they've had this. They've had this ability.  Echelon and carnivore. We've wiretapped, you know, to get into drug dealers rings and stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, we've done that with a court order, right? This just makes it more important that people learn how to use things like True Crypt, that they learn how to protect themselves, that they, you know, that they get more sensitive to this.  I've always said that the future of freedom fighting is not having a gun or it's knowing how to hack. The freedom fighters in the future are going to be the hackers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The criminals I'm worried about aren't these guys. It's the Madoffs. I mean, you know, why is that guy out on bail?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Wait a minute. Let's stop right there. Madoff. Why? How did Martha Stewart go to jail for like getting like a five dollar, you know, scam?  This guy has ruined the lives of hundreds of people and a lot of really important charities and he's really well known charity was wiped out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Shocking. Yeah. This this that is terrible. Meanwhile, Martha Stewart and we does time. We put people who who deal a pound of dope in jail for five years.  Well, now this is not to say that Madoff's not going to go to jail. No, from what I'm hearing, his penalty is going to be like something like five years in jail for if he hasn't even been convicted or tried yet.  Yeah, but he destroyed thousands of people's lives and he's what's he he's out on bail. I mean, you know, if you get out on bail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, Martha Stewart, the point is, is that Martha Stewart thing is a travesty and that this guy, you know, I mean, the fact that Martha Stewart would go to jail in the first place is so ludicrous and become a felon.  Well, you know, this other stuff is going on at the same time, by the way. Well, Martha Stewart was being tracked down like a dog.  This guy that was during the year where this guy was stealing money left and right under the noses of the SC of the watchful SEC.  I mean, come on. Not that I'm a Martha Stewart fan. I was just going to say I think there's a little crush.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think she's a good example of abuse of an abusive situation. And that's the only reason I keep bringing it up.  Well, I thank you all for being here. What a fun show this was. It's great to see you in studio. Robert, please come back any time you want.  And Patrick Scoble also. Yeah, you didn't talk to him about World of Warcraft. Oh, yeah.
