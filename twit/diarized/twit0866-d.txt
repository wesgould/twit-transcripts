I take the chocolate over there  We fight over everything  Cheese who has the best cheese? I don't know. Let's try some more and find out  So Carolina was watching with interest. I saw your article as Apple unveiled new hardware on  Tuesday, don't worry. This is not gonna be an all Apple show  But we have to mention it because I think Apple has really shown  some real skill and leadership in the chip field these  Apple silicon is just starting to lap the other guys in really remarkable ways  the M1 ultra  Even Apple was able to have a secret at this event. Actually the Mac studio was kind of a secret  In fact, if anything this this event showed that the rumor mongers can be very wrong  they were talking about a  Mac mini that had plexiglass top they were talking about a 7k display neither of which appeared we knew there'd be a  iPhone SE that was you know, pretty much, you know on schedule the iPhone SE with 5g  And a chip equivalent to the current iPhone 13 a very powerful a 15 chip  They announced an iPad Pro with the M1 chip. No product not pro iPad air with the M1 chip but verging on pro territory  but the most interesting thing to me was this this Apple silicon in the Mac studio and  What Apple was it John Ternes or Johnny Suri?  Yeah, there was John Ternes Apple senior vice president for hardware said we have one little thing  We didn't tell anybody about with the M1 chip  It has a built-in interconnect and as everybody predicted the way Apple would move forward  With their silicon just as Intel and AMD have done is to do multiple core  Architectures, but when you're doing multi core architectures with the M1 you're they have their each die has its own memory its own  AI processing its own video processing and they glue them together and the interconnect is the fastest interconnect  Anybody's ever seen so Apple has this really great story going forward  In fact, everybody predicts you got the ultra which is two of them stacked one on top of the other  It's just a matter of time before you have four or eight  16 you could really disguise the limit very impressive  Processor  the interconnect is  2.5 terabytes per second  Kind of mind-blowing  800 gigabits gigabytes per second memory bandwidth because remember the memory is unified memory. It's on ship  64 up to 64 cores on the CPU  On the GPU rather a 20 core CPU 32 core neural engine  But Carolina you are most interested in the display

End time: 455.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I was interesting in first of all the range that they showed I think it was the first  Event where we saw pretty much Apple addressing the whole user base that they have right from the creators and the really demanding users with  The Mac studio over way down to DSE  User are the most pragmatic users that you could possibly have within the Apple ecosystem  And not so not only because of the size. I think a lot of times we get  Focusing on you know, how big is DSE is no is really about familiarity of things like touch ID  Instead of using face ID

Start time: 456.52
End time: 473.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Instead of using face ID it's I have to say when you look at it looks like an old phone  The touch ID dates it the big bezels dated a little bit the rounded corners  It's the old design  Who wants touch ID? What's the touch ID? Why I like

End time: 510.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But a good look if I actually have I have an old this is not the phone I use normally  But I have an old look at that and it's just this is I think the six  I actually use it for specific apps. I don't even have a sim card in it  But the point i'm making here is that it um, I like the touch ID because it's positive it works  Well, it works almost all virtually all the time  Um, you don't you don't have to worry about whether you got a face mask on I know they're trying to fix all that but

Start time: 511.46
End time: 515.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I I just is that is that why this is still around carolina? Because face masks

Start time: 516.66
End time: 589.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, and and apple has already, uh fixed that  With with uh with the software in the phone or if you have an apple watch you can you can definitely open up your iphone  With a mask no, it is really about people that like  What they know and uh, you know to larry's point  He has a six and that's where the basis for the new se is the six the seven and the eight  Um that have been around for so long and and also the fact that people  That are a little bit more pragmatic and tight and price sensitive don't want to pay for things that they're not actually using  And so getting to that, you know, four hundred dollar price point with 5g  The fastest chipset you're giving a phone that is going to last them four or five years  Which is normally the life of a cycle of a more pragmatic user  And for apple is it's kind of a win because  That means that they can get you know, those users can get to appreciate all the new features  But more importantly the services that apple puts at their disposal and that's what it is  It's about you know future proving your purchase as a consumer and for apple making sure that they bring those consumers with them

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  As they drive more and more services. This is what happened with i'm thinking back to the ipod  Uh that the initial ipods were targeted at a higher end market  But by the time the ipod had reached this full life cycle there was an ipod for every pocketbook  Every need every desire. That's how you double down on a product that is so successful. There's none

Start time: 609.44
End time: 632.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  More successful than the iphone especially when you consider, you know  They're selling razors and razor blades both at a profit the idea that they're still making plenty of money on the se  And to the point if if they people sign up for apple services  They're making money on an ongoing basis. So get an app get an apple in their product and also  Maybe they'll buy a mac. Maybe they'll buy another iphone later on so it gets people into the ecosystem

Start time: 634.17

End time: 652.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Price there two hundred dollar and less and I mean there are people who buy androids at that price all the time  And if the only reason they're buying an android is because they like the price point apple now has a competing product  And so I think that's a better chip in it

Start time: 653.08
End time: 693.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know usually on the android devices at that price point  you do have somewhat of a compromise on the chipset that um, they use because  To be honest, it feels like it feels awkward  philosophically  Uh on the android side  There's a limit that they put that the brands put on what they think those users  Want to do with their phones and apple is not doing that right is giving them the best chip for now  That they have so that they can do what they want to do and you know some of the advantages of having the 815  Bionic is obviously the camera and you know doing more with just one lens

Start time: 694.96
End time: 706.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This uh is a big problem in the android world where you have a lot of phones that cannot be updated  You even can get phones brand new phones  That aren't going to be guaranteed security updates next year. So it's a big issue

Start time: 708.08
End time: 726.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I only recommend pixels. I mean if you're gonna buy an android  I know a lot of people love samsung  But if you're gonna buy an amma an android I really recommend a pixel because you're gonna get the latest software  You're gonna get pure android. It's the closest thing google has to an iphone  And I I just think it runs circles around any competitor out there in the android world samsung

Start time: 726.80
End time: 732.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which is I think the biggest seller of smartphones in the world probably is yeah has said we are gonna guarantee

Start time: 733.18
End time: 738.64

Start time: 739.72
End time: 746.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They have said four years of guaranteed updates  So they are responding to that but how quickly will you get your update?

End time: 752.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Will you get a day one like an iPhone you that will or that's an interesting point because I have the latest samsung s22 ultra

Start time: 753.48
End time: 765.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it still has the january security update. We're in march  You know, uh, so that that's a good point. There's there's a little bit of it because it's  They've so modified the os in the apps that they have to do a lot of testing before they release that right

Start time: 766.50
End time: 786.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They are getting better though because they know that that matters a lot especially  Especially in the enterprise space where they are trying to get more aggressive to compete with apple. So  We should definitely see an improvement on the rollout and they also differentiating less from the software  They're getting closer and closer to google. So

Start time: 786.92
End time: 792.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So let's go where yeah, yeah, they're even using google's messages as the default messenger, which is a huge shift

Start time: 793.10
End time: 889.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For samsung, but you asked me about the display, right?  Because I thought that that was interesting as I was listening to you know, the the rollout of of all the features  I was expecting something around three grand, you know, we know that the latest display that they launched a couple of years ago was  uh five thousand dollars, um, and  Like yeah three thousand, you know with with the brand of that but they came out with a quite aggressive price point  Uh of in my view to be apple and getting what you're getting with it of 1600 and that made me really think about  What apple is changing is  Uh using first of all using silicon as a differentiator  So we've seen the m1 go into an ipad air or honestly not something that I was expecting  We've seen the a13 in the display  To power some of these experiences like center stage  And so using silicon as a differentiator and then using a device like the display at a price point to appeal to a broader audience  Than not just the mac studio potential buyers, right? This is not just  You buy the two because you're the most demanding users. This is for  Somebody that might have a macbook  Um, somebody that might have an ipad that wants  Not just a display you can get cheaper display with similar features  But that end-to-end experience that you will get like center stage  And yeah, you can use it with a pc as well, but some of those experiences are not going to be there

Start time: 891.00
End time: 941.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think one of I was very puzzled by the fact that they put an i-a13 bionic in a display  That is that is the iphone 11's processor that is a faster processor than they put in the apple tv  And yes, I guess it powers you can say hey siri on it. Although it still requires a computer to respond  And yes, they have center stage on the camera so they can zoom and pan as you're on your zoom call  But it doesn't that seems like an awful lot for to put an a13 in  Just for those things. So i'm wondering if there is something down the road that apple wants to do with this display  I mean it honestly could be an apple tv. I don't know if they put enough memory and  Uh storage in there to be an apple tv. Probably not but it could be or it could be a hub for your home kit  There's things you could do with that. You've put a lot of smarts into a  a monitor

Start time: 943.46
End time: 974.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Um, it's becoming more important, right? We're doing this  Hours and hours of the of the day and I do think that  Screens will become way more important in the future as we talk about ambient ambient computing and  And I I agree with you. I think it could become a hub  um, or you know something around tv or maybe around some of the services like  You know what if you can run just on the display something you're like apple fitness plus as an example, right?

Start time: 975.64
End time: 1024.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  the uh other reason they did it of course though is because I and I think that this is  Proven the case as the week has gone by they're going to phase out the big imac  Not just the imac pro, but just the 27 inch imac  And and and for the same price you're going to get a separate mac studio  Studio display which you you know when you put together when you put the mac studio on that special tray under the screen  It's very much like an imac. It makes sense to me. It's an imac deconstructed  This is actually what I was hoping apple would do  It was why I was going to buy a mac mini because I don't I want to have a choice of displays a bigger choice  Than apple can offer  Uh, and I have a lot of 5k imacs and iMac. I have an imac pro  And I feel a little hobbled because I can't it's not very upgradable  It's just it's just what it is and so I think this back in the future leo

Start time: 1024.38
End time: 1029.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that was called the desktop pc. Yeah, it's kind of but in that but it's in a very apple way

Start time: 1029.56
End time: 1177.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They they you know you and by the way, I have to point out  It and I I don't know who did this it's very funny  This is one of the publicity images they sent out a creative person using and this is the the mac studio really is just a very fat  Mac mini but the top half is really where the fans go  So I think what happened is they were trying to design it in the mac mini size and they realized we got to cool this sucker  Especially the ultra in fact, they have a copper subs cooling subsystem in this  For the which makes it two pounds heavier for the ultra it's aluminum in the mac  My net max max studio, but notice look carefully  I don't know if anybody picked up on this  uh at this  plant in the background  It's in an old iMac. Can you see that?  It's in the trash can iMac. She's turned it into a flower pot  Now i'm apple has to have done that on purpose  Right or or did somebody was somebody punking them?  Or maybe it maybe just looks like uh, but i'm pretty sure that's  I think you can even see an apple logo on there if you look really closely  So i'm pretty sure that's a trash can mac in the background there. Uh, you know, that's not news. It's just uh  Interesting. I honestly feel like  There this is my theory  There were two contingents in apple during johnny ives era  There was the johnny ive crew wanted to be simpler more beautiful  The mac their trash can mac a perfect example of that the thinner and thinner  Macbooks with the touch bar and the butterfly keyboard. That's the johnny ive crew and then there was the functional crew who said  No, it doesn't matter. These are power tools. They should be more functional and they won i've left  The trash can couldn't be upgraded apple had to hang its head in shame and say yeah, we blew it  But can't upgrade this because the cooling design doesn't allow for it. They got rid of the touch pad touch bar  They got rid of the butterfly keyboard this new these new macbooks even have htmi ports on them, which johnny ive  Must just be tearing his hair out  And I think this is a little shot. I hate to say it  But I think this is a little shot this mac trash can mac in the background designed by johnny ive  Is a little shot at that crew  I think they won and they're basically another person in the background, too

Transcript:  But it's purely functional  And it's got the ports on the back. I think the monitor has more ports. I think they have four  Type-c ports one thunderbolt four three type-c usb  I would like to see more especially since it has an i13 in it. I feel like that monitor could be doing a lot more  I  This is the new keyboard too, which by the way you pay I don't know what it is 50 bucks more for the black keys  I've never seen an apple black. This is new. That's new. That's uh, they announced that as well. Um  And of course if you're really a style of maven, you're gonna want to pay the 50 bucks extra to get the black keys

Transcript:  a flower pot  Yeah  flower pot probably doesn't make a very good flower pot, but uh,  I mean who knows?  anyway, we  Ordered I ordered the high-end mac studio. It'll arrive on friday  I don't you by the way, you got to order fast these days from apple. I guess probably because of the chip shortage  Um, they say, you know, you you could pre-order it right away before tim cook even left the stage  I was in the store if you order today  you're going to be waiting till april 26th for the high end and april 5th for the  M1 pro i'm sorry m1 max version of the studio  so  a lot of people a lot of uh, i've noticed a lot of uh,  Edits putting that sd card slot under the type c to make a little face  um  I think apple missed a bet there that could have could have been cute could have been smiling funny about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's something about apple people they're just a little yeah a little weird a little different  Um, anyway, I it is if I were intel I would be a little bit nervous intel keeps saying oh no  We can make chips that are that fast  But they use five times the amount of power  Five times the heat and you better not put them in a laptop or you're going to have a puddle of  aluminum slag in your lap  Uh, this is and this is just I feel like just the beginning for the apple silicon  They're really  And they have such a huge advantage because the operating system is designed  With the chip in mind and vice versa. This is essentially a swift machine  Pretty amazing. It's a five nanometer process. That's the other thing intel's had a little trouble doing

Start time: 1354.28
End time: 1380.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does it also give apple some independence, you know in terms of like  I mean, I I don't know where they're making these chips. I assume in china tsmc makes them  So I mean, but in taiwan in taiwan, okay  Well, I mean i'm wondering whether you know of apple is becoming more of a master of its own domain  By not having to depend on other companies for you know as many components including obviously the vital components  Of the cpus as they other companies are having to do

Start time: 1381.60
End time: 1428.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, actually, uh  Because of the geopolitical situation in the world these days  I think a lot of companies are really starting to say  Hmm  Uh  Hmm chip shortage and and so forth apple has already started encouraging tsmc is building a plant in the united states  They've started building plants in india and brazil and other countries  Vietnam, I think so. I think there is definitely this was tim cook's brilliant move early on  Was to concentrate iphone manufacturer in china get the skill set built up there  Uh really was a smart move to to get tsmc to be the foundry  Because the of the skill set tsmc built they were able to build  five nano you know chips long before intel was so that was a brilliant move but

Start time: 1432.28
End time: 1438.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

He does something called photogrammetry  Which is 3d rendering of uh spaces  uh, and you have many many many points photogrammetry is a very  challenging way to do 3d modeling  And uh, and he has found models that are almost impossible to render, uh, even on a high end  intel mac  so  That's one thing, you know 3d modeling  Video 8k video editing. I mean, you know, they always show somebody who I got eight  8k videos running at once. I don't know why you would really need to do that  You know, yeah, you can uh, if you're using logic and you're you know  You've got an orchestra and every or every instrument has its own track. I guess you could probably tap out the ultra. It's it  What alex says is it's about time  If you're a professional working in one of these fields your time is extremely valuable  And so it's worth it to spend money on hardware that does stuff faster that saves you money in the long run  So I think that's really it and and of course, there's people like idiots like me  Who just say but I want the fastest even though there's absolutely  I'll never my my crossword puzzles are not going to challenge  That m1 ultra in any respect i'm gonna have to actually go

I mean the iphone was so successful  That I think a lot of mac users were a little bit nervous that apple would you know, just lose interest in the mac  So this is a way to reassert their you know  Their dominance in the field. I think it's interesting carolina that you talk about the fact that these products are designed to reach  a broad range of consumer price points broad range of consumer needs  That's a smart thing to do for any technology company

Transcript:  Absolutely and and the fact that you're adding device to device to deliver more value that's always been  Apple's game, but now that they have services, you know, I said this at the end of my article  I think now with the services play apple can play more no pun intended with the  the price points of some of these devices, um to really  Really  Hook people into their ecosystem even more than in the past. Yeah

Transcript:  Uh in performance and what is fascinating is they can do that with their own silicon, right?  So they they can play up and down with the silicon to address or  These users and then use that for their services and their application and their ecosystem  It was you know, one of the big advantages of the design of the new chip is that  For all terms of person purposes for the developer it is one chip  So you don't have to figure out you know how your app is going to run and and that's a huge advantage again as  I'm convinced of apple has big  Aspirations for the enterprise market, which is why you know, yeah historically very difficult for apple  Very true is a very different world, right?  We are at the time where from a from a talent perspective giving  Employees what they want is absolutely critical and we just did a study a creative strategies and there's no question  But people do want max in the enterprise space

Transcript:  I think so because with the m1 line they can now make it much easier for  It decision maker to manage deploy especially from an application perspective  Something that they've already been doing for ios  And so, you know the the way I talk about it is not so much of a comparison between  The mac and the pc but really the mac and the iphone and the ipad  So if you put it in those terms it's much easier for an it managers to understand that the  The lift that they have to to make for their apps is going to be less  And and I think that's the other part is like, you know, all of this goodness is coming to something running on arm  Um that you know, we've been waiting and been telling people that is was not going to happen and and it is whoops

Transcript:  Uh a couple of thoughts came to mind as we were talking about this  One maybe that's why you put an a13 bionic into the monitor and now you can run ios apps  On your monitor  Uh, I don't I don't know how you would do that or what that would mean  I don't know if they put memory and storage in there, but that's really weird  Uh, it is they certainly were selling that as part of the benefits of macos  Is that you can run your uh, the vast number of ios apps  Wouldn't you want maybe they meant maybe they wanted maybe that was it maybe they wanted to put a touch screen in there  Maybe they will in the next generation. That's interesting. It's about time  I don't know apple said for a long time they didn't want touch screens, but at the same time  This is a new apple. This is not johnny ives apple anymore  um

Transcript:  Yeah, I don't it's interesting  It's a very clear line right now between the ipad line or the ios line with touch and the desktop without touch  I I wonder if that line is of benefit to apple  So that they have a clear distinction between the two product lines  They are they are muddying things with the ipad air. It's looking more like a pro. So maybe they don't I don't know  It's fascinating to watch. It's a well, it's a as warren buffett has said  It's a well-run company. So it's interesting to watch  As they continue to strategize it looks like almost perfectly  To build their market.

This one was very straightforward  It was just like boom boom boom maybe because of the amount of stuff they had to present  Maybe they didn't want to distract from the very interesting stuff. They were saying  Alex lindsey on macbreak quickly thought it was maybe because they're going to stop doing remote events  They're going to start going back to in-person events and they wanted to  Kind of ease you back in ease people ease people back in not not the most exciting  Production value but really very exciting content. So  Pretty good. All right. I've been of every show we've done in the last three weeks have been about ukraine and about the war in ukraine  There's a huge tech side  To this evan i'm sure you'll have lots of stuff to say about it. This is a  Well, I think the first thing we were talking about this on the radio show  I was very nervous  There's two things that make me nervous about this war with ukraine. One is that it will heat up into world war three  And that is still a risk  Putin's a madman  And we don't know what he's going to do whether he'll use tactical nuclear weapons or chemical warfare  And at what point do do we say, you know, all right?  That's a bridge too far. I don't know  That's a terrifying prospect  But even more proximate I thought was the risk of cyber warfare  And that hasn't happened  You know any thoughts evan? Why we haven't seen this hot cyber war or cold cyber war

Start time: 2465.08
End time: 2519.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I suppose the easiest answer is that we've been prepared for it that security professionals have  been able to to foresee it and  Uh, you know stop attacks that that have occurred, you know  You only hear about the ones that that are successful at least in the mainstream media  We hear about those but it could also be and this is perhaps a bit more cynical that  There is a playbook of tactics and you know as things deteriorate from russia's perspective in the  The ukraine or as it gets more entrenched or however you want to characterize that it's going to it's deteriorating for everyone  Maybe there's there's there's more to to come but I would like to think that there have indeed been  Uh attacks and that we've been well protected because we we've thought it through and we have smart people  Thinking about cyber security on a day-to-day basis down where the the rubber meets the road

Transcript:  What do you think russia in the early days?  Before the war used ukraine as a kind of testing ground a proving ground for their attacks  They brought their power grid down for a few hours a couple of years ago just before the invasion began  they uh  Shut down the financial system, but in both cases  It only lasted a few hours and i'm wondering if maybe ukraine  Got the message and hardened its cyber defenses before the war began. I'd that be my guess  Uh, I thought we were very vulnerable, you know 75 the u.s. Intelligence estimates 75 percent of all  Ransomware attacks come from russia  either because they are  tacitly supported by russia or russia's turning a blind eye to them  But I don't think it's an accident that 75 of all ransomware comes out of russia including by the way the colonial pipeline  Shut down, which was a big infrastructure attack in the u.s  From a russian hacking group called dark side  we don't know if putin was behind that or just turned a blind eye to it, but  You know that  I think in a way  In 2018 we founded cisa  Which was all about infrastructure cyber defense in the united states the cyber security and infrastructure security agency  And maybe uh, they deserve some credit for doing a good job as you said evan and and locking stuff down  or  Maybe that mad dog hasn't been cornered quite enough to to let loose the hounds of  hacker hell

Transcript:  I have a feeling that the what you just said is more like likely that they they have an arsenal  And clearly if you look at what's going on in the ground in ukraine or on the air in ukraine  They have a lot of tools in their tool chest that they haven't brought out yet  So it would not surprise me if russia has plans  Maybe they maybe you know, we've hardened enough that they had to hold off on the plans, but I wouldn't breathe a sigh of relief  Anytime soon around cyber attacks of the u.s

Well, you can turn on the news and see folks in you know, every day  Russians trying to get money from the atm's particularly folks who have us dollars  So sad, yeah

It's the world has changed dramatically  And we we're seeing lots of cell phone videos smuggled out of russia by russians  Who are against the war? I think we'll have boots on the ground sort of in russia for some time to come  There's some good telegram channels telegram. Yes  Maybe a piece of evidence maybe not  Uh russia clearly was developing the ability to shut down the ukrainian power grid  That that they definitely were making efforts along that line  And I think they would if they could at this point they they tried to do it by bombing two nuclear plants, which is  crazy  uh very dangerous  If they had that cyber ability, I think they would have done it  And I think they must not have that ability that somehow ukraine has prepared itself. I hope so, too  a little different attacking the u.s  That might be a provocation that russia does not is not yet ready to engage in  And and I think to your point  Go ahead go ahead carolina. Go ahead

I you don't you know, you can run your country the way you want to I think the russian bear has to be defeated  I don't think it's going to give up  But I think it's a possibility and I think maybe putin should be thinking about his own  Tale right now you wrote a piece larry on connect safely russian cyber attacks are possible  Be prepared but not panic now you wrote that earlier this month.

Transcript:  well, I think you know the points we've been making is that I actually did expect to see something by now in the united states and  Uh, i'm as I said, i'm not  Breathing any size of relief that we're not in the future  But I think what's what will happen is that people will be indirectly affected and I you know  I took the in this article  I kind of took the worst case scenario that maybe  You should have some extra cash on hand because they could shut down the financial system  I don't say they will but theoretically they could they could impact it  It's always a good idea to have extra food and extra water on hand  It's always a good idea to have ways of charging your smartphones and you know the usual things and by the way everything that I said  In this article applies to earthquakes fires  Any disaster man-made or natural so i'm not urging people, you know take any extraordinary precautions  I'm just saying that in a period of uncertainty  It's not a bad idea to have you know, a few hundred bucks if you can if you can if you can put that much together  In a safe in your house not a bad idea  batteries, uh a way to charge your cell phone from your car, you know, etc, etc  Because it could happen

Start time: 2929.40
End time: 2940.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_00

We didn't have facebook. Well, we managed to survive but uh tech has become  It's a very good and one of the things that i'm i'm very pleased about is the cellular network is apparently working in ukraine  I mean, I just saw today people being interviewed from their phones in ukraine. So there is infrastructure  But it's all it's all vulnerable and if it goes down  Those reports that we're getting are going to are going to disappear along with it  So, you know technology is is our lifeline right now both in the united states and still in ukraine

I want to be clear. Our policies are focused on protecting people's right to speech  You know, this is really just taking it this kind of annoys me. It really feels like  Taking a horrid situation and making public relations points out of it  um  We're only going to uh to be the fact is if we applied our standard standard content policies without any adjustments  We would be now removing content from ordinary ukrainians expressing their resistance and fury at the invading military forces  Which would rightly be viewed as unacceptable. We're going to only apply this policy in ukraine itself  We have no quarrel with the russian people. There's no change at all in our policies on hate speech  As far as russian people are concerned  They're really they're in a tough position  We will not tolerate russophobia  There's a new word or any kind of discrimination harassment or violence towards russians on our platform  Okay

Transcript:  It's one of the reasons why zuckerberg keeps talking about I mean he's talking about why he supports legislation  Or regulations and I think part of it is they would like to get off the hook  I mean, I think that facebook has gotten itself into a very tough position of being an arbiter of speech  Where you know and they know it's kind of above their pay grade  It is not something that private companies should do sure they have a right to do it on their platform  But given the the size of their platform and the power of their platform  Should they have that right or should that right belong to somebody who's accountable to the people but then you get to the question  What that means and to what people but it's a very tough situation  And i've talked to people at facebook who really you know  You can say all you want about the negatives of facebook and there are plenty of good things to say about that  But there are people who are really struggling with these issues about which right do we enforce which right do we impinge on?  And and it's hard for a private company to do that. It's it's hard  I mean evan you're a lawyer you understand the complexity that our legal system deals with  And why we have a supreme court because these issues are hard even for learned judges

Well, that's the government  so then what do we need to do then to ensure that there is  Appropriate application of the principles that the government is obligated to deal with namely in the united states the first amendment  Um, how do we do that in a way that is is even-handed fair?  Um, I would submit that there's probably not much more to do other than apply those first amendment principles that have developed over the last  Some some some years so it's all a matter of bringing it in and contextualizing it and making it appropriate to  To where we are now and I think that I think we can be optimistic to think that there are approaches that are going to be  viewpoint neutral  Still protective of certain classes of people for example people who are the targets of violent threats or hate speech or defamation  Those things that don't enjoy first amendment protection  It's all a matter of figuring out how to do it  The first step is figuring out what principles ought to apply but we can get there. I think you wouldn't

Oh god in a  stewpot of trouble  When their chief executive gabriel weinberg tweeted thursday the search engine would rank websites quote  associated with disinformation  lower in search results not not knock them off the internet, but just  lower in search results  Uh, it's later come out. They maybe didn't have that much choice because they rely on microsoft bing  For their search results. I did not know that but uh now I do  And bing said that they were gonna follow the european union's order to restrict access to rt and sputnik  Um, what I was surprised is I thought yeah, of course they're gonna do that. I think i'm sure google's doing it too  but I was surprised at the  firestorm that generated  Um a libertarian youtube user tarle warwick  With half a million followers said if you're using duck duck. Oh, I suggest you stop using it and switch to something else  Uh bright bart the right-wing news organization said a duck duck go is adopting the censorship policies of big tech  and and  Uh in social media channels devoted to conspiracy theories users vowed to switch to yandex  the russian search engine  This is why when you say, you know, we got a governmental solution and so forth  We are so divided as a nation that people would get upset with a search engine for saying yeah, we're not gonna include propaganda  From a warmongering country  And their search results would upset people  in the u.s  Is it it's appropriate is it not I mean aren't maybe not

Oh, he's very clever  Yeah, you know we were watching him the night of the invasion and he was on the air two or three hours before the invasion  Going on and on about oh did putin call you a racist did putin steal your job  You know, why should you hate putin and then the invasion happens and I say to my wife I said  Tomorrow night he's gonna have to backpedal somewhat. He can't possibly keep this going  And sure enough the next night he comes on television and he says yeah, I don't like what putin did but by the way  Um, it's all because they're nato is at putin's doorstep and he basically said  It's justified tactics. We did it. We should we should give him what he wants. Yeah, and and so I mean going on and on

Go to say we want to control curtail the spread of russian propaganda. I don't know. Right? Is that wrong?  Should a search engine be completely agnostic?

Transcript:  You know, I I let other people speak if you would ask me this 15 years ago  I probably would have said it was wrong because I was a free speech purist  And I think over time we have learned that just like you can't yell fire in a crowded theater  Just like you can't send out, you know pictures of sexually explicit pictures of children. There are certain limits to speech and  The old me never would have would have allowed the new me to get away with saying that but  I think history has proven that we have to have at least a private sector  Public sector a different story the first amendment as you know applies to government government cannot make a law

Start time: 3846.14
End time: 3875.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right a bridging speech, but that's not what this private sector can do this  And all search engines make decisions all the time editorial decisions about what content they rank highly and not  It's not like they took it off the internet. They just lowered the ranking. I don't know  Doesn't that doesn't offend me and I was very surprised to hear how upset people were and it made me actually think  Oh, maybe I maybe I do believe that the search results should be completely agnostic  Evan what do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I'm cautious in saying that there ought to be clear  categories here for a search engine to  Deprioritize  Especially when you hold the principles  Like what duck dot go does where it purports to be?  Very neutral in in this  I hear what you're saying leo  Search engines certainly, you know quote-unquote make decisions all the time about what content is there  I'm much more nature of a search engine right and i'm much more satisfied when that's done  algorithmically based on certain things like  You know basic things that happen in the in the algorithm like well, how much is it linked to what's its?  What's what's it?

Transcript:  but  there's there's a certain part of me that that  once there to  Remain with you know a certain sense of agency in the end user to be able to look at this content and evaluate  Its truth valence. For example, i'm a bit  Upset is way too strong of a word, but certainly disappointed to see that youtube took rt  offline I was  benefiting greatly  Learning about the contours of this dispute by watching rt, right?  I didn't believe most of what it was, but it helped me gain a robust more deep understanding  Of the nature of the conflict and now i'm not going to hear what the what the perspective in russia is what the russian people are

Start time: 3982.90
End time: 3996.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Being told yes, and so you think that companies tech companies should trust  It's a it's a little paternalistic to say oh we don't want to show you that information because we don't trust your ability to discriminate  So we're going to do it for you

Start time: 4001.50
End time: 4100.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, I I agree. I think is  is  basically saying that  You know user readers cannot make up their mind as to what is true and what isn't now  We do also know that there are users who are  You know maybe  Less in tuned with how you know the internet works or that might be  And i'm not talking about the warrior, but in general that that might be  That might need to be  You know safeguarded from some information  um, but  you know, you can't always make the  Decision for them because I I agree otherwise you create a bubble, right?  And I think that in the tech sector we are sometimes and and I talk about from my experience, you know  Think about how you use twitter, you know where you follow people that tend to be  people that you agree with people that share your  Likes and dislike that you know might be similarly politically inclined or whatever the case might be you do end up in a bubble  And you don't understand what others?  Are listening or hearing?  um and  How they make up their reasoning and I think that to your point leo earlier about the state this country is in right now  Is that is that we are not?  We're not really listening to each other anymore. And and so having both sides of the equation I think is important

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I certainly wouldn't want  silicon valley to  Be able to say oh look our point of our world view our global view is the only global view  This is what you should and so that's the risk of of letting  a tech company decide  Uh with their own agenda what we should be able to see and not you can still go to rt.com evan and watch  There oh, thank goodness. Yeah, so and I so it really was more you  So if I do that, you know, I can see it if I go to youtube it says  Uh, but but I think that that's the point I guess is maybe youtube was more paternalistic  And didn't trust its audience and maybe there's some case for that  It's funny because i'm sure youtube would fight it if they were brought to let's say congress to testify  About their algorithm and its tendency to make people more extreme. They might say oh we don't have that kind of influence  But they still pull down rt and I I would certainly

Transcript:  be willing to stand up for youtube and it's  um  it's it's um  Perogative is the word i'll use to do this  I don't want to say right because I think that's a bit too fundamental  but and that's enshrined, you know, for example in section 230 where  You know these platforms can make these editorial judgments for content. That is unlawful, you know  Lude lascivious or otherwise objectionable is the the the categories that are there in the statute  So I don't think there's anything unlawful about what youtube did and I don't think any of us are suggesting that as well  This is a much deeper  Uh more even deeper than what policy questions go. This is philosophical. This is  You know, whatever is at that layer. These are the kinds of perspectives. I think we need to think about

Start time: 4206.84
End time: 4268.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's I think it's important to try to get outside your bubble. I mean, I actually divide my television news viewing between fox  MSNBC and cnn because I want to hear the different perspectives. I want to hear what tucker carlson is saying  I want to hear what fox and by the way fox has some amazing journalists like guenifer griffin jennifer  Kim her last name but she has jennifer griffin pentagon  pentagon correspondent is rock solid and she'll argue with the with with carlson and  Hannity but my point is that it's important to get out that bubble and I do want to see rt  I go to rt.com because I want to see that perspective. I go to brightbart.com  And I think it's pretty probably obvious by now that these organizations don't reflect my worldview  But it's important. I think to have a broader sense of what's going on  One of the things that bothers me about modern media including social media  Is how people are being pushed into bubbles. They're being pushed into into these very narrow  tribes and I think that's detrimental to  intellectual curiosity as well as democracy  Absolutely

Start time: 4272.80
End time: 4345.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's it's so hard to know  Where to draw the line?  Uh, it is very tempting to be a little paternalistic and say well, I know the difference  I can go to rt.com and I could tell that's propaganda, but I don't think we should let everybody do that  and I and I and I  wait, it's just it's uh  It's it's a little thorny  My you know my like you larry my initial  Feelings in the early days of the internet certainly was this is only beneficial for everybody to get every point of view  And you could trust them to decide and to use this information  To make their own decision and yes, we may not agree  But that's the nature of the world  And this is a great benefit to everybody to have every point of view  Uh, you know during world war two you couldn't listen to  To  Gebel's, you know broadcasts in germany, but you know, you could hear tokyo rose and you know, you could  You weren't cut off from the german point of view or the japanese point of view during the war  Um, but at this at the same time rt has a big fat pipeline right into the u.s  Uh, and they're very subtle by the way as I look at it doesn't look it's not obvious propaganda. Yes, you're right  Yeah, they're very subtle

Start time: 4346.78
End time: 4411.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's interesting that you talk about different point of views because to the point of subtle versus now, um  We're still not necessarily even for tv stations or you know newspapers  Always getting everybody's point of view in as much as how the story is told because  You just need to see the difference that we're using to talk about  The ukraine and how people are fighting  um russia and deem, you know the invasion  And we speak very differently  About other parts of the world where is the same situation people fighting for their land  To defend themselves and their loved one, but they so happen  Not to be in a country that matters more to the you know peace in the world in europe  They might not have  Nuclear powers that are a concern for everybody else and you know, they have um, the skin is a different color

Yeah, we we hear a lot about syria  I think in comparison to what happens in africa like i'd imagine if you polled a hundred americans to tell you about the  significance of the second congo war  Very few of those hundred would be able to tell you even one fact about that, but it was an incredibly  Bloody conflict and you know, we just don't know about it, right?

I I agree  um  tiktok  Tik tok let's talk a little bit about tik tok  You may remember last year under president trump. There was pressure to sell tik tok to an american company oracle was in the bidding  In fact oracle was expected to win  That did not happen when the biden administration came in  Uh, you know just it kind of drifted off  the horizon  I wasn't so much concerned about america america's data being held in china as I was about the  Incredible propaganda  potentials  for tik tok  Well, there are two stories this week that reflect both sides of that story tik tok has moved ahead in its deal with oracle  for oracle to store tik tok data about american users  So that bite dances china parent can't access it  so in a way that's kind of  That deal never did die. This is because  Cefius the committee on foreign investment in the united states has  Continued with you know without abatement to  Talk about its concerns over data security  So oracle will be holding americans information in the united states  in an oracle database  and uh  Maybe that makes you feel better because china doesn't have access to your data  They still have access to whatever you do on your phone  Which maybe is even more concerned my biggest concern frankly is that tik tok could be very easily algorithmically tuned  In the same subtle way that rt is to become a propaganda platform for china the white house  This actually was a saturday night live skit last night the white house, but it's a true story  Brought tix talk stars in to talk about the war in ukraine  briefed them jennifer asaki the uh  Um the press secretary briefed influencers  About the united states strategic goals in the region no my son was not included  In that although he had more followers than a lot of these tik tok  Influencers i'm just saying  Uh, I you were somebody recorded the call and you could listen in on it and it was a fairly  You know wasn't exactly a deep inside briefing  But I think it was very much an attempt by the biden administration to get these tik tokers to  uh  Espouse the american point of view  on their channel  Khalil green 21 a creator with more than 534,000 followers on tik tok said he wasn't surprised  When an invitation arrived in his email inbox, this is from the washington post people in my generation get all our information from tik tok  He said it's the first place we're searching up new topics and learning about things  Um, I guess you got to go where the kids are  I wonder if jen jen socky said hello fellow kids  Some of the creators, uh said  It wasn't a lot of information in there. Jules turpeck a gen z content creator who does essays about digital culture  And then james jager  Said the white house decision to engage creators such as she was essential in helping to stop the spread of misinformation  Those who have an audience can ideally set the tone for how others decide to assess and amplify what they see online  I'll do the propaganda thing if you want me to  Um, I don't know.

He was convicted in october on campaign finance charges  His son says i'm not my father. I love him, but i'm not my father  Uh, he apparently is posting a lot of information  About non-stop news updates about ukraine. He is after all, uh  ukrainian, uh by ancestry on the night of russia's invasion  He hosted tik tok live streams  Discussing the events to over 800 000 viewers. That's a much bigger audience than cnn or msnbc. Yeah  Every day he's posted videos breaking down news about the war every 45 minutes  Interesting a ukrainian-born journalist who operates the tik tok channel good morning bad news  News  Uh said he thought the overall tone of the briefing was too soft and officials dodged hard questions  The energy of the call felt like a press briefing for kindergartners  I'm not surprised.

Transcript:  Too little too late, you know james allen, you know who wrote um  you know as a man thinketh back in the early part of the  20th century. I mean there was a passage there that says if you know a person who wants to you know, do well, you know shouldn't  Wrestle with opportunity but must purify the heart, you know  You need to come into these situations challenging situations having been fundamentally prepared rather than just figuring out at the last minute what to do  and so  if we're  sort of coaching tik tok publishers or whatever you would call these these content developers on tik tok what our position is  You know, is that really going to be effective?  I would suggest that that's not nearly as effective as the results one would see  from a  Greater focus a greater love  among our citizenry  on our  collective civic values now only heaven knows really how we would agree on on what those are especially in this day and age  but you know things like a greater sense of  Patriotism not nationalism but but patriotism a a more robust sense of our history a a  well fortified sense of what our  Position in this global conflict is based on you know where we come from as a nation  Historically in all these things and I recognize it's a it's a different challenge  And I don't want to anybody to be hearing what i'm not saying where one has to espouse sort of a radical  America first  Agenda, but the point i'm trying to make is you know ought there not  Uh be more done  Beforehand before it gets to this point of having to just educate the the tik tok crowd in the irc  There's been some discussion about you know, the importance of of educating our  youngsters to recognize  Logical fallacies and you know to be able to think well  So it's it's things like that that you know certainly this this this briefing is is a good thing in principle as long as it's  Well, it's a good thing in principle.

Transcript:  I was just going to say nobody's actually asking the question of why this is happening, right?  So we're going to try and and manage  creators on social media  But we are not wondering why  People are turning to other channels to gather news. Yeah  And there we are not doing anything  to actually make those news channels because  I mean, obviously i'm european. I am i'm and and not just european, but i'm italian. Um, you know television in italy is  Not one of the best things  Um, then I I spent 18 years in the uk and you know love it or hate it there is the bbc  Uh everything, you know, I don't think that any channel in the world  Is not influenced by politics in one way or another some is more obvious some are less  But the way that the news are done in europe is really more about the news, but not the commentary  And that's what i'm struggling in this country  There that seems like a lot and and I you know, there are channels that are not quite to the extreme  But there's a lot of opinion that come with the news more and more that's what gets ratings

Start time: 5091.34

Transcript:  About writing a blog post  Exactly. No, you're right. You're ill trained for this stuff  Uh, I have to say I would say most of the young people I know get their news and information not from tiktok  Which is really short form but from youtube, but there's a lot of very  Good your kid's the same a lot of really strong content  On youtube and if you follow if you know the right person to follow not pewdiepie  Um, maybe even not mr. Beast, but but if you there are some really  quality history and news  Uh science channels on youtube and I think what I observe is people find the one that they really and they're devoted  They very much pay attention to that watch it much more than they would watch television for sure

Transcript:  And there's a handful of of you know  Publishers on youtube that that I really enjoy because of their depth of content and and what what really draws me to them  Is that I feel like i'm being told the truth  I mean and and maybe i'm belaboring the obvious in a way that's not really helpful here  but but I suspect that that's something that  uh is attractive to  To to younger folks who are you know going to tiktok to find their information.

Transcript:  Sensationalizing and yet there isn't and larry and I both come from that, you know the older generation that that tradition of  Journalistic integrity there's not that understanding of the rules of the road and all that stuff or even just the who what where when why  I think that's on on one hand. It's just as you say evan that is the benefit the beauty of it. It's not that  Polished stuff, but I also think you don't necessarily know  As you watch somebody on youtube  If they have an axe to grind if they have an interest in this and disclosure is is non-existent  I don't know. Yeah, i'm very torn. I don't want to be the old guy who says oh you got to do it  Clearly the the forms of journalism are are pretty much dead  Um, and youtube is the perfect example of this and it was also clear that anybody under 25 is getting most of their journalism from youtube  I would think  Yeah, yeah  Um, which is not a bad thing necessarily  It means it can anybody who has something compelling to say and knows how to present it  has a voice  But it's also very easy to get get  As you've seen sold down the river on that stuff, too

Transcript:  back again again not to be to be to a dead and very old horse, but I mean  I grew up at a time when we had 12 tv channels dial literally had 12 options on it  I think went from channel two to channel 13, right and most of them were empty  Yes, most of them were but it was but why was it in la so I had to get a lot of stuff  Okay, it was really easy. So like when you're when you're talking about this i'm thinking to myself  I'd like to know who these great youtube broadcasters are to find them. That's right. I'm missing out on some of them, I guess

Start time: 5410.94

Transcript:  But you also they don't have any hierarchy. So the other thing that happened is newspapers television. There was a hierarchy of editorial  People I mean not always by the way a good thing because at the top of the hierarchy was the guy who owned the old transmitter  An old white guy, but there there was some there were some checks and balances  But at the same time 12 channels is not enough to express the broad variety of

How can how can people  Find you know, because there's so much crap if you just go randomly looking on youtube  You're going to go down all sorts of rabbit holes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I don't know that they have a metric as such but obviously finding somebody that they can relate to  um either because of interest or because of who they are is absolutely critical and I think that you know  We're going back to that diversity topic that you know, we discussed earlier about  The ability of seeing somebody that looks like you that you might think  has gone through  What you're going through or might see  The you know what is happening in a similar way that you do because of the experience not because you you think alike  But because you had similar experiences, so I know that that matters a lot to them  I also  Know that both dad and I keep on telling them to check their sources. Yeah, you know, we're not  My husband would like me to police more than I do. I think i'm you know, even if i'm in tech I I would  Kind of be defeated at doing that because they are  Way ahead of me  And that is sad for somebody who covers tech to admit that they're gonna just say yeah mom, right?

Transcript:  It's just you know  Like larry was saying earlier and and what he's doing with his work is giving them the tool  to be as smart as they can right in terms of  being able to  Check their sources to go and and fact check these people and what they're saying and not just taking it in  Uh, and that's true with everything. I mean that is true as well when you read  Textbook that you know that are used in school to know who wrote that book. What story are you being told?  um because we know that  it's not all the the different opinions and different aspects of of somebody and you know,  a character or or  A fact in history that you're telling because is whoever  Um, you know is the point of view of whoever wrote that book and then the teacher who tells you

Transcript:  It's even true with tech reviews  I mean there was a time when there was leo john devorek walt mosberg myself and about a dozen other people  Who are writing about technology?  And you know you could love us or hate us agree or disagree  But you kind of knew who we were and who we worked for and who was paying us  Now there are thousands and thousands of tech bloggers out there that are recommending products day in and day out  And I have no idea who these people are and who's paying them and what they're what they're why they're writing about what they're writing  And and so, you know, even something is silly is what smartwatch to buy. It's hard to figure out a credible source  I mean there are credible sources, but it's hard to know if what you happen to be watching is credible

Transcript:  Well, it's interesting because in the creator world, I think especially youtube  um  the the people that do great work go to  all of you know kind of extend to  Really explain, you know the posts that are  Sponsored the posts that are not and you know, I I did an interview  At the end of last year with ijustine and her sister  uh, and um, I you know, I looked at  I've been following ijustine  Justine for a long time  and  I like everything about them and I wrote this story in the spirit of women history month  uh, and because it's a story of sisters working together and lifting each other up and also a story of a younger generation compared to  mine where  They didn't think about themselves as women in tech or women as a creator in the youtube world  And they do great work and we were talking about exactly what you're talking about larry about  Who pays you you know, how can you be as transparent as possible?  With the content that you put out there so people know  And it was fascinating because she was saying that now when she's actually asked to showcase a product  She will never call that a review because it's not right because they are paid to showcase a product  Versus she's taking a product and she's reviewing  All that said I always remember writing. Uh, I was still at garner and I wrote a review of an iphone  and a customer  Asked who paid for that iphone and I said man like, you know  If I was so cheap that you know, whatever eight hundred dollars or whatever would buy me a favorite  review  Why would it be?  What am I doing at garner?  You know that and and there are people like that that just um  because of a business model might question your  ethics, um, and and  I also think that that's not necessarily  The the right way to go compared to okay because you you know write for ap you don't  Have a point of view or you're not, you know, we're especially in tech. We all human we we are  You know we we like some brands better than others and and all of that and I think as long as you're transparent  Um more power to you. Yeah, we threw out though

Transcript:  The notion that any of these people in the good old days were independent or  You know had journalistic ethics. I think we've learned  Everybody has a point of view  Uh, and now it's just a free for all. I mean you see youtubers who have investments in the not merely  Given money, but have investments in the companies they're covering  It's and the ftc has rules by the way disclosure  Even to take products you're supposed to disclose. Yeah, I don't know how I think they're probably that's what we deserve more in the  Breach breach than it is in the reality, but there are supposedly rules now cnn says we're going to start streaming  CNN plus starts streaming  in a couple of weeks  Six dollars a month, although if you sign up early you can get it for less  That's interesting isn't it?

Start time: 5926.26
End time: 6010.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, here's how I'd answer that question and sort of ask if you think that i'm thinking about this appropriately. I can't help but  Uh go back maybe I think it was maybe 2004 2005 2006 chris anderson's book the long tail  I think that was more of an economic thesis where you know, you've got you've got the main  providers the big networks  The fact that always comes to my mind is like, you know back in the 50s on any given night  Whichever night I love Lucy was on like a disproportionate amount or a huge proportion of the amount of yeah  Watching now we're all sliced up and watching stuff. And so does it is it valid to think of  You know chris anderson's model as as as rather prescient on how it's come a lot of this has come to pass  And there are perhaps issues that weren't after this show  I'm going to go pull that off of the shelf and thumb through it and and revisit it  Um, you know, it it's interesting to see  And sort of what made me think of this is a big player like cnn an incumbent  I don't know if that's the right clinical term or whatever for all of this, but you know one of those big  You know at the head of the long tail  now trying to get into sort of the the the space where  The the the streamers and everybody else is is occupying the the longer portion of the tail. I would just i'm just sort of  Setting that out there as a paradigm wondering how valid that is how helpful it is for us to categorize

Start time: 6010.26
End time: 6042.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think chris's book comes from every, you know that utopian vision of the internet we all had  Uh some years ago and it's certainly accurate that the long tail  Brings you a much broader variety of content. That's what youtube is  I've lived in the long tail for the last 15 years and probably for my whole career actually  And uh, that's where you get a much broader variety of content  But I don't have the same techno utopian point of view that it's  That it's all going to be flowers and daisies from now on because everybody gets a voice  That hasn't really turned out to be accurate either

Start time: 6043.66
End time: 6046.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It goes back to the issues we were talking about earlier exactly who gets the voice

Start time: 6046.48
End time: 6079.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, who has the right to silence everybody should have a voice and that's the beauty of the long tail  Everybody can have a voice but uh, I don't know. I don't I don't know if it's worked out. So  uh, I think  There's look it's this is the way it is. So whether we like it or not  The future of media is much more like youtube than is like cnn  And uh, and we're gonna have to live with that and I don't think any attempt to say oh you people are too stupid to watch all these videos  We really have to watch what we tell you to watch. I don't think that's gonna work  You know, it's not going to work

Transcript:  But on the other hand the new york times the washington post are doing pretty well right now  And one of the reasons is I think that millions of people trust the editors who make the decisions as to what they cover  And I think there is still I don't think they'll go away smart editors. Yeah

Start time: 6095.02
End time: 6146.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think they'll go away. I think there's a place for them  It's not going to eliminate the new york times, but it hasn't eliminated a lot of local newspapers local papers in trouble  Yeah, the new york times success. It is thought by many  Comes with the fact that they have such a variety of things  That it's it's a multiple subscription. You might like the cooking you might like the crosswords. It's not just about news  And that's how the new york times has managed to make it in a very difficult world for journalism  I don't know. I agree with you. I mean, that's why I buy the new york times and the washington post and a bunch of other news  Uh sources that I trust I pay the subscription for them including something like the information and upstart like the information  Because I know that that's going to be a good source of information  But I but again, I think if you're under 25 you're not paying  You know 100 bucks a year to get the new york times  Right and and that's the other problem right is

Start time: 6147.78

Transcript:  What can you afford versus what is available to you? Um, and it's not a question just  Should you have to pay for  Better information reliable information and I i'm not you know questioning and saying that you know  All newspapers should be free  But you know, I think is an interesting question and you see models like the guardian in the uk, right that really  Struggled to stay independent and and they had to ask for you know funding from  from the  The readers and to to stay afloat  It's a really important question

We couldn't there wouldn't be a better time for better  help  Better help is online therapy that helps you take care of your most important relationship the one you have with  Yourself better help  You deserve to be happy  You know  Maybe you're one of those people will drop anything to go help somebody you care about  We go out of our way to treat other people. Well  You know you try to be a nice person but are you doing the same for you  That's okay  It's okay to do that. Don't feel bad about that whether it's hitting the gym or just you know making time for a massage  Or even trying psychotherapy  You're your greatest asset invest the time and effort into yourself just like you do for other people  Therapy is there's no it should not be a stigma. It is just  Looking to the resources that are out there to help you live a better life whether it's a better relationship  With your loved ones whether it's a better relationship with the world  better focus  Help you with anxiety  Better help can really help it's online therapy that offers video  Phone or even live chat sessions with your therapist. I think the reason they offer those variety of modalities is because sometimes  You don't want to see somebody you want to or don't even want to talk to somebody you want to type to somebody  Whatever you communicate your way and that's the beauty of this  Plus it's much more affordable than in-person therapy and because it's global you don't have to use the therapist down the street  You know, there's a lot of reasons why you might want the privacy of using a therapist in another city or even another state  Plus there are all kinds of modalities out there all kinds of therapy  And at better help you can find a therapist that works the way you want to work  You can be matched with the therapist under 48 hours. I want to be clear. This is not crisis help  There are you know call a crisis line if you're having a current crisis  But if you're looking at long-term  Psychotherapy just to help you have a better life. This is a great way to do it no matter  Where you are no matter where you are in your life  It is amazing give it a try see why over two million people have used better help online therapy as we've been doing these ads  I've heard more and more stories for family members listeners  Who say you know what? This was great. I'm so glad I did this  You can message any time with your therapist, which is really nice  Uh, it makes it very easy to schedule and you're not limited to the therapists in your neck of the woods  Yes, they have group sessions even I think group sometimes is really valuable to see  See other people experiencing the same issues you are  Betterhelp.com slash twit find out more  You'll get 10 off your first month  better help b e t t e r  h e l p better help  dot com  slash twit affordable  private therapy  Anytime anywhere phone video live chat  I think this is really now's the time we need it better help  dot com slash  twit  Uh couldn't recommend it more highly. It's very very important  All right, let's uh, let's move on  Maybe if I could find something a little more, uh fun  No, no  Although I have to say i'm very interested with amazon's doing clubhouse was all the all the rage  Remember a couple of months ago, maybe a year ago  Uh, and that's kind of faded amazon has decided to do a clubhouse competitor, but I think they're going to do it better  They call it amp  It is now opening up. It's you still have to get an invite  But the idea is you can play music they have act they have deals with all the record labels  You have tens of millions of licensed  songs  Uh, so you could be a dj if you want you could take phone calls  If you want and it all works through an app ios right now only in the us  But they plan to expand it to android and the rest of the world  Uh, you can download amp from the app store sign up to get on the wait list  I think this is very interesting, you know  i'm sort of  focused on this because I this is the space I work in  and I look at spotify's trying to own this space and and apple and  And facebook and now here's amazon. They have a very interesting play on this

So it is really kind of  Like radio you can't  Focus on taking song requests. You can't play any songs from outside the library unless you have the right to do so  Uh, it's audio. Um, I I feel like this is uh, this is going to be a very strong contender and a lot more interesting frankly  than clubhouse

They're already working on hiv  Uh, in fact, I think they're already in trials on an hiv vaccine  They also want to develop  Vaccines against  I hope i'm not pronouncing this wrong chicken guña  I'm not familiar with that dengue. I know ebola  Malaria a vaccine a malaria vaccine would be huge  Mideast respiratory syndrome and this is really a technology story because mrna vaccines  Were developed. I mean they've been working on them for more than a decade scientists have but the vaccine for covid  Was developed  after sequencing the covid gene in a weekend and then developing a vaccine  computationally from it  Testing is what took a long time  almost a year  so  The technology though is is is now, you know much better understood  Scientists at the university of pennsylvania were able to create mrna that could get past the cell's defenses without triggering an immune response  But still recognized by the ribosome in the case of covid vaccines the modified rna was programmed to get the ribosome to make  The spike protein and then your immune system  Was awakened and trained and responded  So it's a very it's a it's kind of a trojan horse delivery vehicle to get past  The cell's defenses and then say hey, you ought to know here it comes  And you better be prepared  It's also has another benefit unlike many vaccines. It's easy to scale in production at a relatively low cost  Doesn't require chicken eggs things like that

So all of that is on the horizon  I think it's very very interesting  And uh, you know what?  Darwin will win in the long run  Exactly  If you're against it, that's fine. Don't get the vaccine

No, no  because we you know, I'm curious because I mean we covered the story as it was happening and  And but so it's kind of interesting to see I think it's well done  That and dropout show that there's a lot of interest in how silicon valley works  And uh, and the cutthroat kind of culture of silicon valley is very much highlighted in these  Uh twitter is looking for younger users so they've hired a uh, a a ute  The world's the tech world's teen savant jess joss robinson. He's an 18 year old freshman at the university of connecticut  uh and uh  I'm, sorry, that's not who they hired. That's this that's the lead in the article. They hired michael saman  He's a prodigy in silicon valley when it comes to building products for young people  He dropped out of high school at age 17 recruited by mark suckerberg to work for facebook at facebook  He helped the platform build out and launch products  Like the snapchat killer instagram stories  Uh, he left facebook of 2017  He worked there on youtube shorts  which basically was  Youtube's attempted tick tock killer. I don't think it succeeded yet. Then he went to roblox in 2020  To help the gaming platform incorporate more social functionality sounds like he is the wunderkind  He will be working on  At twitter something called zero one a new group focused on building experimental features within the company  Can you get young people to use twitter?  Probably not only if you can have the reverse chronological timeline. Oh, yeah. Thank you for turning that off  It's still in there, but twitter has made it harder to uh, I mean look that's how I want to see twitter, right?  Yep, uh, I don't in fact I hate it. I i'll open twitter and I get something for three days ago  Yeah, that's not what I want to see  Um, so the design change which lets you swipe between your home  Which is the algorithmic non-chronological timeline?  And the latest which is the chronological timeline?  Uh was announced thursday to set it up you tap i'll have to try this tap the sparkle icon  In the  I guess it's better than the hamburger menu you tap the sparkle icon in the top right corner  The option to pin your latest timeline if you select that you'll see both home and latest tabs at the top of the ios app  If you used pin lists on the ios app that layout should look familiar  The feature is available right now in ios coming soon to android and the web  So that sounds like it's easier  Or no, it's harder  Because okay, so this is why it's harder according to j peter's writing for the verge  To my great disappointment. I found that after testing the feature. I can't make the chronological feed the default anymore  Yeah, instead I can only have home as my default or  Swap back and forth between the two  ah  Yeah, of course twitter like youtube  And facebook they want you to they want to algorithmically control what tweets you're seeing because they think it makes it better  You don't agree to evan
