Transcript:  Grizzly Productions.tv. You know, we had all of our shows for four years scattered across all these  disparate lands. And we finally, after months and months of working on it, we built it on the backs  of Squarespace, by the way, and fantastic. So, that's nice to know. We have all of our shows now living under one  roof and it's still in beta. So, hey, all of the listeners of TWIT, go there and rip us apart. Tell us what we need to  fix. We're still, we're still working on it and tweaking things. I didn't realize you had so many shows. This is great.  A lot of parenting shows and we just launched our new sports show. So if you're twice a week, if you're into  sports, this guy's like Rain Man. He's like a walking encyclopedia. Paul Roberts. Yeah, Paul Roberts. He's great.

Is that you, Daddy on board? Yeah, that's me and my pal Mike.  That's where most of the complaining comes in. So if you're a new dad and you want to join the revolution, we get people all  the time who say, just found your show. I'm about to be a dad in three weeks and I need a week. Trust me, we tell it like it is.  We tell you what furniture not to build if the wife orders it. Oh, the IKEA. Oh, right. Or some assembly required.  That's a bunch of bunk. We tell you what not to build. If it comes with one of those little L-shaped hexagonal wrenches,

Transcript:  David Prager from Revision 3. Sitting next to him, Loic Lemur from Seismic and LeWeb, which is coming up in December.  We're excited to be part of that. That's a lot of fun. Yes, tweet at LeWeb. Tweet at LeWeb. What do you call it? That's good.  I like it. I thought Tweet in Paris. Okay. A Tweet in Paris. Yes, so you're going to have your own studio. That'll be good.  I'm so excited. Yeah, that's going to be great. And Alexia Tsotsis is also here from... Hey, guys. Are you still at TechCrunch?  I'm still at TechCrunch. Okay, just checking because you never know.  Wow. We're not going to spend a lot of time talking about TechCrunch. It's really boring.  Because I'm sure it's boring to everybody except those of us in the tech industry, tech journalism industry, who are fascinated, can't get enough of this.  But just from your point of view, how's things going? Are you comfortable? Is everything all right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I was on vacation for... Smart. Yeah, I know. I might go on another one. Smart. I was on vacation for the beginning of this.  And so I came back really calm and I spent time with my 90-year-old grandmother. Oh, that's neat. In Greece. In Greece.  So I have a different perspective because my mom asked me last week, she's like, what's a blog? Yeah. And I'm like, oh, it's like a newspaper, but it's online.  She's like, can anyone publish anything they want to a blog? She doesn't really know what you do, does she? No, she doesn't know what.  I was like, well, you know, technically they can, but it's not that simple. So I have a different perspective.  I really love tech news and I think that anything that makes tech news more entertaining and reaches a wider audience is a good thing.  TechCrunch is going through its stuff right now and we've definitely made it interesting for people to read about. No kidding.

Start time: 325.90
End time: 337.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah. Were there a lot of memos flying? I mean, did you come back and there's like 800 memos and you're conflicting memos?  Paul Carr saying, don't listen to Eric. Eric saying, don't listen to Paul. I mean, basically what you guys saw is what we saw.

Start time: 338.16
End time: 390.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It all took place on the blog. Yeah. There was no secrets. Yeah, there's no secrets. And we didn't see very much internally.  We saw, or I didn't, maybe other people did, but a lot of it. Well, TechCrunch is distributed too. Eric's in New York, you're out here.  Everybody's all over the place, right? And we're pretty much independent. Right. It's a group of independent journalists trying to break news.  Journalist, you said? Oh, that's interesting. I'm sorry. I think she said journalist. That was lazy of me. A group of independent writers.  Bloggers. I think the word journalist is just so rot with BS that like I don't like using it. So we're a group of independent writers who cover technology,  who have WordPress credentials and can publish onto the blog. And we coordinate so we don't overlap on stories. But for the most part, we're on our own, which is the great thing about TechCrunch.

Start time: 390.94
End time: 399.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And it has a great voice. And I think that you were very, Loic, you were defending Mike. Mike was an early investor in Seismic, we should point out.

Start time: 399.88
End time: 424.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, you know, of course, as many people, there has been so many posts around TechCrunch and Mike, more about Mike probably than TechCrunch actually, that I, and there were like, I think it was just too much.  So I had to put this blog post where I explained Mike was an early investor in Seismic and actually I wasn't complaining about that. But what you get as an investor with Mike as an investor is generally a lot of trashing online.

Start time: 424.94
End time: 427.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  He wasn't overly kind to Seismic.

Start time: 427.36
End time: 476.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, most of the posts were actually pretty negative. And that's fine. I didn't complain. I was expecting those basically. But I was just saying that, trying to say, which was difficult in that post, that I don't think he's BS.  I think you have to like him or hate him or there is no in between like he is. And I think he's just one of the centers of technology. Whatever he does, he will continue.  And you don't have to think about him as a journalist. And people are saying he's BS. It doesn't matter. That's not the point. The point is, do you like reading him and the controversy in the conversation or not?  But it matters. And I always took him as when I talked to him, I was saying, are you a friend, the investor or the blogger today?  And you never know.  And you never know. He actually said it's always blogger first.

Start time: 477.07
End time: 536.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What happens to TechCrunch now?  I think the background of the story is pretty important because if you look at who calls himself a blogger and who calls themselves a journalist, and then like some of the environment that's been created by writers on TechCrunch being personalities and people being interested in following a personality.  Obviously, I think Arrington, the strongest personality at TechCrunch and part of his value is people being interested in what he thinks and what he wants to say.  And one of the things I've always said about Arrington that I think is good is I've never seen him to lie about anything. I've always seen him to be truthful. But then the big controversy and the question was some of the traditional rules on what journalism is and what it means on being able to have a platform to promote the things that you want.  And one of the things that Michael says is I'm going to talk about what I want and no one's going to stop me from talking about what I want.  And I think there's a lot of people that do respect that.  And there's arguments to be made around that, especially when you start looking at investment funds and where people are putting money and what you can say about a company, not say about it, or decide to say something positive or negative or not at all.

Start time: 537.40
End time: 555.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Huge respect about being able to say what you really think.  And Mike does this. Paul Cardiff did this on TechCrunch. He gave his resignation.  And I think it's great. We live in a world where everybody is so fakingly nice.  He's not fakingly nice.  No, that's what I mean. At least you have the truth.

Start time: 556.76
End time: 562.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I grant you that. Clayton, you asked a question. Go ahead. I'm sorry. We're going to have a hard time there in the maple sugar house.

Start time: 567.04
End time: 596.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have the French guy.  How's it going?  What happens to TechCrunch now? I mean, this was all playing out. It was interesting to read, obviously, all the back and forth online about this.  But Leo, I think to your point, even before the show started, is this inside the beltway talk?  And really, do most people pay attention to this outside of the tech world? What's going on, the sort of back and forth?  And if you read this and you read the back and forth, then the way it was funny to look at how it was all laid out on TechMeme the other day, right?  At the top you had...  Oh yeah, it was hysterical.

Start time: 604.03
End time: 606.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But this doesn't happen in public, exactly. I think you're right.

Start time: 606.94
End time: 611.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. I mean, this is the same thing. He said this, he said that. But my question is, what happens to TechCrunch now?

Start time: 613.02
End time: 626.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think we're going to focus on scoops and not digs for the next couple of weeks, at least. We've got F.A. coming up.  The big Facebook conference. We'll ask you about that in a second.  And I'm sure there'll be a couple of announcements there that aren't internal staff fighting.

Start time: 627.02

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are there going to be people leaving?

Start time: 629.00
End time: 634.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But to MG's point, though, I thought it was interesting his...  How am I supposed to know?  Alexia, you're not leaving, right?

Start time: 635.08
End time: 640.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're going to stay?  Not, you know, I am not leaving. Not right now.  I'd like to do better work at TechCrunch is what I'd like to do.

Start time: 641.48
End time: 665.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  TechCrunch is a great opportunity, especially right now, because it does have a lot of attention.  I think AOL is going to be very anxious to justify its purchase of TechCrunch, right?  And it's been only a year.  And they also want to prove that TechCrunch can succeed with Mike Harrington.  And they still have great...  Paul Carr, and they've got great writers still like you.  MG.  I think Sarah... when Sarah come back soon?

Start time: 666.01
End time: 672.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In four months.  She's going to come back for Disrupt Beijing.  For a little bit.  I know, with her baby, with Eli.

Start time: 673.08
End time: 679.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But she tweeted that if the winner of TechCrunch Disrupt was that Israeli company, she would quit.  I think he was joking.

Start time: 679.59
End time: 696.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, really? OK.  I mean, from what I see, people take stuff too serious.  It wasn't entertaining.  I think Paul Carr made fun of a writer, Jack McKenna, which is Harrington's pen name, in a blog.  He made fun of a writer, and then there was an Italian publication that...  Picked it up.  As not a joke.

Start time: 698.18
End time: 705.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  With departures at TechCrunch, are they hiring writers?  Yeah, we're hiring writers.  And those hires are made by the editor?  Ariana, probably, right?

Start time: 706.20
End time: 711.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, the editor is Eric Schoenfeld.  But who makes the hires?  I think Eric Schoenfeld.

Start time: 712.28
End time: 714.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What does Ariana know about TechCrunch?

Start time: 714.56
End time: 717.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're right.  You're talking about your boss here.

Start time: 718.28
End time: 719.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I honestly don't think she cares that much.

Start time: 720.88
End time: 728.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  If she's smart, as Barry Diller said, she'll just let TechCrunch be TechCrunch.  Barry was really scathing.

Start time: 728.24
End time: 740.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It seemed like that's what ALL was doing.  At least for a couple of months, it seemed like it was the same old TechCrunch.  And then, not only until two weeks ago did we learn that that was not the case.  And I'm sure it had to do with the raising of the funds, which ALL put money into.

Start time: 740.44
End time: 768.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Does it change, though?  If you go to TechMeme, the top two stories today are two TechCrunch stories by M.G. and Matt Burns.  You break stories, and that's good.  The only reason I think it's an important issue is I feel for readers and viewers,  I'll include our viewers as well,  who have to decipher who is in whose pocket, who's objective.  And I guess you've always had to decipher that.  And I think it's important to lose your judgment and watch what people say  and judge from that whether you can trust what they say, right?

Start time: 768.56
End time: 775.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does the product, though, get watered down?  I mean, that was M.G.'s point, right?  That there's a possibility that it could become like CNET.

Start time: 776.40
End time: 780.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Welcome to mainstream media.  The product always gets watered down.

Start time: 780.58
End time: 791.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, but that's the edginess.  That's what people turn to TechCrunch for.  That's why I read it.  And you worry that that product that gets diluted in M.G.'s point  about CNET then being watered down, not the edgy property that it once was.

Start time: 792.48
End time: 807.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Every startup starts with a founder and a great vision,  and then it gets...  Every startup starts with a founder, a great vision,  and then it's a process of watering down from then on.  Isn't it?  It's very rare that the startup can maintain  that unique flavor that it had on day one.  Yeah, well, there's Apple, there's...

Start time: 808.78
End time: 809.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's right.

Start time: 810.48
End time: 830.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And that's exactly, that's the exception that proves the rule, isn't it?  Yeah, there are very few.  In fact, I look at Facebook.  I want to talk about Facebook.  Because I think Facebook has started to become watered down,  I want to talk about Windows 8,  because that's really the big story of the week,  and I didn't want to get sidetracked by the TechCrunch,  but we kind of...  Because Alexia's here, and because you're such a defender of my existence,

Start time: 831.91
End time: 835.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

He was at Build and brought back  this Samsung tablet that they gave all the developers.  And we can't wait to play with it.  So we'll talk about it.

Start time: 1101.36

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it's all Facebook comments or at least  the fact that they try to make it so that you have to have a name.  I don't know if I like the fact  that it has to be Facebook but I like  the fact that you can't just be anonymous.  So I'm going to go look at the difference between the comments  on something like YouTube.

Start time: 1133.44

Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Start time: 1135.50
End time: 1155.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Also  part of the thing about the personalities  writing these articles is that you get active discussions  in the comments.  Which I think is fun.  Do you Google Plus?  I did a lot.  I don't very much anymore. However, I don't think  the reason that I don't use it... I think most of it is because I'm so busy  and I haven't been able to decide  to adopt it.

Start time: 1157.56
End time: 1168.97

Transcript:  There's an old company, a mainline computing company.  They're called Microsoft  and they had a big conference this week  called Build.  It was the first Build conference.  They're combining their developers conference, PDC  with their hardware conference, WinEQ  with their web conference mix into one  massive thing in Anaheim.  And of course, they did something that  Google's been doing all along at their  developers conferences. They handed out  hardware running  the new operating system.  Stephen Sienofsky, who's running the Windows 8  development team,  became quite famous at Office  for being a straight shooter,  not saying anything until it was so  really being reliable. He's been blogging a lot  about Windows 8.  And one of the things, correct me if I'm wrong,  but one of the things that's my understanding that Stephen said  is, yes, understand that we are giving  you a developers preview. They did make it  available to everyone. You can go to  buildwindows.com and download it.  Anybody can and millions have.  He said that, but he also said, this is  the final version in terms of OS.  Don't expect us to take a lot  of feedback and change this a lot.  And so, normally,  when I see a developers preview, I probably  would just say, well, there it is. It's a preview.  It's probably going to change a lot, especially with Microsoft  Windows. You know, remember what we  saw with Vista when it was Longhorn  and then what they finally came out with, it changed a lot.  But have they told... Loic, you're a developer,  so you have the tablet. I'm not myself  a developer. My team. But you're a seismic. I lead a developer.

Transcript:  I love this one.  What happened? Is there any staggering at all?  You need to be in an app.  So, see, you do this. Oh, look at that.  That's cool. This is how you switch  from app to app. And then you can split screen.  So, see now, I'm going  to do... Half and half.  Oh, I missed.  It's just nice to show you. Oh, look at that.  So now it's a Windows. So you can have  Tech Meme here and Tech Crunch  here. That's what they've

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  for this. It really is.  And you know that they're not phoning it in here. I mean, this is  not a copycat  of, as they were saying,  other tablets in the market, as if  we don't know who they're talking about.  But this is really...  And this is what I loved about Windows  Phone. I mean, Windows Phone is exciting.  Sadly, I've never  seen one in the wild, but...

Start time: 1334.10
End time: 1362.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I have, and you know what? This is almost identical  to Windows Phone. That's what's interesting.  If you turn this on its side and shrunk it down,  that's Metro. That's the Windows  Phone interface. And  I'll grant you this. This is a great  tablet interface. The problem  is, as far as I can tell,  this is also the start menu  on the desktop version of Windows.  And that's where I'm a little bit more worried. I've got it  running here in emulation on my Macintosh.  I don't have touch capabilities,  so everything I'm going to have to do now, I'm going to do with the mouse.

Start time: 1362.26
End time: 1370.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But they've designed... It seems like  they've been vocal about designing it to be able to be  interfaced with a touch screen and without a touch screen.  And they want the same kind of user experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What it seems to be is one UI to  serve them all. So in other  words, we're not going to care whether you're tablet,  desktop, laptop,  phone. This is the UI.  And I'm not sure  that you can do that. I don't know if you can successfully...  Can you apply a tablet metaphor  to a desktop computer? This is what Apple is trying to do with OS 10 Lion

Start time: 1390.30
End time: 1392.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and it's terrible. It's the same

Start time: 1392.32
End time: 1423.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  kind. You know, I like Lion, so this is running  on Lion. So I can swipe over and  have different windows open. To  me, this is still a desktop  metaphor  with some tablet-like features.  This is the start menu.  There is no more start menu in Windows 8.  You can hack it, but then it really isn't  Windows 8 anymore. This is the start menu now.  In fact, even if I go  to the desktop,  they have a little desktop tile here.  This looks very much like the Windows 7 desktop  until you click the start menu  and that's it.

Start time: 1425.05
End time: 1470.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm curious. I mean, playing with it, does it  translate? I mean, that's the question, right?  Because taking that  tablet and  I like Lion as well, but  there are stark differences.  Going from gesture  control to touch is hugely different.  That's a big leap, right? Going from just a  four-finger swipe on a trackpad  to actually touching  icons, moving things around on a  screen as opposed  to using a mouse to do it. I don't know that it  translates between them, but it's still early.  One of the big problems, though, is that this doesn't come  out for quite a while.  Trying to gain market share, trying to gain traction  in this space right now, which is moving at a clip  and you've got other competitors like  Apple out there on the tablet space so far  ahead of everyone else.  I wait a year for this to come out. I think Windows is

Start time: 1470.40
End time: 1492.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  woefully behind. Incidentally,  Jmax asked me in the chat room, is this going to change  how Office looks? And Microsoft has said  yeah, this is the interface for Office as well.  So this is  the new ribbon.  Your team is developer.  Clearly on the  tablet, this is good.  I think this is the first decent tablet  interface that's not Apple. I think

I just could never see  these individuals  with all due respect to a lot of them.  They don't even know how to use cut and paste.  And they're so used  to that system that they're using. I just can't  see them sitting there with a touch screen  reaching out to one of those HP  touch smarts looking through files.  I just don't see it.

That's the Zag case  that you put your iPad in and it's a Bluetooth  folding keyboard. It's actually very compact.  But you're not using that.  You're using a MacBook.

Transcript:  Now for developers, your question,  I think they are very excited.  They are.  One of the strengths, I wouldn't discount  the chances of Microsoft to succeed  in this because if you look at Xbox  versus Sony, they actually went huge  after the fact.  So yes, they're late, but they have  proven in the past that they can come late  and they have hundreds of millions of users  of Windows already.

End time: 1695.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Transcript:  We'll see.  Imagine if this was an Apple...  This was Windows 8 as a desktop.  Imagine if you could flip that around  and make it a touchscreen.  Convert it into a tablet but run the same operating system  and use it in quote unquote tablet mode

Start time: 1804.87
End time: 1857.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's possibly the real strength of this, isn't it?  You know, Microsoft's always had trouble  with tablets.  It must have galled them after 10 years  of pushing tablets that Apple comes in  and boom, just takes over.  But that's Bill Gates's  war that he lost.  I don't know if Microsoft, the current Microsoft,  worries so much about that.  But I've had a convertible Windows  tablet for years and it was just very awkward  uncannily because you put the touch on top of...  Those are those compact ones.  HP, exactly, HP compact.  But that's because you basically added touch  as an afterthought to Windows.  This feels more like Windows is a touch interface  first and maybe a desktop  a distant second.  People are pointing out in the chatroom that  Windows underneath has been  improved. There's a new kernel. There's a lot of rewriting  that's gone on. But I don't know if  users really are aware of that or care about that.  Developers might care more about that.  The user's going to be looking at the UI.

Start time: 1858.46

Transcript:  I think there will be high-end machines  that the iPad will own  as it already owns the high-end machines  like they do on the laptops.  The high-priced machines.  And this is going to come very cheap.  I think you'll have  very, very low-cost devices  and the rest of the world will really like  the low-cost devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  wouldn't they come to developers  and get a bunch of the key developers  on task  and say, look, we're going to cut you a check.  We want you guys  developing for Windows 8.  We want to bring over some of these marquee developers  get them out there in front so that when  a year from now  it's a robust  app store, it's a robust experience.  To some degree that's what's happening.

Start time: 1910.90
End time: 1932.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This is the developer preview.  They told developers, you can develop now  for this. It's not going to change  too much, so this is what you're going to be developing for.  And remember, Clayton, they don't have to give money  to developers. They just have to say one word.  450 million.  Install Windows users.  If you're a developer,  whether it's malware or an office suite,  that's what you care about, right?

Start time: 1932.74
End time: 1956.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But more than just developers, if you look at the app infrastructure  they're going to popular apps  and they're seeing what's the most popular  Android and iPhone apps, and they're going after  those people and saying, look, you need to make one  for Windows 7. Well, you can bet there'll be an angry bird  on this. But those people are saying, no, we don't want to,  and so Microsoft is giving them money  to do it. Oh, so they are doing it.  On the phone.  I have a friend who took $50,000  so he could put his app onto Windows 7.

Start time: 1956.78
End time: 1980.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So they are doing it. Wait, that's the phone.  Yeah, on the phone, I know.  You develop for the phone, you're kind of  halfway there.  No, no, that's not, so let me  remove my Microsoft Fanboy  hat for a second. There you go.  No, it's not, that's a huge issue.  If you're a developer, you built, we built a Windows  7 app, and it  doesn't work there. It's not the  same, so it's still a light on the phone.

I want a phone that I can  text with, that I can do some of the smartphone  features with, but I don't want such a complicated  thing. The KIN is actually,  if you don't have to pay the $30 a month  data plan, it's actually a great choice  for kids, for young people,  for people who don't want to pay the money.  I got blasted the same

Start time: 2037.14

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

You want an iPhone,  because they want the extra $1000  or $2000 they'll make over the life  of the phone. That's a big difference.  Everybody loves the weather app, by the way, on Windows 8.

I like it, but I just worry that  the main stay of Windows  is people who really want this desktop,  a smart menu.  Uh-oh.  Join the expression blend.  Oh, this is the development environment.  This is free also.  Which is pretty cool.  And you see that now I have a taskbar at the bottom.  Eileen, if you take down the lower third,  you see the taskbars here.

Transcript:  And investors like it, too.  How much do they pay you for Windows 7?  Hold on, Clayton. Go ahead.  I was just saying investors like it, too.  If you looked at Microsoft earlier in the week,  I think it was like a $25 a share.  By the end of the week, I think it ended the week  over $27.  So, yeah, investors are seeing  something exciting for Microsoft for the first time in a while.  And that wasn't the case a few weeks ago.  We were seeing Microsoft shares  keep dipping and dipping and dipping.  Somebody's liking it, and some analysts are seeing this.  I'm just curious who's going to buy it.  I'm curious how you can get a forecast like that  again, when it's going to take a year.  Right? Is it about a year to market for this  in tablet form?

I think that we're talking June.  September, maybe.  Certainly before September.  I would say June or July  because you want to get in the back to school market  and the holiday buying market.  I think that was a problem they had with both Windows 7  and Windows Vista as they missed the ship date.  Remember, it came out in January or February,

We have a Squarespace site, inside.twip.tv.  That's fantastic. Clayton just told you about his.  Squarespace is a really great company  for hosting and software.  So you get the hosting.  Best hosting in the world.  They're using, you know,  it's a very sophisticated, Java-based,  virtual server technology  that means there's always bandwidth  no matter what you're doing.  We've never brought a Squarespace site down, ever.  But it also is great content management software  on top of that hosting.  And the reason you want to do that is  because it's always up to date.  You're always running the latest version of the software.  You don't have to worry about security.  Trust me, this is the week where I wish I were on Squarespace.  We got hacked.  Our Drupal got hacked this week.  You don't have to worry about that.  Now, if you've got an existing blog,  give it a try.  Or if you want to do your first website  or maybe you've got a new idea for a website.  This is one of the things Squarespace is great for.  Got an idea? No problem.  Go to squarespace.com.  Click the Try It Free button right there.  All you need is the name of a site,  a password, and an email,  and you, for 15 days, have full access  to the Squarespace tools.  So you can really design a site  from scratch at no cost to you.  And if you decide you want to keep going,  it's very affordable. Prices is low as a little bit more than $10 a month.  Importing and exporting to all the major APIs,  movable type, WordPress, Typepad,  and Blogger, photo galleries,  point and click design.  They've got widgets for all  the social tools,  you know, Twitter and Facebook and LinkedIn  and YouTube and everything.  I mean, it just really couldn't be easier to use.  Here's the deal.  If you've tried it for free, if you decide you want to keep that site going,  pricing is very affordable,  and if you add the offer code TWIT9,  T-W-I-T-NINE at logout,  you get an additional 10% off for the first six years.  Six, I'm sorry, six months.  I didn't mean to extend it that long.  Six years.  You know, six months. That's plenty.  So you can subscribe monthly,  yearly, or two years,  and you see they have different plans.  But just check it out for free right now.  Click that green Try It Free button.  It's the secret behind exceptional websites.  And actually, just go to the examples page if you want to see.  There it is.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.  That's our inside TWIT blog.  That's a video I made with a new app  that's from the Harmonix people on the iPad.  Have you seen Vid Rhythm yet, Clayton?  It's so cool.  No, I haven't.  Should I just play a little bit of this video?  Yeah.  So the idea is,  you record on the iPad,  you record little,  you got audio in there?  No, it's not coming out.  Alright, I can play it over here.  You record a little bit, like it says,  okay, record boom or chick or a word,  and then it assembles a video.

They added this week,  they added a subscribe button,  which is kind of confusing.  So now on Facebook, you have your personal page,  which has a limit of 5,000 friends.  It's synchronous, so you can't,  somebody can't be your friend unless  they ask and you say yes.  There's also fan pages  where it's asynchronous.  Anybody can be your follower, and there's no limit.  So I have facebook.com slash TheLeoLaporte,  which is all I could get,  as a fan page, right?  So this is kind of the official page.  And anybody can like that page.  Then I have facebook.com slash LeoGLaporte,  that's my personal page.  Well, now they've added a subscribe feature.  Which you can turn on.  In fact, if I go to my facebook page,  you'll see it even starts to recommend  people I should subscribe to  in the right hand column here.  So they don't have to become friends,

Transcript:  Here's what God is saying.  Zuckerberg...  So here's my fan page.  What do I do?  He killed his page, and he moved all his fans into subscribers.  So I'm going to tell these 4,125 people what?

Start time: 3274.52
End time: 3314.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, you tell Facebook.  You tell them nothing.  You just disappear.  No, you ask Facebook.  You find a friend there.  Use Facebook as Leo Laporte.  No, no, no.  That's something else.  You know, I got to tell you something.  Take the tour.  This is so freaking confusing.  And I have to say, I think Facebook  is making a huge mistake.  Now we'll see what they're doing, and I want to know what they're going to do at F8.  You probably know already, Alexia.  But it strikes me that Facebook,  in an attempt to keep up with Twitter and Google...  See, Zuckerberg confronted 5 million people.  Yeah, so he dumped 5 million people.  How is that a good policy?

Start time: 3314.62
End time: 3317.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They moved them as followers, as subscribers.  So how do you do it?

Start time: 3318.60
End time: 3330.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But wait a minute. Coca-Cola and other brands  have spent millions of dollars getting people to push the like button.  No, no, no.  It's for individuals.  So they want brands to use pages  and individuals to use whatever they call that.

Start time: 3330.94
End time: 3334.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So they move your fans  to your subscriber followers.

Start time: 3334.74

Transcript:  But you lose analytics.  So if you go ahead and you move that over,  you lose all this.  No, look at this.

Start time: 3348.76
End time: 3360.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  When I look at my click here,  I see how many impressions,  I see the percent of feedback on here.  You lose all of that.  All of that goes away.  All of that goes away if you move it over with the subscribed.

Start time: 3360.80
End time: 3387.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So therefore, I don't know,  I mean, unless they move and they're able to migrate  the analytics over to the subscribed functionality  for fan pages,  then it's worthless.  It's worthless to me.  I mean, I think like a couple of years ago,  I hit on my personal page and just stupidly accepted  and just said, add friend, whatever,  and just kept accepting folks who had asked.  And then I hit my limit on my personal page  and it's impossible now to clean it up.  I just assumed delete the thing.  That's what I ended up doing.

Start time: 3388.84
End time: 3393.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Can I just say this is what Facebook should do?  Submit it.  And you guys tell me I'm wrong. Submit it.  Here's what Facebook should do.  They should stop adding all this crap.  They should make a...  Why do people want... Who uses Facebook?  Ignorant people don't know anything about the Internet.  This is how they keep track of their friends and family.  Normal people, not ignorant, but just people  who are not interested. Normal people.  They want privacy. They want to know what mom did.  They want to know what their college roommate did.  They don't want all this complicated stuff.  It's way too confusing.  Facebook should stop adding all these crazy features  and just focus on what brought them to the table  which is making people...  This is also a reaction to Google Plus in circles.

Start time: 3435.06
End time: 3446.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is.  Because if you look at people...  If you're accepting friends now, you see that...  I understand that they feel pressure from Twitter  and Google Plus.  They're making a huge mistake.

Start time: 3447.10
End time: 3451.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's another thing they've done.  They've made lists. So now when I post on Facebook...

Start time: 3451.12
End time: 3465.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I think they want you to be open.  People are afraid to be open, so they say  oh, well, we'll be able to let you  privatize different things in different ways  so that you can say more about it.  Twitter is inherently open.  So there's a problem with Facebook starting as private  and Twitter starting as open.

Start time: 3467.20
End time: 3484.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Does this remind you of Google Plus?  Now when I post, I can say, post to people who went to my high school.  People who work at Twitter. People who went to my college.  They've made all of these lists into who I post.  This is totally Google Plus.  Facebook, this doesn't make people feel better.  This confuses people.

Start time: 3485.12
End time: 3507.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is a mess. It is an absolute mess.  It's a mess.  I have fan pages for our different shows.  Like Daddy on Board, these other shows.  It's just a mess trying to manage all of them.  Use Facebook as a page makes no sense.  Sometimes when I'm using the mobile version of this  I'm not that person.  I'm the other page and I'm posting as this other page.  It makes no sense.  And why are you still using it?  Because you have to.

Start time: 3509.58

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly.  First of all, have you guys ever read the John Battelle article Search is a Pencil?  It was argued that it was a pen.  It was a pen.  He was arguing that Facebook is like Photoshop  and Twitter is like a pencil.  It's simple and you use Twitter just to post a status update.  But if you need to use Photoshop, you need to use Twitter.  That's so silicone Valley-ish.  There are 500 million people using Facebook

Start time: 3529.50
End time: 3533.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  and they don't know about Twitter.  700 million.  I admit.

Start time: 3535.24
End time: 3537.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And some of the chat rooms said you're not using it like normal people.  No, no, I agree.

Start time: 3539.26
End time: 3560.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But what I'm saying is normal people  don't want all this stuff.  All of these people are using it  and they don't want all this stuff.  All of these things that they're putting on Facebook  are ways for them to try to make money.  They're throwing stuff up against the wall.  They have no vision in this.  There's no central core principle.  And they're screwing the hell out of it.  In a year, this is going to be gone.

Start time: 3561.32
End time: 3567.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They've totally got vision.  They made $3 billion in 2011.  What, 700 million of that was profit?

Start time: 3567.60
End time: 3582.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's history.  Right.  But then that was certainly, they were out,  obviously not out in front, obviously MySpace was out in front.  But I think, to Leo's point,  I look at somebody like my mom, right,  who loves Facebook.  She's able to connect with my audience.

Start time: 3583.40
End time: 3588.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Make mom happy.  But they're not, because there are certain functionalities  that are public.

Start time: 3589.44
End time: 3611.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so when you add public and then subscribe,  most of the defaults are already there.  So no one would need to subscribe because they're already getting everything  if they just go to her feed anyway.  So now if she sets certain things to private,  then that's where subscribe would be valuable  because then I could subscribe and not get all the private stuff.  But she doesn't know that.  I mean, it really is.  You need to read like three books  to know all the functionality of Facebook.

Start time: 3611.52
End time: 3620.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It is in that respect very much like Photoshop.  But they're aiming, it's for the Photoshop for mom.  Leo, Leo, Leo.  See, my 14-year-old here,  he knows nothing else than Facebook.

Start time: 3621.52
End time: 3630.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And he loves what we're saying.  Because he doesn't use anything else.  When you talk to him about Twitter,  he doesn't know why you would use Twitter.  And so it's not for moms, that for sure.

Transcript:  There was another crazy thing.

Start time: 3639.60
End time: 3661.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what it's totally like.  It's basically a combination of email and IM conversations.  When Messenger came out, when you do a Facebook email,  it basically pops up on your screen immediately.  Really?  Now, like I used to use Facebook occasionally with people as email.  As soon as Messenger came out,  I mean, it's right in front of your face in half a second.  The only good thing about that in a way is that you deal with it  and it's done, so you're consistently at inbox zero.  And it's also free.

Start time: 3661.64
End time: 3663.64

Transcript:  So Gauthier, get some more root beer for Alexis.  Root beer, maybe some water.  Make yourself useful.  Are there chips?  You use Facebook all the time?  You spend hours on it?  What do you like about it?

Start time: 3721.01
End time: 3721.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 3721.86
End time: 3727.64

Start time: 3728.47
End time: 3730.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm not really interested in following people.  So you don't subscribe?

Start time: 3732.20
End time: 3741.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You don't like pages?  If I go to your Facebook account,  you won't see...  Gauthier likes Nike shoes and likes Coca-Cola.  Well, I have some pages I like.

Start time: 3741.88
End time: 3749.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I just did that.  Usually it's my friends who like those pages.  And then I just see that and like them too.  You don't interact with the brands or anything like that?  No.

Start time: 3751.90
End time: 3756.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Start time: 3757.88

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's mostly Facebook message.  And otherwise, sometimes email.  But less.

Start time: 3763.90
End time: 3775.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So you use Facebook because that's where your friends hang out.  It's the best way to stay in touch with your friends.  See what they're doing.  And you share pictures with them?  And you find it very easy to use?  Do you see a lot of features there that you don't use?

Start time: 3777.96
End time: 3785.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the only feature I use  is the friend part of it.  So, otherwise...  So kind of what I'm saying...

Start time: 3785.98
End time: 3790.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you have people in categories though?  Do you have friends, family?  Do you do lists?

Start time: 3791.96
End time: 3799.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like really good friends versus not so good friends?  Do you do that?  Not really. I only have my actual friends.  I'm a member of my family and my friends.

Start time: 3800.18
End time: 3803.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you keep your privacy settings pretty stringent?  Kids aren't allowed to be public.

Start time: 3804.06
End time: 3807.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they're not a part of the subscribe feature  because they're not allowed to have public.

Start time: 3808.30
End time: 3819.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You can't allow subscribers.  But in your account set, do you look at the privacy settings  and look at those settings  and mess with them?  Yeah, I put everything in private.  You just make it private?

Start time: 3820.22
End time: 3824.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not a common refrain among kids.  Do you use Google Plus or any of your friends on Google Plus at all?

Start time: 3824.26
End time: 3826.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're not allowed to.  So you have to be 18.

Start time: 3828.77
End time: 3862.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So this is kind of my position.  Gauthier is exactly who Facebook should be serving.  Unfortunately, Facebook is trying to make a killing in the market.  But I think by doing so, they're going to make themselves less appealing to Gauthier  and his friends.  Because really, you use it in a very simple  and I think very effective way.  It's how you message people.  It's how you look at their pictures, see what they're up to.  You do stuff on the wall.  One of the things you're going to add this week is music.  If you had Rhapsody or some music service in there,  would you have that going in the background?

Start time: 3896.28
End time: 3913.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But you don't use it?  No.  I think he's just underscoring my point,  which is that there's a core set of features  they should focus on, make easier to use,  serve this audience better,  and not start adding all this...  Look at this cruft.  I got a question for you.

Start time: 3914.36
End time: 3915.69

Transcript:  I think that Facebook needs to do what Leo says,  is make sure that the capabilities and the functionalities  that people like remain the same,  and people can use that, but at the same time,  they need to look at what other people in their space  that are competitors are doing,  and make sure that they innovate, react to them,  and maybe iterate what they're doing better,  and maybe create new ideas, because otherwise...  Well, that's clearly what they're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I also think that Facebook's going to be  making it so...  In the ability to have different kinds of feeds,  you'll be able to have more immediate feeds,  so things that people are doing  at the moment, so when the music comes out,  you'll be able to have a feed of what's really  happening right now, and then have a feed of,  I'm just going to catch up on what's been going on with my friends.  I think they're going to focus on that.

The reason people think this is a hot startup  is because...  One word, Facebook.  It's designed for Facebook.  It's not color.  It makes it hot because it will be a plugin for Facebook  so that I'll have Avatar Chat in Facebook.  It seems to me that there is a...  Zynga.

The app, which was supposed to be  social context, those people around  you who you could share photos with,  you could have instant conversations,  to my mind, this is really  like color inside  of Facebook.

When you're in Paris, you focus on France.  When you're in Germany, you focus on Germany first.  It's balkanized.  But at the same time, you've been focusing on Germany,  trying to own Germany or Spain.  There is someone in Silicon Valley  who has more success.  So YouTube versus the French called Daily Motion and so on.  To me, it's the main reason.  We don't start in English.

What's he doing with it?  Nothing.  Let's take a break.  Also David Prager is here from Revision 3.  I just want to reintroduce everybody.  When we come back,  we'll see if anybody knows anything about that.  But before I do that,  I want to talk about audiobooks from audible.com.  I am a big audible fan.  I don't think I'm telling you anything  if you've ever watched me on any of these shows.  You know that I listen when I'm in the car,  when I'm at the gym,  when I'm cleaning house.  Audiobooks are great.  And I highly recommend it.  I'm going to give you a chance to try it for free right now.  Get two books for free.  If you go to audible.com slash twit two,  you'll be signing up for the platinum account.  That's two books a month.  First month's free.  First two books are free.  And they're yours to keep canceled at any time.  Now I think this is going to be one.  You know, Jane Lynch is hosting the Emmys tonight.  She's of course the star.  Sue Sylvester on Glee.  I didn't know she had a memoir.  Carol Burnett wrote the foreword and helps narrate it.  Jane Lynch, Happy Accidents.  So that's a good one.  Now if you're into showbiz memoirs,  now this is a tough one.  There's the Rob Lowe book,  Stories I Only Tell My Friends.  Man, that's probably pretty good.  Rob Lowe narrates that one.  Or Bossy Pants, Tina Fey's new memoir,  which is supposed to be very good.  And also narrated by Tina Fey.  So these are great.  This is an example of audible.  You hear these people,  these great stars talking in your head to you,  reading to you.  It's a wonderful way to get reading done  when you just don't have time.  If you're a little bit more literary,  you want something a little bit more educational,  how about this, Grand Pursuit.  Sylvia Nasser wrote that fabulous book  about a beautiful mind about the mathematician.  This is her new book about economics  called A Grand Pursuit,  The Story of Economic Genius.  Thomas Friedman's new book is out on audible.com.  That used to be us,  How America Fell Behind in the World It Invented.  I just think this is such a great resource  for education, for entertainment,  science and technology,  sci-fi and fantasy.  It's all here.  So pick two books.  Stephen Hawking's Brief History of Time.  That would be kind of nice.  Get smart while you're driving.  Pick two books and make Audible yours.  Audible.com slash twit2 plays back on everything.  In fact, if you've got the new Kindle,  it's great because your Audible books  show up along with your Amazon books  right there in the Kindle  for you to download and listen to at any time.  Audible.com slash twit2.  Clayton, you're an Audible fan, I know.

I love the functionality on the Audible app on the iPhone.  Isn't that great?  Because you can pick which speed, the read rate.  I actually listen to, I think,  in the Plex book about Google in triple speed.  Do you really?  It depends on who's reading it.  I can get through a good book in that amount of time.  My wife can't stand it.  She's like, will you just put it on the normal rate, please?  See, I'm not in a hurry.

There's nothing more pleasant  than reading to your kid in bed.  I just love it.  But on the other hand,  when you're in the car  and it can't be read to the kid,  it is a great way.  We took car trips with the kids  and we'd always have Audible books.  Here's a great one,  The Once and Future King by T.H. White,  the story of King Arthur.

First of all,  Propeller is an interesting name  for this Flipboard clone from Google  because Propeller was the name  Jason Calacanis gave his dig clone on AOL.  I did, I said the word.

They sure are.  some creativity in the design space online  rather than having...  Google Reader looks like crap still.  But now you see what they're able to do with Google Plus  and you're starting to see this user interface  and I'm excited.  I'm excited by the idea of them creating something  that's tied right into Google Reader for crying out loud.  I mean, they've already got the pipeline there.  Right.  Why not?

Start time: 4950.48
End time: 4960.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Start time: 4960.60
End time: 5000.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you're seeing it shift, right?  You're starting to see a lot of Google Plus,  the look and design of Google Plus.  You're starting to see that trickle into Google Docs.  You're starting to see it pop up all over the place  and getting this clean, nice interface.  So it'd be interesting to see what they're able to do  with an iPad app that's set to rival Flipboard.  I mean, I'd be excited by it because I love Flipboard.  But like I said, they've already got the pipes  and one of the big criticisms against Flipboard, of course,  is that it's scraping content, right?  But here, it'd be interesting to see  how Google's able to pull it off.  That criticism has been leveled against them at news.google.com  from the likes of Rupert Murdoch and others,  but taking content when it's really not.  They're linking to content.

Transcript:  I mean, think about how many people  do not have a passcode lock on their phone, right?  Like if you live in New York City,  you better have one because you're going to leave  your phone in a car all the time.  But I mean, I would love to have something like this  on my phone to get on the subway on a regular basis.  Like today I paid at Starbucks  with the Starbucks mobile app on my iPhone.

Transcript:  Hey, speaking of your wife and your child,  you're a parent, Loic, you're a parent, I'm a parent.  What do you think of this?  The Federal Trade Commission is proposing revisions  to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, COPPA,  and I think anybody who runs a website  is going to be a little bit nervous about this,  to prevent websites from collecting tracking information  about people under 13.  That would include cookies and geolocation.  If you have a kid under 13 going to a site,  that site will have to secure parental consent  before using tracking cookies.  Now, I understand the desire to protect kids online,  but a number of people have said...  pointed out, every site in the world uses browser cookies.  How are we going to...  Does this mean that before you can use any site,  we're going to have to do an age check?  This could break the web.

Start time: 5308.34
End time: 5329.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This will never happen.  I agree.  I mean, this is not going to pass the smell test.  You think when you get a couple of companies  sitting in front of Congress explaining...  You can imagine Amazon before you visit Amazon,  which there's questionable content on Amazon,  you're going to have to click on something  that says you're age-appropriate before you actually get it,  and that would mean the entire web  you'd have to click before you get in.

Start time: 5330.00
End time: 5346.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The argument is that these companies  have hundreds of millions of dollars in funding  so that they should figure it out technologically,  because it's more important that you protect kids  than you have a couple of seconds of delay  in entering a site.

Start time: 5347.40
End time: 5364.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'd like to know what they mean by these browser tracking cookies,  however, because for all browsers,  all websites set cookies,  which could ostensibly be used to track.  I mean, it's a unique ID.  We set cookies.  Every browser set...  Every website sets cookies.  We set cookies.  Does that mean that Twitter...  Before you'd be allowed to visit the Twitter page,  you'd have to prove you were 13?

Start time: 5365.20
End time: 5374.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Plus, yeah, how do you know, right?  As an editor or owner of a site, how do you know that?  Like that you have to shut down or not put a cookie to someone?  It's really just difficult to implement.

Start time: 5375.20
End time: 5382.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think the way you implement it is very simple.  That you put a tracking device on children.  Right.  On children?  Like an NFC device.

Somebody had found the cat,  ran the scanner on the chip,  and found out that the owners lived in Colorado.  They were flying there to the city  to pick up the cat.  It was like the local ASPCA,  whatever, had the cat and was able to scan its neck.

Transcript:  You know, it gives good hope.  It gives hope to all cat owners who've lost a cat,  I've lost cats, that maybe the cat didn't get run...  I always assume the cat got run over or found a new owner.  Maybe they're just walking to New York.  Right.  Like Midnight Cowboy.  Yeah.  Everybody's talking at me.  Five-year walk.
