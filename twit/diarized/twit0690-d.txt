Start time: 238.54
End time: 266.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The new Mac mini, the replacement for the MacBook Air. I don't think they'll even hint at the Mac  Pro. I think they've learned their lesson about pre-announcing things before they ship hopefully.  But the new Mac mini and the KB, sorry, the Coffee Lake. Every time I go to Sleepy,  I wake up and there's a new Lake in the Intel family. But the Coffee Lake, not the Coffee Lake  revision or refresh, but the Coffee Lake versions of the iMac, the iMac. And I forget what Xeon is  on now. It was Skylake. So maybe now it's beyond KB Lake. Somebody asked me on the radio show,

Start time: 266.40

Start time: 270.70
End time: 279.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you had to go to class. You got like a- Yeah, they were real educators there and they  were teaching us with playgrounds and pages. And then they had labs where you could like do  Swift and fly a drone and dissect a frog in AR and all these things. Could you say, hey, I got a  file. I'll see you later. Could you just like- Well, I mean, a lot of people just go to these  events and then they leave and like they go to the events, they get the hands on, they post their  video, they get on the plane, they fly to the next event. But my, you know, for good or for ill,  I really only cover the Apple beat. So I get to stay there for the long haul. You get to stay the whole time.

Start time: 358.50
End time: 377.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No other events for you to go to. Tomorrow will be the one plus event for their 6T. They had to move it  because the last thing you want to do is do anything on Apple Day.  They got big footed. They got, yeah, really stomped. So we'll have new phones to talk about

Transcript:  Buy bezels. I actually got my- They were offensive. They deserve to die. I got my 10R on Friday and I  do like it quite a bit even though it has a little bit of a bezel. People are saying,  it's got too much bezel. It's got the littlest little bezel. Oh, it's too much bezel. LCD backlight  is still hard. I like it. I think it's nice. It's the best battery life of any iPhone. Yeah. Right?  Yeah. It's got a forgivable bezel. Very forgivable. I think it's highly forgivable. I think it's  pretty. Although once again, I love the colors. The product red is gorgeous, but you got to put

Although there  is some complicity at Twitter, there is a site that was supposed to be the Freedom of Speech  conservative site called Gab that pretty much everybody, as you pulled their subscription,  the credit cards say you can't use it anymore to pay for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  meaning this week. Yes, they do. Yeah. Tim Cook says it's all the fault of the data industrial  complex as long as we're talking Apple. Tim was invited to speak at the 40th International  Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners, the jauntily named ICDPPC,  which is in Brussels. He gave the keynote and took it as an opportunity to say that the  weaponization of big data is a problem and that artificial intelligence is really the bad actor.  For artificial intelligence to be truly smart, it must respect human values, including privacy.  If we get this wrong, the dangers are profound. Somebody said, well, easy enough for Tim to  take pot shots at Google, which is clearly what this is, but he's also letting China  do whatever it wants with Apple servers on the iCloud. So it is a point to be made that you can  say all this, but if you're letting China have access to iCloud data, I don't know if you're

Start time: 623.73
End time: 662.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  really supporting privacy. The interesting thing there is that he indicated there might be a shift  in policy. So previously with iOS 7, Apple went all in on fail secure. You could barely get into  anything and if you lost your recovery number, that was it. Apple could not help you. And then  they got a lot of pushback because we talked about this previously. Some people, they don't  care if anyone else gets their photos, you just better not lose their photo. That's the most  important thing to them. And so Apple changed their policy and now they have fail secure for  anything that's real time and fail safe for anything that's in the backup. And he indicated  in that speech, or I think in the comments following that speech, that Apple is reevaluating  that and it may be given the climate now, it'll be better to go to fail secure everywhere, even if  that means that they can't necessarily help somebody if they lose their access password or code or

Start time: 665.70
End time: 724.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  recovery digits or whatever. Alex Stamos, who is the former Facebook Chief Information Security  Officer says, I agree with almost everything Tim Cook said in his privacy speech today, which is  why it's so sad to see the media credulously covering his statement without the context  of Apple's action in China. Apple uses hardware rooted DRM to deny Chinese users the ability to  stall the VPN and E2E messaging apps like Signal that would allow them to avoid pervasive censorship  and surveillance. Apple moved iCloud data into a PRC controlled joint venture with unclear impacts  but he also points out China is an ethical blind spot for many in tech. We ignore the working  conditions under which our beautiful devices are made, the censorship and surveillance  necessary to ship apps there, the environmental externalities of cold powered Chinese Bitcoin  farms. Cook is right, the US needs a strong privacy law and privacy regulator but Apple needs to come

Start time: 724.34
End time: 786.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  clean on how iCloud works in China. Google already went through this dance a few years ago,  going into China and then exiting China for an extended period of time. And as I think everyone  in that entire trillion dollar cohort has said along the way, China is this puzzle that there's  no easy answer to. They represent such a huge part of the world that you can't ignore them.  You can't just say, well, if you won't play by our rules, then we'll just stay out of your market  because they're just too huge of a market. It's one of those conundrums that we need to be  wrestling with and it's really good that we're having these conversations that we should have

Start time: 786.72
End time: 807.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  been having years and years ago. Do you think though that Apple should, I hope you're right,  Renee, that Apple's planning on doing something to step back a little bit and that Google should  not be going back into China with censored search dead? I mean, should American companies  just point out how big a market is, turn their back on it? I don't know. If you don't go into

Start time: 812.68
End time: 850.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  those markets, then you're denying billions of people access to transformative technology.  If you do go into those markets under the terms that are being dictated by an increasingly  autocratic regime, then you're complicit in things that are going to happen to the citizens  of that country. So, neither one of those things sounds like a good answer. It can't be a binary

Start time: 850.20
End time: 955.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  question. Go ahead, Jason, and then Renee. Yeah, it's always the question, right? What will further  the goals of the world, the better answer for the global community, right? Is it isolation when  people are doing things that are regressive in human rights to their citizens, to other countries  in some cases? Is it better to isolate them? Is it better to bring them part into the global  community and then put over time, naturally, pressure gets put on them? That's the tactic  that the Olympics takes. It's better to have them at the table than to have them off in their own  room doing whatever they want to their people. So, it's playing out in tech because tech is a  bigger part of the world and is becoming a bigger and bigger part of the world. I don't think it's  possible for us at this point to separate or completely isolate China. All of these big  tech companies are so connected to them. The question now is just sort of like,  how much do we give them a seat at the table versus how much do we have this sort of carrot  and stick? Whereas, if you do things that share our values, then we give you more. And if you don't,  we pull back. It's all a matter of degrees. There's no complete answer to completely isolate  China. And there probably never will be, not in the foreseeable future for now.

Start time: 956.86
End time: 1021.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  René? Yeah, the only thing I wanted to add is that as far as I know, there's not too many  differences in the way that Apple handles iCloud in China as opposed to outside China.  The real-time stuff is all end-to-end encrypted and nobody has the keys to that, not even Apple.  The backup stuff is the same as it is in the US. The US government can and has gone in and demanded  the data, and China can go in and demand that data. The only difference is inside America,  we look at China is scary, where inside China, they're like, we don't want our citizens' data  to be stored on American servers. You're going to spy on us. We don't trust you. And France is  wanting repatriation, and other countries are wanting redata repatriation, which is why we have  the Cloud Act. It's becoming an increasing problem. And if those companies, Apple's got a long-standing  policy of always being engaged. They truly believe they cannot affect change if they don't  stay engaged. And there's going to be pretty much every country or union in the world is going to  want their data localized at some point. So I think it's a bigger question. I mean, Microsoft  was wrestling with it. Apple is wrestling with it. Google is off and on with it. But it's going to  have to be answered. And it can't be just like, I'm a Canadian and I necessarily don't want my data  stored in the US, frankly, anymore. So I don't know what we're all going to do. Right.

Start time: 1023.00
End time: 1145.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, there's another data point to toss in there, which is Twitter. And Twitter,  let's think back to the glorious Arab Spring, where it seemed like Twitter was doing an amazing  job of mobilizing the forces of the people to rise up and demand democracy in their countries.  And as we learned, I think just in the last week or two, that a lot of that data was being  siphoned away that a Twitter employee had actually been recruited by the Saudi intelligence services  to hand over the names and identifying details of people who were running  anonymous or pseudonymous accounts that were involved in actions that were against the state.  And so, you know, so at the time, all of the talk of Twitter was, look what a force for good  Twitter is being here. And now, years later, with the benefit of hindsight, we look back on this  and say, you know, how many people were arrested, imprisoned and possibly executed  as the result of all of that stuff. It really, you know, Renee is right,  encryption for a lot of this stuff is really crucial. But there's more to it than that.  Identity is as important as anything, because even if they can't see the content of what you're  doing, if they can see the metadata, or if they can see your account information and associate that  with communications between point A and point B, you can get in a lot of trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's really been a terrible week for Silicon Valley in so many respects. There's of course,  the debate over the Pentagon's $10 billion Jedi cloud contract. Google said, well,  we're not going to bid on it. Amazon is likely to get it. Amazon employees have signed petitions  saying Amazon shouldn't be selling face recognition tech to police. Many employees say Amazon  shouldn't be bidding on this cloud contract. Jeff Bezos said, I'm happy to bid on this contract.  And you know, in a way, I can't exactly he says, sometimes one of the leaderships, the jobs of  senior leadership is to make the right decision even when it's unpopular. If big tech companies  are going to turn their back on the US Department of Defense, this country is going to be in trouble.  And actually, I thought that was a compelling argument. So we is this stuff is so tough. And  of course, Silicon Valley is under a microscope. Everybody's looking at what Silicon Valley does.  And and I honestly feel like there's nothing is almost nothing these big companies can do  that's going to not put them under further scrutiny. Take the contract or not.

Start time: 1219.12
End time: 1304.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, techs become so central to everything we do. Right?  It's part of the mainstream now, isn't it? Yeah,  it is. It is intrinsic in in every part of business and every part of government and  every part of health care. And it's become that way, you know, so quickly, almost overnight,  right in a matter of decades. I mean, all of us obviously have been talking about this story  for a long time, knew it was coming, have seen parts of it happen. But we're at the point where  it has gotten mission critical everywhere and part of everything. And so it's it's now there  are problems. And the tech industry has been so focused on innovation specifically for the past  several decades, three or four decades, so little on privacy, so little on security. And and now and  while things are better, and there's more attention to those things in the last, say, five years,  there's still a lot of things out there that that are not, you know, up to snuff. And we're  paying the price for it. We have a huge technical debt to pay in cybersecurity and privacy. And it's  going to take, you know, it's going to take decades to get it right. Because it's taken that long to,  you know, build all of these things so that those those are not a natural part of an intrinsic part

Start time: 1304.46
End time: 1331.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  of the world that we built with technology. It's funny, Ed and I, and I guess you too,  Jason and Renee have been covering this for so long. And when I first started covering tech,  it was just a narrow slice of the economy was a narrow slice of the world. And these decisions  didn't carry much weight all of a sudden, because it's so important. These decisions carry huge  weight. And it's hard to know what's right. And they were different companies, right? They were

Start time: 1331.96
End time: 1339.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oracle, they weren't Amazon, they weren't the company you bought from that was making these  systems. It was companies you maybe had a parent or uncle who worked for. Right. Well, and, and,

Start time: 1340.74
End time: 1447.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and there's another thing too, to add, I agree completely with what Jason said. And I will add  that right now, most of the the technical and ethical decisions are being made by engineers  in Silicon Valley, even though there's a huge political component to them.  And at least in the Western world, the two largest powers, the United States and the United Kingdom  are basically so consumed with self destructive, internal problems that nobody, nobody is offering  the slightest bit of leadership on these issues. The probably the, the one force in the Western  economies that's offering anything there is Germany. And the reason that Germany is doing that is  because of the unfortunate history that they have from, you know, both from the Nazi times,  but also in more recently from East Germany, where, you know, where they've baked privacy  into their constitution, into their government and into their, you know, into their culture.  And even there, you know, there's a struggle to still come to terms with a lot of the technical  decisions that are happening there. So when you have, you know, you have this huge interlocking  problem of technology and politics, and yet the political leadership is almost completely lacking  on this. And that, that fundamentally is the problem, I think. It's true. Why you do have to

Start time: 1447.76
End time: 1507.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  admire, sorry, Renee, sorry, just one quick thing. You do have to admire, you know, Tim Cook and his  remarks, you know, where we kind of started this conversation. It is self serving. Apple has played  its hand where it's not being Amazon or Facebook or Google and making all this money off of data,  which is, you know, a gold mine. And ultimately, all of those companies will eclipse Apple in,  monetarily and in market share and those things because of that. You know, the writing nose is on  the wall, but where, you know, Apple has put its, you know, its stake in the ground is on privacy.  It doesn't have the data operations that the other companies have and it's, you know,  put its stake in the ground with its products there. So it is self serving, but still you have to admire  Tim Cook for showing some leadership because we have to pinpoint a huge vacuum in leadership on  these things and we need it in the public world as well as well as the private world.

Don't let Google take over Berlin. Google  plans to implant a Google campus in Kreuzberg, Berlin. We, as a decentralized network of people,  want to keep our lives and spaces free from this law and tax evading company that's building a  dystopian future. This campaign succeeded. More on our Wiki.

Transcript:  decided not to open that. It's super, it's super interesting to me because we can't all afford  everything. We want a lot of things, but we can't all afford to them. But we're all data billionaires.  We're all equally data rich. It's the great equalizer and we can get all these data subsidized  products, but we have different expectations. Like we know we can, we give Google our selfies  and it gives us amazing Google photos, but we probably don't think about them using that for  military drone strikes. And when we hear that, it's sort of, it's not the deal we feel like we signed  up for. Our expectations get suddenly out of whack or we hear with Amazon and law enforcement.  And it's going to, I think, have to result in a lot more disclosure and a lot more sort of sobering  of our community because there really is no free. We're just, we are giving them our selfies and

It's a really  interesting mix and it's a very challenging one. We're going to talk, we'll take a break and talk  about the biggest software acquisition in history, which just broke hours ago. And it's kind of a  stunner and you guys are going to have to explain to me what's going on here. But first a word from  WordPress. If you don't have a website, you ought to make one. I think it's increasingly obvious that  merely existing on social media, having a Facebook page or a Twitter feed is not enough.  If you're a, even if you're a teenager in high school, you ought to create a website because  that's what people will find when they search your name and you want to control that.  It's even more important if you're in business and the easiest, best way, most affordable way  to create a great website is with WordPress.com. I just got a little notice in my WordPress app  that I am celebrating my 12th anniversary with WordPress.com. It wasn't the beginning of my blog.  I started with content management systems going back, I think, to 2001, all sorts of different  ones, but I finally settled on the best WordPress. I'm not alone. 31%, 31% of all websites in the  world now run on Word. 32% just went up. It's like the tote board at the telethon. It's now 32% of  the internet. We're going to get to a third of the internet by hook or by crook. Pretty impressive,  right? Matt Mullenweg, the guy who created WordPress, just had a vision. He wanted to make  it easy for you to make a website and that vision has come to life at WordPress.com. It's so your  vision can come to life. There are no limits at WordPress.com. You can create the ultimate online  hub that's yours, your ethos, your style, and you own it. You can upload video, images, audio,  all your text. It's on your site. You can get it in. You can get it out. It's yours. It's not  sitting anywhere else. You could choose from hundreds of designs so it'll look exactly how  you want with the best engineering built in. WordPress is hassle-free. It takes care of the  hosting, the security, the software updates. You can focus on your site. Now, I have to say,  when I started using Twitter and Facebook and Instagram, I stopped posting on my blog and that  was a mistake. Now I'm back and posting because that's where I live on the internet. That's where  you live on the internet. Grow your audience. Reach new customers. Built in search engine  optimization. Social media sharing so you can get other people to talk about your site on their  Facebook and Twitter. Don't get rid of your Facebook and Twitter but you got to have something  linked back to you and that's your WordPress site. I love the WordPress app on iOS and Android.  When we were traveling, that was how I posted blog posts, checked comments, approved comments,  looked at my analytics, my stats. Great app. Launch your website with confidence knowing you  can always get help 24-7 from a support team that's friendly, nice, and smart. Plan start at just $4  a month. Find out why 32% of every website in the world runs on WordPress, including some of the  biggest publishers in the world. We've got a deal too, 15% off any new planned purchase but you have  to go to WordPress.com slash twit. WordPress.com slash twit. Create your new website. Put your flag,  put down your flag, plant your flag on the internet. WordPress.com slash twit. Thank you so much. Thank  you Matt and WordPress and Automatic and all the team there. For 12 years I've been happy at  WordPress.com slash twit. So glad you're blogging again, Leo. It's so much fun. I don't do Instagram  so instead of putting a thing on Instagram I put it there. The nice thing about that is  if you want to see my pictures you know where to go, leolaport.com. If you put them on Instagram  sometimes you see them, sometimes you don't. And it's yours, you own it. I own it. I have to say,  if you go back in my blog, because I've moved around, there are big holes in it. All the text  survived import and export but a lot of the images were stored. Remember Vox? I had stuff

There was so much there that was just,  you know, there's 5% of it was stuff that I really wish I still had. Actually I do have it  in the backup somewhere but I wish I still had. But the other 95% of it was, you know, it was about  software and products and a lot of hands-on stuff that it's simply about dead products.

I'm just looking,  this is my first WordPress post. It's 28 February 2001 and it's so fun. I mean some of you're right,  some of it's nuts. Like hey this meeting is ending, yay lunch. This is pre-Twitter folks.  But then there's also, you know, I think things that are to me of interest, maybe not anybody  else. But it's kind of like keeping a journal, right? And then your old stuff's there. I just  like having it. I wish some of the pictures I'd posted were still there. Do you remember,  remember Moblogging? Remember that? There was TextAmerica.com, remember that?  So this was early days of camera phones, maybe 2002 or 2003. And I posted hundreds of pictures  pre-Instagram, way, way on a site called TextAmerica and it just disappeared.  It was called Moblogging. Am I dreaming this? You remember that?  Not that we're Moblogging. You can Google it.  I'm still missing Jaikoo. Jaikoo, I miss Jaikoo. I loved Jaikoo. Yeah. No,  all the TextAmerica stuff disappeared. It's all gone.

But, you know, I remember for a  decade or so I was, you know, a webmaster and an IT guy. And I had to, you know, I had to learn how  to kick a server that was 2000 miles away, right?

Here's one from  2001. Tomorrow morning on Tech TV, we're doing a roundtable celebrating the 10th anniversary of  Linux. So here we are a little bit later, 17 years later, and I am blown away by this headline.  Red Hat has been acquired by IBM. By the way, Red Hat was one of the early Linux's I used. I used  Mandrake and then Red Hat for $34 billion making it, it's the biggest acquisition IBM's ever made.  It's the third biggest tech acquisition of all time. Bigger even than Microsoft buying LinkedIn.

Transcript:  So in the press release, I read the press release today and like you, I'm still trying to  figure it out. And there's folks at ZDNet who probably have already posted something on this  and I need to go read it. Stephen J. von Nichols, I would expect would be, if he doesn't have a post  up there yet, he will soon. But one of the things that they said in their press release was hybrid  cloud. I think hybrid cloud, hybrid cloud, hybrid cloud. That's their approach to it. And  Red Hat has been an enterprise services company for quite a while. They're not a Linux distro.

Start time: 2159.60
End time: 2171.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have 12,000 employees, I think. However, they were valued at the last,  I saw, $20 billion. So this is a significant premium.

Transcript:  Just put that out there. I'll take it. Yeah.  Red Hat missed its most recent revenue estimates. Company subscription revenue, 20% of year over year  growth to $722 million. So that's a lot of money for a free operating system.

Transcript:  They think they need this to compete, right? They think that the cloud is definitely the cloud  services of the future and Amazon and other companies are running away with them and IBM's  and they need one of how Ed figured out how to kick the server. They think Red Hat's going to  help kick them into the better into the cloud. Yeah, this is what Jeannie Rometty, the CEO,

Start time: 2213.98
End time: 2246.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  said. The acquisition of Red Hat is a game changer. It changes everything about the cloud market.  IBM will become the world's number one hybrid cloud provider offering companies the only open  cloud solution. That's cloud four times in one sense. They will unlock the full value of the  cloud for their businesses. I guess it's all about- And open, right? Open is big now too.  Cloud. Well, at Microsoft, I thought the moon had turned blue when Microsoft announced they  were going to put Linux on Azure. They bought GitHub.  And then they bought GitHub. By the way, that closed this week also. It's an interesting week

Transcript:  Seriously, anybody who is still on the, who is still quoting Steve Ballmer saying that  open source is communism or whatever, whatever that stupid thing he said way back when was.  You said Linux was a cancer. Linux was a cancer. That's right.  And it was Bill Gates who said that open source is communism. But that was a long,  long time ago in a galaxy far away. And, and, and, you know, I mean, anyone who's been paying  attention, it has been at least five years that Microsoft has been unequivocally committing  to open source projects. They, they just, they just open source their patents for, for Android.  Right. You know, when you compare DNA and fusion,  they had been making a significant amount of money over the years. I mean, a billion dollars  a year from Samsung alone on their patent licensing for, for those. So giving that up was,  I mean, you know, a real demonstration of a commitment to, to this, you know, this open

Start time: 2337.26
End time: 2344.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  source stuff. Yeah. It feels like companies want to keep proprietary what makes them money  and then open source everything that makes their competition money. That seems like the winning

Start time: 2344.74
End time: 2531.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  strategy. Totally. It's kind of like the Microsoft thing is kind of like, and it is, it is relevant  to the IBM red hat story. You know, it's like in the new Star Trek discovery, there's the guy who's  a Starfleet officer, who's actually a Klingon underneath, but you know, so, so that's kind of  like what it's like a complete DNA and fusion. But today's Microsoft is essentially a Linux  company, especially on the server, because all of this stuff is the backbone of the internet. It's  the backbone of the enterprise and you know, these tools and open source technology and software  runs the world. And so for IBM, as they said, you hit the nail on the head, Leo, like they mentioned  cloud four times in the one sentence. This is all about them trying to compete and get a leg up  any way they can against Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. Amazon and Microsoft have really been  kind of running away, especially Amazon with the cloud market. Google's playing catch up. They've  been trying to use price and AI machine learning as their way to, to pick off some of these cloud  deals. And they have been somewhat successful, but still, you know, Amazon's the 800 pound gorilla.  Microsoft is the number one challenger. Google's trying to, you know, elbow its way in. And IBM  has been trying unsuccessfully to sort of be the fourth wheel there. And they needed something like  this to help them push forward. And Red Hat is interesting because they've been rumored to have  been an acquisition target of Oracle, of Microsoft, of, of Google especially. And now it's happened  with, with IBM. And so they are a huge company and they, to Ed's point earlier, they are very much a,  a cloud services, IT integrator kind of company anymore, not really a Linux company.  They're not a Linux company. Okay.  No, no. And so it's not a Linux distribution, you know, anymore. It's, it really is. It's funny  because even during the dot com boom, the moment that the dot com boom that we kind of all,  or I think a lot of us scratch our heads was the moment. And I thought about this when the story  broke, the moment that Red Hat actually was worth more than IBM in value, its market capitalization  was a moment we all kind of went, yeah, this is probably getting a little bit out of control.  And that wasn't long afterwards that the dot com bust happened. So it is somewhat ironic,  you know, that was one of the pivotal moments of the dot com boom. It is funny that these two  companies are now paired up, you know, 20 years later almost, and trying to make a go at Amazon  and Google and Microsoft as, as the big companies that are going to control the next generation of  the internet and the enterprise, unless, you know, IBM can disrupt them. And IBM, you know,  they have the got their work cut out for them, even with this acquisition.

Start time: 2531.78

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Although I have to say, and this is really unfair, and I don't mean this to be as cruel  as it is probably going to sound, but it does in some ways remind me of the merger of Kmart and  Sears. Oh, holy cow. Well, I know that's, I know that's really harsh and, and, and all, but both  of those companies, you know, when they merged had, they had been successful for years in their,  in their field. They had struggled as other companies leapfrog them and, and they, you know,  they dropped in the, in the rankings in their, in their segment. And, you know, Jason, like you say,  you know, you've got AWS and then you have Azure and then you have a big long gap before you get  to, you know, Google and IBM and, and, you know, Salesforce, Oracle, anybody else who's going to  be in there with a, with a cloud product. And I just, and I just wondered that, you know, that  there's a, there's always a temptation for two smaller companies to combine and say, we're going  to, you know, we're by combining, we'll be big enough to be a credible competitor. But if they  didn't, if, if it's not, if it's not a good fit, if it's not a good fit, culturally, technologically,  product wise, then what you do is you magnify your problems instead of, of,  instead of magnifying your opportunities.

Transcript:  Tim Cynova Boy, the analogy to K Martin Sears is pretty stunning. I mean, that was an 11 billion  dollar merger, two failing retailers who were desperately trying to stay current in a, this was

Start time: 2654.86
End time: 2698.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  back in 2004. Yeah. The one way this one looks better though is that they were in a market where  retail was drastically dropping. In this case, you know, 10% of the world, 10% of enterprises today  are all cloud by 2025. That's likely to be 80%. And so even these two together, if they can find  a niche where it's like, we're really good at hybrid cloud or we're really good at hospitals,  where they can find one segment of the cloud market that they can serve better than anybody  else in a market that's growing this big over the next decade. They could survive and even  thrive if they, if they can do that and do it well. It does seem like a kind of a premium. I mean,

It was, uh, the tone that he was setting in the management of  probably the single most important open source project in the world. Um, and he was, you know,  frankly cruel and dismissive character, uh, to a lot of people. And I think, you know, and,  and people pointed that out. Linux, the whole Linux project did a whole new code of conduct  and he went away for 36 days and, um, and then came back saying, I've, I've learned things.

Transcript:  to the. Now there, there was an article that said that in 1999, Red Hat Linux, um,  presented Torvalds with stock options and gratitude for, you know, the work he did.  So he had a big day today. That would be, he might have if they, you know, if they, um, uh, you know,  if he stuck with those stop options, stuck options and hasn't already sold them, like my guess is he  probably still has some, I would be surprised if he didn't still have some of those. That's some,  good. I hope that's pretty awesome. I'd love to see some money going. Yeah. You know, you have to,  I think the great thing about his story and ultimately, you know, they Red Hat for better  or worse has been known as the, you know, flagship Linux company, even though that we said they've,  they've grown and are far larger than just Linux itself. Um, you know, you still have to,  to think that in one sense, this is sort of a victory for a very public kind of victory for  open source and it's, it's journey. Um, and, and to Torvalds, you know, he created this, uh, he  started this as a college student and, uh, you know, welcomed others to build on his work. And,  and he, he did, he changed the world. He did something amazing that has made the technology  world, um, a better, more open, uh, place. And, and so you kind of have to tip your hat to him

Start time: 2991.32
End time: 3024.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  for it. His timing was singular too, because he did this in 91 when the internet was starting  to emerge and the idea of collaborative, you know, global, uh, uh, coding was brand new, but boy,  it couldn't have been a better time. And of course the, I gotta point out one more thing,  which is that Linus wrote Git. So now that Microsoft owns GitHub for God knows how many  billions of dollars, I swear to God, this guy, we talk about Elon Musk a lot, maybe Linus Torvalds.  He changed the world. Yeah. Literally changed the world. He should get a little more credit.

He's, he's, uh, so, you know, um, and, and there's been lots of people,  lots of imperfect people that have done, you know, amazing things and as will be the case for the  rest of the life on our life on this planet.

You know, one of the most famous  things it's, it's kind of not taught much in any more, but for, you know, 150 years or so,  it was a very well known, very widely, uh, taught one of the most published things in American  history was Washington's farewell addressed. And it's essentially a, um, it's, it's, it's  could be more timely. I know it couldn't be more timely. Oh my gosh. So it's all about, um, it's a,  it's a, it's in one sense, a very gentlemanly polemic against partisan politics. Um, but it  deals also with, um, foreign policy very, you know, um, closely, uh, and talks about the,  the tone of our dialogue, you know, even as well. So you, you couldn't find something that's more  of an antidote to, you know, the, to what you read and see every day, uh, you know, in the news.

I just got, I watched on a, I think it was at HBO or Showtime, Benedict Cumberbatch  in Patrick Melrose. And then I found out that it's actually a biographical true story as crazy  as that sounds. Um, and I got the entire Patrick Melrose novels. This is not for the young,  but it is hysterical. Nevermind bad news, some hope mother's milk and at last all five novels  in one 27 hour audio book. And I am truly enjoying it very well written too. It's a  Showtime, I guess five part, uh, series on Showtime. Uh, let's see here, moving along  back to the tech news. The president. Yeah. You just laugh when I say that. Don't you?  The president, according to the New York times has three phones, all three of them,  iPhones. Two of them are carefully modified to be secure by the secret service. One for instance,  only has wifi. The third is a stock iPhone, which according to the times the president keeps because  it has his contact list on it. And that's the one he uses to make phone calls. And according to the  New York times, it's the one the Chinese and Russians are, are hoping he'll use cause they can

What? So there I feel better. It actually is good. Actually as much as if you're going to send to  one country in the world, send it to Germany. Exactly. Um, I really liked the P 20 and they  have a new one, the mate pro 20, which is just spectacular phone. Uh, but they can't get it sold  in the United States because the commerce department basically went to Verizon and I can't remember,  was it AT&T and said, you know, it would be a mistake for you to carry this phone.

The other favorite detail in that story for me was that  they found that I think if I'm recalling this correctly, that he was going into the situation  room alone to make phone calls because, you know, that nobody would be able to, you know,  nobody would be able to monitor them. And I don't know, you know, what is he trying to call David  Pecker and say, you know, where are the tapes? Where, you know, are they still in the safe?

So, you know, who knows? We know he tweets from an iPhone.  Like cigarettes. He just can't quit the habit.  Can't quit the habit. The question I'm probably, you know, on a lot of people's minds who read this  is, well, wait a minute. I thought the iPhone was secure. Renee, how would, if you were the  Chinese government or the Russian government or, I don't know, anybody on the street who wanted to  listen in on the president's phone calls because they got to be good, how would you go about doing

Transcript:  phone on, for any means, any government thing. So Wired, Lily Hay Newman and Wired had an article  on, well, how would this work? One thing we know is there's stingrays all over Washington.  Some of them run by national intelligence agencies. Some of them, we don't know who they're  run by. Those are fake cell towers that can intercept phone calls and impersonate cell towers.  They're like man in the middle attacks, but for cell phones.  Yep. There's also the issue of SS7 and she goes into this in great detail. SS7 is the broad,  baseband software that's basically in all phones. And it was invented in 1975 and is laden with  issues and has been hacked multiple times. And that would be another venue, another avenue. In  fact, probably what you'd do is do both. Right? Yep. So I think you have to think,

Start time: 3914.78
End time: 4007.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to give the security community the benefit of the doubt here because there are a  lot of really smart people that have served on multiple administrations that have been  working on this stuff for a long time. And if this is the case, if this report's right,  I have to believe that the moment he came in that they, for example, maybe swapped out that  SIM card with some super encrypted, different kind of SIM cards. Yeah, yeah, you're not using  that anymore. Maybe they even swapped out the iPhones themselves and have versions that they've...  They look alike. Yeah. Sure, this looks like it  felt, but they've swapped out the radios in it or something. Right? So for all that he knows,  he's using an iPhone, but it's a different device a bit on the inside. I just think they've been  working on this problem. And for a long time, I'm sure that when Obama walked in, they told him and  they showed him like, look, we've got everything you've been doing. You think you're secure?  We can show you that we've gotten all of your messages. There've been some sort of reports to  that effect that showed how insecure it was. And that was at the time the most secure phone you  could get straight off the streets. So if this is the case, I don't think it's a case of utter  incompetence on the part of the security community. I think that they likely have that thing locked  down one way or another. Yeah, my God, I hope so. In 2016, President Obama...

Start time: 4018.31

Transcript:  Most of those people in Washington, like the DOJ and Secret Service and all of that,  99% of the people that work in those agencies are professionals that work there and have worked  there for a long time. They tend to have people tend to be in those jobs for a long, long time.  And such a small percentage of them are political appointees, and they're a bit  firewalled from the rest of what really happens. They're more public spokespeople.

Transcript:  Opsec professionals who are doing something. Yeah. Meanwhile, according to Vox, the midterms  are already hacked. You just don't know it yet. We had last week, Dan Patterson on, who's done a  really great thing for CBS on election hacking or 10-piece thing for CBS radio news, a similar  article quoting an investigation into the US election system showing, according to Vox,  frightening vulnerabilities at almost every level. The good news is, and Dan referred to this, is  that we have such a heterogeneous voting system that it's really county by county. And so it'd be  very hard to do kind of a mass hack. The other side of that equation is the nature of electoral  politics in this country is that it doesn't take that many votes to sway an election one way or

Start time: 4138.88
End time: 4173.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the other. And in the right place. In the right place. That's what really matters. The 2016  election was pretty much came down to roughly 80,000 votes in a handful of small regions in four  states, you know, sort of clustered around the Great Lakes. You don't need to bus in people to  pull the lever using fake IDs. All you need to do is either change a few votes or suppress a few votes

Start time: 4174.84
End time: 4285.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  in a few key areas. Yeah. So we did a seven part series on Tech Republic where we went to  states and we talked to them because a lot of this is handled not at the federal level, right? At the  state level, there's a big federal grant that was given out and the states could apply for that money.  And then so our series looked at what the states have actually been doing to secure the 2018 midterms  over the past two years. So we've got Illinois, we've got Florida, we've got Ohio, West Virginia,  which is using blockchain and experiment with blockchain as probably many people have heard  about Washington and a couple others. Pennsylvania, which is going back to paper. And we talk about in  this series, the steps that are being done, the ways that they're changing auditing, the ways that  paper is being used to back up votes, and the ways that they're using resources that they have at  their disposal, like in many cases, universities where they have university experts in cyber  security, or in some cases even their military, like their national guard and folks like that,  where they have cybersecurity experts and they're bringing them in to consult and make sure the  elections are locked down. So I think if you read that seven part series on Tech Republic,  you'll feel a little bit better about the people that are trying to do this in really smart ways.  Actually, the one that's been using some really smart ways to attack this for a long time is  Colorado, and we also have them in the series as well. So be confident that there are smart people  working on this problem. It doesn't mean that it's going to be foolproof, but they are serious and  they have been seriously working on this for a couple of years, and it's not perfect, but they

Start time: 4285.92
End time: 4334.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  have made a lot of progress since 2016. And of course, it's not just the US. In fact,  the Brazilian election is over now. As of today, the far right evangelical, Jair Bolsonaro,  is now president of Brazil. And there is definitely an internet component and interesting article on  BuzzFeed News today about that. But that's politics. I won't get too far into politics.  However, let's talk about this one. And this is the story that just keeps on giving. We're  talking about the Bloomberg super micro Chinese hack story. Now Amazon has pulled its ads from  Bloomberg and sources say, according to Joseph Bernstein at BuzzFeed, both Amazon and Apple are  taking retributive measures against Bloomberg. Apple did not invite Bloomberg to its event.

Start time: 4334.96
End time: 4345.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh no. He's not the one who reported that, but he wasn't going to get invited anyway, I suspect.  He's been to all the most recent Apple events. Yeah, he's been to every one of them since he

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  went to Bloomberg. Well, I wonder if he's not going. And Amazon pulling ads from Bloomberg.  You've dealt with this, Ed Bott, I'm sure. And I remember that Ziff Davis had a very good and  admirable policy for years not to give in to this kind of blackmail from companies over advertising.

Start time: 4365.16
End time: 4491.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Access journalism. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, the firewall between advertising and editorial is there.  And so advertisers are free to pull their ads. And they did. I mean, I remember that they did.  And I cannot remember a single time that we were ever told to change our coverage.  That being said, this story is so far off the rails of anything I have ever seen. I've never  seen a story where all of the primary subjects of it are denying in the most unequivocal terms.  There's no weasel words. There's no, oh, well, they left out this thing there. So that leaves  the possibility that maybe they're hiding this thing in there. I mean, unequivocal denials,  sources who are backing down from the gist of the story and saying, we don't support the gist of the  story. And even people in the government who are saying, we've looked at this and we can't find  any evidence of this. And Bloomberg is the thing that I find just baffling about this is that  Bloomberg is simply saying, well, we stand behind our story rather than saying, OK,  we didn't want to have to do this. But this is where if you're really good investigative reporters,  you have a suitcase full of documents and you bring the suitcase in and you open it up and you  pull these things out and they land on the table with a satisfying thunk. And then you start  going through them and explaining why you wrote the story you did. And the fact that Bloomberg  has not mounted a defense of this story just confounds me.

Start time: 4492.38

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't. It doesn't pass the smell test. This was starting to get to where it doesn't pass the smell  test. I agree with Ed. It feels like they should be more vigorously defending it or saying, look,  we want to make sure the truth comes out. We're about telling the truth and that's our job. And  we're going to make sure we do it right. And so we're going to go back and look at these sources  again and dig deeper and we'll let you know what we find out kind of thing.

The other,  there was a story that he said that the NSA, I'm trying to remember what the details of it were,  but the NSA had done something and no one else could confirm it, but it was never proven wrong  either. So I doubt that Bloomberg management, their editor in chief who was very respected,  and they'd worked on this for two years, I doubt that they would kind of let this guy make a big  mistake or lie. I just don't understand the deal. The story that I've heard and it's like sort of

Start time: 4576.54
End time: 4600.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

It wasn't, does this make, like he didn't go out and interview  people and say, what is happening? He's like, does like everything he heard was, can I use this to  corroborate this really compelling story that I want to get published? And when you hear bits

And so the one possible explanation  that I've heard, and it's pure speculation, there's no evidence for this, but then again,  there's no evidence for the story itself, is that this was a disinformation, is that the possibility  that this is a disinformation campaign- From the US government.

It's sort of like what Andy said on Macbreak, where like you'd think by now,  someone else would have talked, like someone in the investigation, someone else who'd heard this,  some other, like the New York Times is investing huge, like other outlets are spending a fortune  trying to find whether they can prove or disprove this.

He's no longer, I think, the richest man in the world.  He's only number two, but that's okay. He had to have it to lose it, Leo.  And you know what? It'll probably go right back up. One of the things I learned from this though,  is how much money Amazon's making on advertising, online advertising. That is a huge business for  Amazon, one that you wouldn't really expect. And by the way, they are kind of profitable.

This is now seven, eight, nine quarters in a row  of profitability after years and years and years of being criticized as a company that was just  always plowing whatever profits it made back into the business, investing in infrastructure  and investing in what turned out to become AWS. But nobody really sort of grok that at the time.  But after all those years, they're now delivering a steady profit every single quarter.

Transcript:  Poor Jason. Our show today brought to you by Betterment, a better way, the smart way to  manage your money. Betterment is the largest independent online financial advisory designed  to help customers build wealth, plan for retirement and achieve their financial goals. If you are  saving and you should be saving, whether it's for college or for a house or for retirement,  you've got to put your money somewhere. You can't put it in a savings account these days.  That's not going to go anywhere. So how do you invest? I think a lot of geeks, a lot of us say,  oh, we can do it ourselves and then put the money somewhere and just forget about it for years and  you don't know what's happening. This has been a tough year in the market. That's why  you need a little help. You need Betterment. Betterment uses technology to help you make  more from your investments. And actually you can really take advantage of Betterment when the  market's down because they can do then tax loss harvesting and give you a tax benefit  that kind of offsets the losses. It's things like that. They're trading  instantaneously on your behalf. There are no hidden costs. You pay a low transparent management  fee and the transactions are, you do not get charged for transactions. They do that all  within the fee. They're a fiduciary. This is really important. In fact, you should ask anybody who  gives you advice, are you a fiduciary? They make recommendations in your best interest. They are  not incentivized to recommend certain funds. They don't have their own investment products  to sell, but you do get unlimited expert device that's tailored to you exactly. Betterment gives  you constant access to information and tools that allow you to track progress towards your goals.  You'll feel smart. You will. And you can take advantage of down markets and up markets.  Investing involves risks. I'm not saying it doesn't, but our listeners can get up to one  year managed free right now if you go to betterment.com slash Twitter. Betterment.com  slash Twitter. Betterment outsmart average.  It's been a bad couple of weeks for Microsoft. Windows 10, 1809. I don't even know what to say.  There is no question that the worst kind of bug you can have in an operating system is one that  deletes data by accident. That's what's happened to Microsoft. Not once, but twice now. And here's  Ed Bott writing about it. He says, worst Windows 10 version ever. Microsoft's terrible, horrible,  no good, very bad October. A lot of people are speculating why this is happening. Ed,  do you have an opinion on this? Does this have something to do with the way Microsoft develops

Transcript:  Windows? I don't think that was, you know, Peter Bright wrote a really good article  in Ars Technica about this and everyone should read that. It's long and it's technical, but I

Start time: 5171.84
End time: 5208.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  think he gets at a few points. His premise is that when you did a new version of Windows every three  years, you could do it in a kind of a waterfall method that really involved planning a short  period of development, testing and release, but that it's not working as well in the shorter  timeframes of the dual yearly releases. And Microsoft fired all the professional testers  and basically has relied, it seems, on the Windows Insiders program, which is, you know,  you're getting people who are not professional testers. And so the testing has been somewhat

Start time: 5208.24
End time: 5485.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  helped. So it's slightly more complicated than that. And so my thesis in this article is, you  know, there's a great management principle, really important management principle. What gets  measured gets done, right? And what Microsoft has done with Windows 10, and they caught a lot of  flak of, unjustifiably, in my opinion, on privacy issues because of all the monitoring diagnostic  feedback technology that they built into Windows 10. What that's given them is the ability to look  in real time at these dashboards as software is installed, as drivers are installed, as people  use the product, as they, you know, open the start menu and, you know, do all the things that you do.  Microsoft calls it telemetry. In fact, that's that stuff that's sending back to the home office all  the time, right? And so they have become so obsessed with telemetry that that has become the  metric that they use for everything. And so they can, so when they see a problem, they say, you  know, well, you know, on our telemetry dashboards, we see that blue screens are down, you know, 35%  and driver problems are down 17% and the start menu is opening 17 seconds faster, 17% faster,  and so on and so on and so on. The trouble is that the problems that they've been encountering  throughout the month of October, and there are a few other ones here as well, are the kind of things  that you're not going to see in telemetry. And they basically require, so let me see if I can  very briefly explain the killer bug that caused them to pull the software four days after they  released it, which is, you know, kind of unheard of. If you had relocated your documents and videos  and music folders to a different drive using the built-in feature, Windows 10, all versions of  Windows for that, you said, I want this on the D drive instead of the C drive. And so you click  that thing. But if you left the original folder on the C drive, the installer program said, oh,  okay, we're, you know, you've relocated your personal files. And so therefore, anything that's  in the original location is junk and we're just going to get rid of it during the process of  upgrading to this new version. And that's not the way that a lot of people had done this. They had  files in two different places. That's the kind of thing telemetry is never going to tell you  that that happened. And this was reported by bug testers, by bug testers, by amateur testers in  the Windows Insider program. They had been reporting this sporadically for several months,  but non-professionals don't write good bug reports. And so these things never rose  to the level of urgency that an engineer needed to see them. And back to your point, Leo, yes,  when they got rid of the dedicated testers, the things that dedicated testers do in a situation  like this is they start testing edge cases. You know, the developer says, I wrote this product  to do this feature and here's how it was designed and it works as designed. And a good tester says,  what happens if I do this? Why would you do that? I'm an end user. And do crazy things.  End users do, you know, off the wall things for whatever reason they have for doing those things.  But that's my thesis of why this happened is that they didn't have processes in place to  effectively identify these kind of edge cases. So the bottom line is they do have, Windows 10 is,  I think, verifiably more reliable and more performant than any previous version of Windows.  And yet that is because of the system that they built that allowed some of these weirdo bugs to  slip through and they only affect a small number of people. But it really hurts if you're one of  the people who got affected by this. Yeah, data deletion is pretty severe.

Start time: 5488.28
End time: 5548.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, that is as bad as it gets. I guess the only thing worse is not running at all,  but at least you don't lose your data. Right.  Leo, again, like all this stuff is so complicated. It's complicated, but at the same time,  it feels to me like we've gotten pretty good at software engineering and making reliable software.  I know how complicated Windows is, but it seems to me it's a tooling problem. You don't fire your  testers. That's nuts. You have tooling and a system that tests everything as you're going.  I think Bright's not far off when he says, waiting till you finish development to start  testing is wrong. I mean, there's some simple things that I feel like Microsoft could work on.  And adding this box to the insider program, how does this problem impact your experience?  That's worthless. Every bug is severe if you use this box. It's just dopey.

Transcript:  That's the thing. Apple had a very bad month of its own when it had a bunch of really bad,  rude exploits, and they had a bad year. And they realized that they were doing similar to what Ed  said. They were testing for crashes are way down, and these apps are launching faster.  But it turned out a lot of people found frustrators in volume just as bad as crashes,  and they didn't really have metrics on that. And that's what led to a lot of the performance-based  rewrites that we've gotten this year. And I always think really bad things are going to happen. Yes,  they may have made a mistake with the testers. So for me, it's always how a company responds  to those things. There are companies that respond terribly to these kinds of things,  and companies that respond really well to them. And Microsoft, when you say a few percentage of  users, when you're at Apple or Microsoft or Google scale, that's still hundreds of thousands,  if not millions of people. Yeah, Microsoft said only one percent,

Start time: 5594.38

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 5597.86
End time: 5636.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  lost it. At Windows scale, yeah. Yeah. Right. Yeah. And you know, it's just a lot of it goes back to,  you know, the desktop is and, you know, computers are not flashy. It's not a growth market. And so  these companies are managing them for profit, right? They're putting fewer and fewer resources,  the minimal resources they can possibly put against it that they can. You know, we've seen  it with with Mac and we've seen with Windows. I was it I was at Microsoft campus last year,  and I was amazed. I was there for three days. I didn't hear the word Windows one time. Yeah.

Start time: 5636.82
End time: 5650.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like Google not saying the word Android in its product.  Kids are going off to college and have kids and have settled down. You know,  they don't give them the attention that they used to. Well, I think there's more than that.  I think Mary Jo Foley referred to this. I think they don't want to be thought of as a Windows

Start time: 5650.22
End time: 5767.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  company as much. They definitely. Oh, they've and they've removed Windows from the branding  of a lot of their of their corporate. It used to be Windows Azure. Now it's Microsoft Azure.  You know, and and that's deliberate. They want to be going, you know, they want that branding  to be there because Windows is a is a shrinking part of the larger population of devices,  especially mobile devices in there. But I think there's a there's a there's a second problem  as well. I called it out in a in a different column where I said, I think,  to two feature updates a year is too many to updates a year is too many.  And and here's the here's the problem. Every time you do an update, whether it's to your iPhone  or your Android or your Windows PC or your Mac, every time you do a major upgrade there, no matter  how conscientiously the developers have designed it and how well they have tested it, you have  you're changing the state of a whole bunch of parts of the device and you're introducing  the opportunity for something to go wrong. And the thing that could go wrong could be  someone else's fault. It's a it's a driver from a third party company or it's a  defective piece of hardware or whatever. But when you're doing that every six months,  when you're doing this, you know, this big refresh, you're just introducing an opportunity  for bad things to happen, even if they're not your fault. And and if my PC breaks,  if my iPhone breaks because you gave me an update, I, you know, I'm going to call you.  And when you tell me, well, it's not our fault, I'm not going to accept that.

Transcript:  Yeah. Both. It's a worry point. You know, both both Mac and Windows. And look,  as a publication, we love when they do new versions because people want to know,  right? What are the new features? And it is it's something to talk about. And it's interesting.  But from a user standpoint, it's really it's it's really out of date. What about think about  Chromebook, right? That's much more. There's much less to change with Chromebooks, let's be honest.  But when do they announce, oh, yeah, a new version of Chrome OS is going to be released. Never. They  never talk about it. You just restart the thing once in a while and it automatically,  you know, has some new features. And sometimes they talk a little bit about the new features. But  really, that's more the future model of where this stuff is going to go. And it makes a lot  more sense. We see it in our own site. You know, we used to do these big redesigns. And inevitably,  every time we did a redesign, we would lose at least like five percent of our users because they  were like, you moved something and I can't find it or something would break. And, you know, finally,  I just was like, we're not doing any more redesigns. We're just going to incrementally add  and get better. And when there's big features, we'll announce it. We'll let people know we  gave you something new or whatever. And it works so much better. And we don't have these big moments  where we moved somebody's cheese or we broke something that was really important to them.  We rarely, rarely, rarely ever have those kinds of things anymore because we just go incrementally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  business. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there's some historical debate about how close they were  to that, but basically it was an unsustainable path that they were on. And so having Steve Jobs buy  next and then bringing him and next back into the company and turning next into OS 10 was,  it wasn't disrupt yourself before someone else does. It was disrupt ourself because the  we're heading towards a brick wall. OS 9 is not the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to in 25 years, I don't think we're going to just be talking about operating systems anymore. I think  that it won't matter. I think some of it, it will be, there will be layers in between, you know,  operating systems that will unify things. You're already seeing that in the cloud world where,  you know, you actually, your infrastructure works on both Amazon and runs on both Amazon and Azure,  sometimes also Google too. But you have a layer above that where, you know, that essentially  functionally, you know, things are running on and to the user, it doesn't matter. And I think  operating systems are going to be that way. It's going to fade further and further into the  background. And that's one of the reasons the companies aren't, you know, they don't pay a  lot of lip service to them anymore. I think they would like them to move more into the background.  I think even within a decade is possible. Maybe even five, within five to 10 years, I think you'll  see Windows and Mac both go more to the Chrome OS model of these sort of incremental updates.  The funny thing is Microsoft intellectually, or at least conceptually was there when they announced  Windows XP, right? Because the Windows XP, the original launch, the original pitch of Windows  XP is we're going to get out of the operating system business. We're going to, you're going to  buy this, you know, you'll buy it sort of a subscription and we'll give you updates continually.  And we're going to stop with these big releases. That was in 2001. And, but there was such a  backlash from the people who still loved and thought of their computer as the operating system  that they had to backpedal from that. And eventually they kind of threw up their arms, but,  you know, they, this idea has been around for a long time and I think we're just sort of at the  end of the cycle for the operating system. And it's days aren't, you know, in terms of being a  thing that we think about and talk about, and it's part of what we think about for computers.  Now there's going to be still new features and we're going to be talking about new features that  are introduced just in the same way we do in the app world and iOS world. And when there's new  Android world, when there are new things that are announced and like Google maps has done this year,  an amazing amount of new features, right? And every time there's a new feature, it just kind  of will slowly trickle it out to a certain number of users. And then somebody gets wind of it and  they start talking about it, you know, as, because they were part of the AB test where it went out  to whatever 10%, 20% of users. We're going to still be talking about features, but we're not  going to be talking about these big OS upgrades. I think the days are definitely numbered.

Transcript:  It was 2001, but I think it was the same year that the iPod came out. And you go back and you read  the reviews of the iPod. I did this a few years ago and I think I wrote an article about it.  You go back and you read the reviews of the iPod and people just laughed at it. It was this big,  clunky thing and it has a hard drive in it. How are they going to sell music and put it on it?  And it's only for the Mac. Nobody has Macs. And yet, arguably, OS 10 was an important product  and everything. But the iPod is the... Big disruptor.  The primogenitor of all the smartphones and all the mobile technology that we have today. It all  goes back to there. And yet, it was sort of laughed at as an expensive toy that,  is this really going to be a big thing? And yet, relentlessly innovating and developing  and turning it into tablet and smartphone and all of that. And that's how disruption works.  So yeah, we're not going to be using the technology that we have now. In 30 years,  people are going to look back at movies from this time and kids are just going to jiggle.

Transcript:  We're going to take a little break and come back with the silly stories of the week and another  Pokemon Go story that's very good news. But first, I want to tell you how you can take your Wi-Fi  and make it all better again. And I know because I did it. In just a few minutes,  it's the IRO. This is an enterprise-grade Wi-Fi system you can install in under 10 minutes. You  just download the IRO software, put it on your phone, unplug your cruddy old router and plug in  this IRO and the phone will walk you through it, attaching additional IRO beacons if you need it  through the home. This is a distributed system. This is what we've had for years, offices have  had for years. Now you can have it in your home and it solves the problem of bad Wi-Fi.  Wi-Fi isn't any different. It's just that we're using it more. Our neighbors are interfering with  us more. We have... How many devices do you have using Wi-Fi in your house? It used to be maybe  one laptop. Now, I have now at last count 62 different devices in my home that are on the  Wi-Fi network between Amazon Echoes, my doorbell. I mean, it just goes on and on and on. Everything's  on the Wi-Fi, but IRO can handle it. The IRO app lets you manage your network from the palm of your  hand. In fact, that's how I know how many devices I have connected. It also gets the internet speed.  I love the IRO app. And IRO Plus, which is really nice, is fantastic. IRO Plus is... In fact,  I'll show you because I have IRO Plus. I subscribe to it and I love it. We have five IROs in the house.  IRO Plus... So you can see everything looks good. There's the five IROs. Here's the bandwidth,  the recent bandwidth test. I could take a look at the IRO Plus settings. Look at all the stuff I get  for free, by the way, with IRO Plus. 13,000 sites were inspected this week. I can go back to the  previous month as well as I want. In fact, through October, a million 85 sites that we went to in the  house inspected. The good news is they didn't have to do any threat blocks this week. There were a  few in weeks past. These were malicious malware that was blocked, spyware that was blocked, botnets,  phishing attacks that were blocked, content filters. I have those turned on for our 15-year-old  and it will protect him. Advanced security, even ad blocking. I love... And this is all part of the  router. The IRO is fantastic. Guest access. I like it so much I installed it at my mom's house because  she was having problems as well. This IRO automatically will tag sites that contain violent,  illegal, or adult content. You can choose what your kids can and cannot see. And you can do that in  the app. I can even say to my Amazon Echo, Echo, pause Michael's internet if, you know, he acts up  and it turns off his internet. Not mine. I still can surf. I can still play Pokemon Go, but he's  got to go to bed now. Oh, Michael. IRO and IRO Plus provides complete protection for your network,  your devices, and all of those who use them as they connect to the internet. And I love that.  Make your Wi-Fi work again with the best router, IRO. IRO also, and this is really important for  any device that goes on the internet, automatically updates. You not only get the latest features,  but the latest in security at all times. WPA3, yep, they just said we'll be doing it. It'll be  a software update on the IRO router. Things like that. It's really nice to know. IRO is taking care  of you at all times. I am a huge fan of IRO. Life's too short for bad Wi-Fi. Right now,  just get $100 off the IRO base unit and two beacons package. $100 off. And this is the best offer  we've ever had. A year of IRO Plus. And all you have to do is go to IRO, E-E-R-O, IRO.com slash  twit, and enter the offer code twit at checkout. If you've been waiting, if you've heard me talk  about how much I love our IRO and look at all the stuff you get with IRO Plus, this is the best  offer we've ever offered. This is great. $100 off the base unit and two beacons. That's what you want  pretty much. We have five, but most people, three is good. That's $100 off and a year of IRO Plus.  I think that's worth 99 bucks. ERO.com slash twit. Enter the code twit at checkout. It's just  transformed. I got so tired of Lisa saying the Wi-Fi now and again. I had to get the IRO.  She actually, you know how she got me to do it. She said, I'm going to have John, Russell, and  Burke come and fix our Wi-Fi. But, but, but, but, but, but, you're married to the tech guy. But,  but, but, but. That's when I got the IRO. At least it wasn't Manny, Moe, and Jack.  I'm getting those Starbucks people. John, Russell, and Burke. She says, all I have to do is give them  a free dinner and they'll do it. I said, I want that dinner. It cured the problem. Let me tell you.  All right. Couple of weird stories. How about this? This is a painting that sold at Christie's at  art auction. It's a painting called Edmond de Bellamy from La Famille de Bellamy by the French  art collected Obvious painted entirely by artificial intelligence after looking in machine  learning a bunch of classic paintings. And, and this sold at Christie's. Are you ready for this?

So you've got this bag of, of, I have that burst  into paper and then it either bursts into flame or it disintegrates into a pile of ashes or,  you know, or dust or something. And, and, you know, and basically it just comes down to when  you're done, when you're done with it, there's this little compressed thing, you know, a little  ball that you can squeeze into, make a diamond out of it. The more you destroy it, the more it's worth.

Uh, and this is,  okay, I shouldn't end on a down note, but this kind of depressed me breaker, which is a, a, uh,  Bitcoin crypto site sent, uh, e-mails to a bunch of other crypto sites saying, uh, hey,  basically posing, I'm representing a blockchain PR company from Moscow.  And, uh, what I would like is for you to put coverage about my clients and have it not be  marked sponsored. Is that possible? And of the 22 outlets who replied conclusively, 12 of them  were willing to publish paid content without disclosing as such, which by the way is illegal  according to the FTC, but who's going to catch you in this country, in this country. And many  of these aren't probably, and just a word of warning, you know, we don't do paid content,  but you know, I have to say I get, and I'm sure you do too, uh, uh, solicitations every day from  people say we'd like to put something on your blog.

So if you, if you want to move this from the downer category to the absurd  category, uh, a few months ago, four or five months ago, I, uh, I changed my Twitter bio and  just for, just for, uh, grins, I put in something there about blockchain and it was a, I mean,  you are a Twitter master, Ed, I must say. Just a dumb joke. You know, I put in there, you know,  you know, my, I think the way it reads now is something like, you know, my blockchain can beat  your blockchain or something, something like that. But, uh, within days after I changed that bio,  I started getting, first of all, followers, uh, secondly, uh, email solicitations and direct  messages from people wanting to fly me to blockchain conferences to, uh, you know, uh,  offer exclusive stories about their blockchain product and everything. And so yeah, this is,  uh, changing my bio right now. It's just, uh, I mean, you want, you know, if, you know, Donald  Trump was really upset this week because he lost 2000 Twitter followers, two days in a row.

Transcript:  very hard to take Leo. I feel bad. I'm missing all the fun. It's all happening. Uh, all right,  I'm going to end with some upbeat stories. First, the copyright office has ruled that you have the  right to repair thanks to SORIC. Uh, Jay SORIC is of Cedia iPhone jailbreaking fame, uh, the  electronic frontier foundation. I fix it. Uh, Kyle Weins and his attorney Cynthia rep local  Corey, Dr. Oh, Kit Walsh and Mitch Stoltz from the electronic frontier foundation.  They filed a long brief. They went and they testified, uh, at 342 pages of background  information, the final ruling released and it's good news. The copyright office says you can now  jailbreak Alexa powered hardware and other similar gadgets. They call them voice assistant devices.  You can unlock new phones, not just used ones. There's an exemption for repair. This is because  the DMCA says you can't reverse engineer copy protection. They need all these exemptions.  There's an exemption for repair of smartphones, home appliances or home systems.  Repair of this is a huge one. Remember John Deere doesn't let you repair your tractor.  Repair of motorized land vehicles, including tractors by modifying the software is now legal.  This includes access to telematic diagnostic data, which was a major point of contention  and it's legal for third parties to perform repairs on the behalf of the owner.  So this is a big change. Thank you. The copyright office.  Yay. Yay. Uh, yeah, that's a win.  It's a big win. Uh, they did try a little more. They wanted a game console, uh,  repairs to be legal on the PS4 and Xbox one. That is not going to happen. Um, they also said that  it has to be products that are smartphones, home appliances or home systems or motorized land  vehicles, boat and airplane owners. You still can't reflare your boat and airplane.  And Bunny Wong and the EFF wanted to bypass HDCP, the, uh, HDMI copy protection.  And that was denied as well, but it's generally a win. And I, you know what, a lot of credit goes  to this group of people from the EFF and I fix it who worked so hard, a team of students from  Stanford's IP law clinic. Um, they were fighting the MPAA, the RIAA, the audio alliance, John  Deere of so many companies and they were good work. Good work. Good work. So you see,  we ended on a happy note. Yes. I'm going to try to shred my Banksy magnet. I don't think it'll work.  And thank you guys for being here. Uh, you're, when do you go to New York,  Renee Richie tomorrow? Yes, I, sir. I leave tomorrow. Have a great trip.  I'll be looking for you in the audience at the Berkeley Academy of Music,  Tuesday morning, bright and early, and we'll see you back on Mac break weekly,  a week from Tuesday. Thank you, Renee.
