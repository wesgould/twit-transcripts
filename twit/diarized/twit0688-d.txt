It's, I haven't, we haven't had you in ages.  Thank you for coming up and I appreciate you being here.  Yeah, thanks for having me.  It's always great.  I have some questions for you though  about Bloomberg Business Week.  And I just want you to know.  Anytime.  I defended Bloomberg Business Week all week long  and I had to.  Appreciate that.  We'll talk about that in a second.  Also here from All About Android,  Ron Richards.  Hi Ron.  Hey Leo, good to be back.  Nice to have you.  You might have a little something to talk about.  I guess Google released some stuff.  Big week.  Big week.  Big week for the Google.  And from Microsoft, she's senior cloud developer advocate,  but of course we love her as film girl  from formerly Mashable, Christina Warren.  Hey Christina.  Hey Leo, good to see you.  Wonderful to see you.  I love the bright pink purse I guess behind you.

People are like, oh there are boxes in the background.  No, this is great.  My husband did this, but I have this purse wall behind me.  So you can see my full collection of,  I didn't realize I had so many Kate Spade bags  until they were all in one place.  And I was like, oh.  That's nice.  I do have a lot.  Yeah.

Transcript:  We have much to talk about.  Actually it was really last week's story,  but as long as we got somebody from Bloomberg here,  I thought I'd ask about the Super Micro story,  which of course really galvanized people  late in the week, last week.  And we talked about it on all of our shows.  The story from Bloomberg that Super Micro,  which is an American company,  but manufactures its motherboards,  and they're very widely used in servers  not only all over the world,  but in the Department of Defense, Apple, Amazon.  Super Micro had been caught,  or one of its suppliers had been caught,  putting a surveillance chip on the motherboard.  This story by people you know, right?  Jordan Robertson.

Transcript:  Had 17 anonymous sources.  Seemed very well sourced.  We were talking before the show,  you have a brand new EIC there,  came from The Economist, who you said oversaw.  It's been a couple years, but yeah.  But he's very highly respected  in the industry.  And I've been saying all week long,  Bloomberg is so prestigious,  there's no way this is,  the only way you could say,  you'd have to say it was fabricated.  And there's no way that's possible.

Start time: 272.02
End time: 313.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We have nothing to gain by doing that  and everything to lose by either fabricating something  or even handling this irresponsibly.  We knew what a huge story this was  throughout the reporting,  which had been going for well over a year.  And spent months and months talking with the companies  and getting their denials and repeated denials  and doing more reporting.  And everything I know about the story  is that it's 100% solid,  but it's frustrating that we couldn't get anybody  to go on the record.  That's kind of like the nature of reporting  on topics of national security.

Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, look at what the Trump administration is,  they're a crackdown on leakers.  These people have nothing to gain  by putting their names on the record.  Our reporters had four very well-placed,  independent US officials who all said  Apple was specifically a target of this,  despite Apple saying it wasn't us,  Amazon saying it wasn't us.  The reporting was solid,  and at some point we just had to go  with what we knew to be true.

End time: 392.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It almost becomes, for the rest of us,  the unwashed masses, a they said, they said story,  because there's nothing to support it in either direction.  I completely agree, and I've said this,  I'm not saying it to you to kiss your butt,  but at Bloomberg Business Week,  you don't put this on the cover  unless you're absolutely sure.  But that raises the question,  how can Apple say, on this we can be very clear,  we've never found malicious chips,  we're unaware of any such investigation?  And many people on our shows said,  Apple is not the kind of company that would lie about this,  so now we've really got a conundrum.

Start time: 393.98
End time: 423.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, our reporting, not to my knowledge,  shows that Tim Cook was directly involved  in reporting this to government officials,  or that even their chief security officer  was involved in doing that,  but our reporters talked to company insiders  who were knowledgeable about the specifics of this attack,  and to government officials who were knowledgeable  of Apple being a victim of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To their credits, Jordan and Michael published  the statements from Apple, Amazon, Supermicro,  China denied it, the Department of Homeland Security,  and they kind of gave it a lukewarm denial,  saying, well, we currently don't think  that anything like this is going on.  Honestly, the real bottom line,  and the important thing that this story brought up,  is that this stuff does happen, we know it happens.  We don't know the specifics about Supermicro,  but you don't need to believe that it happened at Supermicro  to know that this happens all the time,  that the US does it as well as other governments,  that often it's done in transit,  not necessarily at the factory,  but some hardware hacks, hardware hacks happen,  because you want to target an attack,  as server hardware is on its way to a company in transit.  We know that happens, we know the NSA has done it,  it was part of the Snowden released materials,  the NSA has done that.

Start time: 480.50
End time: 541.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For the purpose of this reporting,  we had a mountain of evidence of the Supermicro attack,  and how prevalent it was, and how vulnerable they were  to something like this, but yeah,  I think the point that the security community,  who have been very skeptical about the story,  as many people have, but the point  that they've been trying to make is,  regardless of whether or not this is true,  it's a problem across the supply chain.  The supply chain is a black box to everybody.  Even the companies that put their logos on the products  have no idea many of the things that happen  in the supply chain, it's part of the reason why  we'll often find out about what's in the next iPhone,  because we've set up a system where everything is farmed out  to hundreds of different companies,  and anything can happen in between the time  that the components are manufactured,  to the time that they're assembled,  to the time that they make it to the states,  or wherever you live, and to your doorstep.

Start time: 542.98
End time: 598.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Brian Krebs, you saw we flashed it up briefly,  said that supply chain security is the whole enchilada,  but the problem is nobody's willing to pay for it.  We already save so much money by offshoring this stuff  that nobody's even thinking about bringing it back  to the United States.  Bruce Schneider's got a new book,  Push Button to Kill People, or something like that,  in which he talks about the fact that security,  at this point, has to be, in fact,  he wrote an op-ed in the New York Times,  that he said this has to be government regulation,  because no company is gonna spend the money  to properly secure its hardware.  With IOT on the horizon,  with self-driving cars on the horizon,  it becomes more than your computer's crashing  or they're stealing your credit card.  It becomes a serious problem,  and I don't know if we have either the will  or the ability to fix it.

Start time: 599.28
End time: 627.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Another important point to make on that  is another one of the conspiracy theories around the story,  because it does rely, to a large extent,  on government officials as the,  oh, this is part of the Trump popular push to bring.  Disinformation story, yes.  It's important to note that the reporting on this story,  and a lot of the evidence came  during the Obama administration,  and those conversations and the reporting continued  into the Trump administration.

Start time: 627.56
End time: 640.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what's fascinating.  This is a three-year story.  These guys have been working on this for some time.  Started in 2015.  So, yeah.  This isn't a push by the government  to bring manufacture back to the United States.  That's not gonna happen anyway.

Start time: 640.38
End time: 671.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it doesn't even necessarily need to happen  for at least part of this problem to be resolved.  I mean, a lot of companies could just take more responsibility,  more ownership over the process  by owning the factories in China  that manufactures these components  and owning the assembly plants,  or at least being more directly involved  in the process, whereas now it just goes to dozens  or hundreds of different vendors  who all have a piece in things,  and then it's assembled somewhere else.

Start time: 672.22
End time: 703.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In 2007, the Department of Defense initiated a program  with IBM called the Trusted Foundry Program,  specifically to address this supply chain issue,  to create trusted suppliers,  whether they're in the US or elsewhere,  to secure manufacturing infrastructure.  That was 11 years ago.  I don't know where the Trusted Foundry Program is today,  but we've seen this coming  as we've internationalized manufacture.  This has been coming.  So there's no question we've got a problem.

Start time: 705.62
End time: 774.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, the only thing I would say,  just like as somebody who's a complete outsider,  I'm kind of with Julio and so far,  I'm not ready to say that this is something  that didn't happen because knowing how journalism works  and having been a reporter for many years,  you don't put a story like this on your cover  unless you feel like all your boxes are checked.  But as a reader, there wasn't going to be,  there were lacking technical details.  And I think that is, maybe that's the wrong focus,  but I think that that's where a lot of the focus  has been on this because we don't know  what the technical details are  and what things might be right  or what things might be wrong because again,  it seems like most of these sources came from intelligence  and not necessarily from cybersecurity.  And so that's where I think this gets muddled,  but that might be focusing on the wrong things  because as you're saying,  whether this story is 100% accurate  or has been told the full way or not,  these supply chain issues, these black box issues,  these kind of accounted for threats,  our realities and our things that we should be realizing  are our reality and not something  we should just continue to ignore.

Start time: 775.40
End time: 816.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, we wrote this story for a general  kind of like business reader  and not so much for the security community.  Jordan has been covering cybersecurity for many, many years.  He knows the topic better than anyone I know.  I mean, he nerds out super hard on this stuff,  which is probably part of the reason why some of the sources,  the insiders at the companies in particular,  trusted him with this type of information  because they knew he understood the particulars.  So he will, if you get him on the show,  he would probably nerd out super hard  on all the specifics of it.  But for the purposes of the story that we were writing,  it's for a general audience.

Start time: 817.08
End time: 830.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was one of the criticisms though,  you're right, Christina, was, well, where's the detail?  Where's the detail?  That's not their job, that's not Bloomberg's job.  No, it's not.  So it's encouraging to hear from you, Mark,  that Jordan knew the detail.  It's just, it's not gonna make it in the story  because that's not the audience.

Start time: 831.44
End time: 886.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which is understandable,  but unfortunately with a story with this level of stakes,  it makes it hard for people,  especially when you have denials  and they're very well couched,  very well written legal denials,  it's hard for people to, I guess, do that.  And I guess maybe understand the extent of things.  And I've even said the same thing that you've said,  like Mark, it's written for a general audience,  I understand that, but I think that's why  some of the criticism has been so focused  on the technical details because,  regardless of what audience it's been written for,  not having those things there  leaves a lot of things open to interpretation.  And that lets people either off the hook  or start extrapolating things that may or may not be true.  And that's just, unfortunately,  the nature of these types of things  when you're writing for a specific audience  and you might not have those,  especially when you don't have people on the record,  how you get that across.

Start time: 886.44
End time: 975.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is, and the other thing that I think is true,  that if this really happened,  you're gonna see over time people step forward and say,  yeah, I have one of those motherboards, here's the chip.  Unless spooks have gotten to them all,  which also is possible.  There is some evidence,  there was a follow-up story this week,  both Jordan and Michael on this one as well,  of hacked super micro hardware found in US telecom.  And this came from a security expert named Yossi Appleboom,  who was brought in by this telecom.  He could not reveal the name of the telecom.  He was formerly with the Israeli Army Intelligence Corps.  And he's a hardware security guy.  He was brought in to scan data centers  belonging to this telecommunications company.  And Appleboom said, yeah, I've seen this before,  and I see it, and I did see this with super micro.  He says, though, that super micro is a victim,  but so is everybody else.  It's not super micro didn't do this on purpose,  and that doesn't surprise me,  that maybe one of the suppliers was suborned, bribed,  or forced into doing it.  So all the AT&T said, no, not us.  Verizon said, not us.  Sprint says, not us.  T-Mobile didn't respond.  Doesn't mean it's them.  But this is the kind of corroborating story  I'd expect to see more of over time.  And as people step forward and say, yeah, we found this,  that's gonna settle it as far as I'm concerned.

Start time: 977.00
End time: 997.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that was my main takeaway from the article,  just in both the specifics of that story,  as well as stories to come,  is that is this the tip of the iceberg?  And is now more proof comes out once the article's in place,  and then you let the people who are doing  the technical analysis, do the technical analysis,  and I've gotta imagine that this is not gonna be  the only type of story that comes out  of the supply chain that's going on in China.

Start time: 997.62
End time: 1025.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And there's just no question that the real,  the moral of the story is absolutely intact,  which is we have to secure the supply chain.  Because there's huge risks.  You know, that a state actor could use it for cyber warfare,  could use it for industrial espionage, or both.  And there's huge risks as we get more and more automated.  That was Bruce Schneider's point.  And we're moving into a world  where we're not gonna be driving the cars,  the computers are gonna be driving the cars.  And if they're hackable, that's a problem.

Start time: 1026.02

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I worked at an IoT company a couple years ago  that has a device that they literally designed themselves  and then brought the prototype to China  and showed it to a supply chain manager.  And they came back, they said,  yeah, we can make this for you.  They don't know what's in their device.  They don't know every chip that's in their device at all.  And they claim they designed it.  They didn't, you know, like there's so much gray area  in especially IoT, but in all the work  that's being done now in hardware and with China,  it's cheap for a reason, everyone.  I mean, like that's, you know, so it's-

Start time: 1056.20
End time: 1117.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We welcome that, we embrace that.  China became the world's manufacturing arm, right?  And it is actually powered huge innovation.  I mean, you can do exactly that, Ron.  You can come up with a great idea,  not know how to implement it.  It can be made and manufactured at scale, affordably.  By the way, whether Apple admits to this or not,  a lot of this can be attributed to Apple  because when they brought the iPhone to China,  they, and this is Tim Cook's expertise in supply chain,  they really created an amazing industrial capability  in Shenzhen, China.  And machines, specialized machines to do all sorts of things.  Those chips, the accelerometers, you know,  the barometers, all the different chips  in a smartphone today, you can really trace it back to 2007  when Apple created the iPhone  and started making this stuff at scale  and taught China how to make it at scale.  And as a result, we're getting all sorts of great stuff.  But we better secure it.

Start time: 1118.24
End time: 1124.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're getting great stuff in the short term.  I think for now we're finding out  what the long-term ramifications of this is gonna be.  Now here's the question.

Start time: 1125.43
End time: 1132.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't China risking its integrity and its future  as an industrial, as the manufacturer of the world by doing?  If they would do this.

Start time: 1133.27
End time: 1137.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But where are people gonna go?  I mean, what's the alternative?  Like we literally, well, no, because-

Start time: 1137.40

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Samsung makes its phone in Thailand and South Korea.

Start time: 1140.68
End time: 1215.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, but it's still Foxconn  and it's still a lot of these same companies.  So, okay, so maybe China loses its foothold,  but that doesn't mean that these problems  are going to go away because the profit motive,  which is what's behind a lot of this  and maybe the other types of motive still exists.  A lot of the times when you have,  when you hear this all the time from companies  who they will put together a prototype  and they'll design a board  and they'll have somebody in Asia make it.  And then it comes back and it's not what they ordered.  And they've had lesser parts done and they have to have,  they have to pay somebody to actually be on the line  and watching things and doing spot checks.  And even then you have to make sure  that the person who you're paying  isn't being paid off by someone else.  And it can be really complicated.  I don't necessarily know if those issues go away  if you just go to Thailand.  So I don't really know what the alternative is  because as you said earlier,  the manufacturing is not coming back to the United States.  That's over.  A, we don't have the capacity and supply of do it.  B, we don't have the skilled workers.  C, the amount of money that it would cost.  Unless you can prove that there are very, very, very real  tangible security implications.  I don't think that anybody is going to be convinced  to do that in exchange for the pot.  And the kind of stuff that the administration

Start time: 1215.66
End time: 1221.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  is talking about is really just bringing assembly back.  All the parts that they're assembling  are still manufactured overseas.

Start time: 1221.90
End time: 1230.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And also, if you, just cause you bring manufacturing  back to America, I mean, I'm an Italian American  from New York, corruption looms in America  just as much as China.

Start time: 1231.00
End time: 1236.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, completely.  And then you just have corruption,  but maybe at higher prices.  So yeah, I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everything gets more expensive.  Including the bribes.

Start time: 1242.52
End time: 1258.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I guess my point is, but you were saying,  what does this do for China?  I mean, I don't know.  I mean, I think that this is an interesting opportunity  maybe for some other nations to kind of try  to be a hub for that.  But it took China a long time to become  what it's become manufacturing too.  And so it's not one of those things where you can just shift  to another place overnight.

Start time: 1259.24
End time: 1291.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  But also you got to wonder what are China's primary  motivations here?  Were their primary motivation to be the lowest cost  manufacturer for the world?  Or was it to be the lowest cost manufacturer in the world  in order to do X, Y, and Z to get political agenda across?  Like they're a socialist nation.  I mean, they're not, I mean,  aren't they not looking for profit?  Right?  Like, isn't that the whole point of the country?  So why, you know, it's, you got to wonder,  we can't look at their politics and their country  and what they're doing as their motivations  the same way we do because it's a completely  different starting point.

Start time: 1294.24
End time: 1306.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a really interesting question.  And we know that the Chinese government is able to think  much more long-term than any of us.  Maybe 20 years ago they said, you know, it'd be great.  You know, it'd be great guys.

Transcript:  Actually, yeah, on Friday, I got to try the Magic Leap.  And we can talk a little bit about that.  I wanna hear about that.  This was very interesting.  We did an extensive demo on the new screensavers.  I spent about an hour and a half talking to Nicole Lozaro  who is a game, consulted to game companies.  She's consulted with Myst, with Maxis on The Sims.  She helps game companies make their games more fun.  And she's had a lot of interesting things to say  about the Magic Leap.  So we will talk about that too.  Our show today brought to you by,  by the way, Ron is the host of All About Android.  I forgot to mention that.  Brought to you by, and every four years,  we bring him in whenever Google does something.  Actually, Google did a lot of things this week.  You're gonna be busy today, Ron.

Start time: 1472.88

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you're gonna have to defend Google a little bit,  I think, on this show.  Our show today brought to you by Molecule.  This is kind of like the apple of air purifiers.  We love our Molecule.  I got one, Lisa used to wake up in the morning with headaches.  We had moved to the country  and she'd never had allergies before,  but she'd wake up every morning with headaches.  And we figured it's kind of, it's the pollen, it's the dust.  I tried different air purifiers.  We finally got a Molecule  because it's very different  than the HEPA filter air purifiers we had been trying.  Turns out HEPA technology was invented during World War II  to get big particles out of the air.  And all it does is it traps the particles in the purifier.  And you know, okay, it's a start,  but Molecule goes to the next level.  So they also trapped the big particles,  but they also used something called PICO,  photo electrochemical oxidation.  This was a technology funded by the EPA.  They verify the technology in university laboratories  like the University of South Florida's  Center for Biological Defense,  University of Minnesota's Particle Calibration Laboratory.  The PICO technology actually traps airborne pollutants  and it can trap stuff a thousand times smaller  than the HEPA filter.  Things like mold, bacteria, viruses,  even airborne chemicals like VOCs,  the volatile organic compounds emitted like formaldehyde,  emitted from carpeting and paint.  It can actually, it not only traps it,  but then it burns it up.  It actually destroys it.  So instead of making a collection  of all the bad stuff in the air,  which a HEPA filter does, this gets rid of it.  It is really amazing.  Lisa's headaches went away.  In fact, we know it works because when we travel  or when the molecule's been turned off,  sometimes our son comes in and turns it off.  We know because the next morning she wakes up with a headache  and we go, check the molecule.  Yep, it was off.  We cannot live with that.  We like it so much.  We got one for the studio.  If you're in studio, you're breathing the better air here  because this studio is completely sealed.  There's no windows and sometimes they'll tar the roof,  they're painting and stuff.  It's really nice to get rid of all that stuff,  get it out of the air so I'm not breathing it,  you're not breathing it.  We got one for our son too.  We love the molecule.  And Lisa's headaches are gone.  It really works.  Easy to use, it's got a clean, sleek design.  We pair it to our phones.  You don't have to because it's got controls on the top,  but I like to pair it to the phone  because then the phone will order new filters  when necessary, which is really cool.  You could do it on the WiFi or using Bluetooth if you want.  That is a really great deal.  But I've got to tell you, you've got to try this.  You can try it at no risk to you if you go to Molecule  M-O-L-E-K-U-L-E.com and use the promo code TWIT75.  Molecule.com, if it doesn't work,  you can return it and get your money back, absolutely.  Molecule.com, offer code is TWIT75.  That's going to save you 75 bucks off your first order.  They really reinvented the air purifier.  This is a modern way to get great air.  We have well water, so I have lots of processing  on our water to make the water great.  We process the air now too to make the air great.  And it just makes a huge difference.  Molecule, M-O-L-E-K-U-L-E.com.  Let's see, Google had an event.  I almost want to start,  let me start with the Wall Street Journal  and then we'll get to the Google event.  Wall Street Journal, I don't think they like Google  that much, I think there's kind of this animosity  towards Google that might have something to do  with the fact that all newspapers are suffering  because Google and Facebook are eating them alive  and advertising.  Wall Street Journal originally wrote  that Google had a data breach.  And I think correctly revised the headline.  Still, it's a little bit of a, I don't know, nasty headline.  Google exposed user data,  feared repercussions of disclosing to public.  What happened back in the spring,  according to Wall Street Journal, and Google admits this,  Google has been actually going through a,  they call it a root and branch assessment  of their security with regard to third party applications.  As you know, you can use Google  to enable a third party application  to go through your Gmail, for instance.  Just recently, Google said,  we're going to stop letting companies do anything  but mail specific applications in that regard.  So they've been going through all of this stuff.  They discovered in the spring,  there was a flaw in the Google Plus,  that's their social network, API,  that potentially would allow a third party developer  to use the API to get at your private profile information.  Now, if you've used Google Plus, you know,  you create a profile.  They really pushed this for a while a few years ago.  Use this as your home on the web, everything you want to.  And I was looking at my profile after the story came out  to see, well, what private information is there?  And it's not your social, it's not your credit cards.  In my case, it was my home address  and my personal phone number.  And the reason I put it in there  is because you could set up a profile to share  different levels of access.  And close family and friends,  I wanted them to always have my correct address  and phone number.  So Google said, for privacy reasons,  we've destroyed the logs of how this API  is used every two weeks.  But, so we can't be sure nobody's used it,  but to the best of our knowledge, no one has used this.  No one even knew about it.  So we fixed the bug.  There was no data breach.  We fixed the bug.  The journal basically found emails saying,  let's not say anything about this.  And use this to kind of really hit Google.  But my question for you guys, is it below the belt?  And here's why I will say it's not.  Companies do this all the time.  When Microsoft finds a flaw in Windows  that potentially allows a hacker to get into your system,  it doesn't announce it, it fixes it.  Otherwise, every minute Microsoft's saying,  oh yeah, we found another one, let's reveal this,  let's reveal this, let's reveal this, they fix it.  That's the normal process.  Now admittedly, Google has a little bit  of a fiduciary responsibility  because they're holding your personal information.  So in fact, GDPR said, had this data been breached,  had they found evidence that somebody was using this,  they would have had legally a requirement  in Europe to reveal it.  This was-

Start time: 1866.60
End time: 1876.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the distinction.  This wasn't a breach.  This is an open hole in an API that there's no proof  or no knowledge that anybody used to exploit.  So-

Start time: 1877.60
End time: 1892.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, and frankly, no one was using anyway.  I mean, if we were gonna be really real,  the number of Google plus apps.  No, I mean, genuinely, like word A, not significant  and B, the amount of, I mean, it was a,  the vector here is significantly smaller  than it would be for say,  if this were like a Facebook app, for instance.

Start time: 1893.60
End time: 1897.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I should say, it has opened the window of opportunity  for Google to shut down Google plus.

Start time: 1897.52
End time: 1915.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, by the way, that's the weird upshot of this  is Google says, well, fine.  Then we're taking our ball and going home.  They project strobe, which is this security assay  that they're in the midst of.  They said finding number one, we found this API flaw.  Finding, so result number two,  we're gonna close Google plus.

Transcript:  The all about Android Google plus community is amazing.  They're on there every day.  They're posting stories, they're talking,  they vote in our app polls and stuff like that.  And so like, now we've got to find a new playground  to go play in because it was one social network  that actually was for the right people and they used it.  Admittedly, that's just a,  it's a small number compared to the massive billions  that are on Facebook and things like that.  But still, it's a bummer that we have to go find a new place  for our voting mechanism.  Yeah.

Start time: 1956.24
End time: 1973.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think even if, I mean, granted,  virtually nobody was using Google plus,  but they did push hard for a long time  to get people to create profiles  and plug information into it.  Absolutely.  So I have no idea what was in my Google plus account.  It could have had my address and phone number.  Yeah.

Start time: 1974.99
End time: 2002.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't even know.  Oh, no, I mean, I think that the potential here was real.  I also think that to push back a little bit  on what you said, Leo,  your Microsoft analogy isn't completely wrong  because obviously, and yes, disclosure,  I work at Microsoft, but I'm not speaking for them.  And it's very common when companies have-  Use Apple.  It's the same.  Well, yeah, well, whatever, exactly.  But it's very common when you have vulnerabilities  that you don't immediately disclose.  You fix it and then you talk about it.  The slight difference here is-  You might not even talk about it.

Start time: 2002.26
End time: 2004.40

Start time: 2012.12
End time: 2033.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, okay, but if you have this amount of thing,  I mean, as you were pointing out the GDPR thing,  in this case, Google probably would have to disclose  the way that they did with or without the journal article  just because of A, the Cambridge Analytica scandal.  So that's in the crosshairs.  And B, Google is on probation and had to pay  that huge FCC fine because of Google Buds.  That's true.

Start time: 2033.84
End time: 2034.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They have a consent decree.

Start time: 2034.84
End time: 2088.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're right.  So it's exactly.  So to me, that makes this slightly different.  And that's why I think if your publication,  regardless of your rationale for why you may  or may not be mad at Google,  if you see documents and emails and look,  somebody internally is clearly leaking them  because they're uncomfortable that are making it look like  we might not be letting this be public  in the light of the Cambridge Analytica stuff,  the ongoing kind of push for more information  about how this information is used  and the fact that there's a consent decree  because of the massive fine that you were levied  over Google Buds,  it's definitely in Google's best interest,  regardless of when they do it  to let people know exactly, to say,  hey, look, whether you're gonna use it as an excuse  to shut down a dying social network or not,  you should say, look, this was what happened.  We fixed it.  We don't have any evidence of any of this happening,  but this was a thing that was out there.

Start time: 2088.28
End time: 2104.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, keep in mind, this vulnerability was open  for three years and they said nothing.  And I had missed the part of the story where you had said  that they were deleting their logs every two weeks.  I mean, how could they possibly know over those three years  whether anybody stole data  and is now selling it on the black market?

Start time: 2104.20
End time: 2171.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The journal says Google was unable to determine  which users were affected,  what types of data may potentially  have been improperly collected.  Two people briefed on the matter said,  the bug exists since 2015.  Google says four, actually the journal says,  Google believes 438 applications.  So it's not an insignificant number,  had access to the unauthorized Google Plus data.  They did, in fact, as part of the Project Strobe  investigation, check those apps to see if any  of the developers had previous complaints against them,  determined that none of them looked suspicious,  but the leaker said the company did not call  or visit with any of those developers.  They didn't follow up on that.  Internal lawyers advised Google  that it wasn't legally required  to disclose the incident to the public.  This happened before GDPR was in effect, by the way.  But the, and because the companies didn't know  what developers may have had, what data the group  also didn't believe notifying users  would give any actionable benefit to the end users.  And the legal and policy staff said,  let's not publicize this,  it might attract regulatory attention.

Start time: 2172.62
End time: 2192.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is within their right.  Like that's why you have lawyers to tell you, you know?  Like, I don't think that there, I mean, aside from the GDPR  and the EU stuff, which is just gets bananas in general,  the company has no obligation to reveal inner workings,  unless there's a, like, I feel-  It wasn't a breach.

Start time: 2192.94
End time: 2200.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess that's the point.  As far, but to Mark's point, as far as we know,  it wasn't a breach.  As far as Google knows.

Start time: 2200.24
End time: 2215.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The journal was transparent to say that we,  they had only used the word breach in a print headline  and they retracted that and corrected the article.  Breach was the wrong word.  Breach was the wrong word  because they don't have evidence of it.  But we don't have evidence  that there wasn't a breach either.

Start time: 2216.20
End time: 2219.46

Start time: 2221.18
End time: 2240.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sure.  Yeah, breach would be a stronger story,  but this still frightens me that, you know,  the second most, third most valuable company on earth  had a tremendous vulnerability in its system  for three years that it chose not to disclose.  I don't know how tremendous, because Google Plus,

Start time: 2240.22
End time: 2248.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it wasn't everything Google knows about you.  It was just what you actually put  in your Google Plus profile.  Well, and it also-  You should look at your profile  and see what's in there.

Start time: 2248.76
End time: 2251.34

End time: 2268.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's gonna take 10 months to do it.  I immediately went and said,  well, God, what could they have learned?  And the worst case would be my home address  and phone number, which I know is not.  I mean, I agree with Mark.  It's bad and it's even worse optics for Google to say,  let's not say anything.  I think that's the worst thing.

Start time: 2268.80
End time: 2294.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think the optics here are worse than anything else  and I think that the optics in context  of all the other things that are happening,  regardless of whether it was legal or not, I mean, fine.  That's not necessarily always the best decision  to do something like this,  because then you have to play cleanup  when you're already battling regulators.  It's maybe not ideal.  I don't know.  I would say, I think even in addition  to maybe the information to be outdated-

Start time: 2314.04
End time: 2350.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But all I was gonna say though is that the number of apps,  I mean, okay, 438, but genuinely,  if you looked at app usage, I mean,  I think they'd shut down that API a long time ago  and so it's possible that somebody could have given access  and somebody might have allowed them to do that.  But again, this isn't like,  apps were never a big part of that platform,  even when they were forcing everyone to create an account.  It wasn't a big part of the experience.  So that's, I think, the good thing for end users  who might be worried about their data.  The likelihood of your stuff being breached,  to me, seems low just because the number of people  actually using applications was low.

Start time: 2351.24
End time: 2363.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you might remember that one of the things  Google Plus never allowed was an app to post on your behalf.  Unlike Twitter and Facebook,  you can't auto post to Google Plus.  You had to actually go to Google Plus and post.

Start time: 2365.00
End time: 2410.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the thing about this is this is a drop in the bucket  compared to what Facebook has done.  This is potentially 500,000 users  where Facebook has been in the millions of users  with an actual breach.  And the other thing is that this is something that came out  from one person who leaked stuff out there  and then Google responded.  I guarantee there's gotta be tons of stuff like this  that we just don't know about.  So it's flawed.  It's flawed.  They made a mistake.  They did what they can to fix it.  I think the Project Stroke blog post  was really well written  and the whole approach they're taking to deal with it  and the ramifications of shutting Google Plus down,  that shutting down a major product,  whether anybody was using it or not,  but still it had usage.

Start time: 2412.92
End time: 2488.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you wanna know if you were impacted  by the Facebook breach,  Facebook's now saying approximately 30 million accounts  actually had information.  Or I guess the breach was that somebody unauthorized  could get the access token to your account.  We have now determined, says Facebook,  this is as bad as you can get,  that attackers used access tokens  to gain unauthorized access to account information  from approximately 30 million Facebook accounts.  That means somebody with your token can be you,  can not only read everything on your Facebook page,  including whatever information you post there,  but post is you.  And so that is pretty bad.  What you can do is go to the Facebook Security Center  and they have a notice there,  oh, I'm not logged into Facebook  because I deleted my account.  But if you have a Facebook account,  it would say whether you were impacted.  I did actually log into my account,  reactivate my account and found out  that I was not affected by it.  But it's another good reason to get.  You know why I had to activate my account?  Because I bought a Facebook portal.  I bought two of them.  Yeah, I'm an idiot.

End time: 2541.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  on Facebook or to anybody with Facebook Messenger.  But in order to pre-order this thing,  I had to activate my Facebook account  and spend a not insignificant amount of money  because I'm not gonna buy the little one.  I want the big one.  Look, if Facebook's gonna follow me around the room,  I want it to have the best possible camera.  With a 15 inch screen, geez.  Yeah, it's a giant screen.  It rotates, it's $349, but I did get $100 off  because I bought two.  It is essentially a FaceTime camera, right?  It allows you to make video phone calls.  It has Amazon's Echo built in.  But here's the thing that maybe Facebook  might wanna think twice about this.  The camera can automatically follow you around.  So.

Start time: 2542.14
End time: 2560.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, which happens with a lot of meeting systems  and other types of cameras.  It's not a unique thing.  It's just, it's creepy in the context of Facebook  creeping us all out.  But it's actually a useful feature.  Anybody who's ever had those in conference rooms  with Lotter Tech makes them, other companies do too.  They're actually really great.  They follow you around too.

Start time: 2561.44

Transcript:  No, and also just the way Facebook has branded themselves,  you don't think about them for hardware  the same way that Amazon's been able to do that  and that Google's been able to do that.  But I think when you have all the other things going with it,  the creep factor is just too high.  Like, I mean, this is the sort of thing  where if you had this feature  and it was another company who was well known  for home products who released it under their name  and their brand, and you could use,  you could do Facebook chat with people, that's one thing.  But I think being under the Facebook branding  and like, I feel like that's more,  as much as anything else, the DOA part.

Does anybody care if I review it?  It sounds like nobody, nobody does.  Well, let me take a break and then when we get back,  we'll talk about, it's interesting  because Google's offering something similar  without a camera.  Google's not a fool, right?  And they may even made a point at the event,  didn't they, Ron?  There's no camera.  Yep.  This is the day after Facebook announced its portal.  We'll talk about the Google event  when we come back with Ron Richard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They haven't even mentioned it on Google Plus.  That's the part that kind of incenses me,  is that for the people who still love it  and are very upset, and look,  we've all had social networks, we love Go Away.  I'm not gonna make fun of anybody who uses that community  and is part of that.  I genuinely feel empathy.  I still post here, I love Google Plus.  What bothers me though is that there's been  literally no response or outreach  to that community from Google, which,  I mean, I feel like if you're gonna do this,  regardless of whether you're using it as an excuse or not,  you owe it to the people that actually do use it,  however infindecimal they might be,  to say something.

Transcript:  Google killed Google Plus a year ago when they,  I mean, yeah.  It was three years ago when they did the Pinterest design,  when they made it Pinterest to me.  I like it, and photographers like Trey Ratcliffe  made his name on Google Plus  because it was such a good place for photographers.  People like Mike Elgin really sang its praises.  I loved it, but I mean, I'm looking at my Google Plus page.  It's filled with spam of a sexual nature in many cases.  And I'm a member of a lot of,  remember they pushed communities,  so I joined a lot of geek communities,  and now I'm getting porn spam.  That's not a good look for Google Plus.

So I'm gonna leave geeks.  The Google Plus geek community apparently is not,  oh man, what's this one?  Photography.  Oh, now I have to leave photography too.  They're all full of it.

Transcript:  I don't think anybody building the products  or steering it understands social.  I just don't.  And I think that you can have all the best things,  but if you're not coming at it from that perspective,  I mean, there was an interesting medium post,  or it wasn't a medium, sorry, but somebody's blog,  someone who was on the design team for the first eight months  who kind of talked about his experiences.  And they're obviously colored in some ways  that maybe aren't fair to the final product,  but it was always from the very beginning,  it was a defensive move always.  And that comes through.  And I think that the fact that it was designed  because Google realized that they'd missed social.  And then the fact that it was pushed down everyone's throats  so much to the point where there wasn't even a reason  for people to want to use it.  You're almost turned off.  to all of your Google stuff.  I'm verified on YouTube because of it,  so I'm thankful for that.  I had a ridiculous number of Google plus followers.  I would joke about it because it was hilarious.  It still is.  But I didn't really ever see that sort of engagement.  It was just kind of this weird thing foisted upon people.  And I don't think it ever had direction from people  who saw it as anything other than we've got to try  to beat Facebook because that's an important part  of the future going forward.  And I mean, it is what it is.  It's a shame, but it is what it is.

Trey Ratcliffe is actually putting together  a documentary kind of a online thing about saying goodbye  where people are gonna, he wanted me to record something  and I'll do it, record their thoughts  and memories of Google plus.  It's sad.  Although I noticed Carson will not show my Google plus.  He's not gonna show my Google,  he saw what happened, right?  Poor Mark Millian is going, why?  I don't wanna see that.

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by FreshBooks.  If you are a freelancer,  I know a lot of you are a small business,  you know that the, you love,  I'm sure you love what you do,  but there's a part of your business you may not love  that is doing those invoices at the end of the month, right?  Sending out the invoices.  It's like paying bills.  You just, you don't wanna do it,  but if you don't send out the invoices,  the bills will not get paid.  I learned that when I was a freelancer.  This is back when I was going to Canada every month  to do a call for help.  Amber MacArthur, my co-host at the time,  because I was moaning about it,  said, you gotta try FreshBooks.  They had just started up in Toronto.  It was, I'll tell you how long ago that was,  it was a Web 2.0 startup.  And it changed my life.  I was able to do these invoices.  It was in Canadian dollars.  It did the currency automatically,  does every currency automatically.  And the neat thing with FreshBooks is,  just merely in the process of sending invoices,  you're actually doing your books  because you make the invoices.  That's gonna be your accounts receivable.  You put expenses into the invoices.  You can even use the FreshBooks app  to take pictures of receipts.  Gets right into the invoice.  So there you go.  There's your expenses.  It'll even download your expenses  automatically from your bank account.  So, and then when you get an invoice gets paid,  you record it in there and you'll have everything.  You'll have sent, viewed, viewed.  Yes, you know whether they've read your invoice or not.  That's nice.  People say, no, I didn't get your invoice.  Yes, you did.  You know what's overdue.  They'll automatically send out reminders to pay.  And actually the truth is you get paid faster.  On average about twice as fast  because every FreshBooks invoice  also has a automatic pay me button.  People, your clients can pay online.  Turns out clients, clients are no more anxious  to pay bills than you are to send bills.  So if you make it easy for them,  they go, oh yeah, yeah, let's just pay it.  Get it over with.  You can create proposals now.  They've, because it's a web app,  they've constantly added features.  Create proposals with rich text, content, and images.  Request your clients e-signature.  Yes, you can accept e-signatures.  All of this is automatic.  You can set up credit cards.  You don't have to set up a merchant account.  They do it all for you.  They have, let's see, the mobile app  will let you keep track of your business  no matter where you are.  And you can also give employees,  if you have them, access to that information.  You can control what their access looks like.  So you can have them put in invoices or check invoices.  There's a, I mean, I can go on and on.  They're always adding new features.  And boy, what a great support team.  The best, because they're nice.  They're Canadian.  Nice support team.  Check out their learning hub videos now,  which make it easier.  Although I don't think you're going to need them.  You just sit down and it's just kind of automatic.  You're doing bookkeeping without doing bookkeeping.  It is the ridiculously easy to use cloud accounting software  helping small business owners thrive.  24 million people have used FreshBooks,  including me, to painlessly send invoices,  track time, to capture.  Yes, they have, you could bill by time and hours.  They have a little timer built into the website or the app  and to capture expenses.  Try it free right now.  That's the best advice.  That way you'll know.  You know, if you don't like it, no harm.  30 days free at freshbooks.com slash twit.  And this week in tech, in the how did you hear best section  so we get credit, that's freshbooks.com slash twit.  It was really a great thing for me.  So Ron, you went to the Google event.  That looked pretty cool.  And I have to give myself credit because we streamed it.  They streamed it and we re-streamed it.  Florence Ion and I commented.  And I looked at those pedestals they had  in the middle of the audience and said,  I bet you products are gonna emerge from there.  I was being facetious, but they did.  Uh oh, Ron's muted.

Start time: 3349.96
End time: 3392.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was muted during the ad, sorry.  I thought they were like big Google Home design props.  I thought they were gonna roll out like a new version  of Google Home, that's what it looked like.  But I was actually sitting right in front of one of those  and when the products came up out of it,  I think, I don't know if on the feed,  on the livestream you could hear me actually  laugh that loud.  I love it.  Because it was just such a bananas decision.  Because I mean the whole story of this event was  this was the worst, this is the most poorly kept secret  in all of tech for the last what, month and a half?  Right?  Yeah.  We knew every product, we knew specs, we'd seen it.  And they had, they kind of poked fun at it  with that little video where they're showing clips  of people talking about it and stuff like that.

Start time: 3392.98
End time: 3403.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They actually asked YouTubers to give them clips  of them saying we know everything Google's gonna announce.  And they did a montage, I as actor was in the opening  montage, place of the montage.

Start time: 3404.12
End time: 3410.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And all the montage did was just show an emoji  like a shrug and then they just moved on.  I thought when they tweeted that the day before,

Start time: 3410.56
End time: 3416.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they were saying something like, oh you'll be surprised.  You think you know but you don't, no we knew.

Start time: 3416.64
End time: 3441.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what we hoped for.  But turns out we knew, there was no surprise.  But so they got up there and Rick Osterloh,  head of hardware for Google gets out there  and basically just says, this is what we're announcing.  The phone, the home hub and the slate.  And now you can see it.  And it comes up out of these pedestals and he's like,  you only got 30 seconds and then 30 seconds  it went back down the pedestal and they never came back out.

Start time: 3442.60
End time: 3443.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 3444.42
End time: 3459.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, I mean, what are they gonna do?  I mean, I feel for them because this was  the most leaked phone ever because okay,  first the renders come out, that's common.  Then so many renders come out that it's left in a Lyft  and the Lyft driver recognizes it  and sends it to one of the Android boxes.

Start time: 3460.00
End time: 3461.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He actually recognized it.

Start time: 3461.44
End time: 3494.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He actually recognized it.  He returned it to the owner but took a photo first.  Then more stuff gets leaked.  It's available for sale in Hong Kong  before the event is out.  So Richard Lyatt in gadget buys it and reviews it.  Then, then, then at the event, at the event,  they literally make the event wrap-up video public on YouTube  before the event starts.  You're kidding.  No, I'm not.  The guy from Android Police noted that,  that literally the wrap-up video was live.

Start time: 3496.40
End time: 3503.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they did that to capture the search traffic.  They wanted to have the first wrap-up video out.  That's why that's happening.  They're Google, what do they have to capture any?

Start time: 3504.10
End time: 3506.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You think that they could manipulate that maybe?

Start time: 3506.96
End time: 3551.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I mean, literally that's the,  I mean, it's like, I gave Apple, I think,  deservedly a lot of, made fun of them or not.  Yeah, yeah, did.  When the iPhone XS and the watch leaked  because they were available on their website  weeks before the event, because that was just sloppiness.  But this is just like, this is literally another level.  I mean, and look, Microsoft, we've definitely had leaks too.  And I feel for the teams that go through this.  But then what are you gonna do?  You still gotta have the event.  And in all honesty, there are lots and lots and lots  and lots of people out there  who didn't pay attention to any of that.  The people who were in that room  all know what they're getting.  And if anything, I mean, Google, congratulations.  You made it way easier for all the journalists in the room  to already have their stories pre-written  so they could just focus on other things.

Start time: 3551.62
End time: 3568.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But there's also another interesting narrative  that I think that came out of it  that not all people are talking about  is that a lot of the opinions from the leaks were negative.  And it was like the Pixel 3 is not gonna be a good phone.  It's not as good as the Pixel 2 and all this.  What is this good?  What are these cameras?

Start time: 3568.66
End time: 3582.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People still, I mean, very few people have seen  the Pixel 3, because it's only coming out on Thursday,  although I guess in some phone stores,  people are still based on pictures alone  saying that Notch is hideous.  And now you saw it, is the Notch hideous?  No, it's not hideous.

Start time: 3582.34
End time: 3586.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 3607.62
End time: 3620.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the pink phones are so good.  Even it's so funny, because I have the gold XS Max.  And it's so funny because Apple,  they called their pink phone rose gold,  and now they have gold.  And this is actually, in my opinion,  what rose gold actually looks like.

Start time: 3620.94
End time: 3627.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually do have the gold iPhone,  but I feel like a pink phone might be a bridge too far.  Come on, you can pull it off.

Start time: 3628.26

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, you can pull it off.

Start time: 3630.92

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think so.  Is this the pink?  Ron, you were there.  This is a picture of that pedestal.  Is that the pink?  Yep.  That's pretty pink.  That ain't no opalescent.

Start time: 3640.52
End time: 3644.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And by the way, I wanna say,  it was great that Rick ran it,  because he's their hardware guy,  and everybody loves Rick Osterloh.  He came to Google when they acquired Motorola,  and he stayed, and he's great.  Everybody loves him.

Start time: 3666.62
End time: 3692.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, he was a great keynote speaker.  Just as a attendee of the event,  they did it at Spring Studios downtown in Manhattan,  which Microsoft has used a lot.  But they completely rebranded everything on the inside.  From the moment you walked in,  there was stuff on the wall.  It looked as if Google took over the building for the event.  And the room the keynote was in  was actually smaller than I thought it would be.  It was a performance space with great windows  and the skyline and everything.

Start time: 3693.42
End time: 3702.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

It was an hour and 15 minutes  because we covered it.  And then once the event finished,  they ushered us all into this very well-designed  demo pit room that basically had design.  And I took pictures of it.  I get cars that say links of it.  You can see all the pictures I got were from this demo pit.  There was a section dedicated to the Pixel 3.  There was a section dedicated to the slate.  Section, they had three or four mock-ups of the home  where you could see the home hub working in a bedroom  or in a living room or a kitchen.  And they were running demos of those.  And so it was just like this playground.  I knew after seeing it,  after seeing once I walked into the event space,  I ran to that demo area  because I knew that within 15 minutes,  it was going to be overrun by YouTubers  and content creators.  And sure enough, it was.  It was like dodging cameras left and right  because everyone was filming in front of stuff.  But they had all the products there  for us to play with and touch.  What was the gift?  So the gift, I saw, I'm like, ooh, a gift.  Going to get a phone, nice.  The gift was actually the latest Chromecast,  which they didn't include in the keynote  that they didn't even talk about.  And the Google Home Mini Mickey Mouse stand  that Otter put out.

Start time: 3938.38
End time: 3970.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That or they'll start just putting those things there,  because that's what I've noticed,  is I've been traveling a lot this year  and I've seen a huge uptick in the number of hotels  that either are putting smart TVs in the rooms  and actually enabling the smart TV features,  or that are kind of encouraging the use of Netflix  or other sorts of things.  Because it's, I mean, it's good for them in so far,  is like they can still obviously sell their,  they wanna upsell the in-room options.  But a lot of times it means that they might not have to  care as much about the full cable package  if they know that people are just gonna be watching  Netflix or Hulu or whatever.

Transcript:  Right.  So they announced Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL.  It looks a lot like the Pixel 2,  but the camera is much improved.  In fact, we had Rishi Sanyal on the science editor  for DP Review on Saturday, yesterday,  on the new screensavers.  He had, ours, not ours, DP Review had a great couple  of interviews with the product lead  and the imaging guys from Google  that were really fascinating.  It sounds like what they're doing  with computational photography is really leading edge.  And ahead of Apple, we thought it would be,  because Apple's playing catch up with the iPhone XS Max  and XS with Google's last year phone.  Now they're doing nine images in some cases.  In some cases, as slow as a quarter second in low light,  but because they're taking multiple images,  they're able to eliminate handshake and motion blur.  They're doing things like fill lighting computationally.  It looks great.

Transcript:  Yeah, a lot of the gray area, not the gray area,  but the crossover between hardware and software  really came out in this keynote.  That yes, here's the phone and it's got these sensors,  it's got these lenses, but we took the computational power  that we've learned from Google and put it on the chip  in the phone to allow you to do these things,  to apply computational approach to it.  And for me coming out of it, it was like,  yeah, the phone's really cool, but wow,  that mode that I forgot the name of the mode,  but it takes a burst of pictures  and recommends the best shot.

Start time: 4063.40

Start time: 4065.08
End time: 4082.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, top shot.  That actually, I am prone to say holy cow,  but I said wow out loud in the audience  because it was just like seeing it in the demo  and the funny video they had to go with it  of all the missed shots.  But that's something I would actually use.  That's actually something that could improve  my photo taking skills.

Start time: 4083.04
End time: 4110.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Another thing camera phones are terrible at is zoom  because they usually are optical zoom.  Apple solved that a little bit with dual lenses.  A number of companies have done that.  Google still only has one lens,  but they're using this multiple image technology  to do a zoom.  Here's a unzoomed picture.  CNET took these with the Pixel 3 in New York.  And watch this building here because this is a significant  amount of zoom on that building  and that's from the same image but zoomed in.

Start time: 4113.92

Transcript:  No, it's really good.  So I just got a, I finally,  so I had a, this is the Sony Mark RX100.  Yo, that's a great camera.  And I had the Mark IV and I left it during build,  even though it was like literally down the street  from where I live, I was staying in a hotel  because I was doing so much stuff  and I left my camera in the hotel  and I wasn't able to get it back  and I was very mad at myself  for leaving my expensive $900 camera.  And so I was gonna get the Mark VI,  which has the giant zoom,  but I actually wound up getting the 5A,  which had the faster processor,  but still has the lower, the better aperture  and the better low light stuff.  And this is, I spent all told about $1,000  to get the camera and the kit.  And it's a great camera and it has zoom  and it's pocketable, it's really good.

Start time: 4168.00
End time: 4170.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a one inch sensor, so it's a really big sensor.

Start time: 4170.88
End time: 4254.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it's a really big sensor for a camera this small  and I love it, but I'm gonna be honest,  the way that, since I was not withstanding  that Google and Apple and others,  but especially Google are changing their software  to really get the most out of photos.  I mean, even something like this,  which is granted will do great 4K video  and is a fantastic camera and is better in a lot of ways  than what you would get with your phone.  What we're seeing now with phones,  I mean, I think unless you are an enthusiast  or you're somebody like me who has to buy things,  there's not so much reason to,  already the pocket camera market or whatever,  for people who weren't,  we're not talking about the expensive ones,  it was dead, it was already dead.  But now it really, but now even the higher end,  I mean, if I'm Sony and Sony does,  I think the best job with a lot of this stuff,  I would be really worried because you're starting to say,  it's the AI tools and it's these auto croppings  and it's making these decisions  and it's doing all the stuff on the software side  that I think you can make the argument  that a tech company can do better than a camera company,  especially a company like Google who has so much data  and gets so much information and is so good at AI,  it's really phenomenal.  And so looking at the, I'm not an Android person,  but looking at the camera on the Pixel XL3  and also seeing what they're saying about  bringing some of those features to other models  because of this software is so impressive.

Transcript:  Look at this night shot from Manhattan at night.  I mean, very low light.  It's really remarkable.  Now it's not gonna be perfect.  If you pixel peep and really zoom in,  you're gonna see some artifacts, some softness.  So it's not gonna replace high end professional cameras,  but for Instagram and Facebook, this is all you need.  And I'm starting to think I might not have  to bring a camera.

Start time: 4290.76
End time: 4302.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's not a great test because magazine covers,  let's be honest, are not high quality images.  I mean, first of all, it's in a studio, so it's well lit.  Second, they screen the hell out of those things.  So I don't know if that's really a good test.

Start time: 4303.44
End time: 4316.36

Transcript:  Condé did that with the iPhone too.  I remember getting a call for one of their food magazines  that they shot the whole issue with an iPhone.  And this was, I think, the success.  So that's not even, you know,  what you need to think about.

So I'm excited.  I'm gonna take, I get the phone on Thursday.  I'm gonna take it to Chinatown.  I want some challenging environments,  lighting and so forth.  But I'm pretty impressed.  The top shot, to me, the best part of the keynote  was the top shot video.  That was great.

Start time: 4342.78
End time: 4371.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wasn't that fun?  That was very good.  It's a great feature.  It's really, I mean, I was really impressed  by a lot of the software stuff that they're doing.  And I don't love the stuff that's only available on Pixel.  Like so Smart Compose, which we've seen in Gmail on the web  is coming to the Gmail mail app on the Pixel.  Which is like, I don't like when they do that,  but I understand they need something to motivate people  to go buy the phones.  But all the application feature software stuff  really impressed me this time.

Start time: 4371.16
End time: 4440.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's interesting actually though,  is that Google's gonna push a lot of this down  to the other phones.  Not all of it requires the Pixel 3 hardware.  Yeah, right.  Apple would never do that.  That's unheard of.  And I think that's, here's the top shot video.  So this is something we're all used to,  which is you get everybody ready to take a picture.  And then, because of camera lag,  you get people's eyes closed,  their faces blurred of scarf in the woman's face.  We all get these pictures of finger over the lens,  guys jumping off the cliff,  and you get the shot after they've already gone off the cliff.  Who doesn't have these pictures  all over the place in their camera?  In their camera.  And so I really thought this was a very identifiable video.  And what Top Shot does of course,  is it starts recording before you snap the shutter.  So as a result, if you do get a shot,  and everybody's got a goofy look,  you can actually scroll back.  And I guess the AI will attempt to offer.  They'll recommend one.  They'll offer the best shot,  which my experience is may not be the best,  but the fact that you can still go back.  Are these lower resolution though than the one you shot?

Start time: 4441.76
End time: 4457.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, so the ones in the carousel that you see there  are lower resolution,  but once you say, I wanna choose that one,  it bumps the resolution up on it.  Interesting.  I believe it's doing that computationally,  not actually like it didn't capture everyone,  but it is bridging the gap.

Start time: 4457.82
End time: 4464.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple does this with live photos, I'm pretty sure.  Although I had wondered the same thing  about whether the resolution changes.  Like, does it really taking so many?

Start time: 4464.70
End time: 4472.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apple does is they have one good quality still,  and then it's actually a video,  the rest of it in effect is low res.  But you can go ahead and edit and change.  Can you make it better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, well that's good to know.  The next step is gonna be,  and this is probably a couple of years down the line,  but probably not that far,  where they will stitch parts of the photo together.  So you'll have like,  Okay, my eyes closed.  Oh, they're already doing that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But they'll make it automatical  so that if my eyes are closed, but yours are open,  then they'll create a composite of the two together.

Transcript:  So what Rishi showed us is an image that Google had taken  of a guy sitting in a basketball,  tossing the basketball.  And what the phone did was,  for stuff that didn't move,  it got very nice, crisp stuff,  because it's taking nine shots.  For the stuff that's moving,  it picked one of the nine.  So the basketball, as you can see,  it's a little lower res,  if you really look down at it.  His hands are a little lower res.  So the stuff that's static is perfect,  and the stuff that's not,  it's as good as it could get,  given it was taking one out of those nine shots.  So it's already doing that.  It's really interesting.

Start time: 4534.32
End time: 4538.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, doesn't HDR mode do something like that?  It's like a longer exposure so that you can.

Start time: 4538.68
End time: 4582.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, precisely.  There's basically stacking.  So I think in some cases it stacks five,  in some cases it stacks nine.  And basically, the other thing that Rishi talked about is,  there's normally micro movements in the camera  between the shots.  They're very quick, they're 60 frames a second,  but even so, your hand is moving in tiny little ways,  and it's using that to get parallax,  and get different views of the same image  from different locations,  and then picking the,  so you get, in effect, more pixel depth.  It's pixel shifting, but because your hand's moving,  as opposed to having the actual pixel shifting  on the hardware, it is mind blowing.  Now, we'll have to all try it and see  if it's gonna be able to replace your RX100.

Start time: 4583.54
End time: 4628.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, and look, I think that there are probably,  for people who actually go out and buy that camera, no,  but I think that there are times  where if you don't have it with you.  I mean, so I originally bought my first RX100  to see Beyonce in New York,  and then I didn't get the second one in time  to see her and Jay-Z in Seattle,  and so I had to rely on my iPhone XS Max,  and I still had really great photos.  So it was kind of part of me was like,  well, it's getting better, and the Google software,  I mean, I think this is,  Apple's doing really good stuff,  and I think that historically they've had the best camera  stack in the phone industry,  but at this point, I do feel like Google software is better,  which is something that I didn't think I'd ever say,  but it's really, really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One thing Apple's getting some heat from is,  people is over-sharpening, particularly in the selfie cam,  there's a lot of beauty filtering going on,  and you can't really turn it off.  Marques Brownlee tweeted this picture with a Pixel 3,  he says, there's for sure no beauty smoothing happening  with this Pixel 3 camera,  and I agree, this sharpness is pretty darn good  in that selfie shot.  All right, so here's the question,  is Google even close to competitive with Apple and Samsung  in the smartphone market?  I mean, they sold 10 million total last year.

Start time: 4673.62
End time: 4684.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, this is the problem, right?  It's almost like you wonder, okay,  would they not be better off trying to charge  and license this to people who are actually selling phones  or cameras?

End time: 4694.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a shame, I mean-  It really is.  I like, I mean, I also feel like I'm safer using  a Google Android device than other Android devices.  Is that crazy talk, Ron?

Start time: 4695.68
End time: 4701.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's not crazy, but I do think slightly tied to this,  they didn't say the word Android in the keynote once.

Start time: 4701.92
End time: 4707.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was wild, they did not say it once.  At all.  In an hour and seven minutes, they did not say it once.

Start time: 4708.44
End time: 4724.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why?  So I wonder if they're trying to combat whatever,  in the ether negative opinion about Android  that's out there to bridge the gap  to compete with Apple and Samsung.  Because Samsung users, the millions and millions  of Samsung users do not say I have an Android phone,  they say I have a Galaxy.

Start time: 4724.68
End time: 4746.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, they have a Samsung, they have a Galaxy.  Well, and in fact, it's the point where people,  I mean, look, granted, the diehards get upset  that the updates are delayed,  and people like us, Ron, probably prefer  the stock Android experience,  but most people who are buying Samsung devices,  no matter what your opinion of TouchWiz is,  they're buying it because that's how they use their phone.  So if they were to go to the stock experience,  they'd be like, what is this?

Start time: 4747.40
End time: 4759.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because they're nine generations in now.  They bought a Samsung 10 years, six years ago,  and they've just gotten every phone  every time they upgrade, so it makes sense.  But I thought it was really enlightening  that Google didn't acknowledge Android  in the entire presentation.

Start time: 4761.24
End time: 4777.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Chatroom's corrected me.  Google shipped 3.9 million pixel devices in 2017.  Oh, that's terrible.  Compare that to 1.5 billion units sold worldwide  of all other phones.  It's less than a week's worth.  I mean, those are Blackberry numbers.  It's less than one week's worth of iPhone sales, 3.9.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, another point,  they get to show off some of their top tier things.  I mean, I think it's the same way,  I think the Surface is now selling really well,  but it's the same way why it makes sense for Microsoft  to be in the Surface business.  It's a good way when so many people  use your operating system,  and that's both the plus and the minus of Android  is that anybody can use it, as we just said.  Samsung makes it their own.  Other companies do their own things with it.  Google has this opportunity,  regardless of how many units they sell,  to show off the best aspects of Android,  and they're the ones who can control  the entire end-to-end experience,  and they make enough money that it's worth it,  I have to assume.

Start time: 4827.92
End time: 4842.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And as you point out,  Microsoft did the same thing with Surface,  and it has turned the corner.  It's now the top number five PC maker in the US,  which Microsoft has really just started  making PC hardware in the last few years.  So that's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Christine, I agree with you there,  but I also think that,  so the story about Android and hardware,  and specifically with phones,  is all about accessibility.  And the fact that these are 799 and up phones,  799 dollar and higher phones,  so they're expensive price point,  they're available on the Google store,  which nobody knows exists,  unless you're a fan,  and Verizon.  So then it becomes an accessibility issue.  I'm on T-Mobile,  I gotta wait till T-Mobile gets it,  and all that sort of stuff,  they do these exclusivities.  I mean, this is why OnePlus isn't known,  I mean, by and large,  I'm using the OnePlus 6 now as my daily driver,  and people at work is like,  what is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They've never heard of it,  because you have to be a certain type.  No, I agree with you,  I was actually gonna say that,  I think that if they were really serious  about taking this on,  they would have to be serious  about getting agreements with the other carriers.  But the problem with that, right,  is that then the carriers wanna make concessions,  and wanna make changes,  and wanna do things,  and that goes against kind of the core model.

Start time: 4907.60
End time: 4936.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  go ahead, Mark.  I was just gonna say,  I think a lot of what Google does  is like the illusion of competition.  Like, we're gonna make a phone,  we know it's never gonna be the best-selling phone,  but we also don't want to be overly reliant on Samsung,  or overly, it's the same reason they do Project Fi.  They're never gonna be the biggest cell carrier in the US.  That's why they do Fiber.  They're never gonna be Comcast,  but they're showing Comcast,  we can do really fast internet at low prices,  so why can't you?

Start time: 4937.88
End time: 4941.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 4941.62
End time: 4955.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I think they're,  I think it's for competitive business reasons.  They know their main business  is not gonna be cell phones or cell carriers,  but they wanna show we're not gonna be overly reliant  on any one company.

Start time: 4955.98
End time: 4960.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And of course, we've always said that Google makes money  when you use the internet, just in general.

Start time: 4961.20
End time: 4981.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's also the implication  of a suggestion of competing.  You gotta know that once they open Fiber,  Comcast is like, oh crap, Google's getting into this.  So it's the suggestion of, hey, at any moment,  we can shift this large cruise ship  that we're steering in your direction and wipe you out.

Transcript:  And it did, and I remember I was at CES the year  that they announced that it was gonna be on Verizon,  and I was actually in a Motorola briefing,  and we got the invite for a meeting with Verizon,  and it was clear that it was gonna be the iPhone launch,  but they were gonna do something in New York.  And I remember, because it was campfire at the time,  kind of getting with my editor to me,  do I need to leave this CES Motorola keynote  to write the iPhone news?  And they're like, yeah.  You do. Yeah.  Because that was such a big deal.  I mean, that held the iPhone back,  but that was also the very beginning of all of this,  and the iPhone was enough of a halo product  that many people did switch,  but as soon as they came to Verizon,  I mean, that was massive.  Like the number of people who became iPhone users was-  It did, it jumped, yeah.

Start time: 5057.97
End time: 5084.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, yeah, that's my other point,  is that going back to the price point,  I've been saying since they came out with the Pixel,  hell, I've been saying it since the Nexus,  give me a mid-range to low-end phone from Google.  Because the thing is,  is that not everyone can afford an iPhone,  not everyone can afford a Pixel,  and you know what they're getting?  They're getting those mid-range phones by ZTE  and by other companies- Which is dangerous.  Which is actually dangerous.  Yep, right.  They're getting the cheapo phone  from their carrier, basically, that runs Android.

Start time: 5085.48
End time: 5105.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And what's interesting is that Google  really could have an opportunity to really outsell those.  If they used older SoCs,  if they used less memory,  but they could still bring some of those,  maybe you don't have a 12 megapixel camera,  or maybe not as good of a sensor,  but you still bring some of those AI features,  you could still get a really tremendous experience.  Isn't that the point of-  You could get lock-in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Right.  But, Kristina, to your point,  why not make an affordable phone  that college kids can buy,  that's the Pixel, I don't wanna say Pixel Lite,  I'm not a marketing guy,  but to make it a flagship,  to make it so expensive immediately limits your audience.  You make it accessible,  you lock them into the brand,  and then you get a generation like Samsung has done  that only think, that's my phone.

Start time: 5147.38
End time: 5164.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not a particularly good business,  which is probably a big reason  that they don't go to the low end,  is because Google can't do it cheaply  in the way that a lot of the Chinese and South Korean-  Right. Samsung owns  a lot of the manufacturing,  or has adjacent companies that do the manufacturing

Start time: 5164.84
End time: 5174.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  where they can get- That's true,  and they own their chips,  so that's a good point.  You could almost make the argument, though,  because since really they want the data,  and that's where they're making their money,  and they get more of the information that they could-

Start time: 5174.80
End time: 5178.16

Transcript:  is after this event with three,  they've got phones, they've got tablets and laptops,  and they've got now home devices,  is Google now a software and a hardware company like Apple,  or are they still just a software company  that has some hardware?

Transcript:  You can, because as the ballot measure points out,  it will take two thirds of the state legislature  to approve it and federal government approval.  We know the federal government's not going to say  California can change its time zone.  So it's like a nonstarter, but I'm still voting yes.  We've got to stop this insanity, the clock changing insanity.  What if we just stayed daylight, not as they stayed standard time?  You could do that without federal approval.

And again, none of this was a surprise.  Although there were rumors there might.  There were two rumors that didn't come true.  One, that there might be a Pixelbook 2, an update of last year's Chrome OS device.  No. And nor was this a dual boot device that could run Windows.  That was another rumor. Didn't come true.  But the Slate does look exactly like people like Kevin Toffle  at All About Chromebooks dot com predicted  because of leaks from Bridge and others.  It is a tablet 3000 by 2000.  Very nice. High res, almost 300 DPI tablet  to which you can add a keyboard and a pencil.  Very much like a Surface Book, very much like an iPad.  It could go it could go either way.  It's it's priced like kind of a low end.

Start time: 5752.08
End time: 5792.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, no, it's that's my one real critique on it is that if I were going  to be spending that much money, I think I would just get a Surface Pro,  to be honest with you, because, well, I mean, biased.  Well, OK, granted, I do.  But even if we're like, OK, let's say that this is 14 months ago,  I think I would probably still say the same thing just because it put crouton on.  You can you can put other kind of, you know, you can dual boot  and get kind of the Chrome OS experience just because I think it's really expensive.  Whereas at least the Pixelbook was expensive, but had the really good hardware.  This it's I don't know.  It's like I feel like you have to have that two hundred dollar keyboard.  It's kind of like the Surface Go.  It's it's a silly it's silly to entertain by and without it.  But but the keyboard is expensive.

Start time: 5793.54
End time: 5849.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Keyboard's nice, though.  It it's good, but it's still expensive.  Yeah, they talked about how they brought in stuff from the from the Pixelbook  and the technology that they've learned and applied it to the mobile keyboard.  And I did a little typing with it.  It definitely felt good.  You know, given that I'm not a big fan of the foldable laptop  and the portable keyboard aspect of it just in general.  But they did do a good job.  And what blew my mind and what we saw in that clip earlier from all of that  Android would flow and I were talking about on the show was that, you know,  you know, the fact that it can plug into a monitor and it could potentially be  if you do buy the high end version with all the memory and all the all the RAM  and all the storage, hard drive storage space,  it could replace your desktop computer and your tablet,  which is really kind of amazing.  If I could carry my Mac mini around with me and have all my files on it,  you could do that with this device.  It was really impressive because it's both an iPad pro competitor  and a surface book competitor like it.

But they've got all those deals.  They've got all those development programs and stuff like that.  Yeah, you're right. It's expensive.  But I but I share your point.  I don't know who's getting this.  They had a rig set up in the demo pit area of one of these hooked up  to a USB turntable with the DJ software up on there.  And I would never even thought of that.  That like I don't know who they're targeting for this stuff,  but it seems pretty flexible and seems like you could hit a bunch of markets.  Now, how does Google market it? That's the question.

Transcript:  I don't think so. They all don't.  I and everybody, this is this is the question I get asked the most  because when my what was the Nexus nine that that?  Yeah. The 10th Nexus 10.  Yeah, yeah.  So when my tablet, when that when it bricked and I had to get a new tablet  and the Pixel C was too much, I settled on the Asus ZenPad 3S10,  which has been phenomenal.  It's just been a great it's been it was a good price point.  It was, you know, the it, you know, running Asus's flavor of Android,  which is fine because they don't really get in the way too much of it.  But for two ninety nine at Best Buy, you can't beat that.  You know, like it's it's it's solves it solves what you need for a tablet

Transcript:  at a good price point. I'm a fan of Chrome OS.  I kind of drank the Kool-Aid at first.  I was very skeptical, but I see its value both in education and business  where people want a secure platform that isn't as complicated to use as Windows  or Macintosh, but it also needs to be affordable.  And it's a little pricey when you add it all up.  Let's talk about the home hub.  This is an interesting product because there are already a couple of Google  Assistant based devices with screens from Lenovo from JBL.  I think somebody else is coming out with one at some point.  LG, maybe. But this one isn't like those.  This one is running Chrome is more like a Chromecast.  It's not running that specialized version of Android  that Google put out for these other companies.  Why is that? To make it better.  But that's that's mean.

Start time: 6056.82

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but to give it an edge against those other folks like when.  So when when Lenovo and those other folks started putting out,  I think it was at CES, we started seeing these smart displays,  you know, Google Home with a display running Android.  And we're like, why isn't Google doing this?  Like, are they just letting the OEMs figure it out?  And then they're going to come do it better.  And it looks like that's what happened.  And again, this is the intersection of hardware and software,  because to me, the Google Home Hub was the star of the show.  I agree. That's like the one I might actually

Transcript:  They didn't put a camera on. And it's tiny.  Look at this image from Mars Technica of a pixel to excel next to it.  It's basically not much bigger than a six inch screen,  even though it's in a seven inch.  How much is this digital picture frame?  One hundred forty nine dollars.  That's a good price, right?

Transcript:  They even they even said they even said in the keynote,  we made the best digital picture capability  because they knew that's what it would be used most of the time.  But that said, it plugs into Google Photos.  It curates your photos.  It gives you a great experience for that.

Transcript:  If you have Nest cameras, doesn't it automatically display  or a Nest thermostat?  So if you're in the Google ecosystem,  it's kind of like a desk clock or a bedside clock sort of thing.  And you can talk to it. It's got assistance.

Start time: 6141.68
End time: 6176.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the whole the whole over the over the overhaul of the home app  and the dashboard for all your devices and the fact that this works  with pretty much every IoT device in market,  because right now, IoT is a nightmare.  Like, you know, I've got I've got two lights in my house  and I've got Samsung SmartThings and Google Home.  And sometimes one light decides to turn on or off.  And I have no control over whether it wants to turn on or off.  And if they're making steps to make IoT more easy to set up,  easy to maintain, then that will help IoT as an industry.  And I think this is could be a game changer, especially at that price point.

Start time: 6177.32
End time: 6204.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Admittedly, it's an IoT device that works with everything,  but it works best if everything comes from Google.  Like, for instance, if you have the Nest doorbell,  when the doorbell rings, the screen pops up the picture, which is awesome.  But I don't want to replace my ring doorbell with a Nest doorbell.  I ordered one, we'll see.  I think the price is smart.  At least Google there, you know, we were just talking about  how the Pixel 3 is too expensive, how the how the slate is.

Start time: 6205.78
End time: 6236.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The price is smart. Well, there's a couple of differences.  One, you know, the smartphone market is is totally saturated.  So they don't need to be as it doesn't behoove them, I guess,  to be as competitive price wise, whereas here there's a ton of competition  and a ton of open opportunity, you know, and Amazon is really, really aggressive.  But so I think that's part of it. I'd say my favorite thing, I mean,  in addition to keeping the price down, they don't have the camera.  Which I thought that was really interesting choice.  A, I think it's really smart in when you juxtapose this product  with the Facebook portal, right?

Start time: 6236.70

Start time: 6243.22
End time: 6260.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly, which I think a lot of people are comfortable  having these assistants in their homes.  My mom loves her Echo so much.  I got it for her a couple of years ago and she loves it.  I don't think people are OK with having the recording for the audio.  They're not as comfortable with having the cameras necessarily.

Start time: 6263.78
End time: 6294.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Absolutely. And so I think this eventually people will be more comfortable.  But this gets you over that hump.  And I think it cuts down the price.  And, you know, Google has to deal with, in my opinion, very valid reasons,  you know, kind of people feeling creeped out by them knowing too much.  And by making that decisions to not have the camera there,  I think makes it a better product.  And it gets them in front of that critique,  especially when they happen to launch the same week as the creepy Facebook assistant.

Start time: 6298.08
End time: 6305.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. But yeah, but that I mean, this product, I mean, people were saying that,  like, oh, it's genius that they didn't have a camera.  They couldn't. You know, that was already.

Start time: 6305.98
End time: 6321.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it was complete. It was complete luck.  Make no mistake. I'm just saying that this is one of those instances where you can say,  OK, they were really unlucky that all the leaks happened with the pixel. Right.  But they were lucky.  And so far as the timing on this, even though they didn't plan for it,  it worked really well in their favor.

Start time: 6321.80

Transcript:  So it's hard to tell during the stream how big this device is.  Yeah, it's pretty tiny. Right, Ron? It's small. Yeah.

Start time: 6328.24
End time: 6375.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And the pictures I took, I took it next to there's a Nest thermostat.  And so you can get a sense of it.  And it's basically the size of two Nest thermostats.  It's a small device.  I mean, it's like a smaller than a seven inch tablet.  Like you said, a six inch screen. It doesn't.  And I think that's smart because you don't, you know,  because my whole thing is I was talking to my wife about it, who is not one of us.  She's you know, she's technically she's technically capable.  She's not a tech person.  And she's like, well, I don't want a TV in the kitchen.  I'm like, right. No, it's not a TV.  It's a little it's a little screen that can help you do recipes and stuff like that.  And I think making it less  cumbersome and less noticeable plays to its advantage,  because then it becomes a thing that you  it's not going to, you know, steal attention from the rest of the house,  but rather fit into the house seamlessly.  So you have you better control things.

And again, going back to these, which I just find baffling and so funny,  but this idea of wellness in technology and everyone's  putting in functionality to make you not use their products.

I remember speaking with people at Home Depot a number of years ago  when they started to kind of get into that space.  I think they saw that they were, you know, it was an opportunity for them.  And the companies that are smart enough to kind of get the shelf space there are good  because you have to think that people who go to Home Depot and spend a lot of time,  there aren't just, you know, individuals, but people who do contract work  and who people hire to come do things for their homes.  And, you know, if they can just do it, you know, go to Home Depot and get everything  there, that's an awesome, awesome place for all those contractors.

Our show today brought to you, interestingly enough, by Ring.  We all love the Ring video doorbell.  Everybody in my neighborhood has it now, which is nice  because of the neighborhood system on the Ring.  I can actually see what's going on in my neighborhood.  And neighbors will say, watch out for this guy or there's somebody  stealing packages. Really pretty amazing.  Ring has expanded.  Of course, we've talked before about the doorbell, the the spotlight  cam and all of that.  Now Ring has the amazing Ring alarm system,  a wireless home security system that completely,  completely re-events the home alarm system.  You can do it yourself.  You can do it for less.  We all know that those alarm companies make their money on the monthly,  you know, high monthly fees for monitoring and, of course,  tie you into contracts.  I saw one that required two years and charged more than three times  what Ring charges.  So Ring has created an easy to install, affordable home security system,  exactly what you'd expect from the Ring folks.  And there are no long term contracts.  You put the pieces together that are right for you.  I have this is the kit, which comes with the basic set of sensors.  It's got a motion sensor.  It's got the keypad.  Of course, there's an app that you can use, a big, loud alarm system  and the sensors for door or window opening, a range extender.  It'll extend the system, the signal from your base station.  So if you've got outbuildings or a big house, it'll work there.  The keypad's great.  It's fantastic.  Everything you need to protect your home and includes 24-7  professional monitoring for just $10 a month.  This is such a great idea.  And I'm so glad Ring did it.  The Ring alarm security kit, everything you need to protect your home.  24-7 professional monitoring, $10 a month.  It's available at Ring.com and retail stores across the United States.  Go to Ring.com slash twit to learn about how you can get a whole  home security system for only $10 a month.  Ring R-A-N-G Ring.com slash twit.  If you don't have the Ring doorbell or the Ring's floodlight cam, get it.  Because we're surrounded.  We have it everywhere.  And I just love it.  I've had Ring now for a couple of years.  Ring.com slash twit.  Apple has sent a letter.  As you know, the Australian government wants Apple to put a back door in its encryption.  Apple has sent a strongly worded letter responding to the Australian  Parliament's Assistant and Access Bill, which was introduced late last month,  designed to help the government more easily access devices.  Of course, this is going to happen in the United States too.  Apple writes, and the letter is, by the way, available online on a website  hosted by the Australian Parliament.  The devices you carry not only contain personal emails, health information, and  photos, but are also conduits to corporations, infrastructure, and other  critical services.  Vital infrastructure like power grids and transportation hubs will become more  vulnerable when individual devices get hacked.  Criminals and terrorists who want to infiltrate systems and disrupt sensitive  networks may start their attacks by accessing just one person's smartphone.  In the face of these threats, this is no time to weaken encryption.  There is profound risk of making criminals' jobs easier, not harder.  Increasingly stronger, not weaker, encryption is the best way to protect  against those threats.  Agreed?  Definitely.  Who wouldn't?  Sure.  But you can see law enforcement here in the States pushing for the same thing.  They want it.  Absolutely.

Transcript:  Scary story in Wired this week.  It starts in 2013, a young computational biologist named Yanniv Erlich shocked the  research world by showing it was possible to unmask the identities of people listed  in anonymous genetic databases using only an internet connection.  Fast forward five years, the amount of DNA information housed in digital data  stores has exploded thanks to consumer companies like our former sponsor 23andMe  and Ancestry.com.  We actually have a new genetic analysis sponsor, Helix.  Genetic profiles of 12 million people, according to recent industry estimates,  have been created by these companies.  And now there is some significant issue that no one's DNA is anonymous anymore,  even though these databases are anonymous.  Something to seriously worry about here.  Researchers chose an anonymous female subject from the 1000 Genomes Project,  which is an open access sequencing project.  They reformatted her DNA to resemble a typical consumer genetic profile,  uploaded it to GEDmatch.  You may remember the name GEDmatch that was used to arrest a guy on a cold rape  case and prosecute him and I think put him in jail because of a DNA match.  Two relatives popped up, one in North Dakota, one in Wyoming.  The match suggested they were distantly related four to six generations back,  an hour of public record combing.  Later, the team had found the husband and wife.  So yikes.  I don't know what to say.  I remember when Esther Dyson put her genome, there was something called the  Personal Genome Project.  I tried to get into it.  And one of the things, the Personal Genome Project, I think it's out of  Harvard, does not attempt to anonymize the data because they say specifically,  it's going to be impossible.  But this genomic data is so valuable to medicine and to researchers.  They asked volunteers to step forward and say, look, here's my genome.  Here's all my allotype information, all my phenotype information, all my illnesses,  all my medical history.  And it's public under my name because this information is so valuable to science.  And at this point, I guess we're maybe all participating in that.  I tried to get in, they wouldn't let me.  But I thought this was worthwhile.  And the fact that my information would be public to me did not seem to be  sufficient harm.  Why wouldn't they let you?  I don't know.  I mean, I applied, didn't say no, not you.  They just never let me do it.  The application at Harvard has been declined.  Yeah.  Well, that wouldn't be the first time.  It's the second time.  And I'm Harvard, you broke my heart twice.  Hey, let's let's wrap this thing up because I know everybody wants to go to dinner and  there's probably a great TV show on.  Is there anything, Christina, that I'm missing?  Game of Thrones isn't back yet, right?  I know.  I know.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really good cast.  So far, I've only seen the first one, which I loved, and we'll be watching more of those.  So yeah, there's some good stuff.  Amazon, I thought it was interesting.  Amazon Prime is taking advantage of this kind of lapse from HBO and nothing going on.

Transcript:  Well, this, I mean, this is the first year.  I'm a huge TV watcher.  And every year I sit down with the Entertainment Weekly Fall TV preview and I make my list  I used to do a spreadsheet with grids and each day when I'm watching.  And this year was the first year where I literally had no new TV shows to add.  How is that possible?

Start time: 7283.57

Start time: 7285.71

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because literally, between Netflix and Amazon and Apple even is getting into it, how successful  Apple will be ultimately, I don't know.  But they certainly are hiring the right people.  Everybody is signing these massive content deals with the streaming services.  HBO is one of the only ones that can still retain people, everybody else.  Why would you sign with NBC when you could sign with Amazon?

Start time: 7312.60
End time: 7344.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the big checks are coming these days from Apple.  And CNBC had quite a scoop saying that Apple is planning to give away all this original  content it's been buying as part of a new digital TV strategy.  They want you to use the TV application on Apple TV and your iPhone.  And I would be thrilled.  I mean, they have signed huge, huge names to create content for this service.  If they gave it away to Apple TV and Apple iPhone and Apple iPad owners, that would change  the equation, I think, quite a bit.  It's an interesting...

Transcript:  They're going for a more family-friendly...  Well, that's part of the problem Apple has.

Start time: 7359.26
End time: 7365.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe they have to give it away because they don't want sex or violence.  They killed the Dr. Dre biopic.  Which seemed amazing.

Start time: 7365.92
End time: 7414.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, what's interesting because they did sign...  They signed a deal with the Always Sunny in Philadelphia guys.  And I mean, they're fantastic.  That's going to be wild, right?  But even the stuff that they've done for networks that weren't FX or FXX is usually...  It's fine for network TV, but it's pushing boundaries a little bit.  It's hard to family-friendly.  It's edgy.  Completely.  So I wonder...  I mean, and this is what a lot of people have kind of been saying is they don't know how  this is going to work with creators are signing these deals and don't necessarily know what  freedom they have.  The advantage you have with HBO is you know basically nothing's off limits.  And Amazon and Netflix have kind of followed suit with that.  And so it'll be interesting to see how you can get people with a lot of talent, how much  money can kind of persuade them to maybe not have as much creative freedom.

Don't know if it'll be Battlestar Galactica like, but maybe.  Octavia Spencer and All Are You Sleeping.  That's from Reese Witherspoon's Hello Sunshine Company.  A thing called Home from I think, who are these guys?  Matt Turnhour and Corey Reesor.  Those names are so familiar.  Well this is all, oh great.  Damien Chazelle got a show with him.

Transcript:  Yeah, with the O network they're doing so much stuff with Apple and Oprah.  But this is just another page in the big problem with the emergence of the streaming services,  which is, I hate to make the reference, but it's the Springsteen 57 channels and nothing's  on.  It's a flood of content to the point where there's no marketing behind any of these.  And I mean, I have all the streaming services.  I'm a huge TV and movie watcher.  I'm a huge fan of Christopher Guest.  Did you know that his latest movie was on Netflix?

Transcript:  But they all do.  I mean, at least Amazon's buying Subway ads here in New York for like Ms. Maisel and stuff  like that.  But the problem is that they release shows on such a frenetic pace and there's a burst  of a couple of days and then it goes away.

Transcript:  I honestly think that's why I like what Hulu does where they often will do the weekly release  schedule.  They don't just dump it all at once and let you binge.  I think that that's a good model in a lot of cases.  That's what Amazon's doing with the Roman also.  Exactly.  Right.  Which is the right way to do it, I think.  I think that you build people coming back and so much TV.

Transcript:  I think binge watching is bad.  It's not a good experience.

Start time: 7585.16
End time: 7623.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that binge watching is good if the show is written to be binged.  I think that it's not as good if it was, which is what happened early on, which is if it's  created episodically and then people wind up binging it.  But I don't know.  I just feel like there's, you know, to the wrong point, there's so much content out there  that you don't have the time to binge it all.  I like at least having to, you know, if I can do it on my own time, that's great.  But what makes television and I think what makes HBO in particular still really relevant  is that you know that you've got to tune in at this certain time or that this week they're  going to come out with the new episode and you'll find time to watch it.  It's a probability.  Exactly.  Because if it's always there, if I know I can just watch the whole thing, I'm much more  likely to not bother.
