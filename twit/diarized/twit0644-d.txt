I can hook you up also with this.  Hey, my goodness.  He's going to make a big deal about Serenity not being here for a long time, but this is  a guy who actually recused himself for a while.  He said, I'm not doing technology anymore.  Dwight Silverman is back.  We're so glad to have you back.  I'm back.

Transcript:  The grill master from Houston Chronicles, tech burger section.  So yeah.  So what happened?  You got, you decided you didn't want to write about tech anymore or.

Start time: 290.50
End time: 320.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They wanted me to do to manage our subscriber website.  And so I did that for a year and a half.  And we decided that, well, actually, there was there was some research that New York  had done that said, surprise, people in Houston want more technology coverage.  Surprise, surprise.  And so they came to me and said, you want to do a tech site again?  And I said, yes, because I really did miss it.  I really did miss it.  So what's the story with tech?

Start time: 320.28
End time: 327.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I love it because it's very memorable and you've got a giant digital  hamburger, Houston Chronicle dot com slash digital hamburger.

Start time: 327.46
End time: 394.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is great.  So when we were coming up with names, you know, I threw in a bunch of names that I  thought sounded techie, like I wanted to call it scan or something like that.  And I, and just as kind of as a joke, I had all these serious sounding tech names  and I threw in tech burger.  And as we were going through kind of eliminating them, my boss kept saying, I  really like tech burger.  I really like burger.  And so we wound up doing it.  And what's, what's nice about it is first of all, everybody remembers it.  People either think it's stupid or they start giggling when they hear it.  And it gives us a chance to do some really good puns.  So our daily, the daily link post, which I've resurrected and kind of beefed up a  bit is called, here's the beef.  We have, we have the AP feed, which keeps live tech news flowing onto the site is  called extra cheese.  The little short items at the top of the page is called sliders.  As long as you don't end up in a pickle, then you're fine.  I'm trying to figure out what to call the condiment section, what to put in  condiments, but, or fries.

End time: 423.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, so we are, it's, it's been a lot of fun.  I've been doing, doing a lot more writing and also I'm able to play with, you know,  I'm able to use all of our wire services so I can use Washington post and  Bloomberg and business insider.  So I can keep the site pretty much up to date and it's more issues oriented as  opposed to gadget oriented, which is kind of what I was doing before.  And, and so far the reception has been really good and we're just going to  keep plugging away.

Start time: 423.90
End time: 442.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, that's actually an interesting distinction because I think when a lot  of our shows are gadget oriented and product oriented, buying oriented and  helping how to oriented, but I've always been much more interested in the issues  of technology.  And so this show has really always been more of an issue show.  Do you find the readers want issues or?

Start time: 442.54
End time: 476.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think in 2017, people are much more attuned to things like security and  the fact that technology and social media is having on society.  I think that there, you know, people are much more interested in that.  I think than they were say two or three years ago and because they're acutely  aware of what can happen.  And so I'm, you know, I would much rather be doing that.  I think it serves our purpose better and it serves kind of what, what journalism  needs to be doing right now.  So I'm, I'm excited to be a part of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A lot of big stories this week, Bitcoin hit $20,000 briefly and then went back  down, causing a lot of people, including me to go, where is that Bitcoin wallet?  I had lying around.

Start time: 489.08
End time: 493.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  People have been doing that over the last couple of months.  It's just, I know I've got some somewhere.

Start time: 494.06
End time: 515.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have, I have, and I'm embarrassed to admit it's 7.85 Bitcoin, which at the  going rate is almost a hundred thousand dollars and I can't unlock the wallet  because I forgot the password, but it's sitting right on my desk.  Oh no.  I know.  But I'm not alone.  This is actually, I think it was estimated about a third of all Bitcoin are  held somewhere, somewhere with, by somebody who doesn't seem to have any  ability to get at it.

Start time: 515.39
End time: 529.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, I mean, there's a huge tranche of the original Bitcoin, which  have never been used.  Well, mostly those are Satoshi's, right?  Yeah.  But then now the quest is on for who is Satoshi.  And I was, I thought I'd track down who it was a couple of weeks ago.

Start time: 529.96
End time: 535.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you join a, by the way, a rich panoply of tech journalists, all of whom  Oh yeah.

Start time: 535.18
End time: 581.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We've all got finger for being Satori earlier this week.  And it was like, yeah, forget it.  That's not going to happen.  Who do you think Satoshi Nakamoto is?  I don't want to say his name because basically this guy has come up in the past.  His family have received a been on the brunt of a bunch of hacking attacks,  but it looked good.  So I spoke to some people who knew him.  He's unfortunately passed on now.  And that makes sense because he has billions and he has not touched it.  This is someone who I've known and trusted for, for over a decade.  And he was like, look, you know, I've worked with this guy.  I know we've talked about it.  He's denied it to my face and the evidence just doesn't stack up.  So everyone's looking for this guy.  And it's probably, I think deep down it's probably two or three people.  And there's a whole bunch of Bitcoin that are just missing somewhere.

Start time: 582.06
End time: 681.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And even in the original paper, they use the pronoun we.  Yeah, I think it's definitely a group.  It means it sounds to me like it was a group.  They weren't even trying to hide it, but they just use a single pseudonym  to represent themselves.  But they, as with any pyramid scheme, and you could make a case that Bitcoin  is just another pyramid case for that.  As with any pyramid scheme, the person who starts it is the one who makes all the money.  And they own billions of dollars in Bitcoin.  But have not we would know the minute they moved it, we would know  because people know which bitcoins are Satoshi's.  And they they seem to have no inkling.  And I would think now, if ever, now would be the time to get on.  Unless I'm completely wrong.  I mean, there are a lot of people like the Winklevoss twins.  Look at these guys.  So they are the famous Harvard crew twins.  You saw them in the Facebook movie, The Social Network.  And I don't know how accurate that movie was.  But I think there was some accuracy to the idea that they had as Harvard seniors  commissioned a Harvard freshman named Mark Zuckerberg to write some software  for them for a social network they had in mind.  Mark ghosted on him, disappeared, ended up  the next time they saw him releasing something called the Facebook.  And the rest is history. They sued him.  And now we never knew what the settlement was.  But this week I saw a story saying they parlayed the eleven million dollar  settlement, which would make sense, not huge, but something into Bitcoin billions.  They went all in a Bitcoin and they're now and they're still just as handsome.  Bitcoin and they still match perfectly.  Matching bookends, Bitcoin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The Winklevi, as we call them.  I mean, they insist they haven't sold any Bitcoin yet.  And they were talking about getting an exchange going.  But, you know, it's we've saw with the exchanges this week earlier on that,  you know, transmission times are going way down.  Exchange costs are getting slower.

Start time: 700.90
End time: 704.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Transcript:  And you got Steam refusing to take Bitcoin this week because it's too volatile.  Yeah, it is too volatile.  And even some drug dealers on the dark net complaining that, you know,  they were having to get out.  I know my heart bleeds for them.

Start time: 716.06
End time: 720.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  Oh, and then Mondale is now, you know, every Monero or Monero.

Start time: 726.30
End time: 737.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Monero. That's the one that people are using.  The coin hive coin hive.  And others are using to take over your browser.  When you visit websites, you actually start running a mining.

Start time: 737.70
End time: 749.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, you you contribute your spare CPU cycles to them.  And to be fair, CoinHive has said we're not developing that software anymore.  We're now developing a new bit of software which does the same,  but insists that you get user consent before you do it.

Start time: 749.56
End time: 788.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The problem with CoinHive, and by the way, I'm glad to say I am blocked  from CoinHive by my UBlock origin, which is as it should be.  Problem with CoinHive, it's software been weaponized.  This is a security issue.  And instead of you know, I think you could make the case  while you're reading a site uses a few spare CPU cycles.  You know, if some of a coin drops out, well, then that's our monetization strategy.  I agree. You need to tell people you're doing that.  But I think that's kind of no harm, no foul.  But they had been modified to continue to run after you closed your browser.  Just sit on your system and run all the time in the background.  And that is not OK. No, no, that's disgusting behavior.

Start time: 788.48
End time: 795.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's also getting on mobiles and that burns through battery power like nothing else.  You feel your mobile getting hot, it might be worth checking out on that one.

Start time: 796.08
End time: 799.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you should probably be running a blocker like you block origin

Start time: 800.40
End time: 807.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  on those kinds of a lot of the antivirus and a lot of the app blocking people  are now getting wise to this thing.  Goodness. Yeah, yeah, because it is a virus.

Start time: 808.42
End time: 836.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Although am I wrong?  Do you got what do you think, Serenity?  I mean, the idea that I'm more, for instance, I mean, the way you  that's an expensive site, you got to make money.  The only way you make money is with banner ads.  Or I guess it's the primary way.  I can't say it's the only way, but you make money on banner ads.  What if what what would it take for somebody like Mobile Nations to say,  well, maybe we should just do this, but say, hey, would you mind if we used  while you're sitting on the site, just did a little JavaScript to mine Bitcoin?  Would people just say, no, that's not going to happen?

Start time: 837.14
End time: 900.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I think the asking is the first step, right, is saying, hey,  we are actually going to do this.  So is it cool with you guys if we use your CPU cycles?  But honestly, to me, it comes back to the problem that we've had with intrusive  banner ads from the very beginning, which is that no one wants to visit a site  that's slow, and if I'm going to be using spare CPU cycles of yours to mine bitcoins,  I am inherently going to make your web experience slow.  And you're either going to use something like AMP or you're going to use reading  list or one of the numerous other ways that you can use to read our content  without running into that, because, again, you want the faster experience.  So I really can't I can't see any way in which this would be a profitable  solution for people.  It would just end up like even if everybody was totally fine with the prospect of,  oh, yeah, you can use my computer to mine bitcoins.  I still feel like they're just they're not going to be OK with it  from a from a slowness standpoint.  Yeah.  But voluntarily checks that box.

Start time: 901.14
End time: 943.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But here I am on Bloomberg site and seen it does a lot of sites do it and live  television, live video starts loading, probably using more bandwidth and  I'm certainly using more bandwidth and probably using more CPU cycles.  Yeah. Then a little Bitcoin miner.  That's really annoying.  We kind of accept that.  I would like to turn it off, but my ad blocker won't.  I mean, I think this is a problem.  I mean, we need to monitor.  Everybody acknowledges we need to monetize these free internet services.  They're really great. There needs to be a way to monetize.  I feel like if there were some the problem is, you're right.  Everybody would just say, no, no, you can't.  No. That's why they don't tell you, because you'd say no.

Start time: 943.28
End time: 967.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Unless there was some incentive to come back to you.  If it was shared, split it, Bitcoin mining, you might get something.  You know, that might be worth it.  But just the whole idea of asking somebody, hey, can I use your computer  to make some money for me?  That's just that's just too creepy.  And I think most people, even if they were incentivized to say it,  it will give you a little bit would would ultimately people would just say no.

Start time: 967.60
End time: 974.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know.  I mean, we saw with Tessie at home that people are actually willing to lend out  their spare CPU cycles.  Yeah, but that's searching for aliens.

Start time: 975.48
End time: 978.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Start time: 980.54
End time: 990.33

End time: 1009.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, Ian Banks, the science fiction author, causes the outside  concept context problem whereby, you know, you have nothing to do with us.  You're getting your civilization around.  And then all of a sudden, these people turn up with sticks  that have gunpowder in them and ships would go against the wind.  And generally, that's when society ends.  So, yeah, let's not encourage.

Start time: 1009.38

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This man is a food.  Bitcoin whales, it is estimated, a thousand people,  mostly Chinese miners, own 40 percent of the market.  That makes me nervous because Bitcoin is not regulated  in the same way that, say, stocks are regulated.  And it isn't illegal, as far as I know, to collude.  These guys could get together and pump and dump.  These guys could do all sorts of things.  For all we know, they are pumping and dumping.  It hit 20,000 and is now down to 15,000.  That's a profit taking. Yeah. Yeah.  Yeah. Yeah. I should probably explain what pumping and dumping means.  You have many connotations.  So these these and then, of course, the big Bitcoin miners  are mostly in China because you need to have very cheap  power now to do that or free power.  And probably I'm going to make a little leap of logic here.  But we know these Bitcoin miners are near big hydroelectric dams  are getting power cheap.  I'm guessing probably an arm of the Chinese military or government.  What isn't over there, to be honest?  So do you really want the Chinese government to control this market?  And I mean, just me.  I don't know. As I said, it's I think it's fascinating.

Start time: 1134.68
End time: 1147.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, it's huge in China because it provides a very good way  to get around currency regulations.  Yeah. But it allows them to get around currency export.  It's anonymous. It's decentralized.  So you can stick it out there.  You can get your money out, invest in companies.

Start time: 1147.22
End time: 1158.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the IRS wants to regulate. They want to charge tax.  If I were to if I were to find the password to my Bitcoin wallet,  I would be expected to report it as income and pay tax on it.  But that doesn't mean you have to mean that.

Start time: 1158.18
End time: 1169.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, they've also just proposed rules this week saying that it should be a crime  to conceal your Bitcoin.  It isn't yet, though, right?  As far as I know, not. But you are liable for tax on any capital.

Start time: 1169.34
End time: 1228.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's always a crime not to report income.  That's how they get around it.  Even I mean, that's how they got Al Capone.  He was an income tax evasion and he went to Alcatraz.  He couldn't get him on anything else.  This is a story from Tech Burger.  San Francisco to robots.  Don't crowd our sidewalks, man.  Apparently, there's we actually interviewed one of these robots  that delivers food.  We had one that that stays within the hotel.  But here's a Starship robot that sits outside Orson's Belly Cafe  in the Richmond as it prepares to make a delivery.  This was last year.  But San Francisco, the board of supervisors,  which which runs the city there, unanimously passed laws  that limit companies to three robots each,  limit the city to nine robots total.  What? And confine them in industrial areas where no one lives.  Well, that effectively kills the industry.  So much for that. That's right.

Start time: 1228.38
End time: 1248.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, it makes sense to regulate it,  because if you had everybody and his mother  with their own delivery robots, you'd be tripping all over them.  Or you'd have to you'd end up like creating lanes for them.  And I think that but to go to do what they did to do  what San Francisco did.  Yeah, it's just kind of like putting the stake in the heart  too early in that in that business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, you can't have batteries in your smart luggage  that can't be removed and taken out because they don't want these in the hold.  I understand that. Would you like to do it as carry on?  You can do it as carry on, but you still got to disconnect the lithium ion batteries.  So a lot of manufacturers are now frantically  reworking their designs to try and make these batteries detachable  because the airlines are putting the foot down and saying, look,  we don't really want something that much of a fire risk,  just so you can always know where your luggage is.  That's actually not a bad point.

The one downside to having these batteries for charging  your device in your suitcase is that if you leave your device in the suitcase,  that those often come back, you know, you don't have your device anymore.  I wouldn't check something like a notebook computer or an iPad  in the in checked luggage.  It's just not it's just not safe.  So I keep those with me and I keep, you know, one of the batteries like  like she had in my gear bag.  And I keep that in carry on and sometimes I'll just charge it while I'm flying.  But I would not leave a good device in a suit check suitcase.  That's just asking for it to be stolen.

Transcript:  Yeah. Plus, I mean, from a safety aspect, having a whole bunch of lithium  ion batteries in the hole is a horrific thing for a pilot to consider because  there have been explosions in holes. Yeah.  And the fire suppression systems in the hold are terrible.  There's generally single use.  They don't last for very long.  If you've got it in the cabin and the battery blows up,  everyone can take a hand in actually putting it out.  But if it's down in the hold, any pilot will tell you their worst  fear is an in hold flight while you're over an ocean  because you've really got no choice.  You've just got to get the plane down on the ground as soon as possible.  And you can't land a plane on the ocean without it breaking up.  So, you know, not the greatest safety idea in the world.

What do you know the answer?  You're good. Stay tuned.  But first, first a word from Fracture.  Where's my Fracture prints?  John just got back in the room.  Bring me my prints.  Fracture is a print photo decor company  that prints your photos directly onto glass and really solves a problem  because we all have great images somewhere. Right.  Unfortunately, they're not visible.  They're they're great images that are, you know, in a in a shoe box  or stored away somewhere or, you know, on a hard drive.  I'll tell you what, if you have a great image and you put it on glass  and print it and hang it, it is awesome.  The Fractures come ready to hang.  This is in all sizes, the small size, four point eight by six point four inches.  And see it come first of all, it's cleverly packaged  so that they don't have to have extra packaging in the box.  It separates from the backing and has a screw.  There's a hook on the back. It's already mounted. It's ready to hang.  That's a picture of Michael and his buddies. Middle school graduation.  Here's a picture a little bit bigger of me and Machu Picchu.  Same thing. You could separate it right out.  You could do it borderless or with a border. Here's a borderless shot.  They have an editor on the website so you can.  And there's something about it.  You know what? I love printing my black and white photos.  Here's a black and white photo I took a few years ago  that I was just on a hard drive or just on my.  And to hang this on the wall brings your photos home.  It brings them to life.  This is a great holiday gift and they get pretty big.  This is the largest size, twenty one point six by twenty eight point eight inches.  This is this is my masterpiece  that I took this past spring in the Galapagos Islands.  But look at that.  That's a get off my face.  Exactly what that was.  It was a seal yelling at a flightless cormorant.  But that just doesn't come alive on glass.  I just love it.  Fractures come with a 60 day happiness guarantee.  So you're sure to love your order.  Each one of them is handmade in the US at Gainesville, Florida.  From US source materials, they have a carbon neutral factory.  They call it their Fractory. I don't know.  I love these fractures.  And we've got a special deal for you right now.  If you're going to get 15 percent off your first order,  if you use the offer code TWIT15 at checkout,  that's better than the deal on the website.  So you don't forget that offer code TWIT15 and you get 15 percent.  What a great gift.  I have to say, if you're going to be,  I don't know, going to grandma's house, bring her a fracture,  hang it up on her wall of the family of the kids, hang it over the mantelpiece.  They're just gorgeous. Fracture.me.  Fracture.me.  And don't forget to use the offer code TWIT15 at checkout to get 15 percent  off your first order. And they there is at the end of one question  survey and it would do us a great honor if you would say that you heard about it.  And this week in tech, it helps support the show. Fracture.me.  The offer code TWIT15.  And we thank Fracture so much for their support and for decorating my walls  for the holidays.  Love our fracture prints.  I want to take these home, though.  I've been keeping it here at the studio so I can show it.  But I think it's time to bring these home.  I just love these prints.

Transcript:  Judging from the only Sarah Connor, as far as I'm concerned.  So the reason I say that it happened this week and maybe I'm but  but I'm going to let you guys talk me down.  I might be wrong on this.  We all know about  Deep Blue beat the world champion at chess almost 20 years ago, right?  Two decades ago.  It was, of course, became Watson heavily trained.  In fact, the complaint was that we've been trained to beat Gary Kaspar  of the world champion specifically to play in a style that would discombobulate him.  It was aiming at him. They had lots of games.  They had four or five grandmasters working with the computer.  Fast forward 20 years.  AlphaGo beats the world champion at Go.  Still took months to train a lot of a lot of master games  fed into the computer, a lot of skills.  There's a new champion in town.  Alpha Zero. This is from Google.  It is the latest iteration.  It does not need any human intervention.  They basically told it the rules of Go and they said go.  And eight hours later, after playing me,  I must have been playing millions of games a second.  I mean, you know, there's no speed limit.  If you put enough CPUs in this thing.  Eight hours later, it got good enough to beat AlphaGo, the champion  go playing game, and then it had a little extra time.  So it thought, I'm going to learn chess, did the same thing,  just new to the rules, taught itself  four hours to beat the world champion chess program, Stockfish, four hours.  And then it said, you know, still not quitting time.  Another two hours, learn Shogi, which is the Japanese,  a very fun Japanese version of chess I used to play all the time  and beat one of the best computers around.  That's a world class competitor, three separate games in less than a day.  And this is why I feel like it's a it's a  kind of a turning point.  This is now computers, artificial intelligence teaching themselves.  Am I am I overextending this?  Before they had I mean, admittedly, this is not general intelligence.  It's very domain specific.  But all they're being told is the rules and they figure it out from there.  And I would be willing to bet that you can't look at whatever the code is  that they generate and say, oh, I could see what it's doing here.  It is a black box from the point of view of humans.  I feel like this is August 29th, 1997.

Start time: 2089.90
End time: 2109.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes. I'm I'm nuts. I'm skeptical.  Frankly, because, OK, these systems are fantastically good  when you can give them a strict and limited rule set.  It is a specific domain and actually make them run through all the possible  permutations, see what works, see what doesn't.  This is what this kind of mass computational systems are good at.

Start time: 2109.84
End time: 2127.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would point out that's true for chess.  For Go, it's a lot harder.  Go has a much faster number and it's a much more subtle.  It's not possible, for instance, that are go playing computer to do  what brute force the solution as a chess playing computer can do.  It has to learn positions and has learned positionality.

Start time: 2127.42
End time: 2132.70

Start time: 2138.12
End time: 2180.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If the problem here is that it's not that like it can learn the rules of go.  Right. And it can it can do minor calculations and permutations based on go,  saying, oh, I can learn based off of this superset.  Right. But it couldn't take what it learned from go  and then learn chess from scratch. Right.  It still had to go started over.  It's a chess. Exactly.  When when the robot can learn go and then come up with chess on its own,  then I think we're going to have a problem.  Or if or if you tell the robot how to play, go the robot learns how to play go.  And then you show them a chessboard and don't explain anything.  That has to do again.  I think then we'd have a problem.

Start time: 2182.22

Start time: 2200.56
End time: 2229.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right. I agree with you in all of those points.  But the reason I think this is significant is because of how little human involvement  there was. So once these machines start learning on their own,  they could do it so much faster because they operate at so much faster  of a scale than humans do that some of the things that have been limiting it,  for instance, there is a project that's been going on.  I don't know if it's still going on for decades to just put all of humankind's  knowledge into a machine hoping that it will become intelligent.  This is not getting anywhere.

Transcript:  I think we're a little human centric, we're a little anthropomorphic  in all of this, that really these these machines operate  at such a different time scale from us that we are not.  We're no more important to them than trees are to hummingbirds.  We we are we're a data variable.  Yeah, I don't think it cares one way or another.  So even if it did become sentient or it got motivations,  we would not rank high in the issues it's addressing.  Its issues would be more like I need resources.  Where can I get more resources?  How can I perfect getting resources?  Not what are those things that are moving at one  10 millionth of the speed of I am?  What do they do? They don't even it's like I live four lifetimes  by the time you take one step.  It's not even a concern.  That's what that would be.  I think it's this is we're talking earlier about aliens, right?  I don't know if that was on the show.  I think it was before the show about SETI.  Oh, no, we were talking on the show about SETI at home.  You know, alien intelligence,  why would we assume it would be anything like our intelligence?  No reason to assume that.  And at least that would be a probably a carbon based life form.  This is not this is not even in our same time frame almost.  So I don't know.  I probably don't understand this well enough to make a big deal.  I agree. This headline is nutty.  Facebook's artificial intelligence robots shut down.  But I think the story is and I think this is more important.  They become black boxes to humans.  They develop their own communication systems.  They develop their own rules.  They develop their own strategies and go.  And at some point, human intervention is unnecessary  except to feed them, to plug them in, to build the machines.

There's a 1968 novel called The God Machine that I read as a kid  that I love by Martin Caden that basically predicts this.  That's one of the earliest  that predicted this.  And basically it's a machine that, as you said,  Leo is being fed all the knowledge and it eventually takes over  and connects to all the other computers in the world.  And in 1968, essentially, is is predicting what amounts to the Internet.  And it's a great novel.  If you can find a copy of it, it's definitely worth reading.  And it's pretty scary.

I also know that many of these AI experts point out that when Elon Musk  and Stephen Hawking say, oh, my God, be afraid the AI is coming,  that they point out, well, these guys don't work in AI.  Nobody in AI is worried about this stuff.

Transcript:  I know someone who worked for the OpenAI project training,  press training their staff, and he ran through a sort of a simulated interview  and said, so what would be possible to build an AI system which could an AI  powered drone which could go off, kill someone and come back to the base?  And he goes, oh, yeah, of course, it's easy.  It's like, no, you can't say that.  OK, you know, it's like it is easy.  Of course, it's about, you know, we have.  Ultimately, people are programming these things  and there may become a point where they become.  That's my point. Yeah.

Transcript:  Well, they're setting up a matrix.  They're setting up a thing.  And then but the but the learning itself, the connections it makes  are no more, no better understand than the in fact, less understood  this connections are synapses make.  They are in effect creating their own synapses.  And I don't think we can we understand exactly what they're doing with that.  And I feel like that's that's what that's the you just hit the kernel of it,  which is humans are less important to these new kinds of AIs  than we've been in the past.  We do control the power switch.  All we do is yes.  And I do know some AI experts who say, what are you worried about?  You just switch it off.  And probably what's going to happen is there be very domain specific.  They'll be great at doing one thing well.  Although who was it was talking about the paperclip machine.  This is the famous.

Transcript:  Well, worse worse than clippy.  What does this thing clippy this I've got to say.  It was the the it's a thought experiment in AI  created by let me see who it is.  It's very famous thought experiment.  Oh, yeah. Nick Bostrom, who we've interviewed on triangulation.  He he described an AI  that would have to be a general intelligence that was a paperclip maximizer.  One goal. Maximize the number of paper clips in its collection.  OK. The problem is it would at some point  undergo an intelligence explosion.  In the sense that it would optimize its ability to collect paper clips  and at some point would eat the whole world because it would be so it would.  It would transform the earth and increasing portions of space  into paperclip manufacturing facilities because it has one goal.  It's optimized for one thing, and that's the risk, of course, of saying,  you know, here we have an infant or not infinitely, but a highly powerful.  Technique applied even to one domain can cause problems.  Nick Bostrom is actually a very interesting guy in this realm.  Anyway, something to be aware of.  I shouldn't really have brought it up because what do I know?

Transcript:  It's interesting. You know, there's an iOS game based on that paperclip.  Yeah. You know, universal paper clips.  It's just it's you play an AI whose goal is to destroy the world  or not destroy the world, but to come as a mess.  The largest amount of paperclip. Yeah.  And then that's the point.

And she had always had problems using Apple Pay with the fingerprint reader  because on the screen in order to prompt you to do it,  it appears in the middle of the screen, a fingerprint.  And she always wanted to put her finger on the screen.  And I and she didn't do it that often.  Now, with this, with this, she just kind of moves her face into position.  Hello. And it pays for it.

Transcript:  If they say he's fine.  But there are plenty of times, especially like at night,  I'm lying in the pillow like this.  It doesn't recognize me and I have to enter the code.  There's just too many times I have to enter the code.  Be nice to have a backup.  Why not have to? I don't.  Apparently, Tim Cook sent Steve Wozniak, one of the Apple founders, an iPhone 10.  And there's always a risk when you ask Steve Wozniak a question,  because he will tell you the truth.  Yeah, that's right.  So he was he was talking to an Australian newspaper,  speaking at a conference in Victoria.  Cook said, try out the iPhone 10  because it's the first iPhone Woz didn't plan to buy on day one.  He says, I'm happy with my iPhone 8, which is the same as iPhone 7,  which is the same as iPhone 6 to me.  For some reason, the iPhone 10 is going to be the first phone I didn't on day one upgrade to.  My wife will. Janet's kind of an early adopter.  Used to work at Apple, too. So I'll be close enough to see it.  So Apple sent Woz an iPhone 10.  He says he bit the bullet. He gave it a go.  It works fine, but it's not what I want.  I think what I would want is Woz says what I say, a touch ID on the back.  I want that more than anything.  Face ID slows down my Apple pay and it fails enough time.  I have to keep typing the password.  He said, I have friends who actually turned off the face ID  and turned passwords on to make their phone simple to use.  Actually, that's what Steve Gibson, our security guy, has done  because he doesn't trust face ID. No.  And of course, we know a long password, not the six digit numeric code,  but the long passwords, the most secure thing you can do.  It's very inconvenient, but that's what Steve says.  He's never going to use face ID.

You know, and it worked all the time.  Yeah, but come on. But yes.  That's enough of an impediment. That's not a wide scale vector attack.  But I just I dislike having companies say to me,  yes, you don't need things like fingerprints anymore  because we've got this spiffy new system.  I happen to like fingerprints.

They're the big, powerful guy, exerting their power,  continually getting more power and wealth over us.  Apple is the one that makes its money off good products,  not off its customers.  I don't disagree with that.  I'm getting a little nervous about the strength and the power of Google  and particularly of Facebook.  I feel that Facebook has an ability.  I'll propose this and I wonder what you guys say.  We are at this point completely reliant on Mark Zuckerberg's goodwill.  Because should he decide  that he wants Vladimir Putin to be president, he could do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought the points at me were excellent.  It's some quasi it's it's first of all, the circle is a circular campus  with everything from rock climbing walls to yoga mats to everything.  And and there's so it's about a young woman,  Emily Watson, who starts to work for them in the customer service  and is really strong armed into being part of the circle.  And you have to put all your information up there.  Eventually, she ends up wearing a camera that watches her every move  and becomes an iJustine style celebrity who is always on the air  to the point where she accidentally reveals her parents having sex  to 10 million viewers, much to her parents' grin and hers.  I and I won't tell the whole story, not that it's going to spoil a bad movie  because it was a bad movie.  But I thought that I really did at every step of the way think that's plausible.  I could see that Tom Hanks plays the, you know, the eminent screes in it.

Transcript:  I mean, we know Facebook can affect people's moods.  And we know that by jiggering around with their newsfeed,  as Facebook did in an academic study, which they didn't tell anyone about  until after they'd done it, that by jiggering around with the stories  that people get, they can make them more depressed or more happy.  This is an enormous amount of power.  But at the same time, I kind of get the feeling  if Facebook abuse it too much, then the next social network will come along.  And I think it's going to be the next big social network is going to be the one  that doesn't take all this information.

Transcript:  in that by saying at this point, Facebook, the one and only,  has way too much power, knows way too much about us  and clearly has the ability and willingness to use things that it knows about us.  Saw a great TED talk, which everybody should see Zeynep Tufiki talking about  some interesting studies that that ProPublica and others were able to do.  For instance, imagine this.  We know, as you just said, that Facebook can do sentiment analysis on your posts.  And it is likely that Facebook can, for instance, by looking at your posts,  analyze it and find people who are  who have suffering for bipolar disease.  Bipolar disease has two features.  One is depression. The other is a manic phase where in the manic phase is not at all.  And by the way, this is very widespread.  It's a large percentage of the population has it.  I may have it. Many family members do.  In the manic phase, people spend outrageously.  Now, what if Facebook says, all right, well, we have categorized  a certain number of views on that spectrum.  We now know from your posts, you're in the manic phase.  A gambling company comes to them and says, you know, it'll be a great time  to advertise our casino deals because these people emotionally  are completely vulnerable to that ad.  That sounds to me like something Facebook could do today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's just an example.  It could be some other thing. Right.  You know, but that's the point is that you combine these things  that Facebook knows about us with with its monetization strategy,  which is to sell very highly.  We know this very highly targeted ads  and really a strong reluctance, we know, to tell us what it's doing.  They still haven't shown us the political ads, the dark ads that they know.

Start time: 3386.76

If we if people really knew what these dark ads looked like,  they'd be very upset.  And how tightly targeted they were. Yeah. Yeah. Of course.  So, again, I ask the question, it seems like the only thing  that could stop Facebook is us trust.  So if we don't trust Zuck, then what we need to do is start  that cascade to the next network.  You have any candidates? No. Instagram.  Oh, they're on by Facebook.

But if we see a movement to like the next great social network,  it's not going to be the way that it used to be, where it was just like  my space is in and then my space was out.

I don't know how you beat them. What do you do?  Unless people go, oh, this is terrifying.  These guys are too powerful. Well, unless they get caught.  That's the thing. Yeah.

I wouldn't be surprised if we saw more of our social networking move to that  where we've we've done the thing, right?  We've done the let's touch everybody with one degree separation.  And that is Facebook.  But sometimes you don't really want that.  And I mean, I could see I could see a network or a future in a network  where you'd use something like Facebook almost as a white pages  where you you find people.  And then once you actually wanted to get to know people,  you'd move over to an encrypted system and get get get the heck off of,  you know, any kind of platform that would willingly sell or monetize your data.

The problem is there's nothing really out there that is good enough to replace.  I mean, L.O. tried to kick off what about 18 months ago,  and that seems to have died on its backside.

Wicker three point eight million.  Wicker is the one Uber uses to.  Yeah, it's a signal.  My my signal is very strong.  We know Telegram is not particularly strong.  No. Or we think it's not strong.

I'm sure Facebook messages ten times WhatsApp. Yeah.  So but yeah, you could talk about these, but they're tiny, tiny fractions.  And maybe that's OK, because we'll use them.  But the vast majority, your mom and dad, your brother and your sister, your children,  they're all going to be using Facebook for, I think, for the foreseeable future.  I don't see that changing, particularly since Facebook is extremely  aggressive about preserving market share more than any company I've seen in a long time.  True. More than since Microsoft.

Transcript:  It's professional grade. It is professional.  Oh, they're coming for me.  Our show, our show today.  But you don't have Christmas decorations, do you?  No, not yet.  We got where's the Festivus poll?  Is it up yet? We wait.  We wait till the 23rd to put that up.  We got rid of the poll when we moved.  We left it in the old place.  Now I've got some grievances to air.  All right. Our show today brought to you by the tracker,  a coin sized tracking device that pairs with your smartphone  and keeps you from losing stuff.  We spend on average almost an hour a day, 55 minutes a day,  according to Newsweek, looking for stuff we know we have,  but we don't know where we put it.  For me, it's my keys.  For some people, it's remotes.  For some people, it's briefcases or purses or wallets.  Somebody suggested I'm going to do this to put a tracker on your drone,  on my quadcopter.  Always looking for that. Never know where that is.  And now with the tracker pixel, you can put it on anything.  Eight years ago, tracker changed everything we knew  when they released their first tracking device.  They were the pioneers here.  Using Bluetooth LA, they pair to your phone.  They have two-way separation alerts.  When you leave your phone behind, your keys make noise,  or your tracker does if it's on your keys.  When you leave your tracker behind, your phone makes noise.  You can push a button on the tracker and it'll make the phone ring,  even if it's silenced.  And this new tracker pixel is so small, it's the size of a dime,  weighs less, small enough to fit in your smallest items.  And I love it because they're colorful.  They have eight different, nine, ten different colors you can choose from.  And they have these LEDs around the ring that light up.  So that's actually very handy because a lot of times  when I've lost, say, the remote control, it just fell down behind a cushion.  So making a noise and lighting up like that, that really helps.  It's a 90 decibel alert, so you will find it in seconds  and even in the dark thanks to those LEDs.  You can even locate your item if it's miles away.  And this is cool. So Bluetooth tracking devices are limited  to the range of Bluetooth. It's about 150 feet.  So what happens, you might say, if you leave your purse on a park bench,  you wander away in a Good Samaritan, then picks it up  and brings it to the lost and found.  Well, every tracker user is part of the world's largest crowd locate network,  about five million strong right now, all over the world.  When somebody else running the tracker app just walks by,  they don't have to do anything, just walks by your tracker,  a notification pops up on your phone saying,  hey, we just saw your keys or your purse or your bicycle or your luggage.  That is awesome. And you get a map and you can go right to it.  Tracker makes a great gift. In fact, if you're giving gadgets,  if you're giving technology for the holidays, stuff some trackers in the stocking.  They're small, they're inexpensive, and you'll save 20% off your order  when you go to the tracker.com slash twit.  That's the tracker.com slash twit. 20% off.  It's spelled a little funny. T-H-E-T-R-A-C-K-R.com slash twit.  Just load up the cart and then take 20% off your order at the tracker.com slash twit.  We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.

We can tweet about it.  And they will ignore that.  But do you think Comcast is going to come out of the box and just start saying,  oh, by the way, you want the Google tier of internet?

They'll offer a special fast lane for gamers because gamers will always pay extra to actually  get that little edge. And then there'll be people, they'll do a mix in. They'll either take money  from Netflix directly or they'll do something along those lines. And because you've got such a  closed and uncompetitive telco market here, then there's going to be those few ISPs. I know yours  and I both follow net neutrality principles, but we're very lucky in that we actually have a choice  of ISPs that we can do this with. Whereas 86% of the country only has two choices.

End time: 4405.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or what?  No, there will be. Yeah, we're I mean, just because just because the FCC votes a certain way next  Thursday does not mean that this issue is over, especially not from a legal standpoint, right?  The courts are going to be the next to win.  Yeah. Oh, absolutely. And that's the scary, the scariest thing of all, right? Because we  really haven't seen a lot of motion either way from the Supreme Court on this topic. And that  like, if it makes its way to the Supreme Court, that's, that's where this may live or die.

Start time: 4408.15
End time: 4451.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. And I'm not, as you say, I'm not entirely happy about about the courts ability to either  deal with this in a nonpartisan way or all that particular knowledge of technology.  I mean, you could solve an awful lot of this stuff by doing what we call in the UK, local  loop unbundling, which means, you know, networks have to be available for all companies to sell  on. You used to have that situation here in the US. And then they allowed networks to sort of  kick out an awful lot of competitors. You lost a thousand ISPs and you lost your competitive market,  which is why, you know, for mobile phones, for internet access, for data services, Americans pay  more than pretty much every other developed country out there. It makes no logical sense  other than the fact that telcos like it and the lawmakers agree with them.

Start time: 4454.40
End time: 4480.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The only reason I didn't bring it up is I don't, I don't even know what we could say or do about it.  I mean, certainly anybody watching us is, I think, been educated enough by this point to know that  we want to preserve net neutrality. Twitter wouldn't exist without that neutrality.  Google wouldn't exist without net neutrality.  That's the problem, by the way. At this point, it's in Google's interest because Google is an  incumbent. The people who made it can afford to keep on the good size of ISPs.

Start time: 4480.84

Start time: 4484.70
End time: 4548.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you want a competitor to Facebook, if you want a competitor to YouTube, if you want a competitor  to Amazon, you better have net neutrality because otherwise those companies will just  not get a chance. They'll die on the vine, as Twitter would have if we were starting out.  I don't know if we might still. I mean, if all of a sudden your ISP said, well, we're going to give  you, Google's paying us extra, so we're going to give you high speed access to YouTube. But anything  other video you download or stream, that's going to cost you more, in effect. I would imagine that  would hurt our download numbers and eventually we would suffer and maybe even go out of business.  For me, it is a life or death issue. I'm hopeful. Again, this is like putting your trust in Mark  Zuckerberg. I'm hoping that the courts will fix it. If courts don't fix it, the Congress will fix it.  If Congress doesn't fix it, the consumers will stand up and be counted and keep these companies  from becoming rapacious. I don't have high hopes. What else do you have?

End time: 4588.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I read something yesterday. I don't have a link immediately available, but where somebody was  talking about the idea of Facebook and Google, and certainly Google could do it because it has  already started doing it, creating an ISP that essentially, that selling point was, we will adhere  to net neutrality rules, even if the others don't. The only problem is, of course, that you have to  connect to those other networks so they can charge you more in order to do it. But certainly Google  has part of the infrastructure in place in some cities. They've slowed it down. Only in a few,  though. Right, only in a few. They also have Project Five. Yeah, but that may be, and some

Start time: 4590.14

Start time: 4599.46
End time: 4619.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  getting that going. It is pretty susceptible to interference. So I'm not sure necessarily  that that's the case. But there could be the right, I mean, suppose that Agit Pai is correct and the  market will correct for it. The market could correct for it by creating an ISP who essentially

Start time: 4619.82
End time: 4670.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  honors it. Yeah, except that no one would have, the ISP would not have the last mile, so it  wouldn't matter. We do. As you said, we have SonicNet. SonicNet honors it. And I think every  single person listening to the show should be using SonicNet with no bandwidth caps and they  stand up for you. But you can't because they're only in a few markets, just like Google Fiber's  only in a few markets. And by the way, you can guarantee the FCC is going to continue rules  that keep companies from putting their wires up on existing telco poles, that keep municipalities  from starting their own internet services. They've already done that. You can guarantee  that they know where the loopholes are and they're going to close those down too. Because basically  the FCC is working for Verizon, Comcast, AT&T. Well, with that and shutting down public municipal

Start time: 4670.58
End time: 4694.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  networks. They don't want municipal networks. But they've worked very well. But no, it's like  states have said, no, we can't possibly have anything interfering with private industry  doing this. And private industry is doing a lousy job of it. So let's get some competition  in the market and actually see what shakes out. But based on the current formation of the FCC,  I just don't see it happening. They're bought and paid for, as far as I can tell.

And I'll just sit on the couch and do my own thing and occasionally look up and  I like the story, right? I like the end piece, but I don't necessarily enjoy the button mashing and  all of the heart rate panic that comes from trying to dodge being killed by zombies.  And if you can get that with a witty podcast that where you enjoy the people,  I guess I can kind of see it. I don't personally enjoy it, but I can at least see where people  get excited off of this. And especially if they're into the game too, because then it's like,  oh, I can get tips from that. It's the same reason why people watch it.

Figures based on YouTube, SocialBlade and Captivate because you can't really-  Nobody releases these numbers.  And I would point out that these numbers probably are a little bit off.  We don't really- We don't know.  That's an 80% jump, by the way, from last year. So lots of money being made on YouTube.  Six-year-old Ryan of Ryan's Toy Reviews. He's a six-year-old.  He opens toys and plays with them. He has 8 billion views.  8 billion views.  Yeah.  Evan Fong, Mark Fishback, 2 billion views. These aren't Seinfeld numbers.  These aren't Eurovision contest numbers. These are unheard of.  If these numbers are to be believed.  Evan Fong is number two. He has $15.5 million, billions of views.  Branded deals worth hundreds of thousands of dollars each.  Merchandised teens love gamers can now earn more than ever on the streaming site.  We're talking about YouTube. And of course, you're right.  This doesn't include Twitch, Amazon's service, which might even be more money.  So you're talking about Jake and Logan. Jake Paul is number seven. He made $11.5 million.  His older brother Logan, number four, he made $11.5 million.  New York Times called him the YouTube villain. Enraged their LA neighbors.  They live in a mansion with a bunch of other millennials.  With a whole bunch of supporters camped out outside.  Set mattresses on fire and do crazy stuff. But people love crazy stuff.

I know Vilegrounds comes out for my Xbox  a couple of weeks, but that doesn't put, I'm not in the gamer culture, obviously.  There's many verticals. There's console gamers, there's PC gamers, there's set the mattress on  fire gamers. I don't know. I sound like an old guy. It's the difference between, again, if we want

Start time: 5335.90
End time: 5381.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to bring this over to the tech sphere, it's the difference between your casual tech enthusiast  who really enjoys tech and the Android fanboys with an eye who are like, oh my God, stuff.  And that's every single company I don't want to pick on Android.  No, in fact, we celebrate those guys. Those are our fans.  Yeah, yeah. They are, but there can be a dark side to any kind of fandom.  Just there can be a dark side to Android. There can be a dark side to toy fandom. There can  certainly be a dark side to gaming fandom. And I think the thing to remember is we need to not  celebrate the dark side. We need to promote the good, like Felicia Day's gaming culture is a much  better representation of, hey, look, here are gamers who actually enjoy sunlight and friends

Start time: 5381.42

If people do,  that's fine. The only thing that I see is a little bit of a negative is Google is happy to have these  numbers come out and do this. They do their own list. They're really happy to make these guys  celebrities because for these 10 people, there are a hundred thousand young kids earning nothing,  who are busting their ass, who are building YouTube's platform for YouTube and making money  for YouTube, but making very little money themselves. And it's kind of like the NBA. They're  kind of looking at these $16 million people saying, I want to be that guy. And most, and they're not  obviously going to make that. Some of them might. There is some turnover in this list. There's a lot.

Transcript:  these brothers originally got popular on YouTube because they had a big vine following. Right. And  they transmitted the vine following into YouTube and now they monetized it that way. You know,  these are not people just making this up. They've worked it out and this is why you  can't begrudge them the money they're making. I don't, I absolutely don't. The only thing I  do begrudge them is, is the stuff that they're making. When you've got this platform, maybe try

I don't say if they're  catering to an audience and the audience loves them, they're making 16 and a half million dollars  a year more power to them, but it does tell you something about the audience or not. True.

Start time: 5493.20
End time: 5502.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's talk about Patreon because this did not get a lot of coverage except that everybody who's on  Patreon or knows somebody on Patreon was very upset about this. What happened?

Start time: 5504.20
End time: 5594.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh gosh. Well, in a nutshell, Patreon decided that they were going to change their subscription terms.  So essentially they had a problem in that when you sign up to support, say I decided to support,  you know, my friend who does comics and I sign up on the 15th of the month, I'm not actually going  to get charged for my pledge to them. Say I want to pay them $10 a month or $10 a creation. I don't  get charged for that until the end of the month. So Patreon was getting ire from both creators and  backers supposedly saying, hey, why do I get charged three weeks later for this thing that  I forgot I pledged to? And creators are like, oh, these people signed up to get my stuff  and then vanished before the thing could get charged. And so their argument is, oh, well,  instead of charging everybody at the end of the month, we're going to charge you when you sign up.  But that means we have to switch our payment plans around. So it means that we're going to have to  charge individual processing fees. So we're changing our processing fee structure. So now,  instead of creators paying the percentage of credit card processing fees when they get the pledges,  instead the backers are going to be paying those processing fees. And in addition to a percentage,  I think it's 2.2% or something like that, you're also getting a flat 35 cent fee.  So for instance, if you pledge a dollar to somebody, it's now going to be $1.40 from your

Start time: 5596.50
End time: 5607.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  checking account every month. So the biggest change is that you as the donor are paying now  instead of the creator. The creator is going to get more money, right? In theory. The problem with

Start time: 5608.26
End time: 5716.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  this obviously is that donors are obviously upset and creators are upset because they're not,  Patreon is not letting them make the call, right? If Patreon said, okay, well, we're going to let  you choose whether as a creator, you take the hit of the extra, the percentage fee, or you make your  backers take the hits. And that got some people upset that there's no choice. But I think the  real issue and the issue that I think a lot of Patreon creators have kind of rallied around  is that their initial messaging around this was very vague and very frustrating. And even their  clarification as to why they decided to make that change, as I explained to you, it's, it sounds in  theory, like you're trying to fix a good problem. But we get that in coupled with a recent blog post,  basically a guest blog post that was made from their, their head of growth marketing,  that essentially said, hey, you know, Patreon's really great. But what we really want to do is  move our business structure more to the people who will make their living off Patreon and focus less  on the people who only make, you know, $200, $300 a month off of our service. And when you couple  that philosophy with the fact that Patreon has recently taken quite a lot of VC money,  including another round of, I think, 35 million in September, the picture starts to get a whole  lot more cloudy. And there starts to be the question of like, what is Patreon actually  doing here? Are they, are they actually trying to, in doing, in making this move, push people away  from $1 pledges to try and get the people who are on their service to be supported, you know, in  bigger and bigger dollar amounts so that they can get more profits? Or is this just as an issue of

Start time: 5717.26
End time: 5746.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  terrible messaging on their part? So Hank Green posted and his partner Jeff Jacks on their vlog  brothers podcast posted, for instance, on Twitter, all these people leaving because of the change in  fees, they're dropping their contributions. Are, is that, can we confirm that? Are people losing  donors, patrons in droves? So that's one concern is that there are a lot of people rely on Patreon.

Start time: 5747.50
End time: 5813.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Absolutely. I have a friend, Mikey Newman, who runs a really amazing video show called  movies with Mikey, which by the way, if you love film criticism, you should watch it.  But I think he's lost something like 95 patrons in the last, I don't know, in the last seven days,  basically eight days. And this is a guy who, you know, he he's pretty great. He wrote the scripts  for Borderlands and like, but he has, has a personal stuff that required him to make this  his full time job. And for him to, you know, to basically his entire livelihood be risked on a,  on a fee change. When, you know, you already have so much in your life that's, that's up,  you know, thrown into upheaval. It just, I don't think that Patreon really thought this through  from a perspective of like, the whole point of your platform is that you're giving people who  might not otherwise have a way to monetize their art, a way to monetize their art. And that doesn't  always mean people who are making, you know, three, five, $10,000 a month off of a project.  It's the people who are making just enough to cover their utilities or even a whole lot more. Like

Start time: 5813.78
End time: 5818.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 5818.94
End time: 5830.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And by basically saying the $1 pledges, you know, they're not really worth it to us.  It sets a really bad precedent for what they want their company to be.  There are, so they need to get on top of this.

Start time: 5830.96
End time: 5852.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There are competitors, but I mean, for instance, a Kickstarter just launched Drip, which is  exactly what Patreon does, but that doesn't solve the problem because if you have a bunch  of patrons on Patreon and you're doing, and you've been basing your business for a year or two on this  and all of a sudden your revenue is cut in half, it's not like you could say,  Hey everybody, follow me over to Drip. Maybe you can.

Start time: 5852.74
End time: 5896.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think you could. I mean, there's a, there's a guy in Australia I follow who does a YouTube  channel called Primitive Technology, where he recreates, you know, how to make a, you know,  pottery stuff and he's working his way up to the Bronze Age at the moment. He gets a lot of money  from Patreon and they're fascinating videos and with no sound whatsoever, but he's seen a massive  drop off in Patreon funds. Now, if he was to say to his supporters, okay, why don't we go to this  new platform? And if a lot of the big Patreon players turn around and say, yeah, we need to  shift to this new platform and this is why I'm explaining it to people, I think Patreon could be  cutting their own throat just in favor of short term profit. I kind of blame the patrons though.

Start time: 5896.92
End time: 5931.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I feel like the patrons, I think this was, all right, I don't know, this will be controversial.  I've always thought this was a little bit of a problem with Patreon is that it's a very, it's a,  it's easy to contribute and it's also easy to stop contributing and it's a thin thread that  holds people there. And all it took was this nudge, 35 cent nudge from Patreon and that people are  going, ah, yes, screw it. And I think that that really reflects more a problem with just the,  just the relationship between creators and patrons. I blame the patrons, no?

Start time: 5931.76
End time: 5947.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I see, I, my concern here is that there's more, it's much more nuanced, right? Where it's,  I don't think it's just, oh, it's an extra 35 cents. Well, now I'm not doing it. It's the,  the trust is gone, right? Well, that's the point is that the patrons are more pissed off at Patreon

Start time: 5947.90
End time: 5958.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  than they're supporting the creator and their pissed off-ness is saying, well, screw it. I quit.  Even though it damages your, it damages the person you're supporting.

Start time: 5960.36
End time: 6030.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not, it will in a, in a way, yes, but also you have to consider that the people who are giving  these kinds of pledges to, to Patreon users, like say you're signed up at the one or $5 level to,  to promote something, like to give money to somebody, you could just be buying their,  their merch, right? Buying their t-shirts or their books or whatever they're selling.  But maybe you don't, maybe you're a college kid, right? Maybe you don't actually have the  financial means to do that. And when Patreon rejiggers their fee structure and plays around  like this, what Patreon is essentially saying is, Hey, you, who only has a dollar a month  to support, maybe you support, you know, 10, 15 creators at a dollar a month. Now all of a sudden,  your budget to support those creators, because everything's essentially, you know, gone up  almost double in price. Okay. Now instead of supporting 15 people, I can only support like  six or seven. So I have to make that call. Who am I going to take away? And it's not that you  don't value those creators. It's that physically you just, you, you have to now decide who, who do  I value most because now that, that decision has been taken out of your hands. So it's an economic

Start time: 6030.70
End time: 6036.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 6036.76

Start time: 6041.50
End time: 6085.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  combination. Yeah. I mean, I think also Patreon, they've got this VC funding. They're actually  profitable. I think they make some like 8 million a year. Yeah. Not a huge amount. No, not a huge  amount. And certainly not enough to justify the valuation that's being put on the company.  And I think this is what comes back to what Sorrenti was saying. Well, they're hoping this  will do is mean that, you know, all these, all the sort of the one and the $2 bit payers that  don't really make them that much money, they can just go away. We'll focus on the really big players  and we'll get our valuation from then. And you're just like, yeah, that might work to get you to an  IPO, but it kills the platform. You know, all it's going to take is somebody with enough of a, a  following together and they can take Patreon down. We've, I know Jack Connie, we've had him on a few

Start time: 6086.02
End time: 6132.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  times. We had Pamplemousse on a few times, the founder of Patreon, who was a creator, was an  artist and made music and couldn't make a living and created Patreon because he saw an opening.  I think he has genuinely a good heart here and is trying to do the right thing. But this is what  happens when you do a deal with the devil. When you do a deal with venture capital, the pressure  changes that you don't, you lose control of what you can do. And I guarantee you when you, when you  have a $400 million valuation on an $8 million net, there's pressure from the VCs. Okay. Oh yeah.  We got to turn that around. Well, this is not a return on our investment. And so I suspect that  that's the problem. I don't necessarily blame Patreon. I blame their investors who are probably  putting a huge amount of pressure on Patreon. Well, I think people are panicking in this

Yeah, exactly.  And so they raised $400 million. No, no, I'm sorry.  No, they raised money to a valuation of, yeah. But that money is now largely gone.

Look,  somebody's throwing a lot of money at us. Let's take it and not understand the deal you're doing  and the risks you're taking. It's been a hard thing for me. Not that anybody's been throwing  money at me, but I want control. I don't want to lose control. I mean, that was the highest value

Start time: 6898.94
End time: 6941.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  brilliant. Here is the number 10, but in my mind, this will always be number one in my heart.  Children interrupt the BBC news. It hasn't lost any of its charm, has it? Shifting, shifting.  You see, he shoves the kid back, tries to maintain his calm. That hurts me.  Yeah. The little kid comes in in the walker. Now mom comes in, by the way, mom's pants are halfway  down. So she was obviously in the bathroom and she's sneaking out hoping that she's not on camera.  Pulling the children. I still get a kicker. This is why YouTube works. And then the hand.

Start time: 6943.98
End time: 6953.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

End time: 6992.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  me. Everything else is cute. But we've seen interviews with him since. I mean, we actually  dissected this when it happened. He was in the bedroom on a Skype call with the BBC.  He's even in fact, if you look at it, he's even got, he's carefully staged his bedroom. He's put  some books on the world bed there. He's got a world map behind him just to make it look,  feel a little bit like it's, you know, like something kind of professional. He's probably  not wearing pants, but my suspicion is the reason he doesn't get up and get the kid is  there's nothing below the tie. I mean, he's probably, we put on, he was wearing shorts.

Transcript:  He went called by the BBC from dinner. I've been there. So, yeah, sure. And it's the Bebe,  right? You don't know. I mean, I did an interview with the BBC World Service at Defcon this year.  Yeah. And because we were doing it over Skype, we had to get, I had to get the hotel room as  quiet as possible. So I had to turn the air conditioning off, but because it was on radio,  it didn't really matter that way. And so I did the entire interview, my pants and the temptation at  the end of it to say, this has been Ian Thompson in his pants. By the way, for those of you who

And the idea is parents will, oh, look how happy the music is, will approve.  And Sheryl Sandberg, who is a mom, COO of Facebook. It must be good, right? She's a mom, as a mom.  And so the idea is that you approve, they can only message with people you approve, obviously  friends and family, nobody else. Let's get those kids messaging. I think we should. I've mixed  feelings about that because kids do want a message. They do. And it's a skill that's useful. Did you

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  read the announcement about this? It was one of the creepiest things you can imagine because  they were saying, we're not going to sell adverts to these kids and you get a strict control of  who they speak to, but we are going to share the information on their viewing habits within the  Facebook family. Including advertisers, right? Yeah. So it's kind of like one of those really  creepy twisted families where everyone spies on everyone else. Now Facebook says there are no ads

The provision about sharing  information with vendors from the privacy policies for things like providing infrastructure,  deliver messages, CDNs and things like that. On the other hand, Facebook's known for, you know,  doing stuff first and then asking, you know, apologizing later. Yeah. Well, just because

Start time: 7156.38
End time: 7167.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  what you want to do is get somebody in the Facebook meat grinder as early as possible  because the more data points you can get about that person, by the time they are 13 and you  could show them ads, you know a lot, you know everything. I think Dwight was spot on on this

Transcript:  to be on both of them. Yeah. We signed, Lisa signed up our 14 year old for a 15 year old now. He just  had his birthday for with Facebook when he was born so that she would have his name and let him in.  Well, that makes sense. I mean, I signed up for, I got my kids dot com addresses when they were  born, right? I mean, but at the same time, she didn't let Michael use it until he was a little  bit older. And I think the best thing to do would be to, if you're going to do it, train them in how  to protect themselves and protect their privacy. Use it as a teaching tool so that they understand  what Facebook can do with the information and why you don't want to give them too much information.  I don't know. I have, I'm torn because these kids are going to grow up in this world. You can't keep  them offline and hope that everything's going to work out. And I don't think I'm against kids being

Transcript:  on the internet because God knows I was, you know, I was in messaging boards from age nine or eight  or nine. Like I, you know, it's, that's okay. But you make a really good point in that the security  concerns have vastly changed. You know, when I was growing up, the internet concerns were,  okay, just don't give too much of information about yourself because you don't want to get  fished by a 36 year old man looking to meet 13 year old girls on the internet.  Now it's a lot more nefarious. Now it's, you don't actually, you don't have to worry about other  people. You also have to worry about the companies and you also have to worry about, you know,  specific data points that you're giving out. And if you're making up a fake, you know, a fake  personality, as many people often do when they're first going on the internet,  go be careful that that doesn't come back to buy you either. Like there's, it's just so much,  there's so much navigational straights that, that the kids have to go through these days that I  don't know. I just, I feel like why add another layer of complication to it? The, the let's make  this nice and friendly for children. No, you know what? Honestly, if, if you want to set your kids  up with a, with a group that they can talk to, if you want, you know, their friends or something  like that, it makes much more sense to set them up with like a signal group or something.

Our show today brought to you by Texture. I love magazines. Who doesn't love magazines?  I got to tell you though, with the cost and the clutter of buying magazines, even if you subscribe,  then there's the guilt factor. I got a pile of New Yorkers and never read.

Paul Thurock got to go. Ryan Shroud got to go. Lots of people we know got to  go. We didn't get to go. They announced the Snapdragon 845. But interestingly, that was  scooped by the Snapdragon 835 based Windows devices with quote, all day power.  If I were Intel, I'd be freaking out right now. This is not Intel's year. First they lose mobile,  right? Qualcomm and the ARM family just destroy them on mobile. Apple uses ARM architecture  license, but they make their own chips essentially like ARM chips, Qualcomm's and everything else.  But at least Intel still had the desktop and they still have the network center. ARM is in  the network center now. Because it's power curve is good. You don't use a lot of energy and  they seem to do a decent job. You're right. Intel probably still owns the premium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But yes, this fundamentally attacks the Windows, which has gone on with Windows pretty much since  the start. The big question here is can they make it work? Because our guy was trying these  new laptops out in Maui and he was saying you're looking at double the lag time. If he was typing  fast, the words were appearing after he typed them. Because it has to use emulation on certain  apps. Now they're going to port Microsoft Office to ARM, so you hopefully get rid of the emulation  lag there. In fact, the new devices which come from Lenovo and Acer and others

Start time: 8015.04
End time: 8036.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  start with Windows 10S, which is the version of Windows that is low power and only runs  UWP apps from the Windows Store. Those probably, I would guess, run at full speed. They're designed  to run on ARM. They're compiled for ARM. But if you said I want to upgrade it to Windows 10 Pro  and I want to put Chrome on it, Chrome would not run well. No, you've got to run it through an

Start time: 8036.62
End time: 8067.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  emulator which can add. The estimates they saw was basically it doesn't quite double the speeds,  but it nearly doubles them. That's really, really worrying. But I think the Windows 10S is key on  this one because I think they're clearly aiming this at student markets. But I'm just looking  at the prices of some of these things. They're not that low. They're five to seven hundred bucks.  Yeah, eight hundred in some cases. I don't know what the others feel about this, but that just  seems an insane price for it. It's essentially just like a big battery Windows machine.

Start time: 8068.52
End time: 8093.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They also only run 32-bit. You have to run 32-bit apps if you're using Windows Pro.  That's the emulation.  And not everything will run on it. So, for example, there are some classes of antivirus that won't  run at all on it. And it kind of reminds me, remember, Leo, the 95% IBM compatible computers?  That's what that reminds me of.

Transcript:  Unfortunately, Intel is also having a problem with its management engine.  The Intel management engine, which is in almost all Intel chips, not normally designed to  hook up to management unless you have a vPro system and you have an Intel network card.  And so there are ways to mitigate that. The problem is there are, at last count, seven CVEs,  that's seven exploits that could be taken advantage of if an attacker had local access  to your system. So it's the point now where Dell, Lenovo, Purism, System76 are offering  PCs with the Intel management engine physically disabled.

Start time: 8162.58
End time: 8166.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's worth, yeah, don't. I mean, I guess if you are an enterprise, that's a use of the  management engine is designed for enterprise, but there are some big problems. And we had been  talking about this last month, but they're back again. Intel has published a page with a program  you can run. If you are using a Windows or a Linux machine, you might want to run this program to see  if your system is vulnerable.

Start time: 8192.08

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There is a remote vulnerability exploit CVE 2017-5712 with a valid administrative Intel  management engine credential. So that means somebody would have still had to hack you at  first, but then they could remotely access your system. And Steve Gibson reported this last week  on Security Now, the JTAG engine is exposed, which means that you could use the USB port to  hack your machine. You just come along, you got a just little USB doggle plug it in,  and you're done. So this gives you full access route and everything might want to might want  to check with your motherboard manufacturers, see what their plans are. So a bad week for Intel  all around. Johnny Ive is back taking control of Apple's design team. I think I have to say yay.  Yay. Yay. Feels like he ever leave. Yeah, he was doing this the campus. And he had focusing  on the campus. Well, I don't I didn't see a lot of his presence. They had two guys, Alan Dye,  Vice President of user interface design, and Richard Hallworth, Vice President of industrial  design running the design for the last two years, they just disappeared from their non persons,  they've disappeared now from the management page at apple.com. But john and johnny i've after an  inquiry from Bloomberg has said, Yes, I am I am in control. And I think a good thing because  iOS 11 had all sorts of problems. I, Apple has had a lot of security issues, but just mostly on iOS

I mean, yeah, the other was  the watch, but that's kind of everyone else is doing it. They were just copying it. But there  seems to be a real innovation lack in Apple at the moment, in terms of where they what they're  going to do after the Tim is not an innovation guy. You wouldn't expect an operation. No, he's

Start time: 8320.66

Start time: 8326.82
End time: 8397.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the problem with with Johnny Ive is that you need somebody who keeps him in check.  Because Johnny is like he has an amazing stable of ideas and creations. But you know, he also  created a back there, you know, $250 art book. That's just pictures. Yeah, you know, so there's  there are limits and there are levels here. Oh, yeah, it was a gift. It's a beautiful book. I've  seen it. It's a beautiful book. And you know what? It's very impressive. But if I  had to pick the things that I'd like my you know, break, you know, life changing technology  experts to focus on, it would not be a $250 book as much as I love books. That said, I don't think  that this is as big of a deal as people are making it out to be. Because I can't imagine that Johnny  let anything slide by without even giving it a peripheral glance. iOS and Mac OS have serious  problems right now. And I'm not going to downplay that at all. But I don't necessarily think that  it's Johnny and the design team that's that's at fault here. I think it's it's a little bit of a

Start time: 8397.96

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

But it's not  that you know, it's not to that extent. But in terms of, you know, and I do have to disagree  with you on the on the watch being, you know, just something everybody else is doing. Because  speaking as somebody who owns a 38 millimeter watch, which is the only thing that will actually  fit on my wrist, like there is no other company right now that has been able to do what Apple  has done in the form factor that Apple's made for for women, especially, or for people with small  risks like there. There is definitely innovation going on here in a level that I think gets

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  know, what does a smartwatch do really, I think you really need to find how it works for your life.  Like for me, as a health tool, this is, you know, life changing, especially because of the training  that I do for roller derby and everything else. Without it, I wouldn't be able to tailor my  workouts nearly as effectively. And then in combination, what Apple's doing for all purpose  health with the heart study app that just came out that they're enrolling people in to check for  atrial fibrillation and things like that. The fact that Alivecore just released a band that,  you know, that hooks to the watch that can take an instantaneous EKGE.

Start time: 8551.82

Start time: 8569.00
End time: 8608.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  massive. That is really important. Well, you saw the story about the man who had a, who had,  who had actually was the original Apple watch. It didn't use the feature where if you're sitting  still in your heart races, it suddenly tells you he had an app doing that and it happened to him.  And he wound up going to the hospital. He had a pulmonary embolism and the watch probably saved  his life. And that story was one of the reasons why I wound up getting an Apple watch eventually,  because I've had pulmonary embolisms. And the idea that this watch, you know, could,  could alert me to that happening again is very, that's one of the reasons I got it.

Start time: 8609.28
End time: 8626.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Serena, do you use the heart rate, what do they call it? Variability interval?  Yeah, I do. So this is a, I want you to tell me about this. So what it measures is the variability  between the beats. Like if it should be fairly consistent and if it's not, is that a problem?

Start time: 8626.22
End time: 8718.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Tell me what that means. No. So interestingly, and this kind of goes against what I think people  understand about heart rate, heart rate variability. It's actually important for your heart rate to be  variable. So you actually want it to be at a high variability because that means that your heart can  adjust quickly. What that's basically saying is say that I'm sitting down at rest, right? And then  all of a sudden I get up and I jog for 20 seconds. If I have a high heart rate variability, my heart  is very able to very quickly adjust to that. So it's not going to take, like my heart's not going  to have to go into overdrive to compensate for the fact that it was just sitting. Whereas if you have  a low heart rate variability, it means it takes a lot longer for sort of things to get into gear.  So it's actually, this is something that's constantly changing. So it's not just like I  have a low or a high and then that's it forever. Your heart goes through patterns depending on how  hard you're working at any one point and whether or not you regularly work out. So one of the reasons  why it's so useful to athletes is you can actually look at it. If you have a high heart rate variability  on that day, that actually says you are at peak rest, which means that you can do the most work.  And after you've done a hard workout, you can check your heart rate variability at the end of  that day. And that'll tell you for the next day, hey, you can still do some work or your heart rate  variability is low. Your body needs to rest and recover. And then you can do another day of hard  work the day after that. So there are a lot of really, really interesting studies. And that's

Start time: 8718.28
End time: 8722.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

There's an app called Smart Gym  that I love that allows you to keep your routines when you go to the gym and not just start workout.  It actually shows you here are your supersets. Here's what you need to weight lift. Here's,  and has perfect individual timers for each motion that you're doing. Oh, you're doing three minutes  of rowing. You do that. Then that timer's done. Okay. Now it's time for 30 seconds of jumping  jacks. Okay. That kind of stuff is so much more useful on a watch versus on a piece of paper  or on your phone. It just, it makes it more simple.
