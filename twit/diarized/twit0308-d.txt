I should say right up front this is going to be a crappy show because both Brian and I have  spent the entire week playing in Google+.  We weren't doing any of our homework. It depends on how you look at it.

Transcript:  Hey, it's great to be back, Leo. Thanks for having me.  I spent the week in a mountain cabin on the equivalent of dial up connection  using Google Plus, so I don't know what that means,  but I feel like I'm bringing something of an old school taste to the table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love it. That's why you go there.  We did bring in an expert, a ringer, ladies and gentlemen,  from search engine land.com. Danny Sullivan is here.  And he quite legitimately, although I noticed in one of your posts  on Google Plus, you said, I don't feel like I've I feel like I'm playing hooky.  He spent a lot of time on Google Plus.

Start time: 232.92
End time: 254.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I guess that's the is that not the top story of the week after all, is Google Plus?  I mean, this is to me, this is more than Google adding another thing.  This is more than buzz or wave this to me.  And I think that this seems to be the case with Google as well.  And I'm going to ask you, Danny, since this is your beat,  is is almost a reinvention of Google, a pivot of Google.

Start time: 257.23
End time: 315.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, I'd be mixed.  Google is very big on saying, hey, this is just us making everything at Google  social, and it's not about competing with Facebook.  It's a whole it's a whole new way of looking at what you do at Google,  which is a clever thing to do if you're trying to compete against Facebook,  but you don't know if you're going to win.  To me, this is very much a Facebook and to some degree, a Twitter competitor.  They suggested that, you know, you've got this whole sharing capability  that's all integrated into Google, and yet the reality is not really that integrated.  I can go to Google Plus and I can share links.  But if I'm in Google Web Search and I want to share that web search,  there's no integration with Google Plus.  I can actually plus one things, but those plus ones don't actually flow back into Google Plus.  If I'm in Gmail, I don't think there's any integration of Google Plus  that's sitting up over there.  It's to me very much Google Plus is a Google Plus new product that Google has rolled out.

Start time: 316.16
End time: 327.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  But is there any doubt that all of that is coming?  I mean, I think that's part of the reason for the highly limited release.  It's very clear that they wanted to start small and build and have  multiple iterations over a short amount of time before they build up to a public release.

Start time: 328.64
End time: 357.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So I'm more skeptical.  I think the reason they went with a limited release is because when they went  all out with buzz, they got burnt because they hadn't really thought about  a lot of the privacy stuff and how it might get used.  And so going into a limited release protects them a little bit more from that.  And in fact, I think they already spotted one example of where I think you had shared  something with a limited group and somebody reshared that with the public,  then it kind of expo to further.  Well, but that's that's what we already deal with.

Start time: 357.34
End time: 362.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  But yeah, if I if I email something to my mom, a photo of my daughter,  and she thinks it's adorable and sends it to everyone and it goes viral.

Start time: 363.40
End time: 402.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm not saying that that can't happen.  And in fact, even with the change that they made, it doesn't prevent somebody  from copying a picture and resending it out to the public.  But I think that they I think one of the things that they were surprised  and didn't expect was that, you know, by default, if you had done that,  they made it a little harder for people to do that.  I didn't think it was a big deal.  But that was one of the examples of things that I think that they were hoping to find  by doing the limited release.  And I totally agree.  I think they're going to roll out all sorts of new features.  And there could be all sorts of further integration with Google.  But I don't see this so far as, wow, we've made Google even more social.

Start time: 402.78
End time: 465.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me read to you from and by the way, this is a primary source document  which everybody who's interested in Google plus should read.  Stephen Levy at Wired magazine was able to follow this since for over a year now  when it was its code name Emerald Sea, and he was invited to be part of the development plan.  So there's a very good article on Wired.com.  You can read it right now.  But here's the quote from Vic Gundotra, who is senior vice president of social  and the leader of this Google plus project.  He says, Emerald Sea is not a Facebook killer, Gundotra told me.  In fact, he added somewhat purposely, quote, People are barely tolerant of the Facebook  they have, citing a consumer satisfaction study that rated it barely higher than the IRS.  Instead, he says the transformation will offer people a better Google.  Do you think that that's that's a disinformation or spin or do you think  that's really how they're thinking, Danny?  I mean, I think this is how they're thinking.  I think they're really trying to reinvent what they're up to.

Start time: 466.32
End time: 471.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So I mean, you're saying you're saying they're going after Facebook

Start time: 471.78
End time: 472.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and they just don't want to admit it.

Start time: 473.40
End time: 503.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yes, I do.  And if that means they also don't want to admit it to themselves,  and perhaps that's where some of the truth lies.  I think that Google often says things that they honestly believe,  even if the reality is completely different.  Right. You know, we don't really intend to wipe out everybody or something like that.  I mean, they don't.  They don't intend to destroy the earth.  Yeah, we didn't intend it.  We just we're trying to save it.  You're laughing at this, Neelai.  Why? The destruction of the earth was a side product.  I think that I think Google has truly believed in their hearts.

Start time: 503.96
End time: 505.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hold on. Hold on, Danny. Go ahead, Neelai.

Start time: 506.06
End time: 613.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go ahead. Oh, sorry.  Now, I'm saying one of the things that Google does not want to admit  is that humans can do some things better than computers. Right.  And in Levi's book, In the Plex, which is excellent, everyone should read it.  You know, the long narrative arc of that book is Google slowly  replaces everybody in its company with computers. Right.  And the people sort of decide what the computers are going to do.  And one of the things about search, which I think Google is having to realize,  is that if you're going to build PageRank and PageRank is going to scrape  links between sites to figure out what's important and relevant,  and you're going to ignore what actual humans who aren't publishing links are doing,  but are just sort of talking to each other, then you've got a mistake  because that body of people who are sharing links and talking about links  with their friends in a social way, they're generating more and better data  about the Internet than a bunch of, you know, a closed circle of like bloggers  and other sites. And they have to go and get those people. Right.  They have to figure out how to get that data and feed that into their algorithm.  And so I think for Google, this is about recognizing,  a, that people are better at doing this,  at figuring out what's important than their computer ever will be.  And two, it's about getting people into the system  and feeding their data about information into Google any way they can.  And if they have to trick people into doing it by saying, oh, it looks like Facebook,  that's what they're going to do.  And I think that's kind of where where their differentiation from Facebook  is internally. They're not building, you know, Facebook's product is social  networking. Right. It's look at these pictures of a girl from high school.  And that's a very compelling product.  Google's product is search.  And I think everything they do feeds into search in that way.  And I think that it's like they've mutated a social networking site  out of their desire to improve search.  So is this is this a case where you go back to the idea that it's

Start time: 613.46
End time: 622.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  that it's all about search and you talked earlier about why do we not see more  plus integration in the actual search for now?  That may change. And I'm kind of with Brian.  There's no search in plus.

Start time: 622.60
End time: 629.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I think that they you know, people are saying, oh, there's no hashtags.  There's not even a search.  I think this is something coming, obviously.  Yeah, it seems like it.

Start time: 629.74
End time: 634.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But are there antitrust issues at play?  I mean, is there a reason why they would hold that back?  And oh, come on, you can't get you.

Start time: 635.22
End time: 645.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Neely is the former lawyer, but I did.  Seems to me you can't sue somebody for not including search  and their own thing in search or can you?

Start time: 645.38
End time: 651.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I mean, that'd be awesome if you could sue for the features that you wanted.  I don't want them to do that.  You can't sue for that.

Start time: 651.28
End time: 659.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't sue Google into putting search in Google Plus.  Well, you can sue Google for is when they do put search in Google Plus.  And actually, there's arguments out there.

Start time: 659.62
End time: 665.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're saying that if YouTube, for instance, were searched better  than other video sites, that would be cause for antitrust.

Start time: 665.96
End time: 729.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, you know, there are arguments out there.  And, you know, the EU is going down this specific road where they claim  Google has a natural monopoly on search now. Right.  Because the way search is engineered and architected across the Internet  is that you have all these signals about what's important. Right.  So you have when you get a list of results and people click on results,  Google gets better at searching.  It says, OK, most people click on the third one.  So the third one must be better than the first one. Right.  And, you know, all these websites feedback and forth.  And they're collecting more data inherently than, say, Bing.  And so if you ask Microsoft, they'll say, well, Google has a natural monopoly  on search. They have to be restrained from exercising the monopoly in other places.  So they start to extend the signals they can get into places like Plus,  into places like YouTube.  And they start to build that monopoly even stronger using outside products.  Well, then you actually do have an argument that they're illegally  abusing that monopoly.  So whether or not any of that will happen or any government  or private party will make that claim, I mean, we'll have to find out.  Google has to put search in Plus first, but it's there.  It's probably something they consider.  Isn't that sad, though?

Start time: 729.76
End time: 742.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, that's that's really what we don't want is the government saying,  OK, Google, you've got to give a head start to Bing  because it's not fair that you're such a fast runner. Right.  That's not what we want.

Start time: 742.50
End time: 791.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's not. I don't think search is there right now  because it underlies the fact that this isn't a search product  and it's not coming off of the search team.  And in fact, when Buzz launched, you didn't have Buzz  and you couldn't search through and find Buzz post.  I think that might even still be the case.  It was almost like a forgotten, oh, yeah, we should do that as well.  In contrast, Google Plus One system apparently came out of the search team  and the search team saying, well, we need to figure out a way  for people to to give us better signals that we're going to use for search  and and integrate it in that way.  And it's entirely possible that you've got two rival social things  that have emerged. You've got Google Plus and Google Plus  One, which are kind of coming together.  But, you know, you could have sort of an Android Chrome  type of thing that's happening.

Start time: 792.46
End time: 800.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought Levi's article said that Plus One was originally part of Plus  and they rolled it out separately ahead of time.  Did I misread that? I didn't get to go through.  I haven't had a chance to go through as well.

Start time: 800.82
End time: 803.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  My sense is in many ways that's what was true about.

Start time: 803.82
End time: 813.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what's true about profiles. It was true about Plus.  They've been doing this for a year and a half.  Emerald Sea is not a brand new enterprise.  And I think that a lot of what Google's been doing has been.

Start time: 814.48
End time: 826.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, that's what's interesting is leaking bits of Plus out.  When they opened Google profile, to be honest,  the only reason I filled everything out is because I hoped it would give me  better SEO for, you know, people looking for fire eating or that kind of thing.  Well, not just that.

Start time: 826.44
End time: 830.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought it was going to be the canonical presence on the net.  Exactly. It was going to be identity on the net.

Start time: 831.08
End time: 854.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And I and I forgot about it for like a year and a half later.  And now when Google Plus launches, I suddenly realize, oh, wait, I've already  I signed up for Google Plus a year and a half ago and never even knew it.  And not only that, but as I use Google Plus, it's forcing me to acknowledge  other parts of the Google ecosystem that I never would have.  I would never have set foot into PICASA until this happened.  But now I want to share photos. I'm like, well, I guess I better  get that PICASA thing rolling out.  Well, better than that.

Start time: 854.06
End time: 861.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I take you back now one year to Twitter.  What what episode of Twitter is this?  You predicted you knew what was going on.  This is a year ago.

Start time: 861.88
End time: 915.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I'm not going to say that I necessarily predicted exactly circles,  but I'm going to say that Google definitely owes me one dollar.  Listen, number of options inside of this is this it?  And maybe they'll do this on diaspora.  But what if you just had like three different orbits?  You had the innermost orbit, which was your family, and you could place it.  It wasn't just you were a friend of them or you're not a friend.  But you had like, you know, you had you had your Mercury orbit closest to the sun.  You had your Jupiter orbit with these are friends.  These are colleagues. These are coworkers.  And then there's the last orbit, which is people you met at a party  and you kind of like.  And you could very quickly and simply and easily decide  what level of content you were releasing.  Then when you listen to that, when you listen to that, first of all, now,  you're brilliant.  Listen, listen to now the first like two sentences, the first 10 seconds  of the Google Circles explanation, which is in the cube.  The box is the same.  It almost sounds identical.  And here's what I've heard since that was 248.

Start time: 916.28
End time: 917.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that was 60 twits ago.

Start time: 917.80
End time: 929.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I've also heard that diaspora apparently.  But people are saying that this is not Google Circles is not new  because diaspora has a similar functionality, which means diaspora  also owes me one dollar.  That's two dollars that the Internet owes me.

Start time: 930.30
End time: 947.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So here's the origin.  This is the and by the way, I have to commend Google.  They obviously learned from bad launches of buzz and other products  that there's better ways to launch a product.  This is the they have a lot of pretty video that they did.  This is the beginning, you said, of their of their Google Circles explanation.

Start time: 947.96
End time: 952.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Explanation.  So if you heard what I just said there and then I have a lot of different people

Start time: 952.22
End time: 963.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  in my life, my college friends, my family, my coworkers and my biking buddies,  just to name a few.  I have lots to share, but I don't want to share everything with everyone.  That's one dollar, Google.

Start time: 964.18
End time: 966.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's one dollar.  Make it out to Brian Brush.

Start time: 967.24
End time: 1004.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to take a little credit away from you.  All right. There was a very  widely circulated.  I don't remember exactly when it was, but it's right around that time.  Widely circulated the slide stack from a Googler.  You remember this? Yes.  Where he did exactly explain that that was the problem.  And Mark Zuckerberg said nobody wants to create lists.  This was this has been bubbling up for a while.  This issue of it's not all one blob of things as it is on Facebook,  where you share pictures of you and your and your buddies  doing the unicorn dance in your in your chat and your and then your family  sees that. That's so Google even said that that this is a year ago.

Start time: 1005.62
End time: 1039.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So that is that is the best.  The best thing about Google Circles is the acknowledgment of asymmetry  of perspective. And it's not like Facebook.  Like I say, you're a friend and you say you're a friend and we are friends  or you make a group like I say, we're the Tuesday night hang up club.  And so that's how that's what we're going to name our little group.  And we're all going to say it because that's what I named it.  It's like the way I see you is not the way you see me. Right. Right.  And so that is the beauty of circles and that you shape your own world.  And you could put someone in like lovable family members  who I could barely tolerate to listen to and then put them in their own circle.  All right. But let's point this out Wednesday.

Start time: 1039.88
End time: 1072.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When is the first time that Google the circle names leak out for somebody  and somebody gets in trouble? Right.  Because that's what I'm waiting for is somebody's going to make, you know,  Lindsay Lohan is going to make assholes from the government.  One of her circles. Right.  And we're going to it's going to get leaked out. It's inevitable.  It's the more data I give to these services about like my actual opinions,  like the more terrified I become because I'm assuming somebody else will see them.  I'm publishing them only to myself.  But it's like one checkbox away from the entire world.  And that nobody else finds that terrifying.

Start time: 1073.22
End time: 1096.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Except on Twitter, where you can make all your lists public.  And if you want to say, assholes, I don't like you put them on a list.  Some people some people love that.  And I think there's some people right now who wish they could have their circles  exposed in exactly that way. You can't do it.  I isn't there. There's a privacy.  I wish I could expose circles of people that I've built in different areas.  So other people who are trying to find good people could follow, could do that.  And yet you can't.

Start time: 1097.32
End time: 1105.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think there's a privacy setting, though, that says that people can't tell if you're in  there, if they're in a circle or not.  So it is it all by default.

Start time: 1105.90
End time: 1114.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It'll show people you've put into circles.  It will not show you the names of those specific circles you put them into.  Which is exactly how it should be.

Start time: 1114.28
End time: 1115.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Because you should you should know.

Start time: 1115.58
End time: 1118.00

Transcript:  If I put you in a douchebag circle.  I don't want you to know that.

Start time: 1118.14
End time: 1132.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, but it should acknowledge because people want to know how large their reach is.  But it's like, I don't care how you interpret the results or what category you put me in your mind.  But it's important for me to know that a thousand people are going to hear this  when I say it or may hear it when I say it.  That's how long my reach is.

Transcript:  And that's how I think they're going after Twitter.  Right. I think that's sort of the important aspect of the service.  It makes it more like Twitter is that I have a lot of followers in Google plus now  who are not following back.  I'm just in their circle of like tech nerds or whatever it whatever it is.  Right. And I think what's funny about all of this to me is that, you know,  the advance in circles is not circles.  Right. You can make you can do this on Facebook with lists.  The advance here is that the list editor is so good.  Yes. That's that's sort of like an interesting thing to me is like it wasn't  the concept is old.  The concept has been on Facebook for years.  One of the most popular posts we had on Engadget like, you know, evergreen piece  of content we had was how to use Facebook lists.  And the advice they gave in that post was make three lists.  Call them people I don't know, my friends and my family.  And it's like that idea is there.  It's been there forever. Circles is just a really good editor.

Transcript:  And Circles is so upfront, too. Right.  Like it's not a thing that's that's somehow hidden in groups or whatever.  It's this thing that's that is the pinnacle of why you have a social network.  And I think it's T minus 10 seconds before we hear something from Facebook  that says, here's our version of Circles.

Transcript:  He already did this.  So I don't I don't think I don't think circles is that big a deal  in the sense that it's not a new concept.  What's the big deal is you sound and I don't even know exactly what it sounds like.  Whatever. And I've got a lot of people I'm trying to manage through that thing.  And let me tell you, when it crashes and it falls apart or I've got four  different people and I can't select them, there's a lot of improvements can happen.  What I think the the important thing that happening with circles is  Facebook is giving you this ability to have clean.  I'm sorry.  So Google Plus is giving you this ability to either do the clean slate  or the reset of your social network that you wish that maybe you could have done  when you started Facebook or when you started Twitter, where I see a lot of people  just kind of accepted everybody and they didn't have these kind of grouping features.  So this is, if you will, the first major social network we've had  where the ability is now to say, you know what, as I start putting people in,  I'm going to actually think about where I put them into it,  because I just don't think you had that with Facebook and Twitter.  They've they've added those kinds of features after the fact.  But at that point, it's like who wants to go back and then start,  you know, reorganizing the 2000 people that you had,  especially when it can be clunky.

All right.  I'll tell you what's not.  Are you telling me Google Plus is the iPad?  No, I'm telling you, it is in that in that it's going to be old ideas  implemented beautifully. Hang out.  Yes, certainly. That's magical and new.

Transcript:  Nobody's doing anything like it.  Although I know on Wednesday, Facebook's going to announce Skype on Facebook.  Right. Well, is there I mean, at this point, is there anything any company can do  in software?  And I remember hardware is a little more tricky, but in software  that can't be duplicated within weeks. Right.

Start time: 1310.76

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Presumably they do. They do what Danny says, which is they iterate  and they iterate and they iterate.  And when they when they iterate, they're tacking on to something  that people have already accepted and like.  And when you change that, people freak out.  Anytime Facebook changes anything, everybody has a canary.  So you can't change it too much fundamentally, but you can add these features.  Google Plus has the advantage of a coming from Google, who could really be a player  and be a company who is willing to say, all right, here is the things  we think that all these other social networks should have been from the beginning.  And they haven't had to iterate on top of that yet.  So it's it's the distinct advantage the new guy has.  Facebook had it over MySpace, MySpace had over Friendster,  and it'll just probably keep happening in some, you know, in that sort of form  from here and tell forever. Who knows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  most of our listeners, the vast majority can't even get in exactly.  And it's always makes me nervous to spend this much time  talking about something that most people can't use.  But I think it's so important because it's from Google.  It clearly will go more public soon.  And it is, I think I'm I'm still thinking this is a big shift for Google.  This is not not merely acknowledging that it needs social graph  in its search information.  I think it's a new way of thinking about what Google's business is.

Start time: 1380.70

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I saw that.  But I was the 12th guy. I couldn't get in.  Electric, spontaneous and close to me.  It was awesome, though.  Although, by the way, that's a problem with Hangout, is you  it's hard to close it. You can't.  It's right. You can't.

Transcript:  Public by default.  I it's one of those things about Google Plus.  It's like they got it.  You want to make lists of people and have different sets of permissions.  And they failed to take that to Hangouts, where sometimes  I just want to talk to somebody and not have everybody know that I did it.  Ha ha. Too bad.  Yeah, it's funny to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess this is part of the problem is that there's so much as with Facebook  to this, it's kind of hard to predict how it's going to react.  But here's the important thing almost to experiments to see before you do anything.  Private, for instance, I am no longer taking pictures of my penis on my Android phone  because I don't know what the hell's going to happen to it.  It apparently shows up on the web.  Crazy enough. There's an instant upload.

Start time: 1480.16

Transcript:  The important part here is that all of the social networking,  what they're trying to do is replicate, you know, what our brains are able to handle.  They would say from a tribal perspective, we can only grab our minds around  around 150 people in a tribe.  The Dunbar number. Exactly.  And so but social networking is starting to replicate other aspects  that actually happen if we all lived in small town together.  And Google Hangout is is a fundamentally  it's it's it's an in public meeting that anybody can walk up.  And if I were to walk into a bar and I see Sarah Lane sitting there  chatting with Leo and Tom Merritt and I could physically walk over,  I could watch them talk, I could kind of be a fly on the wall and just sort of  maybe contribute just a little bit.  Again, you have an analog to a real life experience.  And I think that's part of what makes it such an electric experience.

Start time: 1533.82
End time: 1558.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess my point is this is so early days.  It's not even open to the public.  So it's kind of hard to look at a feature and say, this is good.  This is bad. This needs to be fixed.  All of this is going to change.  I'm looking at a more meta level about what this tells us about what Google  is interested in. This is you cannot deny, Danny, that this is a major  initiative from Google.  This is not just another wave or a buzz, or is it?

Start time: 1559.86
End time: 1565.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, I think this is buzz 2.0.  Oh, you do. No way.  Oh, I think it's so much bigger than we do.

Start time: 1566.48
End time: 1570.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And can I say, can I say why?  I mean, I agree it looks just like buzz, but I think it's so much bigger than

Start time: 1570.78
End time: 1604.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  just like they launched buzz and it was like we're going to try to compete with  Facebook, but we, you know, aren't going to really say that we're going to do it.  And now we're getting circles and they're competing with Facebook, but they're not  saying that they're going to do it. And I think they're clever on the PR.  I'm not denying that they've got more integration that's going on throughout  Google and that there'll be more of that to be coming.  But first of all, if you're running a social network, your social network  better not be dependent on people using all of your services because not  everybody uses your services.  So it has to be independent to that.  This thing that they're building cannot just be Google Plus.

Start time: 1604.70
End time: 1610.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, but it will be. They're releasing the API.  People are going to be able to do other applications.  You're going to be able to access it different ways.

Start time: 1610.42
End time: 1626.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The idea of Google Plus is that it's Google Plus more.  And actually, what you need to have is for this to be successful is really  nothing to do with Google. It needs to be web plus, right?  It needs to be life plus.  The only thing the only thing I go ahead.

Start time: 1626.36
End time: 1678.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, I was just going to say the only thing it really needs to be successful  is to get people to jump on it.  And they did something very clever. And it's so elementary.  It goes back to how to win friends and influence people with on that new  black bar on the top of everything you do in Google.  It's there. It's it doesn't say Google Plus.  It says your first name. Right.  And I'm sitting there in Gmail doing work and my eye keeps going back to my name  in that upper left hand corner.  Why none of us got anything done this exactly.  I mean, it's like it's that kind of thinking that's going to make them  a force with this. And of course, they've shown they're like  Google is like the Borg with this.  They have announced that they want the search data that's inside Facebook  and Facebook is not giving it up.  So they walk to the empty lot next door and they start building a craft.  And at first, it's this rickety ship called or Kuz or whatever it was called.  Yeah, there you go.  And then it immediately fell apart and then like the board,  they went back and did buzz.  It's going on for a friend of me. Exactly.  And now they're coming back again.

Start time: 1678.92
End time: 1799.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Orchid kept happened way before Facebook.  Yeah, it did. And then in terms of them,  they've got to get the social graph because they won't do it.  So like two weeks ago, the the folks at SEO, Maz, released their data  where they turn up all this stuff to try to figure out what the top ranking signals  are and the things that really cause you to do well in Google's top results.  And one of the top things that they found was a strong correlation  between things that were shared on Facebook and things that ranked well on Google.  And so there was everybody going, aha, see, that's it.  Get shared on Facebook.  You show up on Google, except Google turned around and said,  we don't use any of that data.  And then there was some debate going on line.  And then they did more research and they said, actually, we agree  that Google wasn't lying to us.  They apparently don't use the Google share data.  And then people said, but you could see why they'd want to use the Google share data  because it corresponds so strongly with good search results.  At which point I'm thinking, what on earth are you talking about?  What it tells you is even without the Facebook data,  they already have good search results.  So clearly they do not need to have the same Facebook data.  To get quality search results.  Now, having said that, having the things that people like, having social signals,  I think are very good things for them to bring in.  I think it will help them.  I think that that's very much the new kind of link counting that goes out there.  And having something like plus or plus one or whatever plus thing they want to call it,  I think that's an essential part of them going forward and dealing with the fact  that the link graph that they've been using has become more and more polluted.  But I think that some of the social stuff gets overstated.  And, you know, they they they and then even if they hadn't done this,  they're pulling in stuff from, say, Twitter already that they can go through  and see some of the social stuff that comes along.  But, you know, no doubt having it.  This is a key part of them going forward.  And I think if you go back to Stephen's article, I actually had gone through it.  I pulled it up to skin through the thing that stood out for me much, much more about  that they're concerned with is the idea that Facebook is this closed web,  this thing that they can't see into.  It's right, you know, and that this kind of maybe for them

End time: 1830.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sure. So I'm wondering, the thing about Google Plus right now for me is  fine, it's a competitor. But right now, to me, it looks like every other part  of my working day with services, right, because it's full of tech journalists  and PR people. Right.  Regular people are going to sign up for it.  It's going to be very different, isn't it? Right.  And but their friends are going to be there and they're going to say,  why should they use this? And they're going to go back.  They're going to go back to Facebook.

Transcript:  I don't know. I don't know.  I depends on how Google decides to actually market it to real people.  I think these videos that came out, I don't know if you saw it,  but I did a YouTube double or mashup of one of them where the narration  is exactly that of an old folks home.  That's awesome.

Start time: 1852.14
End time: 1902.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I agree entirely with you.  I think that it's it's very exciting right now because it was sort of I was  thinking that Google Plus right now is almost like the tech meme of social  networks. And what I mean by that is practically nobody reads tech meme,  although people in the tech industry read it heavily.  And what happens there really matters.  Google Plus has got this huge elite audience of people that are in there.  I mean, it is amazing. You walk in and you're like, wow,  did I just stumble into Ted or something? What's going on here?  Right. Because there's still relatively few people that are there.  But when that spreads out and, you know,  if you do if you're happy with Facebook and it's doing everything you need it  to do and you know, you haven't had the privacy concerns,  you've got all your video stuff there and you're used to going in there.  I think it's still a really big challenge to convince you.  I want to go over and start using Google Plus.

Transcript:  This is the same challenge that Google,  that Bing faces when they go up against Google, right?  They build a search engine and a credible search engine and in some ways a better  search engine for certain things that then Google, but people keep using Google.  But isn't this where Google Google has, isn't this,  why do they want to go over and use something that they don't have any trust  with because they're already visiting Google every single day.

And at some point,  they're just like, Oh, I, you know, I'm on the Google anyway.  What's this plus next to my name?  And then they're in because so many people are already on Facebook and have a  Gmail account or use Google services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you might be overestimating how many people are logged into Google  accounts. And I think one thing that we all do is tech journalists and like tech  people is that we wildly overestimate how many people use Gmail, right?  Because Gmail is my entire rule. Right? I mean, that's how my life works.  And I'm like, Oh, everybody should do it.  Most people are using AOL still. I agree.  Most people use Hotmail on Pop.  Like, you know, this idea that you're going to see it all the time.  You will see that black bar.  It's going to work for me.  Well, you do see the black bar. You've got people on the web right now.

Transcript:  I think your best your best proxy to that is probably people who have Gmail accounts,  because that seems to be the biggest reason why you would have a Google account  outside of I'm running AdWords or I'm running AdSense.  And it also seems the biggest reason why you'd probably be logged into Google.  There are people who have Reader and they log into Reader,  but that's more of a niche product, it seems.  There's people who may log into Web search or whatever.  But I think your Gmail numbers  probably tell you the real story of what's going on in the potential audience.  And that's also intriguing, because then if all these people are using Gmail  and they're loving it and they're rocking along with it and that pulls them in,  you know, Facebook rolled out Facebook Mail and they rolled that out  about six months ago now.  And I think it's just kind of been sitting there.  And at some point, maybe they ramp it up and they, you know, this is  it's pretty cool.  I mean, you can go through and you can respond to people from your email box  and you don't have to have a subject line.  You don't have to do these things.

First of all, Facebook has the degree of discovery technology  that Google has in terms of search technology.  You're trying to find something.  Google finds that needle.  Facebook has huge amounts of investment and time put into how do I pop up  the stuff that's actually more relevant to you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You're like going, I just saw this and they've had to fix it.  And I know that they'll fine tune that sort of stuff.  But, you know, Facebook seems to be very, very hypersensitive that for us  to have a good system, we need to surface up the things that you're going to be  most interested in and Google has a lot of learning to do there.

I want you to go in here and just and just take a look at what you could do  with Squarespace, the the great stats, the great templates,  everything you've ever wanted.  This the blog importer is great.  Now they call it a blog importer, but many websites use the standard  APIs from Blogger or Typepad or removable type of WordPress import and export.  So you're never trapped.  I like that philosophy.  Great social widgets.  Make sure you put Brian's unicorn  Twitter handle and his Flickr account in there.

Transcript:  Let's talk a little bit more about Google Plus.  It kind of pales in comparison to brands  of Unicorn dot Squarespace dot com.  If Google could iterate that fast, just imagine.  So Google is, Danny, updating everything, though, right?  Calendar is going to be is being updated.  Gmail is being updated.  This is there is a kind of something going on, isn't there?

Start time: 2818.34
End time: 2845.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, and one nice thing that actually if you get to the integration  would be, for example, if you're going into a Google Doc  and you want to share that doc with your circles, hallelujah.  Because every time I have to share a doc with people,  it's like constantly going back and I've created lists  and that it seems to lose the list or never works.  So that would be pretty awesome.  And it was interesting the talk about, you know,  moving stuff over to Pekasa because, you know, that's kind of been this  also ran, I feel like the flicker.

Start time: 2845.36
End time: 2847.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, it suddenly changes everything, doesn't it?

Start time: 2847.62
End time: 2873.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah. And you've also had, you know,  a whole rise of other photo sharing services like TwitPic or whatever  that have come along.  And you wonder if they couldn't make Pekasa more into a real time  sharing service that you could also then upload through your Twitter  account if you wanted to.  But if you're also making more use of this, I mean, maybe this will  will bump it over, especially when, you know, I think there's still  some uncertainty about what what on earth goes on with them with the.

Start time: 2873.96
End time: 2887.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They do put up this notice, which is important.  Albums you shared publicly can in turn be tagged and shared by others.  So all of this kind of shocked me all of a sudden.  Three year old pictures are showing up in my it looked like showing up  in my stream on Google+.

Start time: 2887.38
End time: 2905.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And it's because it's weird if you watch, you know, if you're following  Sergey Brin or Larry Page, yeah, they look like every day they're skydiving  or jumping off a place or heights or being, you know,  the the Mekong Delta or something.  I mean, it's all their old shots are kind of now showing up.

Start time: 2907.16
End time: 2918.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sure that will calm down in a bit.  Now, we've focused a lot on Google plus and Facebook, but isn't Twitter  really the potential big victim here?  I mean, this is this is a Twitter replacement and that's the same.  Roughly the same.

Start time: 2919.38
End time: 2957.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I don't know about that yet.  You don't guess so? Well, mainly because the way I read Twitter  and I don't know if it's just me, but but, you know, I use the tweet deck app  and I get this flash point where I see all the text, all these different people.  It's as though you're looking in and you're getting a snapshot  of a nationwide public conversation and you're hearing everyone you want at once.  There's something about the efficiency of that.  Seeing this many very short posts all at once.  Remember, the whole reason Twitter took off is because it's only 140 characters.  And when you take that away, you lose something.  And that's why. And again, I'm not saying it's a bad thing for Google plus,  but it's going to be a different thing.  And it makes me think that Twitter probably has less to worry about than Facebook.  You guys agree, Neelai. Neelai, do you agree?

Start time: 2957.62
End time: 2972.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I completely agree.  I mean, I think the greatest thing about Twitter is that you can just pick it up  and figure out how to use it instantly. Right.  There's no you don't have to worry about privacy. Right.  Because by default, the whole point is to publish everything with everyone.  And people understand it.

Start time: 2972.52
End time: 2975.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's not true about Google Plus. You're right. Right.

Start time: 2975.90
End time: 2995.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think that is going to be look, I'm happy.  You know, I'm happy Google is competing with Facebook on the very specific  vector of let's make privacy easy for normal humans to figure out.  Because Facebook's way behind in that.  I don't know that Google's answer is better.  But Twitter was never that competitive with Facebook.  Right. Because they were just tried to be right.

Start time: 2996.04
End time: 2998.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, Buzz wanted to be that competitor and it failed.

Start time: 2998.58
End time: 3048.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So right now, but I was directed to Twitter.  I meant, you know, we always talk about the social networking competition  between Twitter and Facebook, but Twitter never had to care about privacy.  They're not built around any notion of privacy.  That turned out to be a huge advantage, didn't it?  Yeah, it's a huge because everybody gets it.  They're like, I'm going to type this and everyone will see it.  I can follow all these famous people who are telling me what they want to see.  Facebook has not had competition in the privacy space at all.  Really. I think that's Google Plus.  I think one of the big things we're going to see out of it is now finally these two companies.  They're going to have to iterate on privacy in a real way.  And I don't think Twitter has to worry about it because they're doing something different.  You it's exactly like you're saying.  It's it's so easy to understand and use and get a snapshot of what's happening right now.  You just look at it and you can walk away.  And then you go and interact with Facebook in a way that you don't interact with Twitter.

Start time: 3048.92
End time: 3117.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think you've also got some advantages that both Facebook and Twitter have in terms of what they're doing with the brands.  You know, Plus rolled out without any concept of a brand has a page and acts on its own.  And I know that they've said that that's going to come along and they're going to get to it and we'll have it at some point.  But I was dumbfounded it wasn't there at launch because they already had that problem with Buzz.  Then they go back to the drawing board.  They start over and they know that they're going to have to have that sort of thing.  Meanwhile, if you look at one of the appeals of both Facebook and Twitter, it's the fact that you can actually follow brands and keep up with them and interact with them.  So that's all got to come.  And I don't think that, you know, these other brands are already out on Facebook or Twitter, that that just gets tossed to the side.  Right. You know, I think you're going to have significant numbers of people there as well.  So you continue to maintain those sorts of things.  Maybe if Facebook or Twitter should go all my space wise and decline, then you kind of let those sort of things go.  But I think they're both fairly strong in that regard.  And this is an area where Google Plus really have to play a lot of catch up.  And they're not even playing it yet because they don't even have that concept.

Start time: 3118.02
End time: 3165.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Well, you know, because ideally the way that you interact with the brand through Google is you search the brand's home page and then you go to the brand.  I mean, Google Plus, I think, represents one of the very few places within the Google ecosystem where you interact with Google itself.  I think the most notable thus far has been YouTube.  But even that isn't I don't think people think of YouTube as being Google.  Right. It's its whole separate entity with its own conventions and communities and rules.  Google Plus is like you're in Google.  You're using this Google product.  And that's I can't think of very many that are hugely popular.  There's YouTube and there's Gmail.  And then search is all about taking you away from Google.  That's a good point.  So they've really got to figure out how that works for them.  And I think there'll be some growing.  I don't doubt that they will.  It'll just be interesting to see how they answer some of these outstanding questions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  There's a difference in this hyper growth world where we keep expecting  everything to take over the world, and we're surprised when something levels off.  I mean, if if Twitter were to level off where it is,  I'm not going to call that a stumble or a fall.  I'm going to say so bad.

Start time: 3206.28
End time: 3210.42

End time: 3242.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, and especially when later we talk about the Apple story coming up.  It's just we're obsessed with constant growth.  And of course, that's not necessarily sustainable.  And at some point, you know, for example, just just a while ago,  we were talking about how Facebook is for the first time ever lost users in a month  or whatever. When we act like this is the end of the world.  It's like, look, they still have 750 million people on this thing.

Start time: 3242.80

Start time: 3246.18

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the interesting about Twitter is that the way I think people perceive it  is that it's just part of the Internet.  You know, I think they feel that way about Facebook, too.

Start time: 3253.42
End time: 3260.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And to a large extent, Google and actually, that's the thing that bothers me  because it isn't part of the Internet. It's a privately held company. Right.

Start time: 3260.62
End time: 3302.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I think that's why it always feels like Twitter is in trouble. Right.  Because I think our instinct is that something that feels so natural  and ingrained should be so easy to run and monetize and grow.  But it's not. I don't actually I still kind of don't know how Twitter plans  to make money forever. Right.  Selling ads and premium tweets or whatever they're doing.  That all feels like, well, crap.  Like, here's the first idea we had.  You know, it's not that here's the big idea of how we make money with this.  And I think that's why they're in trouble.  I think they had the vision of what the product could be.  And they lacked the equally important vision of how they actually make money  making that product.  And who knows how they're going to solve that problem?  Because if I knew the answer, I'd be knocking Twitter's door right now.  They wouldn't be here.

Transcript:  I I'm strongly I strongly suspect that there will be some way to monetize  and make it work out if for no other reason, because Twitter may, in fact,  after the Internet be one of the most significant advances in my lifetime.  And what I mean by that is not from the next few years or whatever.  But what I mean is a thousand years from now, we will have with shocking fidelity  a diary that the entire world kept for a very short amount of time or maybe long term.  Maybe the entire world.  Well, OK. Well, I mean, certainly, certainly.  And you can't search it.  You can't search it. Well, no, no, no, I can search.  Yeah, of course you can't.

This is this is a picture of our whole life for the last few years happening.  And that is precious and it is special.  And there's got to be a way to monetize it, to make it keep on going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google for antitrust.  Twitter, the FTC, according to Business Insider,  Nicholas Carlson and Dan Frommer is investigating Twitter  for the way it deals with companies building applications and services.  In other words, when Twitter kind of undermined the 30 party apps  and undermined the photo sharing and undermined the URL shortening  and undermined the the other Twitter symbionts.  Despite encouraging them in the beginning, the FTC says  you shouldn't be doing that.  You know, I think the one thing that I do does kind of bother me  is what they did with Tweet Tech, where Bill Gross  wanted to what was his what was the name of his Uber Uber  media, Uber, Uber, Uber, Uber, Uber, Uber, Uber, Uber, Uber, Uber, Uber,  media, that's it. Yeah.  Started buying up Twitter clients and even said, I'm going to do a Twitter  competitor. And then at that point, Twitter said, Whoa, and stole Tweet Tech  from them by doubling the value.  Now, that's just business as usual.  It's not it's kind of sharky.

Start time: 3454.78
End time: 3474.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the problem with building a platform, right?  Is that you've got to you've got to do right by the people that rely on your platform.  And this is like, you know, the FTC is involved because it's a it's sort  of a collective action problem, right?  You can't have this company that's affecting the economy with all these other  companies feeding into it and then going in and then they pull the rug out from under

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  everybody. Right.

Start time: 3475.38
End time: 3501.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I think this is this goes back to that core issue of how does Twitter make money.  Right. And you look at all these other companies, you know, Tweet Pick figure  out how to make money on Twitter. Right.  Like put your photos on our service.  We'll run some ads. There we go.  And Twitter is like, well, crap, like we have to do that, too.  And I think that's where they're starting to pull in all of these ancillary  products around the core tweet stream that are easy to monetize.  Whereas I think the core tweet stream will always be sort of hard for them to make money.

Start time: 3501.66
End time: 3505.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I reiterate my initial point, which isn't Twitter kind of in trouble.

Start time: 3506.26
End time: 3511.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I think it's the same level of trouble that they've always been.  That's a great way to put it, actually.

Start time: 3511.12
End time: 3514.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I think that's a good way to put it in perspective.  Yeah, they're in trouble. It's the same trouble they've had forever.

Start time: 3514.92
End time: 3527.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Right. Like who's in charge?  Nobody knows. How do we have money?  Nobody knows. We should probably find a guy to be in charge.  He knows the answer to that question.  Let's try this guy, because the other three guys didn't work out.  So they're going to be in that level of trouble until they they really.

Start time: 3528.18
End time: 3557.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But then you can also argue that they're going to be stronger  by getting rid of the people who don't know how to monetize it,  but knew how to build a good system.  And in fact, I think that some of them have said that sort of thing.  Like, you know, we're we're great.  We love that we built this sort of thing up,  but perhaps we're not the right people to then take it forward to the next level.  It needs to go.  You know, there's also the argument that when you lose your founders,  that sometimes you lose the thing that makes the, you know,  that makes the product compelling in the heart of ways.  But I mean, that can go either way.

Start time: 3558.26
End time: 3582.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It can go either way.  Let me ask you guys, would anybody quit their Twitter account if  if they announced, listen, we got to make some money.  Here's the deal.  Once a day in the middle of the average, you know, three to a thousand tweets  that you receive, one of them will be a paid advertisement once per day.  And once per month, you'll get a text message on your your phone.  It'll be a direct message to you.  I could live with that.  I mean, I think I think they can make a ton of money.

Start time: 3582.84
End time: 3587.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But in my Twitter stream, I'll never catch it.  Well, I know. And they know that, too.  But when you guys have zero value,

Start time: 3588.00
End time: 3598.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  but when you got 200 million people and you could guarantee impressions  for 100000 of them in any given day, you know, I think and especially  if that's every single day.  And these are premium slots that they're selling for 50 grand per day.

Start time: 3598.58
End time: 3602.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If a nootnik like you could figure that out, what's keeping Twitter  from figuring that out? I don't know.

Start time: 3602.92
End time: 3613.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nobody wants to buy it.  That's what that's what's keeping them from figuring out.  Nobody wants to buy those numbers.  You've got however many million people a day and 100000 impressions guaranteed.  It's like chum change.  Yeah, it's like a billboard.

Start time: 3613.76
End time: 3637.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  People would buy the ads.  I think the reason they don't do it is because they don't particularly  have to do it yet. Right.  They've got enough money.  They don't have as much pressure to start monetizing all the stuff that they do.  And, you know, they seem to be very cautious.  And they did have a very bad experience with the Twitter bar,  whatever it was that they had done with it.  But, yeah, I think people would buy those things.  You think this already are buying the promoted tweets  and they're buying the promoted trends.

Start time: 3637.42

Transcript:  Do you think this is kind of like Justin TV and Ustream.tv  trying as hard as they can, as long as they can to put off pre-roll,  knowing that everybody will hate it, but at some point they got to  they got to pay their bills.  And maybe Twitter just isn't in that moment where they actually need  to start collecting a paycheck on it.

Start time: 3651.98
End time: 3700.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, a little bit.  And then it's interesting also that with this plus,  if you go back to the plus launch, it changes like dynamics, too,  because, you know, arguably it puts Twitter in a weaker position  because, wow, people do use this and they do roll out an app  and you can do these kinds of tweets and longer things or whatever.  Will that kind of pick up?  And I think it's also interesting, you know, we haven't talked about  what this potentially does to Foursquare.  But when you check in on Google Plus, it's much better than when you were  checking in on Latitude and there's an ability to add your, you know,  your check in isn't just sort of checking in.  It's I can do the the tweet that kind of goes with it  and I can do the photos that go with it.  And this is stuff that you can do with Foursquare as well,  but potentially you're putting that out to a bigger audience.  You don't get the game mechanics, but then maybe you don't necessarily  need the game mechanics.

Transcript:  Yeah. So the plus app all over their site, they're saying coming soon.  I have no idea what that means.  Well, from what I understand, it's already been.  I like about the way Google does these things is they are so interested  in making sure that their platform agnostic in a very real way.  They're a company who who really has a vested interest in making sure Android  has the best possible stuff, yet they're still spending time making sure  to support either via the web now apps later, whatever.  They're willing to support that overall ecosystem.  Right. That's a that's a strong thing.  And for the future, but in my opinion, from what I understand,

And actually, this was going to be  this was going to be our special question for Brian.  So when he comes back, I'll give it to him.  But 6000 plus Nortel patents available.  Why, first of all, would anybody want these patents?

Start time: 4522.82
End time: 4570.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, patent litigation is like about is about like tonnage.  It really at this point, it really is.  It's you know, these patents were on communications technologies  or a lot of patents that touched on LTE.  There's a lot of wireless patents in there in general.  And the more you have on your side,  sort of the better off you are in litigation. Right.  And it really isn't about necessarily like specifics  or what actual rights the patents give you.  It's about, well, you know, patent  patent litigation is often described as mutually assured destruction. Right.  And it's compared most frequently to nuclear war,  which I think is very interesting when you consider the state of litigation  this country that we're often comparing just one type of standard litigation  to nuclear war constantly.  Like something is probably wrong.  But that's the state of things.

Start time: 4570.82

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there's a consortium of companies. They named themselves Rockstar.  So it was Apple, Microsoft, Rim, a few other major companies  that you've heard of and a few little companies you haven't heard of.  And they were going up against Google.  I think they spent four point five billion in total.  And Google said, well, we're going to cap out at four.  So Google could have been in the game.  You know, they certainly have an extra half billion dollars to bid.  But I think they, you know, they reached they reached the limit  of what they wanted to spend.

Start time: 4600.36
End time: 4606.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Was it a mistake for them not to acquire these patents?  Doesn't this threaten Android and a lot of other Google?

Start time: 4607.18
End time: 4658.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I don't think so.  It would be what there's been a lot of talk about these patents  just because any time you get these companies directly competing,  it generates a lot of conversation.  But really, it doesn't.  I mean, Apple is suing every Google OEM anyway.  Microsoft is going after every Google OEM and asking for  license agreements and royalty fees anyway.  So what these patents really do is they provide additional ammunition.  I mean, it's it's kind of like, if, you know, the height of the Cold War,  you would read about like the United States developed a new missile.  Right. Oh, man, that's awesome.  Definitely going to win the Cold War now.  It's like that's never how that worked.  It's it's about the perceived threat of force.  And it's about I mean, literally, is that's why it's always compared to nuclear war.  So it's not about firing these off and winning settlements and getting royalties.  It's about negotiating settlements and license agreements down the line.

Start time: 4667.62
End time: 4694.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So maybe you can figure out why Google was bidding what it was bidding,  because a lot of people looked at this and said, what are they talking?  So the first bid was one billion, nine hundred two million, one hundred  sixty thousand five hundred forty dollars, one point nine billion.  Their second bid was two billion six hundred fourteen thousand nine hundred  seventy two. So oh, so it is very specific.  These two billion six thousand listen, two billion six hundred  fourteen million nine hundred seventy two thousand one hundred twenty eight.  I know why. Why?

So, you know, it's funny is I think they did this  when they did 700 megahertz auction as well.  Did they really?  I think they have a strategy of goofy bids.  And I think, you know, it kind of irritated like the other members of the auction  who are like, why are these bids so crazy and precise?  But I think Google just does this. I think this is part of their.  I love it. I think the irreverence.

But at the time, you know, they were in opposition to Verizon  and they wanted to trigger, you know, the sort of quote unquote  net neutrality provisions of the auction.  And they did it. You know, they won.  But this one, I think they actually wanted to win.  You know, I think it's like I'm saying it's like you want the protection  of having these six thousand patents on your side, but they're not screwed

Start time: 4846.52
End time: 4858.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  They were talking about on tech news today that you want to have  just a fistful of patents, just so that if Apple were to try to enforce  their patent on that, that they just got granted that you could say, well,  it's going to be a lot of trouble because we're going to hit you with X, Y  and Z. And that's exactly what.

Start time: 4859.00
End time: 4968.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is a great transition into the Apple Samsung thing.  That's exactly what Samsung is doing. Right.  Yeah. Apple sued them.  So Samsung suing them back. Yeah.  And, you know, this report actually Samsung dropped its lawsuits this week.  That's really inaccurate.  I don't know why it's being reported like that.  Oh, I've been meaning to write something about it, but it's a holiday weekend.  Correct us.  So what they so Apple sued Samsung.  Right. And then once you get sued, you have a number of options.  And one of those options is sue the guy back.  Countersuit. Right. Right.  And so what they've done is Samsung filed a separate countersuit.  And they've also filed countersuits in Germany, Japan, South Korea  in ITC. You know, they filed all these actions against Apple and other places.  I think what they've decided to do is they said, well,  we're not going to have two separate lawsuits in the United States.  We'll just have one.  And that'll include our countersuit in the United States.  So we won't have two different judges and two different lawsuits going on.  So they dismissed their they dropped their other one, their independent  Samsung versus Apple lawsuit and wrapped all of those claims  into the existing lawsuit.  So it's like a very technical procedural thing.  And when I read it, I was like, oh, this isn't news.  Like, nobody cares about this.  Like, people care about outcomes.  That's really interesting. Yeah.  Well, everybody got that wrong.  Yeah. And, you know, that's one of the things it's whenever I do legal stories,  I have to divorce myself from how nerdy I am about procedure.  This procedure isn't important.  Right. It's it's what that's why lawyers get paid.  They get paid to manage the procedure and manage the boundaries of conflict.  But what people care about, what's important, is the outcome  and how he gets the outcome.  Yeah, it's related to procedure.  But this is like they dismissed one suit so they could put all the claims  in another one that already exists.  So that's I mean, that's where Samsung is right now.  It's they're suing Apple back with everything they got.  I mean, they're suing them in four countries and 10 venues.  They're they're they're we talk to you in this lawsuit.

Start time: 4968.70
End time: 4976.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When this lawsuit happened,  now that we're a little farther down the road, do you have a different take on it?  Do you think you thought that they had some merit in the Apple  had some merit in the trade dress?

Start time: 4976.98
End time: 5073.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I still think Apple has a lot of merit  in just sort of confusion in a marketplace. Right.  I mean, I think Samsung's products are consciously designed to look like Apple products.  And I think Apple's right to say, well, there's a line and you're over it.  Right. Where that line is, that's a big argument.  And I think everybody has a different opinion on that.  I think what I expected to happen has not happened.  And I thought this would be over relatively quickly.  I did not expect Samsung to fight back so vociferously.  The intensity of Samsung's response  indicates to me that this isn't going to be over anytime soon.  I mean, the sheer number of countries and courts that Samsung has responded in  and attacked Apple in indicates to me that this problem,  I mean, you don't get to wrap all that up neatly. Right.  You're fighting like you're you've opened up fronts of war and you're going for it.  Now, what you know, and we've heard reports that Apple's going to take  their manufacturing away from Samsung and take the A6 or whatever to  TSMC and so Samsung's foundries.  I mean, these are retaliation.  Yeah. And you know, I've heard a lot of speculation that, you know, Samsung's like, OK,  well, we're going to protect our high margin phone business  and maybe we'll lose some of the low margin manufacturing.  But the phones are what's important. I mean, that's the future.  So we'll protect that.  And you can take your, you know, your dinky little chip business away.  Now, I don't know if any of that's true.  Maybe this will settle tomorrow.  Maybe both companies will realize we're spending way too much money for this to make sense.  But right now, the intensity of the conflict is at an all time high.  And Samsung consolidating a suit to streamline it is like that indicates basically nothing.  I'm loving it. They're trying to get organized.

If they both win, then they both like they both found, you know,  liable for willful patent infringement.  That's triple damages or whatever they ask for.  That's an insane amount of money.  It'll just go in a circle. Right.  Because Apple have to pay you up a you and then right.  Or and the court will say, well, you have to stop.

Start time: 5115.38
End time: 5179.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, that's that's what they because not because of patents, right,  because of trademarks, because they say the phones are too similar,  that they're causing consumer confusion.  I have to pull this apart.  Yeah. Again, I've been lazy on a holiday weekend and I because it's this is my next  and not an actual like our news site.  I let myself get away with not working over the weekend.  But come Tuesday, I'll have an analysis that injunction.  I mean, basically, they're saying you go into a Verizon store  and there's a fascinate in the iPhone.  People are not sophisticated enough to know the difference.  And again, you can argue about that as much as you want.  Apple's well within its rights to say people are getting confused.  And Samsung's well, they're interested.  Say no, they're not.  And the judge has to decide, you know, based on all this evidence.  But the injunction is specifically you can't just go ahead and let people get confused  without stopping it because it's causing harm to Apple.  And that's Apple's argument in the injunction.  So, yeah, that mean this is all time high.  You know, these reports of Samsung dropping a patent lawsuit completely.  It's it's staring at a tree while the forest is like on fire.  You know what I mean? It's like stop looking at the tree, guys.  Take a look around.

Amazon is well, in response to a new California law  signed into a law last week by our governor.  What's the name of the governor now?  The Brown is it Jerry Brown?  I can never keep track.  It was Arnold Schwarzenegger.  You don't even know.  Gerald Brown.  I do know, but it's like  it doesn't matter.  It doesn't even matter. Who's the governor?  We used to call Moonbeam. Remember the governor?  Moonbeam. He was wasn't he governor before?  OK, I'm not crazy.  No, you're not. He looks familiar.  OK, so anyway, Jerry Brown signs into law a new sales tech law that says  Amazon has to collect sales tax on all purchases in California.  Now, this is what's interesting.  California has always had a use tax law on your 540, your California income tax.  It says how much you know, how much did you buy online?  You got to pay the sales tax. What's your use tax?  Most most states have most states do.  And it's so so the thing about sales tax is not that you don't know it.  It's that who collects it? Right.  Will the will the retailer collect it or are you required to pay?  Kicked it. But now I paid six thousand dollars in use tax last year. Right.  I made twenty thousand dollars in Amazon and they've cut their throats on both  because now Amazon has come back to California as they did in North Carolina,  as they did to New York and said, well, if you're going to do that,  we're going to withdraw from the state because if we don't do business  in the state, we don't have to collect sales tax.

I got the email. If you would like us to come back, then you got it.  You can't pass this law.  And again, it's like it makes sense.  It's like they can't be bogged down in the paperwork of every  because if it's if you could do that for every state,  then you have to do that for every county.  If you do that for all right.

Transcript:  You say things like you're going to have it today.  If you have any problems, you need a little training.  Come back to me. I'll show you how to use this.  There are ways to solve this.  I think sometimes the people who bitch about this are stores who don't want to  give you good service.  Absolutely. Look at my bookstore down the street.  Now, I want to buy my books from my independent bookstore because I love  having them there.  So I go down there and I say, can I need a book?  Do you have it?  They it takes them a while. They go, they look, they have their little database.  They finally say, no, but I can get it for you in three days. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And again, like matching that matching that.  Yeah. Go ahead, Scott.  Really expensive because for you to be able to say, all right, well,  for me to get it to you next day as a local business,  it's already paying for the building,  the employees, that everything else we get to pay for.  And I got to figure out a way to pay to get that book to you quicker and the book  at a price that's reasonable enough for you to skip the online option.  That's where the complaint is, because that's so much more expensive  to match all of that physically and locally than it is.  In this case, I wasn't price sensitive.

Start time: 6241.82
End time: 6256.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wanted the book. And I think this is often the case.  If you go to a brick and mortar, you go not because you're price sensitive.  If you're price sensitive, you can search online,  but it's because you want it right away. You're willing to pay.  It's like, what is it? It's two bucks or something.  It's not a huge difference. Right.  So it's not about price.

Transcript:  It's my local bookstore, which is the oldest business in Halfman Bay,  has diversified by selling cigars, for instance.  And those are things that you don't really want to buy off online  because you don't know the quality that you're getting.  And he also does a lot of, you know, author readings and celebrity,  you know, readings.  He has a lot of signed copies of books and he's really expert at his at at what's  what's good. You go in there, you go, I'm thinking of a book for my wife  that is sort of, you know, sort of a fun read.  And he'll have some suggestions. He's read them all.  So and that that stuff you can't really get on, you know, Amazon.  You can get the reviews and stuff, but it's not the same,  not the same personal touch.  But it's a tough it's a tough business to be in retail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I think we all have sympathy for the individual who's running a store  who feels squeezed by by Amazon.  But I don't have any sympathy for the lazy systems  that are often behind these these stores.  It's like you should be more focused on adding value  and you should not be taking margins that are that large.  And you got to get closer.  And again, I'm not saying that you have to match Amazon,  but you got to get closer to it.

Start time: 6323.00
End time: 6375.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  In my case, we sold cameras and cameras are really funny business.  This is the 80s and it's still the same margins from what I hear.  Fourteen hundred dollar like we sold Nikon F4s, right?  There they were fourteen hundred bucks back then.  We would make five dollars on the camera.  So there was no way to cut it too much lower. Sure.  Now, the online retailers can charge you a little bit more and play some games  and sell you an extended warranty.  This is why when you call up a lot of those places,  they really, really spend a lot of time trying to get you to buy the extended  warranty, because if they can send sell you an extended warranty for 60 bucks,  that's probably 45 or 50 in profit.  And then they can say, well, we'll sell you the camera for twenty dollars  less than you're paying locally. Right.  There's a lot of games that go on. Right.  And then I would make five bucks on the camera,  but I would make eighteen dollars on a nineteen dollar filter.  And that's that's something that you don't know.  It's like, I don't want to point out that this is not something new.

Transcript:  There is a Hebrew shopkeepers law.  This is this is a rabbinical law that it is.  It is against the law.  To waste a shopkeeper's time,  they don't say because you're going to buy on Amazon,  they say because you're waiting for a bus or, you know, you're killing time.  But it's against Hebrew law, spiritual law to go in and waste somebody's time  and not buy. Yeah.  So that's interesting. Isn't that interesting? Yeah.  So it is clearly an ethical violation. I mean,  I wonder, by the way, this is the new thing that I'm going to be big on.  And Tim O'Reilly inspired me with this. This is your new cause.  This is my new cause. It's not that particularly, but this is my new cause.  And it has to do with G plus as well.  We keep saying, oh, there ought to be a law, there ought to be regulations.  Instead of that, whatever happened to say we not know, you're not the guy.  You're Mr. Libertarian.  But all right, maybe I'm starting to become a little bit more like, right.  There you go. Right there. Here.  But but seriously, Tim O'Reilly said this, instead of getting all these privacy  laws, what if instead we have privacy taboos?  You're not allowed. You're not.  It is illegal to technically look into somebody's window. Sure.  But more so we have the taboo about doing that. Or, you know, a lock really  is going to stop much many people. But it's a signal.  No, your door wasn't locked, by the way.  But it's a signal. The fact that the door is there and the lock is there,  even though anybody could easily penetrate it. Right.  It's a signal saying, don't come in. Right.  I want this to be private.  And unfortunately, I think there's so many situations in our life now  where these taboos or societal mores, we keep wanting to express them in  regulation and law, when in fact, we really ought to be asserting them over  and over telling our kids, it's not OK to waste the shopkeeper's time.  That's unethical.

Start time: 6479.76

Transcript:  And a lot of this has to do with accountability for being busted doing  these things. And in an online space, we've enjoyed for about 20 years.  We're anonymous. Complete on anonymity.  But it's things like the Google Plus that is stripping that away.  Let me tell you, the most freaked out moment I had was learning  the real names and the real locations of the real jobs of half of my friends online.  I'm like, you're not demon by shift lock.

Start time: 6635.20
End time: 6646.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So two questions here.  First of all, who do you guys, if you're handicapping this thing,  who's going to win in this face off, which is, of course, one of many  between Amazon and California?  Second question is, is there any government that has refused?

Start time: 6646.76
End time: 6660.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The government's the big loser here because they there's  this is such a stupid law that's going to cost them far more money  than it's going to make them money.  I mean, first of all, I was paying income tax on that twenty thousand dollars a year.  So they were getting another four grand or five grand out of me.

Start time: 6661.22
End time: 6700.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  This is this is the the the the chicken ass of being so good about not swearing.  This is the chicken ass way that the RIA handled the MP3 problem  is what they should have been doing is going after the people who were stealing music.  But they don't want to do that because that's hard and there's going to be a big backlash.  So instead, they try to go after people who are distributing music.  And then things got complicated with Bittorrent, which, of course,  10 year anniversary this this month.  And then likewise, the government already has owed the money by the individuals.  They should be.  It's already in the law that they need to pay.  But they don't want to go after the individuals  because there will be a backlash from their constituents.  So they're doing the chicken crap thing of going after  Amazon, because that's an easy thing to do.

Start time: 6701.26
End time: 6713.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, on the other hand, Amazon knows very well what it's up to when it says,  OK, well, we'll just tell our affiliates that they no longer welcome, which is good.  I think that pisses off how many hundreds of thousands of smart things

End time: 6813.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, and now that everybody's using their real names, you know who they are,  what biases they bring to the table, what their authority level is.  Now, Cora has a lot better idea of what their authority level is.  Like like I'm pretty high on authority on tech, but not very high on wine.  If I write a wine answer, my answer will be way low on the page.  And it has to be voted up, you know, so the quality has to speak for itself.  And this is stuff that I hope Google starts integrating into Google Plus,  because to tell you the truth, it's going to devolve into cat photos pretty quickly.  And it already has. It's disgusting.  You know, and there's there's no way to find, you know, what you really want.  Like I have a circle of venture capitalists and none of them talk about venture capital.  So I'm not getting what I really want out of that circle.  You can't force people to talk about what you know, but we need filters.  Right. So only show me items that say the word venture capital.  Well, I think that's going to be solved.

Start time: 6813.52
End time: 6818.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
