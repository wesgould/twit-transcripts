Transcript:  Letdcasts you love.  From people you trust.  This is twit this week in tech episode 99 for May 28 2007.  Happy towel day.  This is twit we're perilously close to number 100 episode 99.  There's just a nice feel to that episode 99 of this week in tech and as is fitting as we approach the 100th show.  We've got kind of a small group of the core panelists to the original twits.  Well, Patrick's the only original twit.  John's an early twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's got nothing to do with the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that's a thank you.  John C. Dvorak dot org slash blog.  Ladies and gentlemen, and Patrick Norton from slam dance industries and of course, DL dot TV.  And welcome both of you guys.  We had the doc was on the on the list, but had to bail at this last minute.  So it's just the three of us, but lots of stories to talk about.  Lots of good, good news.  Should we start with, you know, I can't decide where to start here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you get I'm bringing up the delicious list.  Yeah.  Did you get the Chinese?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The cell, the virus or the cell phone, the semantic story?  Yeah, that's what I think.  That's a great story.  Isn't that isn't that nice of some semantic an update to semantics?  Antivirus signatures mistakenly quarantines to critical system files in the Chinese version of XP.  Oops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So rough month.  I mean, like a few months ago, they finally come out with a decent version of like the Norton tools.  And a month later, people are getting files deleted.  It's tough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you if you're Chinese and you use according to Cicert, which is the Chinese Internet Security Response Team,  if you use Norton Antivirus, Norton Internet Security or Norton 360, and you updated on May 17th,  you couldn't reboot.  It deleted NetAPI32.dll and LSASRV.dll.  They thought they were a backdoor Trojan.  No, actually, kind of critical Windows files, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So apparently the kicker to the story is that they also couldn't reinstall Windows because it has all those crazy,  you know, protection, anti piracy protection features.  And apparently something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you're basically been screwed by Microsoft and Symantec.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  According to the China Daily, the people that had this infection,  and it's apparently in the millions, are asking thirteen thousand dollars per machine and damages.  Good.  Good.  A lot of money.  Well, it's maybe a little.  Well, think about it.  You know, you lose the machine, it can't be rebooted.  You can't reinstall the operating system.  You can't use the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thirteen million.  That is a little bit of money.  But it's pretty big.  That's a pretty big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, thirteen million plus three zeros.  It's a thirteen billion dollar deal.  If there's a million machines, in fact, that is a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A lot of numbers.  Speaking of.  Oops.  We now know why Microsoft wasn't able to release Halo 2 on time.  It was supposed to come out, I think, now, right around now.  Won't be to the end of the month because there's some partial nudity in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  And no one seems to know what the partial nudity is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why would there be any new Halo 2?  Come on.  What is partial nudity?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, if you go to the short sleeve shirt, that's partial nudity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess you're right.  It doesn't really say.  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, one breast or a buttock or what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, what's interesting is Microsoft says like it's not in the game.  No one who simply plays the game will ever find this this obscure content error.  That's the other Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like that.  No problem.  It's a it's a OCE.  Secure content error.  It's not nothing.  Nothing to worry about.  Apparently, some did leak out, so we may be able to see the partial nudity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, apparently it's not actually in the game.  So somebody's got to dig through it.  Seems confusing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, neither was the stuff in the hot coffee mod, remember?  And that was a that caused a lot of problems for Grand Theft Auto.  Mm hmm.  Because it unlocked scenes that were buried in the code, scenes you wouldn't normally see.  Wait, I found it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I found it.  You found a picture?  Said not a picture, but but Game Daily Viz.  Game Daily Viz says the content in question, although likely to be inaccessible to the vast majority of users, displays a photograph of an individual showing his bare buttocks.  It is buttocks.  To the user when a particular error occurs and thus warrants a partial nudity content descriptor in order to alert customers to its presence in the product.  How pathetic are we?  So yeah, basically.  So a video game character in a peculiar error moons the user.  Is that maybe an error message?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would be kind of funny, actually.  Well, you blew it.  Microsoft is getting my ass crashed again.  The French have a bare-breasted women on their money.  But if we have a buttock inaccessible in a video game, we've got to pull it off the market.  People are very distressed.  If we have a video game character buttock.  It's not even a real buttock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's just a cartoon buttock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's an anti-aliased buttock.  Master Chief's buttock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not really even a buttock.  It's just a drawing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a drawing of a Master Chief has some fine man gluteal muscles.  Not that I'm looking.  That's an overshare.  Not that I'm checking him out or anything.  But no, people wear Master Chief costumes.  He's a character that people love.  Speaking of which, a Michigan man.  I don't know how I'm going to get the segue to this.  You already blew it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's no segue to this.  You go in and say there's no segue.  I say, hey, wait, hold on a second.  I've got a joke to tell you.  It's the funniest joke you've ever heard.  Although I can't tell it very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How about this?  Speaking of men's buttocks, a Michigan man spent a lot of time sitting outside a cafe using their free Wi-Fi.  That's the segue.  That worked.  That was very good.  Speaking of buttocks, this guy, I don't know, he's checking his email or whatever.  I guess he showed up a lot though.  The coffee people didn't complain.  But a police officer noticed the guy sitting in front of the cafe day after day.  He questioned him and the guy didn't know that there was anything wrong with it.  So he said, you know, I knew that the cafe had Wi-Fi.  I was just going down and checking my email.  He was arrested.  Why?  Under Michigan's fraudulent access to computers, computer systems and computer networks law could result in a five year felony and a $10,000 fine.  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's against the law.  I thought he said it was a cafe of Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The cafe owner said, I didn't even know he was doing anything.  I don't know if it was a crime.  Police officer says, I had a feeling a law was being broken, but I didn't know what.  Oh, this cop's a jerk.  Remember, we talked about this a couple of years ago.  We talk about it all the time and it's just ridiculous that this even comes up in the conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This should be a dead letter law.  These idiots that are actually trying to enforce this, what's the point?  Hey, good job of stopping crime, Mr. Policeman.  Hey, by the way, that old lady's being mugged around the corner.  You don't want to deal with that guy, do you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  An open Wi-Fi and an act of piracy will be a death penalty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  According to section 752.795 of the Michigan Penal Code.  The guy must have been a meter maid.  Section five says, a person shall not, intentionally and without authorization or by exceeding valid authorization, do any of the following.  Now, it doesn't seem to me that he's...  How did this law even get on the books?  I mean, they've got an open Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So people who are hacking Wi-Fi can be gone.  They have legal means to go after someone who's not hacking.  That's a legitimate use of the law.  If you can track down somebody that's breaking into your obviously not so secure wireless...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think there's even anything.  Listen, it says access or cause access to be made to a computer program, computer system or network to acquire, alter, damage, delete or destroy property  or otherwise use the service of that network.  Use.  Insert or attach or knowingly create the opportunity for unknowing and wanted unsearching of attachment of a set of instructions.  You're right. This is all about hacking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but it says it's got the word in there, use.  It's badly written.  Yeah, it's very badly written. It's ridiculous.  Besides that, it wasn't... What was... Who was it hurting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, nobody, unless the guy...  Why is it a felony with five years in jail?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Unbelievable.  I mean, what kind of country are we running here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  According to the prosecutors, they're going to go easy on the guy.  A $400 fine and 40 hours of community service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's not easy.  That's awful.  Going easy on the guy's a $10 fine and get out of here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  40 hours community service. It'll be good for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It'll be a felony on his record.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, they're not going to put it on his record.  But I guess it was ridiculous. I mean, there's nothing more to say.  What a ridiculous law.  Did you see... Patrick, you must have seen this. I'm sure you probably even did something on DLTV.  The new tiny bendable Sony display, two and a half inch display.  I saw that. It's pretty cool.  Is it OLED?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's pretty slick.  They can't. The other stuff... It's impossible. All this is going to be OLED.  Go ahead, Patrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, so yeah, it's like a two and a half inch screen. They show it flexing. It's very exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What would you do with the... I mean, yeah, that means you could put it in your wallet and sit on it. I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can put it around... You know where this is all headed?  This is all headed. And this will be a nightmare for the generation that comes after us.  This is all headed to the grocery store.  Oh, yeah. I'm packaging.  Seriously, think about it. You're going to have everything.  Every Bisquick box is going to have a little jumping guy jumping up and down. Buy me, buy me.  It's going to be unbelievable. It's going to be a nightmare to go shopping,  especially if you're like an epileptic or you've got a little vertigo and you're going to get dizzy in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or you just get annoyed when inanimate objects talk to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Advertisements everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Between that and the federally mandated RFID chips for human tracking, it's going to be a real nightmare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no, the good news is the ads will all be programmed to your personal interests.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's exactly what I'm afraid of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, because you'll have the RFID chip. And as soon as you... This is a good one. I can use this in my speech, by the way.  You walk into the store, it identifies you, and it changes all the ads dynamically on all the packages.  It's a special Dvorak advertising.  Yeah, you walk in and the Bisquick has got, you know, maybe my picture on there.  Hey, John, look at me. You can have a good picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It might have your picture. Whoa. You're right. It wouldn't...  Now, let's think about this. If you're going to customize advertising, don't just say,  okay, instead of advertising Bisquick to this guy, we'll advertise custom yachts, but put him in it.  Put your picture in it.  Right.  Hi, John. This is John. It's like it's straight out of that Schwarzenegger film.  Yo, let's go to Mars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know. What was the Minority Report when Tom Cruise ducks down the hallway and optically scans his retina,  and then all of a sudden it's just all advertising targeted at him? It's one of those horrifying things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that movie about pre-crime. What was the name of that thing? It was a good film.  Minority Report, yeah.  Minority Report.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Philip K. Dick said this was going to happen years ago. He's known it for years.  Blade Runner. Remember in Blade Runner, ads on every surface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know if they were doing it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or at least they were outside in Blade Runner. I don't know. It's going to be a heresy.  Some of you don't even know. They have no idea what products they're going to use this on.  They don't know when they're going to release it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think John's got a good idea, though. Put it on boxes, on packaging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Put it on boxes. Put it on Bisquick. And I like the follow-up idea of having your own picture.  You probably want to buy the thing just because of the cool picture of you on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm on it. Ooh. Yeah, show you making the Bisquick. Look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're going to be making biscuits until it gets home, and then it's going to program itself with a series of other annoying advertisements.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or what about this? It's your mother's picture.  For Bisquicks? No, it's not going to be that.  Patrick, you should buy this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Honey and whatever horrible coffee Bisquick owns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, here's the twist of the whole thing. A hacker gets involved and programs the whole store to display nothing but porn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Goatse. Everywhere you look. That will happen. That happened to us. Remember, we were at the Apple Store and some guy put Goatse on our Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why don't you explain to the listeners out there? I don't want to explain. If they don't know what Goatse is, they just...  No, you can explain in vague details.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is a hideously grotesque pornographic image that has become an Internet meme. All of it itself.  Yeah, well, here's the... And if you see it, you'll regret it because it will never go out of your mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll explain what the root...  The thing is, there's a lot of people that... This image, this Goatse image is used occasionally by bloggers or website guys who don't like the fact that somebody deep linked to one of their images.  This is the big problem you have if you're a blogger and you're deep linking to other people's images, which a lot of people do.  Huffington even does it. And it's legal. But you always risk somebody swapping out the image for Goatse and then your blog will have it and your readers will not be happy.  That's why I only deep linked to Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Somebody was pirating a bunch of our images and she got upset about it so she substituted something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But doesn't that put Goatse on your site as well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not if you change the name of the photos that are linked on your website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Clever.  That's how you do it.  You're using science. Nissan used science to its detriment.  Apparently, the automaker is telling North American customers, don't put your keys near your cell phones.  Cell phones that go next to Nissan's intelligent i-keys may erase the electronic code rendering them unable to unlock or start the car.  I hate it when that happens.  If you've got a 2007 Nissan Altima or Infinity G35, these are big sellers, don't touch them to your cell phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So don't put them in your purse with your cell phone.  Do we have any documentation that this story is true?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's from, I never heard of this magazine, PC Magazine?  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, let me just reiterate then. Do we have any documentation that this is true?  It's via Wires.  We run all kinds of stuff. It's probably from a Wires service.  It's via Wires.  We run your columns, John.  Well, hey, I'm not going to stop saying it then. Do we have any proof that this is true?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, it would have to be a completely falsified article.  I think we need to test it.  They quote a Nissan spokesman, Kyle Basemore, the car won't start and the i-key cannot be reprogrammed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, well, if a guy from Nissan says it, then it probably is true.  Yeah, they're admitting it.  So what kind of bonehead key is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't have one of these keys? You know what's really bad about these? I have one.  I don't like these keys.  You have one. Your Lexus has one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I turn it off. You know what happened? Let me give you the backstory on that.  I had one of these keys with a button. I don't have the button.  I don't have the key that where you walk into the car and it starts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but there's a chip in the key. Your car will not start. You could duplicate the metal of the key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My car predates that. I don't like that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll tell you a good reason not to.  Insurance companies then assume your car is unstealable, which it isn't.  But should it get stolen, it becomes very hard to recover because the insurance companies say, you know, this is fraud.  You have an unstealable car.  There are documented cases where people have tried to file an insurance claim with a car with this kind of interlock.  And the insurance company says, no, you couldn't have been stolen. That's unstealable.  You're defrauding us.  You're kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'd also point out, John, that the announcement actually came from Nissan North America.  Quote, we discovered that if the I key touches a cell phone, outgoing or incoming calls have the potential to alter the electronic code inside the I.  Oopsie.  From Nissan spokesman Kyle Bayes.  Oopsie.  The car won't start and the I key cannot be programmed.  This problem has occurred in a quote, very small percentage of cars sold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, you just hope it's not your car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I don't even use the feature that I sound like an old fogie here, but I don't even use the feature where you knew the button feature on the Lexus, older models, I guess, older than yours.  You mean to open and unlock the car or?  Well, you push the button, it opens and unlocks it.  I like that. How do you not use that?  Well, because, you know, a few years ago, somebody came out with a universal unlocker.  Ooh.  You know, a little handheld device.  How do you defeat that?  There's a little switch on the underneath the steering wheel. You flip it and it turns it off.  Oh, I should do that.  And what happened was I have a friend of mine who had the exact same car as mine.  She told me that her Lexus was stolen.  Right.  And that's how they stole it with one of these universal unlocking boxes.  And I flipped the thing off and I never turned it back on.  And I remember a couple of years, probably it was almost 10 years ago when some guy had invented this universal device that you push it and just, you know, sends out a huge bunch of frequencies and it just unlocks all the cars in the parking lot.  And he wanted to sell the thing.  It was either online or in some magazine or something.  It was a big scandal because nobody would take the ads.  And it was like, you know, it was a controversial at the time.  And I still remember that product.  And it's, you know, as far as I'm concerned, forget it.  I don't need to. What do I need?  I can use a key.  I can find the keyhole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wish I had a crank on the front of my car.  You can't steal those.  Do you have a crank on your truck, Patrick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, but my.  No, but the crank drives one.  Yes.  Well, my actually my old Land Cruiser, the front of like the old, you know, the Land Cruiser, the top tops, the 40s, 55s, that big old 4000 pound six cylinder engine actually was designed to be hand cranked.  Really?  Yeah, I remember this.  There's a hole in the front of that.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You got to be careful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Break your arm right off.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You got to put your thumb in the right.  I remember.  Break your arm right off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jesus.  Bad, bad, bad, bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, are we old?  No, not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It kicks back.  I remember also being told that I used to have a motorcycle and there's the old Harley's.  You had to kick start them.  You know, and of course, nobody kick starts anything.  People don't kick start bikes anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's not true.  A lot of people build choppers with kick start.  Just for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, anyway, you have to be careful with some of those old Harley's because supposedly the kick start throw you right over the bike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The bike isn't bad.  There's a lot of old vintage sports der riders that actually have this strange bump halfway up their shin.  Oh, yeah.  It doesn't kick start and the compression kicks the kick starter back into your shin.  Break your leg right off.  I don't know about off, but it hurts.  I'm sure it hurts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got to come back on Cranky Geeks and show you the new Nokia.  I replaced that one that looked like a camcorder with a Nokia N95, which is better and smaller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You just get everything that comes out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have a very bad habit.  I need help.  That was why I got in this business.  Can you give me the old one?  No, I have to.  Actually, the old one was a loaner, which I'm sending back, but I did buy the new N95.  Sorry, I would.  You know what?  All you have to do is, you know, start a Vox blog.  They'll loan you one.  Well, you already got a blog.  Well, because Vox has a deal with Nokia.  That's how they let me the phone because they wanted.  I don't know.  Anyway.  Actually, the reason I bring this up is apparently Qualcomm has been suing Nokia over CDMA and  GSM patents that Nokia licensed in the past.  Apparently, it does not anymore.  In fact, Nokia is counter claiming that some of the technology Qualcomm is using belongs  to Nokia.  If Qualcomm, you know, Qualcomm has filed 11 different patent infringement lawsuits against  Nokia in the last two years.  The most recent suit says that Nokia's GSM GPRS edge cellular phones infringe on two  patents covering the uses of speech encoders.  They're asking that a judge.  Enjoying Nokia to stop selling phones in the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, like that's going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've seen stronger injunctions.  I want my phone.  I'm going to keep my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They can't have it.  I like it.  I use disposables.  I know you're you and you and the cocaine cartels.  Hey, hey, if it works in the garbage, if it worked for Manuel Noriega, it works for Dvorak.  I don't know how well it worked for Manuel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wish we Yeah, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He ended up having to sit and listen to Kiss music played on loudspeakers for 28 days.  Oh, no, no, no, no, like Linda Ronstadt.  Oh, it wasn't good music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, well, what reminds me, there's a good story about Manuel Noriega in the really in  the book Confessions of an Economic Hitman, which is on that site that you mentioned,  Leo, that you have some connection with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We didn't buy advertising on this show, so don't they don't buy advertising anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They bought one ad.  Oh, OK.  Well, thank you, though.  It's very kind of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we won't give them a plug then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, they got great response.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At last I heard they said they had 400 new users because of it, and I think they're coming  back.  But as a result of them only buying one ad, I cannot plug.  Tell me the book.  We'll say it's audible.com slash.  But what's the book again?  Confessions of an Economic Hitman?  I want to get this.  Audible.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you definitely want to get this.  This will depress you to no end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the one where the world is coming to an end in 2009.  No, this is Confessions of an Economic Hitman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It has a it is this.  I wouldn't say it's an alternative view of reality, but it may be the actual view of  reality from from at least one or two financial perspectives.  And who is the guy?  I can't remember his name.  He's he's he's gone off to become a kind of a crackpot.  I think it's I think he finally is kind of George Gilder type or no.  He was a legitimate John Perkins.  Yeah, that guy.  He was legitimate now.  But now he's gone into Ecuador and he's gone back to his roots.  He used to be a start office in the Peace Corps.  And I think he's lost some credibility because he's now writes crazy books.  But I think it's because they've drugged him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the inside story.  Speaking of is this the Speaking of Manuel Noriega part?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Suddenly the show took a turn.  Libel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the inside story of how America turned from a respected republic into a feared empire.  Well, oh, gosh, that's not so good.  What?  Huh?  Economic Hitman, John Perkins writes, are highly paid professionals who cheat countries  around the globe out of trillions of dollars.  Their tools include fraudulent financial reports, rigged elections, payoff, extortion, sex and murder.  He was one, apparently.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, he was one of the layers.  He wasn't one of the guys who killed people.  Wow, this sounds interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's a great book.  I mean, it's it's one of the best reads you'll ever have or listens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You think of it as if thinking of it as fiction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In other words.  Yeah, that's the ticket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is reasonable book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's his later books that are more sort of fantastic is what you're saying, John.  Let me see if the audible has other of John Perkins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, they only have that one.  No, they wouldn't.  That's his bestseller.  That thing was bestseller for about a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think he came out in 2004.  Do we care that Facebook has finally opened up its service to third party developers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have an API, something like it's smart, actually.  Well, MySpace has done it for a while, haven't they?  Actually, now they're starting to close down.  They want to limit the number of people who can mess around, you know, the photo buckets of the world.  I think you guys are missing the point here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's the point?  The point is that what's his name?  Zuckerberg.  Mark Zuckerberg.  Mark Zuckerberg.  Yeah.  Zuckerberg.  The guy who turned down Yahoo's billion dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I can't say much for that idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But anyway, so he made mention that he wants to turn Facebook into an operating system.  Oh, of course.  Where you can run applications.  Now, what's the last company that made this kind of assertion and what happened to them?  Isn't it Sun?  Google.  Netscape.  Netscape.  So a few people have wrecked on these shoals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because Microsoft will go after you.  So you could use Windows, OS X, or Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That would be your choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know if I want to use the Facebook operating system.  I wonder what they're going to call the operating system.  It's a series of APIs.  How about FB2?  No, he says operating system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think they should call the operating system facial.  Facial's good.  It's a good name.  I'd like a facial, please.  You may have called it an operating system, but this isn't that much different from what  Google's done in opening its API.  So is this beyond what MySpace does?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, doesn't matter.  Who knows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, Zuckerberg, he's young, he's smart, he's focused, he has a really good vision,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  and he's got a huge number of partners working on this one.  You know, you almost have to be if you turn down a business, you know, a business that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you have to say, well, this is why I've got something even more valuable.  65 new services, including photo slideshows from slide, a music recommendation service  I like that's available on iTunes right now, a music player, Uber, Uber, Uber is not a good  name for a music player.  I'm sorry.  A new video application allow Facebook users to send videos to Facebook users.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  A new video application allow Facebook users to send video messages.  This is the way the web's moving though.  In fact, that's one of the kind of fun things about MySpace.  You're going to bet all this crap on there.  Only a goober use Uber.  Uber, be a goober use an Uber.  It is not a good name for a music player.  I'm sorry.  Hey, by the way, I forgot to say happy towel day.  Did you know this is towel day, Patrick?  Do you remember wearing towels on the screensavers in honor of Douglas Adams?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A very long time ago.  We missed you, Douglas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  2001 this started, but I think it's kind of, I mean, if you look at Wikipedia, it's still  going on.  Douglas Adams passed away May 11th.  Was it 2001?  I think it was.  You were one of the last people to interview him, weren't you, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I am on my show.  I knew Doug for a long time because he and I kind of ran into each other a lot on various  Mac user events.  He was a big Macintosh user.  Great guy.  He was a really good speaker too.  Yeah, he was a really great guy.  He's had a good sense of humor, very dry, a big guy.  Kind of a big larger than life character.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In case you don't know, we're talking about the author of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the  Galaxy and the towel, of course, is what all good hitchhikers carry when they hitchhike  from star to star.  And that's why towel day is such an important day to remember.  Just really a way of remembering Douglas Adams.  But you interviewed him, I think, just a month or two before he passed on.  It wasn't too long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I know.  It was kind of weird.  Yeah, it was very sad.  Very disappointing.  Yeah, because he wasn't very old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He was a young guy.  Also, another important anniversary.  This is the 30th anniversary of the release of, anybody want to say?  Windows.  No.  Macintosh.  PC, Apple II.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Star Wars.  No, no.  I'm thinking computers.  Yeah, well, I'm thinking geeks.  There's a lot of stuff that happened in 1977.  It was a good year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was the year I would have graduated from college had I actually applied myself.  You didn't graduate?  No.  I thought you did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got into radio.  In philosophy or something.  Some crackpot study.  Chinese studies.  That's probably why I didn't graduate.  In fact, I'm going to my 30th reunion next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We won't have a twit next week because I will be in New Haven.  I thought next week we're doing the 100th.  Yeah, we're not.  We're going to do it a week from Friday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, we're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're going to do it a week from Friday.  Okay.  Or two weeks from today.  Yeah, you're right.  But I am taking next week.  I have to take next week off.  I'm going to be in New Haven.  Stone Phillips was in your class?  Yeah, he was the star quarterback jock guy.  He was a quarterback jock?  He played for the Yale football team.  I think, yeah.  Oh, the Yale football team.  Wow.  Yeah, he was the star quarterback jock guy.  He was the star quarterback jock guy.  He was the star quarterback jock guy.  He was the star quarterback jock guy.  Yeah, right.  But, you know, for you...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go deep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go deep.  Go deep.  I see you.  No, they were a good football team.  Harvard-Yale game.  That was the game.  Oh, I bet it was.  Stanford and Cal, the big game, but Harvard-Yale's the game.  You hear my dog whining?  I think he wants to go out, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, let's make the announcement to the folks out there.  You have a new member of the family.  I do.  A papillon dog.  An epileptic papillon.  Well, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We don't know what was...  You know, he was actually in really bad shape.  We thought he was going to die.  And he was in the hospital for a couple of nights.  You know, it's a great thing to get a new puppy and spend a couple of grand on hospital  bills, like right out of the chute.  I hear there's insurance for that, but I guess it's too late now.  I never heard about the insurance for that.  It was worth it.  It was worth it.  He's a very sweet papillon.  A little French dog with big ears.  I don't call him French dog, but I call him a Liberty dog.  Exactly.  Yeah, he's a Liberty dog.  So anyway, Star Wars, 30 years ago.  Do you remember...  Do you remember your first time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I went to the premiere.  Did you?  Yeah, or the San Francisco premiere, which had a lot of the people there because Lucas  is local.  Yeah, I was at the Coronet.  It was packed with celebrities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now I'm looking at the 1987...  I had some invite of some sort.  I think it was...  You were a tech writer then, weren't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I was kind of, but I think I had my software company then.  All I know is I had some sort of a special invite from someone to go to this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm looking at the old 1987 Computer Chronicles with you.  That is a hoot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I must have looked like a real jerk off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you put that on dvorak.org slash blog?  Or are you too vain to actually show people that?  I'm not vain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm practical.  You're not vain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not vain.  It's a very...  Those glasses, those are big.  Those big old giant glasses from that era.  Big ass glasses.  And I'm not going to mock you because I wore the same big ass glasses.  I mean, we all did.  Except Patrick, who was like 12.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was the glass of the day.  I mean, that was the glasses you wore.  Otherwise, you looked like a Lenin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right.  It's true.  No, because in the 60s, you did wear the little wire frims.  And then in the 70s and 80s, it became those...  Big giant things.  ...aviator glasses.  Anyway, I'll put a link in the show notes to John's appearance.  You're demonstrating PS2 computers on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's the one with David Bennell?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's a classic because it was driving these guys crazy because immediately we started to...  I think Gary Kalkall's there too.  It was me.  I was taking the thing apart.  I said, well, I think what happens when you pull this?  I basically took the whole thing apart right in front of these guys.  And they were freaked out like I was going to wreck it.  But the weird thing about that PS2 model, and I remember it to this day, is it was actually...  You could snap a bunch of things and the thing would fall into a bunch of pieces.  It was great.  You were supposed to be able to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I was supposed to.  That was the idea.  It was supposed to fall apart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It didn't snap right back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a great video and it just cracked me up.  It was circulating in the net.  This was a hot item, a viral video on the net just this week.  Where do people find these things?  I don't know.  And then they upload them.  And I looked like, besides Chaffé, I think Gary Kildall was on that show too.  Could be.  I think he was a co-host for a while.  Yeah, he was for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Digital research.  Yeah, for a very short time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think for about a year.  I wrote DR Doss and got kind of robbed.  Anyway, 30th anniversary of Star Wars.  Do you remember, Patrick, the first time...  How old were you in 77?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was seven and I saw it at the Menlo Park Mall with my parents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was it a big deal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Going to it?  No.  The ride home?  Yeah.  Because you had seen it.  Yeah, well, it was just, you know, I wasn't really exposed to much of the hype of it.  But the experience of watching the movie was pretty amazing.  I was already pretty heavy into sci-fi as a little kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's funny when you see it now.  It really looks dated.  I mean, the special effects are just, you know, obviously special effects.  It's kind of cheesy.  And yet at the time it was mind blowing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, at the time it was way ahead of its time.  I remember the movie that Disney decided to come out to show that these guys, these newcomers, these newbies didn't know what they were doing.  And so Disney said, we're going to show you how to do it right.  And they with all their old mats and stuff that didn't even look good, they came out with a movie called The Black Hole.  Oh, yeah, that was awful.  It was awful.  It was supposed to be the Star Wars killer.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That would be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was actually a fun movie to watch.  I agree.  There was, indeed, it's, you know, right.  Who is the main actor in that with the robots?  The robots were great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  IMDB, baby.  One of the top sites, by the way, in the world is IMDB because everybody goes there.  The Black Hole.  Do you have the cast list in front of you?  We'll have an IMDB race.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's who it was.  Dr. Hans Reithardt, Hans Perkins, Robert Foster, Ernest Borgnine.  Ernest Borgnine.  Slim Pickens.  Slim Pickens.  Yeah, what a movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What a cast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yvette Mimiu as Dr. Kate McCray.  Roddy McDowell as the voice of the robot.  Vincenzo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Miser has just been lost in space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It really was.  Vincenzo stands for Vital Information Necessary Centralized.  Wow.  I'm going to have to, I'm going to absolutely have to rent this.  I wonder if it's on Netflix.  Have you ever seen it?  No.  Oh, it's hilarious.  Tony Perkins, Anthony Perkins was in this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's hilarious because it's so bad, it's almost campy.  All right, The Black Hole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It would be a great movie if you were seven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I bet it's not on Netflix.  I bet you anything is not on Netflix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, you might be, well, you're probably right.  Available, yeah, it's out on DVD.  It is?  Oh, then Netflix will have it.  Well, it's probably, it's one of those, you know, it's one of those, if you have to join  a club, this is one of the free ones they'll give away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look, Disney's amazing Black Hole, special effects you won't believe, and Roddy McDowell  as the robot.  Yeah, it's on Netflix, two and a half stars.  I'm adding it to my queue.  I'm doing a little Jerry Lewis film fest.  I think it'll fit right in.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Lady!

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Lady!  No, I'm reading the Jerry Lewis biography.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Merlin Mann turned me onto this and Andy Anacko.  And it's a hoot, but it makes you want to see his films.  Just, you know, I don't know why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a lot of his films.  I've never really been able to get into a single film of his.  No, they're awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Although, I think you might reconsider that if you want to look back at them.  Here's the way I always say to look at a Jerry Lewis movie.  And you wonder why he's so popular in France.  If you look at a Jerry Lewis movie and think of it as a European film with subtitles, you  realize these are works of art.  And the funny thing is...  It's very physical comedy.  And the other thing is that many of his best movies in that vein have never been put on  DVD.  You have to catch them on Turner Classics or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, my friend Irma, which I think was his first, is on my Netflix list, my next Netflix.  And I just got...  I can't remember the name of one of them.  But this is pre-Nutty Professor.  This is early days Jerry Lewis.  How did we get into this?  Oh, Star Wars.  30th anniversary.  Somehow.  Via black hole.  Lucas, which is kind of neat, is putting 250 clips from the movies on StarWars.com.  I've been looking for those for all day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They haven't gone up yet?  And I still...  They may be up.  I just can't find them on the StarWars.com.  I wonder if they're on iSpot instead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, they're using the iSpot technology.  iSpot is a really neat kind of mashup, video mashup site where you can upload your own clips.  Oh, it's running right now in the background.  Somebody's video.  Oh, it's pretty.  You upload all your own clips and then you can mix them with other existing found footage and stuff.  And so if you had the Star Wars stuff and you could mix your own clips in, you could do some fun stuff.  I bet they do.  Good for Lucas for saying, you know...  Go ahead and do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, come on.  I'm totally the opposite on this.  Years and years have gone by with him moaning and groaning about people stealing his clips.  And now that this franchise is pretty much over and dead, he releases them and encourages people to use them so you can maybe sell a few more toys.  All right, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, how many versions of the DVDs he released without actually releasing the original versions of the movie?  I don't know if this is a joke.  And let's talk about Greedo shooting first.  I'm sorry.  I'm still miffed about that.  Forget about the whole Jar Jar Binks thing.  Sucker punch.  The re-release.  Yeah.  You know, the whole point of Han Solo is that he shot him first.  He was a bad man.  Yeah.  A redemption story.  I have no idea what he's talking about.  Go watch Star Wars.  You'll figure it out.  Go watch the VHS tape.  Then watch the spiffy renewed version of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Greedo shot first.  All I know is the whole thing went into the tank when the new Darth Vader character yells, oh no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That reminds me of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.  Although it wasn't quite oh no that they shouted when they jumped off that cliff.  Apparently, there are Jar Jar Binks cuts you can edit.  Oh, great.  That might be fun.  No nudity allowed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What do you mean no nudity allowed?  You can't put any nudity in these mashups.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who says?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.  Is it in the license?  I don't know.  That's what it says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a team of people in Costa Rica who are reviewing all of the mashups.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What about using them for having them cuss?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Doesn't that sound like a joke?  A team of screeners based in Costa Rica will watch each video before it goes live.  This is the Wall Street Journal, so it must be true.  Why does it have to be in Costa Rica?  I don't know.  What does that have to do with the story?  It's kind of a non sequitur.  The mashup project will come with rules, however.  While it won't stop anybody from assailing characters or casting of unexpected lights,  iSpot has set up a program to make sure none of the doctored clips contain nudity, pornography, and the like.  And the like.  As a backup of team of screeners based in Costa Rica will watch each video before it goes live.  Yeah, they'll be looking for buttocks.  No buttocks.  We won't have that Halo 2 thing happen here.  Not on my watch.  You're right.  Although I think Lucas has been fairly good about allowing fan films.  He hasn't been as heavy handed as he could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I heard that he was really bent out of shape over that one version of the, I think it was the first prequel,  where the one that had all the Jar Jar Binks scenes and somebody re-edited the entire movie without Jar Jar Binks.  That pissed him off.  I'm down with that.  Just to prove that it wasn't needed in the movie, it was stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But see, that pissed him off because it was an assault on his creativity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  An assault on his authority as an auteur working in the cinema.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.  Have you seen Chad Vader?  I love that.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Wonderful video podcast.  With Darth's son.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I threw the Senate at him.  The whole Senate.  True story.  Oh my god, that is so funny.  They come out of my nose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just looking at some of these mashups.  You can watch a lot of these on YouTube.  They're kind of fun.  And I mean, to his credit, they're still there.  They haven't been coal-bared.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But they were actually coal-bearing a lot of it.  Were they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, there you go.  Well, I don't know who to believe.  What does that mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Coal-bearing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where you come and you cease and desist, you yank them down, you demand a pull down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why is it called coal-bearing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know, but I just made that up, but I think it's appropriate.  I knew what he meant.  Because Viacom pulled it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You just made up the term, like the coal-bear rapport?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Viacom pulled down all of the coal-bear stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, right, right, right. Coal-bearing.  Yeah, that might work.  That could catch on.  You've been coal-bared.  It's going to catch on slowly.  Hey, I'm not the fastest guy in the world all the time.  That might catch on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, you can break your arm if you crank it wrong.  What?  Breaking DVD DRM is legal in Finland.  Yay, we love the Finns.  We love the Finns. I do love the Finns.  I'm having a party, by the way, with Finnish Herring.  You're all invited to the party we're doing with Jaikku.  It's kind of our 100th anniversary party, except not really.  Jaikku?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You keep mentioning it. I never get invited.  You are invited. I sent you an invite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't get it.  Upcoming.org. Well, just go to Upcoming.org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now we know why John doesn't get spammed.  It's because he doesn't get a lot of rest of his mail.  That's true. I did invite you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is email?  Email? It's June, actually I have to look it up.  It's June something, 12th, I think.  And if you go to Upcoming.org, you're all invited.  Jaikku is the Finnish Twitter.  Yeah, it's what I use instead of Twitter,  because I don't want to give them the trademark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There are now like seven different Twitter competitors.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But there were before Twitter came along,  because Google owns Dodgeball, which was one of the first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but they shut Dodgeball down.  Yeah, the guys all left because Google wasn't doing anything with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They were watching Twitter get more and more successful.  And they said, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't know that whole story.  That's interesting because that says to me that Google slowly  is morphing into another Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They are. They're acquiring the stuff and misusing it.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Have you guys seen the URL redirect, they're doing the DNS redirect  that they've partnered up with Dell on?  They've buried a bunch of code on all the new Dell machines  that does a special Dell Google.  If you type in the wrong URL and it does a redirect to what looks like a Google search page,  except for like the entire top two thirds, most of the top papers of the page is actually advertising stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they're changing the hosts file so that when you get a 404.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, they basically have some code, they have some lines buried.  You can remove it. It's just a non-trivial ever to remove that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course, if Dell wants to advertise on this show, it's not scummy at all, but until they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, how about Dell paying you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I haven't gotten the check yet, but apparently the check has been cut and has been sent to our agency.  So that means, good news guys, you will get paid any day now.  As soon as I get the check. Money will be flowing.  This is the drawback to this whole setup.  I suddenly realize is that because I'm not paying you a salary, I'll pay you when we have advertising,  but it takes so long to get the money by the time that you do.  It shouldn't take that long.  You forgot that you were getting paid in the first place.  And so the whole point of it is eliminated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Somebody's like, I don't know. That seems dubious to take that long to pay you.  I mean, that's six months ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've heard confirmation from various payments.  Really? Net 180?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not unusual, apparently in the advertising agency business.  See Dell, it's not Dell, it's Dell's agency. So Dell pays the agency, the agency pays us, but then actually pays PodTrack.  Well, after a couple trips to Vegas.  I guess. We're going to double this money.  Anyway, according to the Finnish courts, I love this, that it's legal to break DRM because the law in Finland only protects DRM that's actually effective.  So because it's so easy.  I love the logic.  Isn't that great? It has to be effective, DRM, or you don't have to worry.  The Finns don't talk like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like the sweet you do, but it works as a Fin. Who knows?  Americans don't get out much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I do. They sound like they're they sound like Ukrainians.  They sound like Russians. They do. They're much more like Russia than they are like Sweden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, but the Swedish voice is funnier.  I know they don't like it.  The guy, you know, the guy who, one of the founders of Jaiku, his name is spelled Y. J-Y-R-I.  Now, how would you, how would you pronounce J-Y-R-I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Very carefully.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would say like Juri or Jerry.  It's probably Jerry.  It's Yuri.  Yeah, that's what I meant.  See, they're Russians. They're just crypto Russians.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they had their day. They're, you know, they're right next door.  Right across the bay.  Yeah, it's like you throw a stone and you hit a Russian.  Targeted. We're going to know exactly why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In any event, Jaiku, which is created by Finns and I are throwing a party.  Upcoming.org has the invitation somewhere.  I'll put a link in the, again, a link in the show notes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are you inviting all the listeners?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, cool.  It's open to the public. It's kind of our, it's kind of our anniversary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're inviting the listeners?  Yes. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're going to have a bunch of food?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're going to have Finnish herring.  Finnish herring?  Finnish herring?  I know, it's herring. Herring from Finland.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not like that Danish stuff, I hope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What? Now, what's wrong with Danish herring?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, they got a herring that they just love to eat.  I like herring a lot, by the way, but I like my herring to be pickled.  I don't like just the herring soaked in oil and then added with some flavors that make it even more sickening and then eat it raw and dripping.  So it just gets all over the place and makes you burp for days.  That is not an appealing dish to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, in that case, you might not want to come to our party.  You've really made it an exciting invite.  June 19th, 6 to 10 p.m. Come. You'll be burping for days.  Citizen Space, 425 2nd Street, No. 300, San Francisco. You're all invited.  But do go to Upcoming.org and say you're attending.  A lot of salted herring.  I don't know what Finnish herring is like. I don't know if it's burp all night or...  Usually.  I think any kind of fish, if you just kind of eat it, you'll be burping all night.  Oh, and that's...  Oh, no, it's pickled. It says, and I'm looking at the invitation, it says,  eat the finest pickled herring from Finland.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, I think I've had that herring there.  They have it like it's just pickled, but then they have a lot...  It's flavored with a lot of dill and some of these other things.  It might be edible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's going to be delicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  As a side note, seeing as how this is like a tech podcast,  we got Hands On with the Zomboo $99 PC on DLTV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I heard that. I haven't seen the episode yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm sorry, I didn't hear it.  Run to DL.TV and download it now. It's interesting, actually.  It's a $100 PC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, tell us about it, Patrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's a $100 PC if you subscribe to a two-year, $12.95 a month subscription.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it's the same old free PC skin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's not a free PC. That's not $100.  Well, it's $100 upfront.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's like People PC. It's that one that Gary Kroll...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's actually...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've used a People PC. This is a lot better than a People PC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, so it's a decent computer. Is it running Vista?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it's actually running a locked down version of Linux.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that a contradiction in terms, a locked down version of Linux?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, actually. Think about it this way.  If you ever have that friend that always downloads the file that kills...  Ah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the kind of box you may want to give it to them.  Now, is it dial-up service that you are buying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's no service included with it.  What are you paying for by the month?  Well, you know what? Management, online storage, and a couple other things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, wait. Let's stop you right here, Patrick.  Is the person that demoed this for you some really hot woman?  Is that the reason that you're so jacked up about this?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me figure this out. It's $100 down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, there's... John, there's definitely some issues with it.  How much a month?  It's $12.95 a month. Or you can buy it outright for $2.49.  It's basically a silent, via-powered box that runs Linux.  That sounds good. No fans?  And stores all of its files online. No fans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's not bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, if you... The 250 version of it is completely open.  You can put whatever you want on it.  The $100 version is locked down.  Can you watch DVDs on it, though? Because it's Linux.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How can you...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, actually. You can, actually, if you buy the...  Well, if it has MythTV, you could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can get a copy of MythTV for free, and that'll play DVDs.  So will the LC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought that was breaking... I thought that's breaking CSS to do that.  Well...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know what?  I don't want to go into that conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did we ever talk about Microsoft...  As long as that cop from Detroit's not around, who's noticing?  You're in trouble, buddy!

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did we ever talk about Microsoft and their patent thing with Linux on the show?  Did we talk about that last week?  Saber rattling?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, we did. We did talk about that.  But it seems to have died down, and now Microsoft's denying that they're making any such threats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. We're not going to sue.  They say they have no immediate plans to sue.  It was clear... You know what?  This is so obviously now an attempt to create a perception in the mind of somebody who's not paying real close attention  that somehow Linux is illegal, and you better stay away from it.  It's designed for either somebody who's kind of not real technically literate, or...  We never used Linux in the first place.  Well, that's true. But obviously Microsoft feels threatened.  Or the corporate CIO who is so terrified of exposure of any kind that he's just going to say,  I'm not going to take the chance. Let's buy Vista.  Yeah, the American weasel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or the corporate CEO who's willing to make a ridiculous...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the American weasel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Although the flip side is that they do have...  They have a patent swap agreement with their own sort of related version of Linux.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The SUSE thing, or is it something else?  Yeah.  I guess we did talk about this because we mentioned the fact that the GPL3 would kind of,  if they enforce this voucher deal, open source Microsoft stuff.  I like that thought. That makes me happy.  I love that. Whoops!  Hey, speaking of oops, the Recording Industry Association of America now has decided that they're not greedy enough.  They need to be more greedy.  They're going after radio stations. Not internet radio stations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This actually isn't the RIAA though.  It's the actual agency that collects royalties on behalf of performers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, okay, I'm reading the LA Times article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not saying, don't get me wrong, the RIAA is still evil, but this actually has nothing to do with the RIAA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  According to the Times, it's the RIAA and several artists groups.  They're pushing Congress to repeal the exemption that allows radio to not pay royalties to perform.  These are performance royalties, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, you mean the one that was put down in the 30s where radio didn't have to pay royalties  because everybody recognized that radio was an incredible tool for promoting music  and that the recording industry had incredible benefits thereof that they fundamentally didn't have to pay for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, and the same group that used to actually do pay OLA, they pay you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All that stopped at Alan Fried, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, right. You know, I remember getting albums with this white powder in it,  and it was such a pain, you'd have to get the Dustbuster and clear it.  I don't know what that was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was probably because you could have made a lot of money selling around the campus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did feel it. My fingers were a little numb afterwards. I don't know what that was all about.  But that was for something else.  The old saying is, according to Chris Castle, a music industry lawyer, probably wearing a very fine suit.  The old saying is, the reason broadcasters don't pay a performance royalty is there's a radio station  in every congressional district in a record company and only three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Hey, you know what? This is kind of perfect actually,  because once they've finished killing off internet radio, which had a 60-day repeat,  they've immediately, once the RIA now is stepping in to kill off terrestrial radio.  Yeah, their greed has no limit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that stupidity is not greed, it's stupidity.  Like Patrick said, I'm in 100% agreement with him on this,  which is these guys need the radio to market their material.  They should be paying people to play the music.  They shouldn't be collecting people from people for playing the music.  They should be paying. It's advertising. Are these guys that stupid?  Well, in the interest...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, they actually, John, the next step is every time you think about music, you'll owe them a nickel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In the interest of fairness, let's ask the artists.  Did you sing that song to yourself?  Mary Wilson, who you may remember as one of the original Supremes.  She's 63 years old now, lives in Las Vegas.  Actually, when she's being quoted, she was in Milwaukee at the Potawatomi Bingo Casino, where she's singing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  After so many years of not being compensated, it would be nice now at this late date to at least start.  They've gotten 50-some years of free play. Maybe it's time to pay up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, what's interesting, right, is whether or not she would even see any of that money.  Well, she won't. She wouldn't see a nickel.  Most of the original recording artists got completely hoed on their contracts by their managers and by the recording company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's not going to see anything. You know this goes straight in the pockets of the record company.  It's unbelievable.  National Association of Broadcasters says the royalties are a performance tax that would upend the 70-year mutually beneficial relationship between radio stations and the recording industry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The NABs got their act together by saying that. That's exactly right. It's mutually beneficial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's kind of hard to believe that the record companies still do not get this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they should talk to those old payola guys and have them explain it to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where is Alan Fried now that we need him?  So, John, you have an article on Market Watch about Dell and Walmart.  Dell has announced it's going to start selling PCs in Walmart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I got that article. Actually, it was an idea that was given to me by CNBC when I did their show on, I think it was Thursday when this was announced.  And I tried to debate with some guy on the TV set there with, you know...  On the TV?  Yeah, the TV set where the waves go through the air.  And I was told agreement, which means I won't get booked again for weeks.  You've got to find an area of disagreement.  You've got to be arguing or they don't like you.  But anyway, the fact that I thought about this more and more and I've come to the conclusion that it's not just, as you say, and a lot of other people say, this just cheapens the brand to go to Walmart.  But HP is there and Apple is there and it's really not cheapening the brand that much. It's just not helping.  But I came to the conclusion that it's because Dell can't, they've not made the transformation into being a company that can merchandise their products with nice designs and something people want to buy.  I mean, their machines aren't very good looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But what's wrong with selling in Walmart? It's just another gigantic channel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's a big channel. But what makes a difference if you're lined up and they're all going to be the same price and there's some cheap EverEx machines, they're like 300 bucks.  But anyway, we have them all lined up next to each other.  And since all the machines are made in China at the same two factories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there's no differentiation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's really no differentiation except which ones are cool looking.  And Dell doesn't get that in the least.  I mean, they bought that. What company did they buy? Voodoo?  Or was it Voodoo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The gaming PC company, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they had some cool looking designs.  But you know, not much of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like mine. I have a dimension 710 with the red lights. It's so pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that's going in the right direction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I don't think PC owners care in the least about that.  I mean, there's that small group of people who like to mod.  Really?  Well, they're attracted to things that are pretty.  So really, because for years people would, you know, remember Acer, the Aspire?  Companies tried to make good looking PCs and they just didn't sell better than the beige boxes.  Those machines were ugly.  Well, you're right. They were ugly.  They were an attempt to make an attractive machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I remember one Acer machine that had a bunch of holes in the side of it in some random pad.  That's the Aspire. Yeah, that was the Aspire.  And I said, what, should I take a shotgun to this thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The same fine people who bring you the sling box bring you the Acer Aspire.  Yeah, I like the sling box.  Yeah, I like how it works, but you can't.  I actually like the looks of it.  You like the thing that looks like a plastic brick?  I just do, sorry. It looks like art.  With paws in it? It looks like art?  It does. It looks like art.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Go to the Museum of Modern Art in New York and catch up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know, this is another, this is another might, I almost don't even want to report this story,  might happen story that the state and local governments once again are lobbying Congress.  They want to get their sales taxes on net sales.  You know, companies like Amazon don't necessarily levy the sales tax.  In fact, that's why people that's like me shop at Amazon.  Although in California we have to pay sales tax on a lot of these places.  So they want to go out the law changed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they want more money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  More money. It's kind of like the RIAA.  Although they have a pretty good case, it means a brick and mortar merchant is at a disadvantage  because he has to charge sales tax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The brick and mortar merchant's at an advantage.  Why?  Because they're, because you can go in and look at the product, they can merchandise,  they can have somebody come over and say, hey, this is pretty good, you should buy it now.  I don't think people when they buy at a local store are thinking about tax.  And so when you buy it at the brick and mortar, you're buying it because it's merchandise being sold to you.  And then you pay the tax afterwards. You're not thinking, you know, maybe I can go to Amazon and get it cheaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I think, I do actually think that. I think, and in fact, I guess you would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's actually a lot of, I've known a lot of smaller vendors, like a friend of mine ran a windsurfing shop  and still does, but branched out a lot because he found out a lot of people would come into his store,  test everything out, spend two hours asking questions, decide on what they wanted to buy,  suddenly realize they had to go to the bathroom, run out and then buy stuff all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Happens all the time. I have a client that's a camera store in LA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but I don't think it's because of the tax, Patrick.  I think it's because online, some of these online stores really have much better deals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I mean, it's interesting. Yeah, tax is a minor part of it, but also the online stores,  they don't have to deal with, you know, the online stores don't have to deal with inventory.  Let me rephrase that. They don't have to deal with keeping a retail space open.  They don't have the taxes. They don't have, you know, some of the overhead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which business would you rather be in right now, John, a camera store on the, on La Brea or an online camera store?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I'd rather be online because the drive to La Brea, that's like eight hours.  Off to the tarpets we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, it's California. We're supposed to voluntarily pay the sales tax.  I was, I misstated myself. I don't pay sales tax as Amazon, but I'm supposed to keep track of it and pay it at the end of the year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  To who?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, John, you haven't been looking at your California state return.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, see, here's the thing that the way I see it.  Amazon, why is Amazon collecting money for California?  They're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It just doesn't make sense to me.  They're not. So you're supposed to do it yourself. Californians are voluntarily, supposed to voluntarily pay your sales tax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For stuff I buy in Washington state.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. They actually ask you. It's actually a line on the California state.  I buy only from brick and mortar.  Me too. I never buy online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I have never violated whatever that new law is.  And I don't want to hear from that Detroit cop either.  No, never. Bill Gates.  Go ahead.  I was going to say, if anybody's out there and they're, you know, happened to be poaching a wifi signal and someone comes up to them,  just tell the guy, Hey, this is just off of a DVD.  There's nothing like that.  Wi-Fi. What's that?  Wi-Fi. What is Wi-Fi?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm just watching, watching the DVD of my mail.  Are you going to the D conference?  The geek conference?  The D conference.  The D?  Walt Mossberg owns the letter D.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's already over, isn't it?  Isn't it over?  Didn't they do that already?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no. It's coming up on the 30th next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought it was a done deal.  I thought it was like months ago.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No?  And not only that, it's going to be the first time ever Jobs and Gates will be on the same stage for a 75 minute joint interview.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why do I? Why am I looking at photos of Jobs and Gates?  If they were at some party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That wasn't a public event.  You couldn't hear what they were saying.  Although I like your, I like on dvorak.org slash blog, your comment on Bill Gates makeup.  What's the story there?  You think he looks like a vampire?  Is that it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it seemed pretty peculiar.  But you know, the joke on there that I don't think anyone picked up on it.  Of course, now they will.  But I think it'll scroll off by the time this gets sent out is I said Bill Gates is sitting next to an apparent codger.  I never mentioned that.  Nobody said, hey, that's Steve Jobs.  He looks like an old man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Compared to Bill and his fine makeup.  Do you think Bill's wearing makeup?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not saying he is.  I'm just saying his hand looked a little peculiar.  You know, when you do when you work TV, people out there should know you like you go wear hand makeup.  People who are really pale like myself and if they're going to make you up so you have maybe a little darker tone so you don't look like you're dead when you're on camera, you have to ask them.  You have to specifically ask the makeup artist to put hand makeup on.  Otherwise you look like you got vampire hands.  Well, yeah, because what happens is that, you know, you're talking and you look like pretty normal and you lift your hand for some reason.  He's got this white hand.  It just doesn't work.  You know, so you always ask for hand makeup and you have to ask for it too because the makeup people always forget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mommy, that technology punter is dead.  So the D conference is in Carlsbad, California, just down the road from La Brea.  D stands for all things digital and Gates and Jobs will be for the first time.  It says according to the Wall Street Journal, the first time ever sharing a, you know, actually having a conversation in public.  They shared a stage in 83 at an Apple event.  And of course, Gates made a famous phone call to Jobs in 97.  But on Wednesday, they're sitting down for a 75 minute joint interview in front of a gathering of high tech executives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know what? They're going to stream it somewhere.  So I'll just watch it.  I'd love to see it.  Oh, why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because they won't say anything important, will they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, they'll probably just be, you know, be nice to each other and then they'll...  Or they'll announce a purchase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of what? Of whom? By what?  By what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which word do we want to start?  Microsoft purchases Apple, Apple purchases Microsoft.  Google purchases...  They're spinning off the Zune and the iPod into a third party corporation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you blog that, John, that hysterical, sad picture of the...  In front of the Zune offices where you turn in your old iPod for a Zune and there's like a pack of cigarettes, a couple iPods and a Zen.  There's like three things in there. It's like a trash bin. It's so sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's pretty pathetic. Who's going to turn in an iPod for a Zune?  iPod amnesty. You'd be crazy.  It doesn't make any sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They keep trying this. They apparently, they did this at the press event for the Zune.  They told all the journalists in attendance before, you know, the invitation said, bring your old iPod. We'll trade it in for a Zune.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you got, maybe you have some friends with it. Well, you probably have about 10 of them from what I can...  Yeah, but I still wouldn't do it.  You must have a couple junkers that don't work anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got one in front of me that just died. The hard drive died. I've taken it apart.  Give it to Microsoft.  Yeah, I could put it in their Zune amnesty bin.  All right, let's wrap this up. Before we go though, I want to mention, John's made a little news. You did it. You are now a vice president at Pod Show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they had to give me some title instead of the money I deserve. So yeah, I'm going to be over there.  I've been developing a five minute news update and then there's a thing we're doing, the whole network's doing,  which is going to be to put together a... It's kind of a... It's a channel. It's a tech channel.  It's not really a channel of anything new though. That's what people don't fully understand.  So that's the existing tech stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  John C. Dvorak's stamp of approval on all of the iPods.  It's a basically... Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cali, Lee Cali Adams show probably, a tech show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, your show and definitely Patrick's show.  My show.  Yeah, I mean, the idea here is not... We're not producing new stuff. What we're going to do is...  Why would my show be on it?  It's essentially considered an aggregator on steroids that's moderated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But John, I read the press release. This is a completely new concept in technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll tell you, there's some back end technology that when they finally roll it out is a completely new concept.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait. Tell me something. They're going to aggregate my shows, just every...  They already do.  They do?  Yeah.  Without my permission?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They don't have to have your permission. They just subscribe to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You have an RSS feed. It's this open game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, so they're going to have a feed reader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm the guy. You're talking to me.  Okay, you're going to have...  You want to get distribution?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're going to have... So what you're saying is it's a feed reader, an aggregator.  Yeah, hello.  It's a channel.  Yeah, but it's not just any old...  You're the vice president of a feed reader?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They do a concept in media aggregation.  No, I'm telling you...  I'm confused, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just keep... Stay tuned when they roll out their...  Ron Bloom says...  There's a scheme behind this.  Yeah, I bet there is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're saying they're doing something cool with the $25 million...  It's a feed reader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  ...chat from VC and fund.  Ron Bloom says...  Accurate, but also exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's funny is that is exactly the way Ron talks.  Does he really? I just made that up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Technology has given us this massive new distribution medium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Actually, you know what? If you search for Twit on Pod Show, the first thing that comes up is delicious forward slash twit.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, it's probably some guy that did that.  I mean, you got to remember, Pod Show, the website is not that much different than, you know, blog spot was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's podcast alley, kind of, which they acquired.  So if I search under shows for twit on Pod Show, I'm doing it right now.  You'll probably find a bunch of fans there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Delicious slash twit, Windows Weekly with Paul Thoreau, Tech Renegades, Radio, Leo, iRock with Jason Bryant.  They don't in fact have twit on here.  They have twit video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, there's twit video. We haven't done twit video in months. That's a year old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By the way, before you go on with that, the search engine is going to be fixed.  It's not the world's biggest...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I like your GoDaddy ads. Those are good.  The search engine needs to work.  So congratulations anyway. I'm glad you got a job.  Yeah, I needed one, you know. We got the deli we got to get going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The deli?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're going to sleep at this point.  I mean, what do you have like 14 columns, cranky geeks, you participate in...

Transcript:  I got time on my hands, believe it.  I'm a columnist savant. The columns don't take that long to do.  A columnist savant. I like it.  Yeah, a lot of people would make something else savant, but that's another story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. Well, anyway, I don't know what it means, but I congratulate you on it.  And keep us informed on whatever it means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can find all you need to find out at dvorak.org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course you can. And of course you can find out more about the $100 computer that really costs $250 from dl.tv.  We have other interesting stories too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Lots of good stuff. I love dl.tv.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you bring the girl on, the woman that showed you this computer?  There was no girl showing the computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Zonbo. I love Zonbo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It sounds like, you know, Zonbo good. Good computer.  Zonbo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that the name of it? Zonbo?  Zonbo.  Zonbo.  Zonbo. Zonbo computer.  Well, they really spent a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Branding. Brand image.  Zonbo good. Computer.  All right. I'm going to wrap this sucker up. Yes, our next twit will be episode 100.  I guess what I'm going to do, I don't have anything particular to do.  We've had bad results giving things away, as you know, Patrick.  So I'm not giving anything dittily away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's many people that have been calling me and writing me about the box of junk.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll tell you what, if anybody wants a box of junk,  well send me an email and I'll send you some stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It costs more, let me just point this out, it costs far more to ship this than it would be to go to your local junk store and buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Depends on which box and which stuff you have.  No, it depends. If you ship really cheap, cheap, cheap, it's not that debatable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It'll arrive in a container in seven months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My wife would be so thrilled.  What a great gag that would be to have some contest that we claim we're going to send all this junk and we make a big list.  And then we ship them a complete cargo container and drop it off in front of their house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Congratulations. It's not just a box of junk. It's a cargo container of junk.  With old monitors and stuff in staples.  I most don't want to do it. Anyway, for the 100th episode, I think what we're going to do, I don't know what we're going to do.  What should I do? We're going to have a party with Herring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, we can do that. I think we should do some, I don't know.  Should I ask people?  I think we should do a retrospective, for one thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, God, nobody wants that.  The problem with podcasts is reruns are available at any time just by going back in the feed.  Or searching Pod Show, because apparently that's all you've got is old shows on there.  I'll tell you what we could do. This would be nice.  If you wanted to record a greeting on our 100th episode and email it to us, you could do that.  How about that?  That would be sentimental.  And maybe you could help me, John, get some big names to say, you know, hi, this is...  That would be cool.  This is Condoleezza Rice wishing all of the guys at Twitter a happy 100th episode.  That's what we need. We need a whole series of those.  All right. So let me think about how I'm going to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There must be some Hollywood listeners that can do this for us.  I bet you we have some celebrities that listen to this show.  All those folks at William Morris.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Hi, this is Mike Ovitz wishing you and all of yours a happy 100th.  Keep tweeting.  Maybe what we should do is I'll put a little bug. I'll do this.  I'll put a little recorder on twit.tv.  And so by the time you hear this, there will be on the front page at twit.tv a little recording device.  You can go there if you've got a microphone on your computer, record something.  If it doesn't sound good, I'm not going to use it.  And if you're famous, send me an email saying you did it so that I know.  Or you could send me an email with the audio attached.  That would be OK to do as well. leo at twit.tv.  And then maybe on our 100th anniversary...  This is going to be so pathetic, John.  A lot of maybes here.  In our 100th anniversary show, we're going to have like four people.  Hi, this is Joe and Freeman. I love twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Happy anniversary.  How about this, Leo?  Folks, what do you want us to do for the 100th episode?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's too late. It's too late. We can't ask him now.  We should have asked him in 95 or 90.  You know what? You'll get the email, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In 1995?  You'll get the email.  We've got a whole five or six days to pull it together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, because we've got two weeks because I'm not going to be here next week.  We're going to do this.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, see, we've got time.  Two weeks is forever in podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Two weeks, we might not even be a show anymore.  John will have absorbed us into the pod show pod.  It seems to take longer than that.  You'll be burping twit for days.  All right, everybody. Thank you so much.  John C. Dvorak at dvorak.org slash blog, Patrick Norton at dl.tv.  And I'm Leo Laporte. We'll see you next time.  Another twit is in the can.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Woof woof, le woof, le woof.  Le woof, c'est le woof.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm killing you.
