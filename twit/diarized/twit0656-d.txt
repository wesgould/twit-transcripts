Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well I like. Truth is you know and I'm sure that there we have lots of young viewers and they always say you know you ought to get some people under 25.  And that's fine. And certainly people under 25 have a perspective on tech.  But we've been around to watch it happen over the last few decades and I think there is something of value there too.  Because I think you get some perspective. You don't jump when Snapchat releases glasses.  Oh this is the next best thing. Of course Mike like those Google goggles a lot the Google Glass.

Start time: 326.50
End time: 332.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I do but the snap glasses are something entirely different.  I do not like those. Kids these days with their glasses.

Start time: 333.06
End time: 435.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Pew's annual study of actually they do it all the time but they've come out with their their big findings about how young people use social media.  I don't know if you guys saw these graphs came out yesterday.  But boy it's a shocker and it's not a shocker.  I want to go down to the YouTube because that's one that's really interesting.  It comes down to age actually. Let me see if I can I can find it.  It turns out where's the where's the breakdown by.  Here it is. Social platforms YouTube Facebook Snapchat Instagram and Twitter.  Now let me explain it because it's kind of a complicated graph.  The green dot is 50 plus you and me.  Yes. Yep. The dark green. The dark blue is 18 to 24.  And here is the gap. So for instance the percentage of US adults in each age group who say they use YouTube.  Ninety four percent of 18 to 24 year olds a little bit less for us old folks 56 percent 80 percent.  Actually the only place Facebook doesn't do well is with people in their 60s.  Facebook is is completely dominant 80 percent of people between 18 and 50 80 percent 80 percent use Facebook.  I think it's I this doesn't say but I think it's every every day.  Snapchat 78 percent Instagram 71 percent.  There's just no question that there is a younger trending thing with everything but Facebook.

Start time: 435.18
End time: 478.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I think this really says this.  I think what this actually doesn't say is that each sort of age group has its own go to main source of information about the world.  And I think that for older people it's television still.  And I think for younger people it's YouTube for sure.  And so you really see this when you start asking people who are 20 22 or whatever or younger about you know everyday ordinary TV station.  Ordinary TV stars or movie stars whatever they don't necessarily know who those people are.  But the YouTube stars they have an encyclopedic knowledge about these personalities.  And most of these names would be completely alien to all of us.

Start time: 479.00
End time: 549.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know it's interesting you know I run safer Internet Day every year and we're always trying to get a YouTube star to come and be a speaker.  They charge as much for appearances as some of the Hollywood stars.  I mean these guys are you know a hundred sure all come and speak for one hundred thousand dollars.  By the way in the super news if you go to the front page of connect safely dot org you'll find I have an article called teens and social media.  It's a mixed bag. I go look at it.  And part of that is taking on this psychologist Jean Twenge.  I don't know if you've covered that. Yes.  I have. Yeah.  You know one of the things that she's shocked about is that as a result of social media young people are having less sex drinking less and driving less as if those are necessarily bad things or you know that that kids are doing that.  But I basically have taken on this whole argument and part of I'm basing it on is what's happening in Parkland Florida.  I mean that's that's anecdotal. It's just a few key kids.  But I am convinced that young people are more engaged in than my generation was.  And I come from a pretty engaged baby boomer generation and not as socially isolated.  And I have no idea how much sex they're having.  But I don't know.  You know maybe that's a good thing.  They're not having much sex.  We talked a lot about her book which is called I.

Start time: 551.52
End time: 566.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jen why today's super connected kids are growing up less rebellious more tolerant less happy and completely unprepared for adulthood which is the ultimate link bait.  In fact she was so anxious to get link bait.  She threw in about 18 concepts in one subtitle.  But worse subtitle ever.

Start time: 567.00
End time: 567.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Start time: 568.14
End time: 577.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well kids in Florida I mean I'm sorry those kids that are leading the anti you know the gun control movement is pretty are actually more like adults than the people who are running our country.  So that's right.

Start time: 578.00
End time: 592.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well I guess what you could say is that these are kids who understand deeply understand social media and actually as it turns out mainstream media.  And so because they're so activated by this issue are showing a real adeptness.

Start time: 593.18
End time: 615.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The skills that they developed on both sides of the cell phone camera work on and mainstream media as well.  It doesn't matter whether you're doing a YouTube video or you're on CNN.  If you're telegenic and know how to talk to a camera those skills are going to work for you.  And they've proven it.  They've also proven amazing mastery of social media.  And by the way I think Emma Gomez has far more followers than the NRA does which is pretty remarkable.

Start time: 617.00
End time: 657.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know one thing that the the the the thing I don't think really addresses is it's not so much I think where they get their news but how they talk to each other.  You know each of them each of the generations has a channel where they when they talk with their friends and their family and news just happens to be a part of it.  You also see in a lot of these surveys and previous Pew surveys that people don't think of oh I'm going to go to Facebook to look at news.  That happens.  They go there to interact with their friends.  And if news that interests them shows up you know it's gravy.  But I don't think that people like jump onto Facebook and say let's see what the news is today.

Start time: 657.50
End time: 703.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that may have changed quite a bit because Facebook has changed its algorithm to kind of deprecate news.  The Pew study did say they don't specifically address news but they did say now roughly two thirds of US adults 68 percent.  Say they are Facebook users three quarters of them on a daily basis.  So this this is actually really across all demographics.  Facebook is is dominant.  But it's interesting.  This is how much power Facebook wields.  They decide all of a sudden.  Yeah we're not going to do so much news news.  A number of news organizations fold immediately.  The rest are suffering.  And and it you know people still go to Facebook.  It's it's it's not where they go for their nose.  It's just where they go for whatever is there right.

Start time: 704.52
End time: 727.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah there also has been a series of studies that have shown that search now is out performing in terms of referrals to new sites.  I saw that.  Social media.  Yeah.  And we've seen that we see that at the Chronicle.  What's also interesting is that at the same time actually on one day Facebook said there'd be less news.  And then the next day they said there'd be more local news.  And we have seen some of that happening here as well.

Start time: 728.44
End time: 747.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That was a Neiman Lab report that just recently in fact I think at the same time as this Pew report came out showed that referral traffic from Facebook and we knew this is becoming less important.  But that's not all bad.  Actually I think they're talking about Buzz Sumo here which is a terrible name for an analytics company.

Start time: 748.62
End time: 749.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Almost as bad as Tech Burger.

Start time: 752.86
End time: 786.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah but Buzz Sumo doesn't invoke a lovely image of a juicy hamburger.  That's right.  It evokes an image of a cocaine addled wrestler.  I don't know what.  So in any event according to Buzz Sumo look at the shares here for instance of New York Times content going up and up and up.  Some of that of course is bolstered by the interest in politics in the last year.  And they're getting a lot of their links as you said not from social sharing sites but in fact from search engines.  Right.

Start time: 788.06
End time: 797.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which I find ironic because Rupert Murdoch is suing Google because he's complaining about the fact that they're linking to his sites which I never understood since it brings people in.

Start time: 797.74
End time: 805.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So he's now suing them because he launched the first shot by saying they ought to pay me.  Right.

Start time: 805.29
End time: 810.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  I mean I love it when people link to my article.  That's the whole idea isn't it to get viewers.

Start time: 811.46
End time: 847.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And we've seen examples in Europe where I was in Germany or France where the publisher said no no more you can't link to us anymore.  And there was Spain and the readership plummeted and they said oh I'm sorry forget I said please please link back to us.  We want that.  Here's the telling graph.  The blue line is Google referral traffic.  The green line is Facebook referral traffic and the scale is over the last year.  So the lines have completely shifted.  It was Facebook on top and now Facebook is well below Google.

Start time: 847.28
End time: 862.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And is anybody else finding Facebook more boring since they changed the article?  Yeah I never go to it.  I mean I just find I just seeing the same stories from the same people over and over again and it's not as diverse as it was before.  I liked all that all that link bait.  Yeah really.

Start time: 863.90
End time: 885.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well I use Facebook primarily to keep up with my friends and people who are far away.  I use it actually much much less for news.  And as soon as I go into it I flip the feed so that it is chronological.  Me too.  As opposed to algorithm.  And then you see a lot more.  The problem is it won't stick like that.  I know I would forget to do that.  That is the that is the annoying part of it I think.

Start time: 886.64
End time: 909.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So let's see should I talk more about social media use.  Maybe there's some more tidbits in here.  Well we did see Facebook said at I think was at their quarterly results that they had two million loss of two million users in the under 25 age group.  So I think there is some erosion among the younger people.  But they seem to be making that up with adults.

Start time: 910.02
End time: 923.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So and also with Instagram which they own.  So it's like yeah.  And that's the best strategy isn't it.  Just buy some other things.  And now they got messenger kids so they can get even younger kids and it's part of the fault.  Snapchat 78 percent of 18 to 24 year olds use Snapchat.

Start time: 927.33
End time: 928.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  54 percent as soon as they go over 24.

Start time: 929.56
End time: 935.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Although Snapchat has issues right now with its redesign and people not being happy about that.  And Kylie Jenner.

Start time: 936.33
End time: 965.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Kylie Jenner.  Kylie Jenner is not happy about that.  Pinterest.  Here's a surprise.  More popular with women.  Who'd a thunk.  Really.  Yeah.  Forty one percent of women say they use the site.  Sixteen percent of men.  Right.  Never would have guessed.  Never would have thought.  Latin America the number one area for WhatsApp.  We knew that because when Brazil tried to shut down WhatsApp it was practically a rebellion in the streets and they brought it back within 24 hours.

Start time: 966.74
End time: 989.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  WhatsApp is the weirdest thing that America where America is out of step with the rest of the world because everyone in the world uses WhatsApp except Americans.  And everywhere we go around the world everyone's like what's your that's the primary way that people stay in touch with each other.  And in the US it's like you know maybe some people use it but almost nobody uses it as their primary means to stay connected to anyone.

Start time: 991.02
End time: 1007.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is that purely economic because most cell phone plans have unlimited texting here but not in other countries.  I have no idea.  I have no idea why it is.  And I think WhatsApp is big in Latin America and Europe but not in Asia where LINE and WeChat totally are dominant.

Start time: 1008.06
End time: 1019.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know the most Americans I know that use it to communicate with people overseas.  They don't use it.  They keep it handy.  Which by the way WhatsApp is also owned by Facebook.  Right.

Start time: 1021.55
End time: 1033.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I took them all off my phone because I don't have Facebook to get any additional data from me.  I still have accounts but I just don't use them on my phone.  It's also because I was staying up late at night.  Waking up in the middle of the night looking at Instagram is not a good habit.

Start time: 1034.12
End time: 1047.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know quite a few people who have taken all of these social apps off their phone and they now only use it on a computer.  And that's a really interesting I don't know how much of a trend that is but I have I know quite a few people who've done it and now you Leo.

Start time: 1048.08
End time: 1048.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.

Start time: 1049.00
End time: 1080.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But there are a lot of apps that you can't use on a computer that you have to use on a phone if you want to use them.  Which bothers me.  I wish they would.  I'm one of these people who you know never goes anywhere without a laptop and I would rather use a computer for anything that requires typing.  But I guess I'm I'm I'm another old guy that out of touch with with the young and are we at a disadvantage in the US because we have so many messaging platforms that it's fragmented.  I find that a problem because you have to figure out that I would love it if everybody would use Telegram for instance.

Start time: 1080.10
End time: 1086.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would be I love the platform.  I would be very happy but I can't use it with I only use a handful of people who are on it.

Start time: 1087.32
End time: 1094.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Imagine if back in the day when we were kids and you picked up the phone and you had to know what phone company the person on the other end was using in order to call them.

Start time: 1094.06
End time: 1111.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know what the analog is email remember in the early days you guys are old enough to remember MCI mail and GE mail.  You couldn't email somebody across services CompuServe and and so you but then at some point I can't remember exactly what happened once you could email everybody from any service that completely changed email for the better.

Start time: 1112.22
End time: 1153.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well you know you're bringing up an interesting interesting pet peeve of mine which is I think that they that the mobile world has set us back in a number of ways.  I remember when every communication services had its own piece of software right.  You wanted to go on prodigy use a prodigy software.  You wanted to go on CompuServe use their software and then there's this marvelous thing that came along called the World Wide Web and suddenly every communication service we wanted was available on the same piece of software with a URL.  Now in the mobile world it's a separate app for everything you want to do.  And so I actually think we've moved backwards.  I completely agree.  You know even like newspapers if I want to read the Washington Post.  It's all siloed.  I got it.  Yeah.

Start time: 1155.10
End time: 1204.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. One of the ways we've moved backwards is in advocacy because back in the old days when IRC and and aim and all these different chat messaging services were incompatible.  There was a lot of pressure by the using public for them to unite and figure out how to be cross platform and so on.  And you don't see that at all.  Nobody's calling on Facebook to be compatible with Twitter and all these other social networks.  And we should be we should be trying to squeeze the social networks so that you can go to a single social.  I mean remember that Facebook purchased what was it Friendster or Feedster or whatever it was which was an attempt to unify different social networks.  They bought it and killed it because the last thing they want is for people to be able to interact with multiple social networks all in one platform.  Sure.

Start time: 1205.04
End time: 1234.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean there are ways your Twitter feed can show up on Facebook but I don't know any way for example that maybe other people do to exchange photographs between Instagram and Snapchat.  And it seems to me you're right.  You should just choose the platform you want to use rather than having to choose it based on what your friends are using.  And that's actually we studied some of these social media apps and it's not the app that drives people to a particular platform.  It's what their friends are using.  And so if all your friends are on Snapchat you're going to be on Snapchat as opposed to just picking whatever platform you enjoy.

Start time: 1234.64
End time: 1256.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a challenging balance because another example here will be restaurant reservation apps.  And I'm not advocating by the way for somebody in the chairman said you're advocating Monopoly.  No quite the opposite.  I'm advocating a standard.  Right.  Because if you had a standard then you could use any app you liked better than any other app but they'd be able to interoperate much like email is.  Travel arrangements.

Start time: 1257.69
End time: 1260.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Expedia, Orbit, it doesn't matter.  They all take you to the same database.

Start time: 1261.04
End time: 1318.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But that's because you're ordering from the same people ultimately.  But email is a better example.  You know you can use any email client you want but there's email standards and that's how you interact with one another restaurant reservation.  So here's the pros and cons.  If you're a restaurant you know there are other considerations like how much it costs how much of your profits you have to give to them.  That's one of the problems open table has a lot of restaurants hate open table.  But if you're a restaurant you'd like to be on some digital reservation system as a user though I have to figure out which system that restaurant uses.  Some use Rezzi some use open table there more and more and there's going to be this proliferation and that makes all of them less useful.  It hurts all of them.  So there's an economic incentive for you know Apple and Google and Facebook to say use our products and none other.  But at the same time you can get to unless you have dominance it could hurt you in the long run because then nobody wins right.

Start time: 1318.58

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And we were talking about generational differences in attitudes in terms of what people do.  Our generation we're a bunch of attention whores.  We want to be able to reach everybody like we want a one to many megaphone to reach everybody.  And that's why it's a problem for us that there's not a single platform where we can post and everybody on all our friends on Twitter Facebook Google plus Instagram etc etc can see that same post.  That's a problem for us.  But for young people they don't want a megaphone.  They don't want to they want they don't want one too many communication.  They want to find a place where they're 12 friends or eight friends or whatever are there and just have this small group communication in general.

Start time: 1356.30
End time: 1389.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm generalizing that's changing though because you're seeing for instance somebody's putting this out also in the chair that a lot of people are using the Snapchat filters saving them and then posting them on Instagram the competitors platform.  So I think young people even want by the way this show is turning into exactly what I thought it would which is a bunch of old folks complaining about the kids.  But I do think young people ultimately I think everybody if they can experience it would want open platforms.  Well the except for the companies who are profiting off closed blood.

Start time: 1389.10
End time: 1437.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Well you know we're we're complaining that we want interoperability but you don't hear everybody else complaining about it.  And there's no which means that for them it's working.  You know Apple Apple is kind of a good example of how it works.  You know the closed the walled garden apples by it where lock in where you end up having you know you if you I think probably the perfect example of this is the is the messages app.  Where if you're talking to someone who's using an iPhone or an iDevice or a Mac and you're texting at them using that you have this pleasant blue.  And then when you're talking to someone who is using an Android or some other device it's this like barely green.  You know it's like it looks barbaric barbaric.

But I would submit that that this is one but I think there are other data points the fact that people use Snapchat to create something and then save it on Instagram shows that even though they don't know to say the way the words open platform.  That's really what people want.  They want to use the right tool for the right job.  They just don't know what to call it because they've never experienced it.  What they also don't know is Instagram has the same filters.

Transcript:  All right now you got me on a roll here.  I am a I am a big fan of Messenger kids.  I have to disclose that Facebook is a supporter of my nonprofit connect safely.org.  We have to say that.  I like to say that.  But but you know I've been involved with involved in pre-briefing and actually in some ways calling for it over a period of years with those guys trying to get them to do a program project for people under 13.  And what I like about Messenger kids is number one it's totally under parents control.  The parents required to set up an account.  The parent has to approve every single contact.  It is not a social media platform.  It is a messenger messaging platform designed so kids can talk to their family and other children.  It has delightful gifts and masks and other other fun things you can do with it.  And unless the parent screws up it's completely safe.  Now a parent can go ahead and let your creepy uncle communicate with you.  But that's on the parent.  It's not on Facebook.  Facebook has given parents complete control.

And once they get a device they're going to find some kind of messaging platform to play with.  And if it's not Facebook kids, Messenger kids, it's going to be Snapchat or Instagram where they shouldn't be.  Yeah, that's a good point.  Campaign for a commercial free childhood.

Transcript:  A bunch of experts, pediatricians, child psychologists, wrote a letter to Mark Zuckerberg saying please discontinue Messenger kids.  Younger children are simply not ready to have social media accounts.  They're not old enough to navigate the complexities of online relationships.  At a time when there's mounting concern about how social media use affects adolescents' well-being, it's particularly irresponsible to encourage children as young as preschoolers to start using a Facebook product.  Maybe the answer is if you're a certain age, Larry, like if you're nine or ten, you're old enough to have a device and want a device, yes, but there's kids five years old using Facebook Messenger.

Transcript:  Yeah, but you know, I just came back from the Facebook Global Safety Summit in Washington.  It was actually on Thursday and we had pediatricians.  We had, there were plenty of experts.  I mean, my own, I mean, I don't like calling myself an expert, but I've been in the child safety space now for 20 years.  And there are plenty of people who would argue that Messenger kids is not, is a good thing.  Now, like anything else, it has to be done with parental control.  You can't let the kids spend too much time using the device.  There's all sorts of things that parents need to do.  But the mere fact that you're letting kids interact with their friends and their family, I don't know.  I think that I just don't agree with these folks that are making a big play on this.  I mean, they have a right to do it.  And I've, you know, I've respectfully disagreed in several public forums, including on LarrysWorld.com.  Good. And then there's Vero.

Transcript:  Do we need another social media app?  This is a social media app that has been around for several years, but for some reason that I don't really understand.  Suddenly, I think I know the reason.  Oh, tell me it suddenly took off.  They were offering free for life subscriptions for the first million users.  That's the reason it's up to it's up to three million now.  And they said due to extraordinary demand, we're going to extend this offer.  Is that the reason? Because it's free.  But at some point, it might not be.

Start time: 1707.36

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, as it approached the million, people are thinking, well, if this thing blows up and suddenly this is the social network, it costs $20 a year for the rest of my life.  Might as well sign up. And those signups caused an avalanche of users, which caused some news reports and people started discovering.  So I really think it's nothing more than that.  Now, they had so many problems with new signups that they actually extended the free for life thing.

Transcript:  And I think they've solved their server issues. I've been using it for a week and it seems to be fine.  Yeah, I do like it that it's more content focused. When you when you start to put a post up, it really encourages you to share about a book or a movie or a picture.  There are a lot of beautiful images on it. It's a pretty looking program.  It also has some nice privacy controls you choose whether people you are following are close friends, friends, acquaintances or followers.  And you can share it with either publicly or with a small group.  It's very pretty. I actually took it off my phone because too many people were joining it and I was getting nonstop notifications.

And I'm really curious what you guys think about this, because I've been debating it with everybody here at Twitter.  There is some question about its founder.  You know, he's he's the son of the former Lebanese prime minister.  He's a billionaire. He there was this is the Gizmodo article that kind of started off.  And I don't I have not done any research. He denies this.  But there's Gizmodo says that there's some evidence that he has previous startup didn't pay its employees left people to starve.  Did some nasty stuff. I don't know if we can prove or disprove that there are plenty of people defending him on Vero.  And but I guess my question is, should we care about the provenance of a program like Vero?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think you don't want to enable somebody who has done bad things to do it again.  I think that's that's the main concern.  There are other issues with this, too.  And that is if you look at the terms of service, it gives them complete rights to do anything with any of the content that you upload in perpetuity to a degree that is not found in a lot of other.  It's worse than Instagram's.  Worst than Instagram, worse than Facebook's and Facebook at one point had the same type of language and was doing things like if you remember the flap where they were taking people's faces and putting them next to products and say, right.  So it's like so that would appear and they I hated that.  You know, in theory, do that based on the on the way this is worded.  So that's something to be aware of. That's maybe a more concerning argument.

Start time: 1899.34
End time: 1918.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And of course, there's another question is, do we need another social network?  And will this be another example of a flash in the pan social network that everybody joins but nobody uses it and everybody goes back to Facebook and Twitter afterwards?  Like hello.  Like hello.  Yeah, I mean, I can go on and on like mastodon, which is the Twitter clone that everybody was excited about.

Transcript:  Well, only only if there's a backlash.  I mean, you know that we're going through a tech backlash now, and I don't think it's affected at least adult users of Facebook.  But if this backlash gets to a point where people feel that Facebook is a inundating us with too much advertising or be taking away our privacy or see putting us in the hands of Russian manipulators, then I could see some interest in people going off to a different type of platform.  That's less reliant on advertising and perhaps more reliant on a subscription basis.  I don't think you're talking about hundreds of millions of users, but I could definitely see people wanting some people wanting to move into a premium service being willing to pay for it in exchange for them at least having the sense that they're getting better privacy.  I like the idea of advertising.

But the problem is what I want is to be able to follow people and get the things that they post.  That's what I want.  And it's like impossible to find something like that.  They're always messing around with it and give me posts of people that I don't follow.  They're taking away posts of people I do follow because they their algorithms decide that I don't need to see it.  I'm tired of that BS.  What I'd like to see is like something like BitTorrent or something, a distributed peer to peer noncommercial social network where the data is distributed like, you know, like BitTorrent is.  But the interface is governed by some sort of open source thing and just get away from these gigantic companies that are just making money hand over fist, manipulating our emotions.

I actually am glad not to visit Twitter every day, Facebook every day.  And I put Vero on here.  I thought it's beautiful.  It's nice.  I really like the platform, but I don't want to spend time there either.

One of they had a really great piece at the end of last year called and this was the headline I put on it because I ran it on Tech Burger.  But it was 2017, colon the year we fell out of love with our smartphones.  And it was kind of it was essentially when we began to look at the devices as taking up too much time robbing us of real life.  You know, a lot of blame of what happened in the 2016 election, I think, falls on social networks on mobile.  And and I think that there is among thinkers and talkers and doers.  I think there's a backlash.  You know, you don't see a lot of I think of mainstreamers complaining on Facebook about how they're on Facebook too much.  Yeah, that's the that's the post.  And I don't think that, you know, however, people are cognizant of the backlash.  And I think over time, I think you're going to see usage cut back.  And even even Mark Zuckerberg has said, you know, he's been less time on Facebook.  Right. So I think he actually advocated.

But that was a big conversation that came up again at this Global Safety Summit.  If you know somebody said it's Facebook like a tobacco company or like a chocolate company.  Oh, it's a very interesting notion.  So tobacco's purpose is, you know, there's no such thing as a modest amount of smoking.  You know, one cigarette's bad for you.  Whereas chocolate, you know, chocolate's great moderation and kill you if you too much of it.

But I think these I think the various realities are going to be so addictive, so compelling and so all encompassing that the we're going to look back fondly at the era when people thought they predicted the smartphones.

We just got our Blue Apron on Wednesday, and there's some delicious...  You told me that.  I would have come in in person.  Come to it.  You wouldn't invite me.  Well, yeah, Blue Apron's the number one fresh ingredient  and recipe delivery service in the country.  Their mission?  To make incredible home cooking accessible to everyone.  When you cook with Blue Apron, you're not just having burgers for dinner.  You're making short rib burgers with a hoppy cheddar sauce on a pretzel bun.  Or maybe you're having what we're having tonight,  seared steaks and thyme pan sauce with mashed potatoes, green beans,  and crispy shallots.  You made it yourself.  There's nothing like the food you make yourself.  But you didn't have to shop for it.  You didn't have to prep it.  It came perfectly ready to cook with the recipe.  You get 12 recipes every week you can choose from.  Pick two, three, or four, depending on what fits your schedule and your needs.  They have programs for couples.  And actually, we usually feed the three of us on the couples program.  They also have family plans for families of four with more kid-friendly ingredients.  Only non-GMO ingredients and meat with no added hormones.  Look at what's on the menu.  Some fabulous stuff.  Quick bucatini with broccoli and pecorino cheese.  Pan-fried chicken breast with sweet and tangy zucchini.  You'll learn new ingredients, new recipes.  And once you've cooked a Blue Apron recipe, this is what I found,  I can cook it again.  So I'm really broadening my repertoire.  Sometimes I get in a rut, and Blue Apron just kicks you right out of it.  Italian-style shrimp and sweet peppers.  Actually, I think this is what we're cooking over fregola sarda pasta.  Parmesan-crusted steaks with mashed potato and broccoli.  You want to try it?  I've got a great deal for you.  Blue Apron's treating our listeners to $30 off your first order and free shipping.  All you have to do is go to blueapron.com slash twit.  Check out this week's menu and get $30 off with free shipping.  Blueapron.com slash twit.  We love Blue Apron.  It's a better way to cook.  And we lost Dwight Silverman.  He ran out the door to get a tech burger, but we'll get him back.  Larry Magid is here.  Mike Elgin is here.  Let's see.  We were talking about social media and smartphones.  Wall Street Journal had an interesting article.  I think it was yesterday.  Apparently smartphone sales are starting to go down.

It's like people are already pretty happy with their phone, pretty happy with the cameras in their phones and go out and spend close to a thousand dollars, which is what one of these premium phones costs.  Even, you know, Apple's the only one that actually got above a thousand, but they all approach that price.  That's a big ticket item.  It's like buying a new refrigerator.  And why would you buy a new refrigerator?  If you didn't need one.  If your old one's still working.  I haven't bought a refrigerator in years.  And there's so much else to buy.  There are drones.

But because everybody looks at the top level number at DXO Mark.  99, which bests the iPhone X and the Google Pixel 2 XL.  But if you break it down, for instance, if you look at, and this is what I find very interesting.  If you look at stills, the Pixel 2 XL is better.  If you look at low light performance, the iPhone X might be better.  It's a mixed bag.  There isn't really a best phone anymore.  You can't just use that.  They all look good.  They're all very good.  And that's the point.  Frankly, your Galaxy S6 is very good.  Your iPhone 7 is very good.  And so I think you're right.  I think there's...

Start time: 2764.76
End time: 2829.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the decline of the market comes at a time when you no longer have the plans that are  two years with subsidized pricing.  People aren't spending as much.  And I hear people complaining about the price, but ultimately, most people aren't buying  it outright.  Apple and AT&T and Verizon all have their next plans that don't charge interest.  So you're paying it per month.  And when you quit paying for it, the hardware cost goes away, which was not the case with  the subsidized things.  And in theory, with Apple plan, you could walk in every year and hand them your old  phone and get the new phone.  And you could have a new phone every year.  And if you don't go up in tiers so that you're getting a fancier phone or one with more  memory, the cost will be about the same per month.  It's like leasing the phone.  And I'm kind of surprised that that hasn't offset some of these sales because, again,  you could have, if you care, you could have the latest phone every year and it's not going  to hurt your pocketbook that much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, no, that's what we do.  We Gazelle them.  If you're ambitious, you can go to eBay and sell it yourself.  That's a little more work and you'd probably get a little more money.  But, yeah, that kind of subsidizes it.  And I guess the reason I don't do the long-term lease is I'm worried about breaking the phone  or damaging the phone.  Plus, there are family members who get my hand-me-downs.  Actually, there's also employees who get my hand-me-downs.  So, there's a ready market for the used handsets.  And I have a lot.  I've got probably four or five used handsets a year because I'm trying all the phones.  DisplayMate, like the S9, they said it's the closest thing to a perfect screen they've  ever seen.  They said it's better than any other screen, including your 4K HDR screen.  They raved over the S9.

Transcript:  So, Eulet Packard loaned me two laptops that were identical except for one had an ultra-high  definition display and the other one had a full definition display.  And the only negative side is that the ultra-definition was more expensive and didn't give me as much  battery life.  And battery life.  Yeah.  Now, when I look at them together, right side by side, I can tell the difference.  The moment I put away the ultra-high-def and walk around and look at the one with the regular  one, it looks terrific to me.  I don't even care.  I watch movies on it.  And even when I was testing both of them, I didn't even bother walking across the room  to get the ultra-high definition.  It just didn't add up to anything that really increased my appreciation of whatever I was  watching.  So, I agree.  I think that, you know, and again, I'm sounding like an old fogey here, almost like a Luddite.  But I do think that it's almost like Adam Osborne's infamous statement, sometimes adequacy  is sufficient, that having the best and the greatest isn't necessarily something that  everybody's going to appreciate.

We get all the stuff to play with.  Yeah.  That we forget that normal people are not, you know, they're buying refurb phones.  In this Wall Street Journal article, they quote somebody saying it's like a Mercedes.  I want a Mercedes, but I don't want, I'm not going to buy the brand new Mercedes off  the lot.  I'm going to wait a couple of years and buy it used and then I'll be driving a Mercedes.  It'll just be two years old Mercedes.  They think that that's what's happening with phones.

And I'm thinking the next time I get a car, I might lease it because unlike the past,  I used to keep my car for 10 years, but now 10 years from now, today's cars are going  to seem really old fashioned.

Transcript:  Lisa wouldn't let me buy the Tesla outright because she's, and she was right by the way,  shortly after I took delivery of the Model X.  I'm sorry.  Wait, it's iPhone X and Model X.  They came out with a completely new platform and my car was obsolete literally a month  after I took delivery.  But if you lease it, you're in luck.  But fortunately, I released it.  And so I'll then begin.  So this is, I mean, this is the kind of ad copy that a company would drool over from  DisplayMate.  This Galaxy S9 display performance sets many new display performance records, including  absolute color accuracy that is visually indistinguishable from perfect and almost certainly considerably  better than your existing smartphone, your living room 4K Ultra HD TV, your tablet, your  laptop and computer monitor.  In other words, it's their highest ever A plus grade.  And you're exactly right, Mike.  Everybody goes, hey, that's really cool.  And what's wrong with this one?

Transcript:  It's even better than perfect.  Believe me.  One disappointment in tech.  A good article came out today in Motherboard and part of Vice Motherboard does great work  Carl Bodie writing.  Eight years later, Google Fiber, a faint echo of the disruption we were promised.  Here's an example of something that we thought eight years ago was going to change the way  we got Internet.  And it turns out that Google's pretty much backed off.  They went through several CEOs.  The CEO now comes from the cable industry.  They've stopped expanding.  They've stopped adding cities.  There are fewer than 100,000 subscribers to Google Fiber TV, which is the TV service writing  on top of this.  Part of it, though, you can you can blame on the current incumbents who have so much clout,  as we know, in Congress and state legislatures, they were able to keep Google from using their  utility polls.  They were locked out.

Start time: 3169.07
End time: 3202.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought you were going to say because the current incumbents are also offering in some  cases internet.  They're doing and that brings up the same issue we were talking about display.  So I don't have gigabit Internet.  I have 200, 200 megabit.  You have plenty.  And and that's the thing.  I have plenty.  And it's funny because I've been thinking about going from I'm on Comcast now and I'm thinking  I could save money by going to AT&T, which only offers 50 megabit.  And there's something inside of me says, no, no, there's no way I'm going to cut my performance  by by seventy five percent.  But the reality is that if I did go to 50 megabit, it would still be adequate for my needs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And we are, too.  And we are 200 is way more.  You know, it works.  I don't know whether 50 would be adequate for that.  But we have plenty of bandwidth without the gigabit.  So even though I would even though if gigabit were available, I'd probably get it.  It just happens. Of course you would.

Start time: 3252.46
End time: 3296.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I think this article kind of article touches on this.  But I take issue with the premise of it.  I think Google Fiber was very disruptive, mainly because I don't think we would be at one gigabit with Comcast and AT&T if they hadn't done it.  I know that when they came into Austin, it completely tore up the the market there and AT&T quickly rushed in and did one gigabit.  And they even offered it here in Houston out of fear that Google Fiber might come here.  So even though they didn't show up here, just the possibility that Google Fiber would would come in, AT&T and Comcast both now offer gigabit services.  And I think that you can thank Google Google Fiber for that.

Start time: 3297.38
End time: 3318.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I think, you know, but so Austin was always going to have fantastic Internet connectivity.  I think the failure comes from the idea that I think deep down, we kind of hoped that the rural rural areas in the United States would sort of leapfrog go from horrible to wonderful.  But in fact, that never happened. So that's kind of the rich got richer in terms of bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No. You don't.  Your question has two. There's two answers.  The first answer is what is 5G and when the hell is it going to happen?  And is it going to happen as they promised? Remember what they promised with LTE.  Remember what they promised with 3G. Remember what I mean.  But if 5G lives up to its promise, one of the promises of 5G is that you would essentially be using a wireless connection.  It's as fast as a local hard drive. Exactly.  Which would totally change your thinking. I just ordered the first Windows on ARM laptop from HP.  It should be coming in a couple of weeks. It's overpriced. It's the HP NVA X2. It's a thousand dollars.  But it has a Qualcomm gigabit chip in it. It has LTE. It's a pound and a half.  It only has 120 gigs of storage. It doesn't have much storage.  It has 22 hour battery life, they claim. And that's one of the reasons I bought it to see if it does.  That is interesting. Not maybe so much now, but what if 5G comes along and now suddenly you're, no matter where you are,  operating at full speed with a total connection. That could be life changing. But I don't know if it's going to happen.  5G is just a marketing term.

But the main reason I'm getting it, I want to see what the battery life is.  And I want to see if it's usable. A Snapdragon 835, is that as usable as, say, an Intel Core M processor? Is it more? Is it less?  I plan to bring this one to Japan with me. This will be my travel.

Transcript:  So I don't think that 5G is going to be the savior for rural users. I think you still have to get the infrastructure.  You have to put the transmitters out there. They won't put the transmitters out there unless they think they have an economic incentive to do so.  There'll be enough people who will buy it. And there's the issue of getting the backhaul to match that hard drive speed.  And so it's the same promises as made before. But unless the economics are there, it's not going to get into the rural areas.

I don't know whether micro millimeter will.  I suspect it won't. I think that's going to be a problem with 5G. But I don't know enough about it. It's such a soft definition.

This is comes from Forbes, but I think it's reported elsewhere as well.  Celebrite, which is the Israeli company that's widely believed to be the company that broke the San Bernardino iPhone,  the one the feds begged Apple to unlock and then said, Never mind.  I think we got this.  They have announced it's probably good marketing that they can even get into the iPhone 10, any model of iPhone up to iOS 11.2.6.  So this is actually no, this comes from this exclusive to Forbes.  This is something that they've discovered recently.  Generally, these require vulnerabilities in the iOS operating system.  And that's something of a concern.  And these companies are holding on to these exploits.  They're not telling consumers because then they can sell their services to law enforcement, not just in this country, but all over the world.  And so we don't get the security update and they get to spy on us.

There's no way to know until much, much later when we find out after it's long too late.  But the question is, is whether this is something that's sometimes there's a theoretical possibility of being able to exploit something.  And then there's something that's genuinely exploitable in some sort of practical way.  So it's early days on this particular one.  But we'll see if we'll see what Steve says about this.

Agencies can provide the device already unlocked, furnish the known passcode or code or use Celebrite's advanced unlocking services to unlock the device.  So they do need physical access.  Once the device is unlocked and or extracted, it is returned to the originating agency.  Any extracted data is also sent to the agency.  Oh, here's the good news.  In encrypted form to ensure privacy.  Fantastic.  Well, thank goodness.  Of course, you're not telling anybody how they do it.  And that's that's my big problem with this is that there is now a strong I mean, they have million dollar contracts.

You know, I had a call.  This is something maybe you guys want to address.  I had a call today from a young woman who had a gaming machine and it was an older machine that she built with an ASUS motherboard that was a few years old.  And it had not been patched for Spectre and Meltdown.  And she said, I can't get a motherboard update from ASUS, so it won't be patched.  So I'm not using it.  And I said, oh, my goodness, use it.  Right. I don't have we oversold some of these security flaws.

Transcript:  Yeah. You know, it's funny because I have a I have a new machine which has a BIOS update and I'm not applying the BIOS update for fear that it might patch Spectre because I'm a little nervous about what that's going to do to my system.  Performance.  Performance. Yeah.  You know, the bug.  So I actually think that in some cases, the cure is worse than the disease.  I mean, yes, there is a risk.  But with all the risks that are out there, I'm not convinced that the Spectre risk is as ominous as some people fear it is.  And I'm actually more worried about my machine not working properly if I apply the patch.

Don't download software from strangers.  Don't run programs you didn't specifically go out to get.  And my new advice, which I am really pushing, is install as few programs as you can in general on any device.  We all do this.  I have hundreds of apps on my phone, most of which I will never use.  Everything you put on your computer, whether it's a phone, a tablet or a desktop, potentially opens exploits, opens holes, affects reliability.  It doesn't just waste space.  It could be a security flaw.  Don't install it.

Transcript:  Yeah.  By the same token, I think back to your original question, there's a huge mismatch between the threat of certain things that could happen and the sort of the energy behind it.  So you go to a lot of websites and they insist on this ridiculous password and the thing that they're protecting is nothing.  It's worthless.  Right.  There's no data.  There's no nothing.  And so it's very important to realize that security threats will be with us forever.  And they will always.  But you have to remember what is the threat?  What could happen?  And if the worst thing that could happen is that somebody reads your subscription to the Wall Street Journal, then you don't need Fort Knox security to secure that account.  Right.

Transcript:  And my Wall Street Journal password is a lot less secure than my banking password for that reason.  And the other thing is, you know, we and this is an issue.  Pardon me.  This is an issue in the Internet safety field.  Also is understanding the difference between prevalence and severity.  Sometimes these very, very severe threats, whether you're talking about kids being abducted or machines being taken over and manipulated, are are horrible, but statistically unlikely to happen.  So often we worry about the wrong threats.  And so it's really important to kind of think through before you take any extraordinary effort to protect yourself.  A, what is the what is the likelihood of it happening to you?  And two, what are the consequences of it happening?  And often the things that are the most severe are the least likely.  But the things that are less severe, but still extremely annoying, are most likely.

To be, you know, there's so much temptation to oversell the threat.  Again, link bait.  Yeah.  Really, I think it's incumbent on tech journalists who have the knowledge to be to share that information and say what the risks are.  Right.  I'm guilty of this.

And this isn't recent, but there was a time when McAfee would everything was like incredibly the world's falling apart.  If you don't install our software, you know, you're going to die in a matter of minutes.  And it got to the point where I stopped recommending their software.  The software is actually pretty good, but their marketing was so fear mongering that I thought they were doing more harm than good.  They've gotten better since Intel bought them.

They've rebranded it because the McAfee brand is such a strong brand.  Especially the Madame Filth.  Why they renamed it, I guess because it's not Intel anymore.  They renamed it McAfee.  Wow.  Real quickly.  Actually, let's take a break.  And then I want to talk about Amazon because there's a lot of Amazon in the news, including a big purchase and the fact that Amazon paid zero taxes last year.  Zero U.S. income taxes.  Did they make any money?  I think they did.  Our show today brought to you by My Mattress.  I tell you, the more I learn about health, the more I realize that how you sleep is maybe one of the most important things for your health.  It's not just about whether you feel rested in the morning.  Literally affects illness, everything.  And having a comfortable mattress that sleeps cool, that helps you get a good night's sleep is so important.  I sleep on a Casper.  Casper is an online retailer of premium mattresses for a fraction of the cost.  They revolutionized.  I think this is safe to say they completely transformed the mattress industry.  They saw a real problem in the mattress industry.  Massive markups and middlemen, mattress stores that weren't doing people any good.  And they said, you know, if we sell direct, if we eliminate the costs of resellers and showrooms and we sell direct to customers, not only can we cut the cost,  but we can give customers a better experience.  So what they did is they made a great mattress.  They sell it directly to you.  And you, by the way, free shipping and free returns.  If you don't like it in the US and in Canada and in the UK, you sleep on this mattress and they give you 100 nights.  You get 100 nights so you can try it.  You can see really if this mattress works for you.  And if at any time in that first 100 nights, you don't like it, you call them, they come and get it.  And they refund you every penny.  So there's absolutely no risk.  This is a better way.  This is the revolution.  There are a lot of copycats, but Casper is the original.  The original Casper mattress combines multiple supportive memory phones for a sleep surface.  Go look at the website with just the right sink, just the right bounce.  It's breathable design means you sleep cool.  And even in the winter, that's important.  You know, you've got the heat on and everything.  You don't want to be hot in bed.  You want to sleep cool.  And they don't say this in their ad copy, but I'm going to say this.  I've had mattresses I've had to air out for weeks.  They just smelled funny like the factory.  The Casper mattress, it came out of the box and it's a surprisingly small box.  It goes, opens up.  It's it.  I didn't have to air it out at all.  It smelled fabulous.  It's comfortable.  Casper is amazing.  The highest environmental production standards there made in the USA.  And you can get a Casper mattress right now and say $50 on select mattresses when you go to Casper.com slash twit.  Casper.com slash twit.

Transcript:  Right.  They actually paid taxes in previous years, but what's your tax rate?  My tax rate is close to 40, maybe 50 percent.  They paid at 11.4 percent, even though they had profits of 8.2 billion.  Anyway, I don't want to set up.  I don't want to set people up for jealousy.  But it's but there's amazing what you can do with money like that, like, for instance, buy Ring.  And that's what they did this week.  We don't know exactly how much.  Initially, we thought it was a billion dollars.  Now I'm seeing from recode numbers closer to 1.2 to 1.4 billion dollars.  Now Ring is a sponsor.  We should mention we do Ring ads all the time.  I take some responsibility for Ring's success.  I will get zero of this money, but I'm happy for Jamie and his team because that's really nice.  Here's the question.  Why?  Amazon Key.  Well, but they already have Key, right?  They tried. Remember, they tried to buy August.  That fell through.  In fact, August was pretty pissed off.  They feel like that Amazon found out how everything worked.  They said, OK, well, never mind.  And they built the shortly thereafter, they built the key system, which allows an Amazon delivery person.  This expands on that into your house.  There's a camera.  There's a lock.  They can open the lock.  The camera watches them while they put the package in the door and they leave.  Is that available in Houston?  Have you tried it?  Yes, it is available.

Transcript:  My other problem is that it is the Amazon logistics, which I don't know what it is like in Houston, but in Amazon logistics in Tallulah is some person not in a uniform in a normal car because they kind of do it like Uber where they list deliveries that they have and somebody says, okay, I'll do those.  To me, that's like somebody off the street coming into my house.  Yeah, now I don't have the problem with packages getting stolen because I have a ring video doorbell.  So maybe maybe that's the I don't know.  So is that why they bought it?  They want to replace key with ring or expand those services or have ties in.

Start time: 4877.12
End time: 4903.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it ties in with the whole ecosystem for both.  You know, I mean, when you look at Amazon, Google and Apple are all competing to own your home and have as many devices in your home as possible.  And I think it ties in with the echo, and I'm sure that they will continue to find ways to integrate it.  I suspect they're already integrated to some extent, but it's Amazon really having a really robust offering of home devices.  And I think they're going to have more of them.

But they did remember this.  They were going to launch last Christmas a security home security system and ADT sued them.  And I think that lawsuit's over.  In fact, my understanding is shortly before Amazon bought them ring settled for a larger amount than they were agreed.  You know, they suddenly said, OK, here's 25 million.  And the ADT suit went away.  So they have now on their page.  They are selling their home security.

And they and they're about to launch you inevitably into this world where Amazon is directly Amazon employees will be doing the lion's share of deliveries to the front door.  Yes.  And this is a way for them to monitor their own employees and their performance and their behavior.

Start time: 5006.04

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is something that I've been kind of pursuing recently.  I've asked Amazon several times pointed questions about exactly what they do in terms of do they listen when they're not listening to the keywords?  And are they doing are they doing experiments where they have Alexa doing things that people don't necessarily expect?  And whenever I ask those questions, they they just stop interacting with me.  They don't answer them.  And that doesn't mean that they're doing those things.  It doesn't mean anything nefarious, but it does mean that they have not answered those questions yet.  So I've read their their terms of service.  There's nothing in the terms of service that I can find that prohibits them from monitoring video feeds, listening in through Amazon, doing any of these things.  And I think it's an underexplored area.  We have this black box that we're putting in every house.  And I'm not a conspiracy theory minded person or suspicious of tech companies as a rule.  But in this case, I'm a little concerned about Amazon because they're they're so they hold it so close to the vest.  They don't tell us exactly what they're doing.  They have a history of, for example, with the fire phone of when you when you take a picture of something, they're also transmitting the audio back to Amazon and doing God knows what with it.  So there's a there's a I don't think they've earned our trust yet.  They're not transparent enough yet.  And I think that it behooves those of us in the media to keep pushing them to find out exactly what their intentions are, what they do, what they don't do.  And it's especially urgent now that they have all these ring video doorbells.

And when you're in an Airbnb, everyone in the neighborhood knows you're a foreigner with expensive equipment and all this stuff.  And so it's kind of a little bit.  You get kind of nervous.  And with a Ring Video doorbell, you come back to the house before you go in.  You check to see if anyone has gone in.  And you can see nobody's gone in and you walk in with confidence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, why?  Their whole business model is based on algorithmically determined sort of behavioral models.  So if you think about what they track and what they do on the Amazon website,  and even when you go beyond the website, whether they go where you...  They figure out where you're going, what you're doing, how long the mouse hovers over this.  Does that mean you're interested?  They're upset and look at their grocery store, Amazon Go.  This is not about a convenient grocery store.  This is about a physical brick and mortar grocery store that has the kind of behavioral data that their website has.  And so they're obsessed with understanding what people do.  And a camera is by far the most valuable sensor for figuring out what's happening in general with human behavior.  They can see who's coming, who's going, what time, how long, all this stuff that's happening.  And so they're like Google.  It's all about the data.

But Bill Gates made a statement in front of the Senate.  He said, you know, it could very well be that some company comes along and they wind up taking a big part of our business.  And of course, he didn't at the time know that Google was about to eat his lunch when it came to the Internet.  And, you know, it turned out to be true.  Not that Microsoft failed as a company.  It's doing fine.  But certainly in the area that we were all worried about in the late 90s, which was their Internet Explorer and what they were going to do online, it turned out that they didn't dominate.  This other company came around and dominated.  And maybe it's fortunate that our legal system wasn't able to do what it tried to do because it turns out that market forces were even better.

Transcript:  But there was an article last Sunday in The Times, Charles Duhigg writing about Google, said Google wouldn't exist if the DOJ hadn't gone after Microsoft.  Not so much because Microsoft shut, DOJ shut Microsoft down, but just that Microsoft got cautious.  They started looking over their shoulders and that was enough to open the door for Google.  Otherwise, Microsoft might have persisted with Explorer and Bing.  But Google had better products.

Transcript:  And now I think Google's getting cautious because of all of the antitrust stuff in Europe and so on.  Sure.  The wind being taken out of their sails.  They seem less aggressive, much more cautious about getting into things that involve privacy and so on.  So I think the same thing is happening to them.  I guess you reach a certain size and you just can't be as scrappy and aggressive as you were when you were a startup.

Transcript:  There's a real division among our panelists about whether this is going to be a disaster for the Internet or something much needed for the Internet.  I'm going back and forth, but I'm starting to kind of head over on the we do need some protections.  And since the US seems to not want to do this, it's good at least that Europe's paying attention to this.  I'm not sure I agree with all of the legal action.  No, you got it right.

Transcript:  And the FCC, of course.  And then there's always the argument, well, and I think, Dwight, you were kind of making this, this stuff changes so fast, innovation will win.  You don't have to worry.  Technology, the business cycle is so rapid that you just let it happen.

Start time: 5567.09
End time: 5591.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  On the other hand, a lot of damage can be done very quickly.  So, I mean, you could argue that the president of the United States don't worry for seven years from now, it'll be gone.  But you know what happens during those four or seven years?  So I think it's worth taking a look at it.  I mean, actually, I've been kind of one of the biggest opponents of regulation and very concerned about the dangers of regulation.  But I'm actually beginning to think that we are entering a period where the government has to be smart about it.  Unfortunately, it won't.

Start time: 5593.08
End time: 5615.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The last group I would, the last two words I would not combine, smart and government, especially when it comes to technology.  That's the problem.  And yet I'm not anti-government because there's no one else going to do it.  No one's going to self-regulate.  So I think that it's just government in terms of reflecting the needs of society is the only choice.  But we got to get smarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, you know, but that's the debate.  And we have this debate all the time.  And I am not even sure which way to go.  I remember the late John Perry Barlow telling me when the net neutrality issue was hot and heavy,  where they were trying to convince Tom Wheeler at the FCC to invoke Title II regulation.  He said, even at the EFF, at the board meetings, we've tussled with this.  On the one hand, we hate the idea of government intervention in the Internet.  On the other hand, we know the Internet needs protection.  And there doesn't seem to be a straightforward, easy answer.  Right.  Actually, the Supreme Court right now is weighing a Microsoft dispute with the Department of Justice.  This has more to do with where your data is stored.  Fascinating.  Yeah, it is a fascinating story.  The argument is over data stored in Ireland right now, stored on Microsoft servers in Dublin.  It's a drug trafficking case, an Irish criminal suspect using Microsoft, I guess, I presume Hotmail or Outlook to store his mail.  The DOJ wanted it.  Lower court said, well, you can't have it.  It's in Ireland.  But now it's up the Supreme Court.  The DOJ has brought it all the way to the Supreme Court.  And while it's very hard to read what the Supreme Court is going to do based on oral arguments, which happened Tuesday,  it does seem that at least a few of the judges are very sympathetic to the Department of Justice's stance,  which would have an interesting impact on U.S. business because, you know, data Internet is not national, doesn't respect borders.  Right.

Start time: 5718.00
End time: 5748.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the problem is the Irish authority might have something to say about it.  Even if the Department of Justice thinks it's OK to dip into a server house in Ireland, Ireland has a different perspective on this.  So and the other problem is, I mean, a lot of our laws, a lot of our privacy laws are still based on the notion of physicality.  Right.  And this notion, you know, they're based on filing cabinets, right, that you can go in and what you can do with a filing cabinet.  But when you're talking about cloud storage, it's a whole different animal, which gets into the, you know, a lot of the privacy laws.

Start time: 5749.32
End time: 5788.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And there's a corollary to this story with the case of Apple starting to store Chinese customer data.  In China, along with the encryption keys to access their data in China.  And that's, you know, the other thing is, is that while Microsoft says that the data is stored in in Ireland in a lot of cases,  particularly with cloud computing and certainly the case of Google's approach to it, the data is everywhere.  There may be a bit of it in Ireland.  There may be a bit of it in the U.S.  There may be a bit of it in Brazil.  And so, you know, the data may live globally as opposed to in one particular location.  Right.

Start time: 5789.49
End time: 5814.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  And ultimately, it's not about the location.  It's about the it's about the segregating the data for people who are citizens of a specific country and then governments trying to determine what can be done with that data.  It really doesn't matter where the data stored.  That's kind of a little bit of a misdirection.  It's about control over what happens with people's data and trying to get bring those under federal under national laws.

Start time: 5816.66
End time: 5836.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I don't I don't know all the details on this government thing, but obviously U.S. persons are involved in this case.  So it's not purely, you know, the victim somebody here is in the United States.  So it's not purely like we're trying to break into some internal Irish issue here.  The government does have an interest in this data.  The question is whether they have a legal right to access it.

Transcript:  Mike, I'm not sure necessarily that it's a distraction.  I think if you were going to have a good lawyer arguing that case, I think that that would be something that they would definitely bring up if they wanted to keep Google, if they wanted to keep the Google data private.

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by Stamps.com.  If you are if you are doing any mailing in your business, and I think most businesses do brochures, packages, if you're if you're an eBay or an Etsy or an Amazon seller, you I'm sure using the U.S. Postal Service for at least some of your mail.  Stamps.com is the easiest way to access all the amazing services at the post office without having to go to the post office.  In fact, without having to leave your desk.  That's why we use it here.  Our employees don't have to get up and leave the office to go to the post office.  They can buy and print real U.S. postage whenever they need it right from their computer and their printer.  Stamps.com never closes.  You can print postage for letters or even packages 24 7 when you need it.  Any package, any class of mail.  In fact, Stamps.com will save you money by suggesting less expensive classes of mail.  You could mail this media, things like that.  There's a great U.S.B. scale, so you always get exactly the right postage.  Never have to.  I still get packages from companies, PR people, product review units that have licked stamps and like a hundred of them going around the side of it.  And it's just not a professional look.  Stamps.com you could print right on the envelope or print a label for your package.  Exactly the right postage.  It actually gets handled better because the indicia, the barcode that's on these labels makes it easier for the post office.  You don't have to have any equipment.  You don't have to have special ink.  Nope, it's not a postage meter.  You got everything you need right now with your computer and your printer.  Stamps.com.  Click, print, mail and you're done.

Stamps.com is convenient, easy, reliable and efficient.  And they have my stamp of approval.  GitHub this week survived and this worries me a lot.  The biggest DDoS attack ever recorded.  Get ready for this.  1.3 terabits per second.  Now it didn't last very long because DDoS protection of course, GitHub had DDoS protection.  Alchemize, Prolexix service they took over.  After eight minutes the attack backed down.  But the fact that an attacker could launch a 1.35 terabit attack and it was almost certainly an amplification attack, which means that the attacker didn't have to have much bandwidth at all.  Could have had a DSL dial up modem.  But because they were taking advantage of about 100,000 memcached servers owned by businesses and other institutions that were just sitting online with no authentication.  Simple thing to do.  The attacker just sends them a special command packet.  The server replies with a much larger reply and boom.  1.3, 2 terabytes.  That's just crazy.  This is the previous largest DDoS attack you remember from the end of 2016 when almost they brought down the internet when the Dyn DNS service was brought down.  But this was even bigger.  Look at this.  This is it.  This is the picture.  This is the spike.  Wow.  Yow.  Yow is real time traffic.  But it's kind of interesting how the mitigation is happening and how quickly it's happening now.  It's amazing.  Yeah, they prepared for this stuff.  You have to throw a lot of bandwidth.

It could be literally could be a script kitty because this memcached flaw is well known.  That's what's that's what's really.  See, I don't want to oversell security problems, but there is an issue when security problems.  It's not just your computer.  It's not just getting ransomware.  You're being used for these kinds of attacks.  Then it's a public health issue.  Right.

Turns out people like to download podcasts Sunday night, Monday morning for their commute in on Monday.  And I know that's how you a lot of you listen.  So you'll find it at twit.tv like all our shows on demand audio and video.  If you have a TV in your car, I guess, or you're on one of them fancy Uber Metro train kind of things, you can watch us and you can subscribe in your favorite podcast.  That's probably the best way.  And don't forget, we can also be heard on all of the voice activated devices.  There's different syntax for all of them.  But in general, you just ask it to listen to this week in tech or any of our shows and you'll get the most recent episode.  And I think more and more that's how people are going to be listening.  Even the car going forward.  You know, I have a the Roav Viva Amazon Echo in my car.  It's fantastic.  I love audiobooks.  I love it.  And yeah, you can ask for podcasts by name.

Transcript:  But they'll get it down to a pretty good price.  If that's good.  I didn't know that.  Because I need satellite radio.  You got it.  I don't need that.  I don't need that.  The only reason I had it was a user interface.  But now that I can use my voice, that's not an issue.  Your voice is the best user.
