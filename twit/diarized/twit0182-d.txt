Transcript:  You are you can go to Dvorak dot org slash blog if you want to go to the blog.  But if you want to see all this stuff it's probably channel Dvorak is probably the best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You'll see it all on channel Dvorak dot com.  Every little bit of it also with us.  Really glad to have her because I for a while was thinking she just really didn't like me.  Molly Wood.  Hello.  We love Molly Wood.  And you know now that you're not on Buzz out loud so much I think we can have you more  on twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's good news for you because I won't be regurgitating all my opinions.  I'll practically be hearing it for the first time.  They'll be fresh.  I know I might be completely uninformed.  I have to warn you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's fine.  That's that's part for the course.  That's how we work.  That's how we roll here at twit.  So what I read your blog post which I loved really loved about being a woman in technology.  Oh thank you.  You know I didn't really get what you said because towards the end you said I'm going  to do less stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought that was funny too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I kind of liked it but I didn't understand a damn thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I kind of missed.  Well I missed kind of the point which is you weren't going to do as much buzz out loud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well you know that had been it's interesting because this blog post went up on you know  a couple of weeks after I had announced on the show that I was going to do buzz out loud  only once a week.  I'm not I'm no longer a full time host of Buzz out loud.  And so this was kind of like a reaction to the reaction of me not doing buzz out loud.  Yeah like here's what's been happening people.  And it was just one of the it was one of the it's the kind of blog post that I thought  John DeForent would just have a field day with overly personal emotional.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it was by the way in small type.  Did you say pathetic.  No it was a great post.  I loved it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what is the what is the reason for this.  I didn't see the post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Summarize it's thoughts on being a woman in technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because you're a woman you're giving up.  You know this is the problem we have the people always.  Why don't you get more women on your shows.  Why don't you interview more women.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well it's interesting because it started out as a thoughts on being a woman in technology  and ended up as a thoughts on being a human in the world.  Like people we I have had a problem setting boundaries for myself.  I was at one point doing 17 shows a week for CNET TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well I don't know what that's like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean Leo knows.  I don't know how he does it.  But I would like.  You know what the difference is Molly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're my shows.  That's the difference right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I have a toddler.  I mean not to be like you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No and I didn't do that when I had little kids.  You're absolutely right.  I have teenagers now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exhausting kind of thing.  So I just am trying to set you know.  So the post was really about in 2009 just trying to find my place.  Figure out what I want to do and set some boundaries for myself.  And one of those is like I can't do a daily show.  That is a part time job and I have a whole other full time job to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know if you if you go back to 2006.  I did very much the same thing on tech TV and a lot.  I quit the screensavers because I was doing call for help every day and then a radio show  on the weekends and people thought that was crazy.  Very similar.  And it had nothing to do with being a woman in technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  And that's where you know at the end of the post it all falls apart because I go like  this isn't really about being a woman.  The first part is sort of about being a woman or whatever.  But most of it is just about like you have to you have to take care of yourself people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I do think that there's more pressure on a woman who is a very visible woman in  technology because you there are so few of you.  There's a you have to you have this kind of burden on you.  Just as Obama I'm sure as a burden being the first African-American president you kind  of become a standard bearer for your gender which is hard for anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is it is hard.  I think I think that the worst thing you know that any woman in technology can hear the  worst insult that can be lobbied at us is you don't know what you're talking about.  And that is the almost the instant conclusion that most people make if we make a tiny  mistake if we pronounce something wrong God forbid you know that kind of thing.  You know what's.  It gets tiring that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what's interesting about that is that women always assume that it's about them  being a woman when somebody says that.  I get people saying that to me constantly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah there are plenty of men who get that.  I get it too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Everybody.  Yeah you don't know what you're talking about.  You know what you're talking about.  But we're not hypersensitized to it.  And in many cases the women because they seem to be sensitive to that particular complaint.  They go overboard with trying to know too much about something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I definitely do not do that if you.  That's why you quit.  Watch my podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  No but I think what Molly's saying I'm not going to put words in your mouth Molly but  but it's not really saying you don't know enough it's saying you don't know enough because  right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it is you know some I mean I've had my fair share of comments accompanied by Bimbo  and blonde and girl you know.  It gets a little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah right.  But the 10th would say I'd do her.  Yeah there's a nice one too.  Yeah.  You're hot even if you're dumb.  These guys are 12.  I mean you have this you know she's ugly she's a homie.  I'd do her.  You know and then there's an argument about your looks.  I mean I've seen these.  Well it's terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We don't have to deal with that John.  We don't have to deal with that.  Well it depends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I have I mean I have at this point the skin of a dinosaur.  I'm not reading those threads and getting upset about them anymore.  What I'm I'm trying to do really is just find the right compromise between my life  and my work.  Yeah right.  That's it.  Which is what everybody everybody has to do that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We all have to do that.  Yeah.  And the problem is that with this work and this is true of broadcasting actually and  acting and any other performance.  This is not just tech.  Is that it's you want to take every opportunity to get because you don't know when the next  opportunity is going to come along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You do.  Yeah.  And you just you get so excited about everything and you don't want to say no to anything.  And then the next thing you know you're half dead crying all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've learned from John.  Just say no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  John's good at saying no.  I just say no.  Say no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When you were a columnist John you at one point were doing a 20 or so columns a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think 23 was my peak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah that's unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a case of not being able to say no to isn't it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No no no no not at no.  Actually the thing is is that I had geared myself and it turns out that when you're writing  at a really high frequency essentially daily you just get into the mold of a daily columnist  and it doesn't really take you much longer.  It's almost easier.  Yeah it's almost it is easier.  And I could tell you this and people who do a lot of writing or and if they've done it  long enough to tell you the same thing it's harder to write one column a month than it  is to write 10.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah I totally agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because you never write because you never get in the groove.  If you're in the groove it's like you don't have a choice.  You got to finish it's like you know coders who program and program and tweak and tweak  and program and tweak and tweak because they don't have a deadline.  If you're like at a 23 deadlines a month you crank out this stuff you finish it you get  it done you're done with it you move to the next one.  It's like production work and it's actually easier.  I don't like I look and I don't like gearing up to do that but once you're geared up to  do it is it's not that hard.  It's a little different on with broadcasting and I think generally speaking I would always  always comment about this and I think both of you would agree at some point.  When you're which is why you have to admire the three hour a day daily guys and what you  did for a while Leo is extremely fatiguing I think much more so than writing to do two  hours or hour or an hour of like TV for example.  You are really burnt out because the because the level of concentration is different than  with writing with writing you can take a break you can do this but with TV you are geared  up you're at full concentration mode.  You can't take a mental break for the period of time that you're working and then you are  extremely worn out first and it's hard to explain to people who haven't done it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because you're on.  There's also this thing and baseball players know this that if you do another show every  day if you screw up one show you always have tomorrow.  But if you only play in a football game a week one little error is magnified.  So it's kind of nice to have another you know I'm doing about 30 hours a week and it's not  it's not tough because I'm just sitting here all the time on my little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well yeah but you got now to us down to you know fine art.  By the way stick cam according to Eric you know are my son stick cam is hosed and doesn't  work at all.  have hacked together things so it's piped through you.  You.  You scream.  Here it is for people that want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's no video though I don't care what they're doing I'm not broadcasting video I  can't get the video out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh OK well you have.  So they're doing the audio so here's the deal I just.  But my making this announcement is ludicrous because nobody's going to know what knows  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You stream TV that channel or if they're hearing it there they don't need it.  Exactly.  So here's the deal.  We normally stream video over a stick cam.com I don't know something's wrong with their  credential server not their regular server because video is still going out from other  people but I use a special server that credential servers down.  So normally we stream the video production of this and at live dot twit dot TV it's not  going out today but I only but I have my own audio server which is up twit dot a.m. and  that's what they're doing they're taking the twit dot a.m.  Audio only feed and restreaming it on various.  It's being restreamed on stick cam as well as you stream is being restreamed everywhere.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love that you know I know they're desperate for the stream.  They're desperate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're desperate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So here's a couple of interesting stories I think some really interesting stories here's  in the schadenfreude category.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What was it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I forgot what it was.  It was a great schadenfreude story that I loved.  Cable operator charter communications to file chapter 11.  Is that unbelievable.  So John John and I worked for a tech TV which was a Paul Allen joint and Paul lost a lot  of money and got fed up sold at the Comcast which promptly destroyed the thing.  He had overpaid.  He also owned Charter Communications which is a big cable company.  He'd overpaid considerably for.  I remember when he did it for cable subscribers all over the place.  Now they're struggling.  They're going to do chapter 11 on April 1st and Paul Allen.  He did the same thing at Tech TV.  He's going to basically be made whole but all the common stockholders the investors  are wiped out.  How can you.  Is that legal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It depends the way it's structured.  He did the same thing on Tech TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We all had shares in Tech TV and that was the first thing they told us.  Well Paul is going to get his money out then and then you've got nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a different class of stock I'm sure.  So that guy's so rich.  It's way deeper for the first reason.  He's loses a lot of money.  I think that's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's lost.  He says he's lost seven billion dollars on Charter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Paul's got a lot of money but it's Microsoft money.  I don't know how much he's actually made on his own.  But the fact that you can't make a cable company.  How do you lose money with a cable TV?  It's a monopoly.  Yeah.  You know it's like you have to really do some crazy things.  It doesn't make sense to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well he did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He paid way too much to acquire subscribers.  Maybe he spends too much time on his three mega yachts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's got the one.  Did you ever go on one of his yachts?  No I don't get invited to anything.  No I never did either.  But our management did but we didn't get to go.  He's got one yacht with a submarine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah that's the big one.  What?  Yeah.  I think it's got two helicopters and a submarine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the story that was told me and I don't know if it's true or not.  Paul Allen if you ever want to come on the show you're more than welcome to disabuse  us of this.  I was told that Paul who likes to scuba dive doesn't like the jarring shock of jumping  in the water.  He prefers to emerge into the water from a submarine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah well that's because his yacht is about 13 stories high.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He also has a recording studio in the basement.  You know he kind of fancies himself a rock and roll star.  He has a recording in the studio in the basement staffed full time 24-7.  So should he get the urge to lay down a track he could just go down and lay it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what will happen to the charter?  I mean because John's writing a lot of places it's a total monopoly and there's only the  one provider but they'll continue to have service right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's chapter 11 so they're not pulling the plug.  And who else is going through real trouble is XM Sirius.  Yeah Kel Surprise.  They have huge debt that they owe this month and of course Charlie Ergen at Dish.  Charlie is a character.  He owns Echo Star which is the guy people who do the Dish TV.  He owns quite a few of those bonds so he's saying I'll take it I'll take over the debt.  Well we'd like we will acquire you.  But Mel Carmozan who runs Sirius XM, XM Sirius says but yeah but I'd lose control.  So he's trying to now he's gone he's gone over to DirecTV saying would you guys like  to buy me?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Who would?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean I just can't.  Terrible business.  Right today there is no reason for anyone to pay $10 a month for radio.  I mean that is the first thing to go if you're going through your budget.  That was always the Achilles heel.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if you don't look at it.  I hate it when a company has to make money.  That's just you know that really makes it hard to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Radios is the problem is radio has been inculcated as a free service for decades and decades  and decades and the fact that they came out it's not it's not $10 a month if you look  at it objectively.  It's $120 a year plus the cost of the equipment.  It's an extremely expensive proposition and in these economic times nobody can afford  $120 a month when they can just put a CD in their player and listen to the music that  way.  I mean everyone's got a huge collection of CDs by now.  You know you can go iTunes it's cheaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or you can plug your iPhone or your iPod or your Zune or whatever into your car stereo.  Or you can stream internet radio in the car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or even better you bring down some podcasts like this one and listen to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can listen to this in your car live.  Right now there's an application on the iTunes store called twit.am.  You press a button and you're listening and frankly you know there's.  In my car?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah on edge.  I haven't got an internet.  Do you do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you do that Molly?  Do you do that?  You're not an iPhone user are you Molly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am an iPhone user yeah.  I do streaming radio.  I use the slacker radio app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Slacker's great.  Pandora's great.  AOL radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I just don't yeah it's not even about like it's breaking my heart that you know  this company has to make money and they can't.  They're trying to make money off of something that we can get elsewhere and maybe it's not  as good but it feels just as good because it's not $10 a month.  It's just not a good business proposition if there are so many alternatives that don't  cost me that much money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know it's hurting broadcast radio too frankly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah I did an interview about it actually with the CBS radio and you could practically  hear the glee in their voices as they talked about the possibility.  Really?  Is going under.  No.  I mean you know I'm sure that broadcast radio wouldn't shed very many tears if SiriusXM  were under.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No but they're wrong in thinking that's the threat.  They're threatened in the same way as XM is by internet radio.  I mean I think that there's no reason to assume that broadcast radio has a monopoly either.  Aren't they hurting just from people listening to music on their iPods already?  Oh sure yeah I think so.  I wouldn't be too gleeful.  This is going to be the Schadenfreude edition.  I wouldn't be too gleeful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You said that word twice now.  I know I like saying that word.  I don't know what it means but I like saying it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is not Schadenfreude but it's bad news.  Pioneers getting out of the TV business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Didn't we talk about this weeks and weeks and weeks ago?  Well you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's been in reverse for a long time.  This is what's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is when Ryan was on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We thought Ryan was wrong.  We thought Ryan was confused because Ryan said no no they're getting out of the business  and we said no no they're letting Panasonic make the panels but they're still selling  them.  He said no no they're getting out of the business.  He knew.  He must have known something.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Clever boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well I don't know if he did because he wasn't familiar with the fact that Panasonic was  making the Pioneer panels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well if he didn't know he failed up because he was absolutely right.  They failed up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like that failed up.  I like that I'm using it now.  I haven't heard that time.  I know that's a new thing.  I'm taking it.  It's my book.  It's a book title.  I'm taking it.  It's totally mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mine.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Dibs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a race to the publishers.  Shotgun on failed up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can both have it.  You don't care.  What are you going to do?  I hate writing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I hate writing so much that it would kill me to write another book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By the way, I got a note from one of the listeners who says broadcast radio is also bankrupt  if we're going to be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Absolutely.  As somebody working in broadcast radio I'm not too thrilled about that.  But why do you think CBS bought CNET, Molly?  To get out of broadcast radio.  To broaden, well at least broaden their depth because pardon their depth makes no sense  but to give themselves some alternatives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  Yeah, it's an escape hatch.  The internet is an escape hatch for traditional broadcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you think CBS, I would bet CBS is most interested in the streaming stuff that you  guys are doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think so.  I think there's a lot of opportunity there.  But honestly, I think that CBS and advertisers and the media world at large should be a lot  more interested than they are in podcasting and download delivery.  We are moving toward, we're an on-demand culture more and more and more every day.  I think we're going to have to get over this idea that you can't track it right and podcasts  aren't that sellable and audio is boring, whatever.  People want to be reached everywhere including at the gym and in their car and that's what  on-demand and audio gives them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's an interesting thing happening.  Obviously, I agree with you.  I wouldn't have started a business three years ago based on on-demand audio.  But there's an interesting thing happening and I'm trying to stay one step ahead of this.  So clearly, by far, by like 90% our audience listens download.  But I've become very interested and one of the reasons we're doing all this live streaming  is in the notion that yes, while you do want that capability, there's also something cool  about being able to tune into something live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Point is you want choice.  You want both.  Right.  And we're doing both.  You're doing both.  I mean, I think that is definitely the case.  And that's how you build that community too of the people who come and watch you every  day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly.  If you're not live, you're not interactive.  So if you want to be a community to me in the long run, it's not download live.  It's really about community.  How big your community is, how active your community is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I hate to disagree.  And unfortunately, I have to backtrack on my disagreement because we know we've been  doing that with Cranky Geeks to a point, but we don't have true interaction.  But Adam decided to start streaming No Agenda Live.  And it makes a big difference when you do the show because you say something and there's  not a big audience compared to the real audience.  But it's like 95 percent like you.  But the audience that's listening, they got stuff to say and they throw it at you and  you go, oh, I can use this material.  I agree.  It's like it's like crowd sourcing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is.  It enriches the show as the show is happening.  It's really a phenomenal experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And even though that's a pure numbers, it's a fraction.  Who was it said that all you really was it Kevin Kelly?  All you really need is a thousand people.  Dedicated, committed people to make it, whether it's a rock band or radio show or TV show,  that thousand people, those core P1 most involved listeners are the ones that will propel you  to success.  I don't know if that number is right.  It seems like it's low.  But right now we have, even though we're not streaming video, usually we'll have two or  three thousand people watching the video, but there's 700 people in the chat room.  And those are clearly, anybody who goes into chat room is clearly heavily invested in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  community or a netball or a Weisenheimer, which is a word I should reinvigorate.  I love the Weisenheimer's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're great.  I don't care if they're involved.  Even if they're making wisecracks, they're involved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me make a note of that.  I got to start pushing that.  Weisenheimer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got your new book, Weisenheimer's Fail Up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have dibs on fail up.  Too late.  Don't make me arm wrestle you for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, the thing is titles are not copyrightable.  Do you know that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I do know that actually from my days at O'Reilly.  We were going to call this a lot of anger about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  But you can still threaten and saber rattle.  We were going to call the show.  Remember when the twits started, we were called the revenge of the screensavers.  And I got a very nice letter from G4 saying, well, you really can't name it that.  But I could have, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You could have done whatever you wanted.  You could have told them to pound salt.  What difference does it make to them anyway?  It's not like they're doing the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Revenge of the attack of the show.  That's just confusing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You could just change the name to the people at G4 are big a-holes.  I don't think there's a common violation there.  Paul Allen sucks.  Paul Allen sucks.  There's another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Paul Allen, weirdly not good at business.  What a surprise.  Where would he be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's a coder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So 10,000 jobs at Pioneer gone.  They're going to get out of TV into the very lucrative what?  Car, stereo and GPS business.  That's where they're putting all their hopes.  Nobody's even buying cars anymore.  Crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they are upgrading their, I mean, if you're at least they're doing aftermarket.  Are they going to actually try to be OEM?  For what?  With that stuff or do after for the car electronics?  Oh, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They've always made radios for cars so it shouldn't be a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're going to do aftermarket car electronics and try to, you know.  It's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why bother a stupid?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Vizio is also killing the Plasmas.  It's kind of sad because I think Plasmas really are giving you the best home theater look.  Right now.  But LCDs are just killing them because you know why?  Because you go in the store and they're brighter and they look better in the store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I was just in Costco yesterday as a matter of fact.  And when you go to Costco, you know, anyone who's a Costco fan.  By the way, if you do a lot of shopping at Costco, you are completely clinically insane.  Not to spend the hundred dollars for the executive membership.  Oh, please do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I totally agree.  Well, they sure push it hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like every time I go to Costco, they say, you know, you'd save a lot of money if you have the executive membership.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why would you want that?  Because I get a check every year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How much I get a check every year for between one hundred and twenty five and two hundred and fifty dollars.  Rebate, which pays for the executive membership.  So in other words, I'm paying my membership is free.  That's a lot of toilet paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You really get that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know, though.  I'm like a pretty casual Costco shopper and it still pays off for us.  We go maybe once a month now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I don't go more than once a month.  But, you know, I'll buy wine and I'll buy a bunch of these, you know, these items.  I can't get out of Costco without dropping two hundred and fifty bucks.  I wish I could only drop two hundred and fifty bucks at Costco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a lot of Pampers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the point is, is that if you join the executive membership, you know, you still buy even even when they're teenagers, you still buy the wipes, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Those things are amazing.  They wipe. They're great.  They will get anything off anything.  There's some solvent they put in there, I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know what's in there, but I can't believe it's safe for babies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's amazing how off the course we go on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they say women don't belong in technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know someone said to me on Twitter, are you guys going to actually talk about news today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I wrote back like, not bloody likely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think there's a misapprehension that this show is somehow supposed to be.  Do you do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does a very good job running down the daily running down to all the high tech stories.  I'm as a taskmaster.  This is more this is more like some friends sitting around gasping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it was.  I think we should still have more take.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But let me get back to the let me let me take the detour off the road back under the freeway on the on-ramp going the other way and get back to my Costco story.  I walk in to anyone who walks in the Costco.  The first thing you notice is there's a first a display of the plasma displays.  OK.  And next to that are the LCDs as you walk further.  So they start with the plasmas.  Yes.  And I don't know of a store that doesn't do it that way.  Although I've only go to three or four of them.  I got the one in Port Angeles.  I go to San Francisco.  I go to the one up in your neck of the woods in Novato.  I go to the one in the middle of the road.  I go to the one up in your neck of the woods in Novato.  And I go to Richmond.  And then they start with this plasma.  The weird thing, by the way, is an aside.  There's a store in Washington State and Port Angeles.  It's exactly backwards.  You go into the left hand side and you go around exactly the opposite way.  It's very, very unnerving.  Anyway, so I've been I was looking at the plasmas and I have to say now you can get a really good 50 52 inch plasma for about $999.  This would have been the same device would have been $30,000 a few years ago.  It's a lot better than it used to be because the old plasmas used to posterize.  It's just a beautiful image.  Beautiful.  And the LCDs to me, I still see them falling apart.  They fragment when there's heavy action.  They don't try not to show too many action movies on the LCDs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you think that plasma really lost the PR war in some ways?  Because I feel like I still hear people saying, well, plasma is going to get burned in and plasma is a huge energy hog.  And they have gotten there's like a negative vibe about plasma.  There's just a dark cloud hanging over them.  Well, I talked to comes off as slicker and nicer and brighter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The last the last bastion of plasma is Panasonic in terms of who.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Although I read a stat and I finally started to believe that Samsung and LG said not sell 90 percent of all plasmas.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That can't be right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It must have been an error.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I find that hard to believe, too.  But anyway, the the I've talked to Panasonic people about this over and over again.  And they say the burn in thing is long.  That's not true anymore.  The things last at least a decade of constant use.  It's just a completely a lot.  But there is a little more energy use, but it's not as though the LCDs are, you know, are necessarily cheap.  I mean, they still have the fluorescent bulb in there.  I would say once the LCDs go 100 percent to LED backlighting, then I think the days are numbered for plasma.  But if I was going to go buy one today, I would buy one of these plasmas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I try to get Robert Heron on the show to talk about this and also the demise of DLTV, which we'll talk about a little later.  But my other home theater expert, Scott Wilkinson, says that these new LED backlit LCDs, they have some that the blacks are every bit as black.  In fact, even blacker than plasma.  And that really is where plasma has an advantage is in the contrast ratios.  So they are getting LCD every bit as good, in fact, a little bit better than plasmas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I would buy an LCD now.  I don't I totally admit that I think I've fallen prey to the dark cloud of her plasma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, go to Costco and look at these plasmas. These plasmas are gorgeous.  They have a lot of action movie on them.  I love my pioneer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, that's what I have a plasma now.  It's just like if I was going to get a second one, I think, oh, I don't know.  You have a plasma. You guys all buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm using a projector.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What? Oh, well, that's kind of awesome, actually.  No, if he's got a good one, that's better than anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's way better.  But you but you have to have blackout curtains on the windows to watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, this is if the sun's not pounding into the room, you can watch Vizio's also getting out of the plasma market.  Well, that's where oh, well, yeah, they're going straight LCD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they're not getting TVs. They're getting plasma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess the LCD business, you know, they apparently they've gotten to the eighth generation or maybe I don't know, maybe further.  And I went to one of the display shows and they show the different size of the panels that they manufacture at these factories.  The ones the ones they make now are the size of like they're huge.  They're like eight feet tall by, you know, six feet wide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're monsters. Oh, yeah, we had one hundred eight inch LCD on Regis and Kelly.  Kelly looked like a little tiny little elf.  She was so small. Actually, Regis did too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Regis is much bigger. They're both. Yeah, they're little people.  They're diminutive. Would be diminutive.  That's a nice way to put that.  So LCD it is. There we go. Bring it on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Two satellites collide in orbit.  I don't think that has this happened before.  A commercial iridium communication satellite and a defunct Russian cosmos satellite ran into each other Tuesday.  What are the odds of that above Siberia?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Somebody thinks something's phony baloney about this.  Oh, you talking to Adam Curry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does he think it's the grand conspiracy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, he thinks everything is, but that's kind of beside the point.  No, we don't. There's this there's this sketchy.  I mean, who says that there was who says I heard the space debris.  You can go. I was listening to Space Weather Radio Dotcom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they said at exactly this was we did it on the show at it was Thursday at I think it was three forty five Pacific.  We were listening as they said, listen, you'll hear a tone if we did if the radar detects space debris.  It was just like that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It sounds like you could do a dolphin imitation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was impressive.  So so I heard the space debris.  Of course, they told me it was space debris.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But but but but apparently over Houston right now, debris is falling as we speak.  Oh, horrible.  Debris is falling.  That's the name of my new book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is a good title.  Debris is falling.  I what I got out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't understand what we get out of the satellites collided conspiracy other than the idea of maybe not putting so much junk up there in the first place.  There was a space war and we need to one of our Thai fighters was blown up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Explain it away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so it was satellite.  Yeah, it's alien.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Debris.  It's aliens.  Alien.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It could be it could be a flying saucer that blew it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I did see a meteor in broad daylight the other day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, really?  That's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really bright streaking across the sky.  I mean, during the day.  Yeah, it was huge.  And I thought it's a good meteor.  You can see it there.  I've seen one during the day.  But I'm saying it was pretty close to the satellite collision event.  So could have been part of the alien.  Cricket.  If you already do a show with Adam Curry.  I'm going to say if you plant this with Adam and like say that's what it was, it could take.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can assure you Adam is listening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think there's just a bunch of crap up there.  And it's not surprising that it eventually runs into each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We have more of these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's Adam.  Adam is online.  This brings up a woman's driver joke.  I remember seeing from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Years and years ago where there's this woman.  Middle of the desert and one tree and she plows into it.  I mean, it's just not as unlikely.  That's the joke.  That was a hilarious joke.  I'm just saying it reminded me of that.  I didn't say it.  You guys are funny.  OK, so when does go to Windows 7?  Windows 7.  Windows 7.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Windows 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Windows 7.  Windows 7.  Windows 7.  Let's go to Windows 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Windows 7.  Now this is a completely I think a silly rumor.  But it's a rumor and we I guess we should report it.  It's certainly PC Magazine felt it was worth repeating.  This is Chloe Albanesius writing in PCMag.com that there is that Windows 7.  Will come out.  At the end of the year and there will be a free upgrade.  For Vista buyers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is what they do.  This is what Microsoft does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is what this exact same thing was announced months ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it's not all Vista users just ones that buy it.  It's ones that buy within a first date.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they did the same thing for Vista if you bought it like from October until the time that Vista.  I was amazed that this was so breathlessly reporting.  I got excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I misunderstood.  I thought it was for everybody because I really would love to have that free upgrade.  That would have made sense.  I'm campaigning for it to be a 49.95 upgrade.  It really should be a cheap upgrade.  People who bought Vista, you know, are unhappy.  They deserve it.  They deserve it.  They deserve it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We deserve it.  No, no, no, we deserve a cheap upgrade.  We should be a cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, OK, I know they're not going to go for 49.95, but but 99 bucks they could go for.  Yeah, that wouldn't be too bad.  I think that's I think that's a reasonable goal for us to.  I think it should be free.  OK, anywhere from free to $100.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Preferably closer to free.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So OK, so let's talk about the Microsoft retail stores.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You do love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, see, they're looking at Apple going, man, these guys, I mean, Apple's really I poo pooed it when Apple said, let's do retail stores.  I said, look, what happened to Gateway?  You don't want to be in the retail business.  And I was so wrong.  They say Gateway, Compuad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a whole bunch.  Well, I wrote a column in Market Watch, which you didn't put on the list here.  You ran this joke column from PC World.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was a mistake.  I'll do that.  It's OK.  No, I don't care.  Over the Market Watch columns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I wanted to mention something that seems to be overlooked in this.  Oh, you know, Microsoft's copying Apple, Microsoft's copying Apple.  Microsoft had a retail store two years before Apple had its retail store.  And it was at the Metreon in San Francisco.  In the second floor of the Metreon in San Francisco.  Why was it awful, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because it was no.  Well, as Robert Scoble pointed out, it was on the second floor.  There was no foot traffic.  You'd go in there and everything was in boxes.  And it was a flop, wasn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was there, I think, three times.  I was the only person there ever.  It was now because they didn't know how to merchandise.  How about this for a concept?  Microsoft never told anybody this store existed.  Well, right now they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, they're already doing it better.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What would you do in a Microsoft retail outlet?  How would you make?  Because the truth is, really, most people's relationship with Microsoft  isn't through Microsoft, it's through an OEM.  It's through Dell or Gateway or Sony.  They don't have a relationship with Microsoft.  So how do you make a nice Microsoft store?  You show people's computers?  Other companies' computers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's got to be a store oriented toward the Xbox 360 and games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the Zune.  I mean, I think you can make it more of a sort of a multimedia store.  It's not a computer store.  You know, it's not like Best Buy.  It's not the idea that you walk in and you're buying a laptop.  Although they should have that, they should definitely hear it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They even should because having somebody else's products, unless Microsoft,  by the way, and I have been predicting this forever, but it hasn't happened yet.  Hardware.  Hardware that Microsoft would bring out a branded computer someday.  And if they were going to do that, they'd have to do this store  because they'd never sell any if they didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's ultimately why Apple did a retail store,  is they couldn't get Apple computers in regular retail.  They said, we've got to do it ourselves.  They had a good app.  They have a deal with CompUSA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's because they kept yanking them out of Apple retail because they couldn't control it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  The control was the issue.  In fact, I've been writing about this since the first computer store opened  when Byte was, you know, the Byte stores in Computerland,  which is the fact that I could not understand why these hardware companies  weren't opening not necessarily mega stores or big stores like the Gateway Store,  which I thought was poorly advised, but small little outlet stores,  the way the car companies used to do in the 50s,  that just had their models there for sale and a salesman who knew how to sell  that had one sales pitch.  I want you to buy this computer.  When you went to CompUSA, it's a crap shoot on who's getting bribed  as to what they're going to push.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think the reason I think the Apple stores have done a phenomenal,  a phenomenal, wow, a phenomenal.  This is what happens when I only do this once a week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now we see why you quit the radio show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Phenomenal amount of good for the brand.  Like, I think that those stores have really contributed to their rise  in market share because you can go in, have a nice interaction,  and walk out with something.  There's an instant gratification that occurs,  and it's a pretty good retail experience.  If Microsoft can replicate that, then I think that it will be huge for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well, we know they won't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They'll probably blow it. It's true.  They're not the best at marketing ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, they're monopolists.  Monopolists don't know how to.  They never get good at marketing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's no pressure on them to do so.  Is there any PC manufacturer who does a good job of this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of sales, of direct sales?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, direct sales. Gateway Store wasn't so hot.  Dell does some.  Like, they're in malls and places and stuff.  But is there anybody who does a good job? Sony?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a lot, and that's why I think the Apple store's been so good.  No, none of them do.  Maybe Sony. They have those weird Sony-style stores.  But with Apple, it's like it's an easy experience for someone to walk in and buy an iMac and leave.  And if you can make it that easy to buy a computer, that's just a winner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They've really paid attention to a lot of details, too.  You know, the way you're approached in the store, you don't wait in line at a cash register.  You know, they will sell you the computer you're standing right there.  They carry those little Windows mobile devices.  They've done it right.  Yeah, it's not a perfect read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everybody is going to have a story about how they went in there and it sucked.  But for the most part, you can have a pretty good experience and they know what they're talking about.  And I think that makes a big difference.  And then they actually, to a certain degree, demystify the purchase process.  You don't have to make that many choices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I think it's kind of a lie that not just Apple,  but every PC maker tells that these things are easy to use and that you're going to be able to get home and do something with it.  I often feel like they're really...  In fact, all of us are a little bit party to this misleading normal people because the truth is...  Totally.  It's really not that easy.  It's really a mess.  You get home, it's going to be a nightmare.  You're going to be pulling your hair out.  Nobody tells the real truth about this stuff.  Don't we all kind of...  Aren't we a little bit culpable there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, the thing is that from the beginning of the personal computer desktop microcomputer revolution in the mid 70s,  it was always required that you had a friend, somebody that would help you get up to speed because it's not that hard.  If you take somebody and sit them in front of a Macintosh or even a PC for that matter,  and you spend 15 minutes with them showing them how to do this, that, and the other thing,  they'll at least be on their way and then they can maybe call you again shortly after.  But it's a very community-oriented thing.  It's like learning how to drive.  Learning how to drive.  I mean, you just don't go buy a car and then drive.  You have to be taught how to drive and you have to take tests and your dad shows you how to drive or whatever.  Yeah, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, we assume that we could just drive a computer without anything.  We just sit down and work.  But I think we're told that.  It takes the village.  It takes the village.  Well, you know, in the early days of automobiles, when you bought an automobile, you got a driver mechanic with it.  You didn't expect to do it yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and Tom Merritt makes this point a lot that the computer is still fundamentally,  even now after all these years, kind of a tinkerers' machine, a tinkerers' experience.  I think it's worse.  It's worse than ever.  Yeah, I think it's just getting more confusing and then more fractured.  You know, you've got more alternatives, whether it's the Dell or HP putting a little mini OS over top of Windows for instant boot  and then, you know, the Windows versus Mac thing and then the boot camp thing and then it's just a mess out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have to be an enthusiast to have a chance at this.  And then the security issues alone.  Yeah.  You know, I got a call from a friend saying, my Aunt Petunia, can you stop at her house?  The computer's not working.  And it's like, you know, I can't because if I started doing that, I'd be stopping at Aunt Petunia's house, you know, everybody's house every day.  But you need a friend who could do it.  And if you're not, you're really out of luck.  Well, there's nothing we can do about it.  Just everybody should buy more computers and then demand better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know what the solution is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sorry. Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know what you're going to want to know about the live birth on quick.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I thought that was an interesting.

Transcript:  We'll talk about that in a moment, but we'll also talk about what?  What do you think, Interest?

Actually, I should ask you, Molly.  You're a mother.  What if your husband had said, honey,  there's 500 people watching you right now.  Give birth.  Give my little shout out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I cannot even imagine.  I actually did a bit about this on the Buzz Report and was just like,  you've got to be kidding me.  Like, presumably, as soon as this woman recovered from birth,  she threw a garbage can at this guy.  Like, that will kill you.  You son of a bitch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My wife was mad at me anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She said, you got me into this, you son of a bitch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And if I'd been videoing it, that would have been.  But let alone, this is more than videoing it.  This is streaming it.  It's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I would, I'm assuming that she's in on it and okay with it.  But I don't know.  I mean, if this is the first baby, I don't think you have any clue.  I just know, just know.  Like, you know, there's the question of just because you can doesn't mean you  should shouldn't like be illegal.  You can put whatever you want on the Internet.  But for God's sake, people have some self-respect.  It's a baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's interesting here to me is that the headline is another baby birth  stream.  How many times is this going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the second one that I know of because we did the thing on the Buzz  Report a couple of weeks ago.  I did a new stream.  What happens if it becomes a fad?  Can you imagine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This was a C-section.  Mommy, mommy, how come I wasn't on the stream when I was born?  Didn't you love me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How come you didn't stream my birth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There'll be a new it'll be the new bumper sticker.  My child was a live stream birth.  Live stream birth.  We break for live streamed births.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The nurse said turn it off, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And he didn't.  The nurse knew.  The nurse knew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But, you know, I have to admit that I think this is a way to do it.  I think this is a way that anxious fathers are handling their anxiety.  I remember that now my daughter was born in 92, so we didn't have that much.  But we had hypercard.  And I made a hypercard stack that would time the contractions every time I  pressed the space bar.  What a nerd.  So I said, honey, are you having a contraction?  Is it now?  Is it now?  Now?  Then I pressed the space bar.  But it didn't work so well.  But but but but but but but but Amber MacArthur, who just had a baby a couple  of weeks ago, her she said we use the iPhone contraction timer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, really?  I was there first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If only I'd commercialized the product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Whatever happened.  Yeah, you could actually made a patent.  You could have made a buck.  Whatever happened to what happened to patent the hypercard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, it just kind of withered in the vine.  There there were clones made.  It was you remember how important and how big a deal that was.  I mean, it really it made it the first one that you could really easily write  software for a Mac graphical stuff.  It was very cool.  But it's long gone.  Talk about dying on the vine.  Yeah, there's a lot of stuff like that.  If you know, fortunately, I have no short term memory, so I don't remember it.  But there, you know, every once in a while, I read a story and I go, oh, yeah, I  remember that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So here's a story that I was thinking of.  This one, Canon has no sense of humor, tries to shut down fake Chuck Chuck  Westfall blog update and fails.  What is this?  So Chuck Westfall, is he the CEO of who is Chuck Westfall?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.  Well, I know, according to this picture on the Thomas Hawks digital

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  connection, he some looks like a guy who should be doing, you know, those  documentaries about Chuck Westfall.  That's a joke.  Chuck Chuck Westfall is the technical guy.  Chuck, Chuck Westfall is the technical information advisor for the camera

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  marketing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, so he's like he's like the point man to help you with Canon issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think so. Yeah.  Or to. Yeah.  I mean, he's a so he's a marketing guy.  Apparently he's well known, it says, in the photography community.  He's interviewed a lot about photography and photographic equipment,  magazines online.  So he's sort of a and this is where it gets a little sticky.  He's a slight public figure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, he's not like if it was fake, fake Obama blog or fake Steve Jobs, you  can't do anything about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But because this guy is maybe not a like, no, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Molly said indicate that I think he kind of is.  I think he is, in fact, a public face of Canon.  Then I think that they have almost fair game.  It's fair game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not like they didn't say fake.  It's in the name.  Right. That too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it says here's the main objections that Canon seems to have as cited.  Who? I'm sorry.  This sentence, I just don't like it.  But anyway, always the writer.  No, I'm just that's not writing.  It's typing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's not writing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's typing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is this sentence needs number one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The fact that fake Chuck is using the Canon stylized logo, which you which there's  some maybe.  But again, this is a parody for the humor is always protected, by the way,  threats of physical violence against their client and employees.  What is that?  An invasion of privacy and the overall look, feel and the tone of the blog is  calculated to mislead.  Isn't the word fake used here?  Yeah, over and over.  How is that misleading anybody?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, well, and they took down the logo.  They were like, all right, well, maybe the one even remotely legitimate argument  you have here is that we're using a trademark logo.  So goodbye to the logo.  And now we're all good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love it because WordPress, it's on WordPress.com and WordPress stood up for  the blogger, which I really think is great.  They wrote back saying the owner has removed the Canon logo.  We consider the privacy complaint about the names of Chuck's wife, a child  void, since he mentions them in his own biography.  There you go.  We also find biography.  We also reject your other complaints regarding the blog being confused because  that says fake.  And the about page actually starts with high.  I'm not actually Chuck Westfall.  And it's satire.  So good for WordPress really kind of stood up to Canon on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, no, they can't afford not to because if everybody has a petty grievance  against every little thing that tries to be funny on the Internet, and there's  plenty of that, they would be spending all their time fighting this stuff one way  or the other and they would get a bad reputation from their users.  So they had to do this.  But I do agree.  Good for them.  But the fact that Canon has got to stick up its butt over this thing.  Well, the funny thing is.  The humiliation, I think, to the company itself, that they should be they should  be ashamed of themselves, ashamed of themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The humor of it is I never heard of Chuck Westfall.  I never heard of the blog, but I'm reading it now.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I literally saw this in public relations done by a Japanese company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You just think like, who is this guy?  Yeah. And you know what?  There is there.  There are certain companies that have this goal.  And that goal is to control every single bit of information that that bleeds out  about them.  And it is absolutely ludicrous that they wouldn't have someone inside the company  who would say, look, this is a not illegally viable argument and B, it's going  to backfire in a phenomenal way.  Because have you ever visited the Internet?  Who?  I mean, really, they need to get some serious like Internet advisors in the company.  Like, have you met the Internet?  You don't want to do this.  It's going to be better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't get it.  You met the Internet.  How long is the year?  That's a good book title.  Meet the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll trade you that for a fail up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you could have written have you met the Internet, but I think you would have  written it in like 1995 because it's a little late for that.  Oh, yeah, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But no, no, the subtitle could be an introduction for clueless companies.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.  Let me write that down.  Hold on a second.  No, no, no, no, that's totally mine.  No, that is beautiful.  That is a blog post waiting to happen.  It's all yours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But there are so many companies still to this day who have a tin ear about this whole thing,  who fight this stuff and end up making it far worse.  Monster is an excellent example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they sue.  Who do they sue?  Everyone.  The latest was the mini golf company.  Because they have the word monster in the name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a monster cable or monster dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Monster cable is the one who sues everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They sued Monster Blue Jeans because of over rivets in the blue.  I mean, they are just out of hand and they're really torpedoing their reputation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Certainly in the geek community, they've lost it entirely.  And I guess if you're monster cable, that's kind of important.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who else is going to buy that overpriced crap?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe that's it because they know the geek community thinks that.  So it's like, well, we already lost those guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's go for the dummies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We can't charge 90 bucks for an HDMI cable.  Those guys, they know too much.  It's pretty funny.  I think companies often say, well, if you don't defend a trademark, you'll lose it.  But not against a blue jean company or a mini golf company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's no confusion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no, absolutely not.  It's ridiculous.  And if in fact you had to defend it as violently as Monster has,  then you would see this kind of behavior all the time.  It's like Monster Cable is the only company who is acting this vehemently about defending their trademark.  So it's obviously not the requirement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know how far back you go as a writer, Molly, but there was something that happened.  I think it was starting to show up in like the mid 1980s where you'd get a press release during the days of the press release.  And you'd read this press release and every other every mention of the company's name had a trademark thing next to it.  So it's like that trademark, trademark, trademark, trademark, trademark.  And the whole thing was so filled with these little trademark things, which are unnecessary and stupid.  And it was like a trend.  It was a weird trend until somebody said, hey, you only have to do the trademark thing once, if at all.  And they finally realized you can put it down at the bottom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then remember that there would be these long paragraphs at the bottom of these things that say Microsoft Windows is a trademark of Microsoft Corporation.  Sony is a trademark of Sony Corp.  Do they still do that?  Did they stop doing that too?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You'll see it sometimes at the bottom of emails and then it will also include the confidential and private.  I like that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you're reading this email in error, please destroy it now and try to forget you ever saw it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, right, pal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  I think what these companies don't realize is not only do they have a tenure when it comes to understanding the Internet response, they don't know there's going to be an Internet response.  I think they really still live in such a bubble that they think they can send out an email or a legal notice to a blogger.  And that blogger is going to pee his pants and take the site down.  And those days are long gone.  Are they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, look, I would be scared.  I don't have the money that Monster has or Canon has to fight it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but you can get, I mean, you can get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is EFF going to come and defend you free?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You might get enough responses on Twitter alone to build a decent case.  At least a good letter.  Just avoid the process server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No one's going to come up there and serve you.  They won't be able to find you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are you kidding?  People wander in here all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but nobody knows.  They only have a few people.  I don't think any process server is ever going to do it.  And if somebody comes up to you, Leo says, are you Leo Laporte?  Just say no.  Oh, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that your technique?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I don't get served.  It's funny.  Does that work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, if the process server can't serve you, are you not served?  I mean, if you avoid them, you're not.  That seems like a 10 year old playing that game.  Oh, you didn't catch me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's some truth to it in certain situations.  They have to serve you.  Somebody has to serve you.  Somebody has to, and they can do it in different ways.  But you show up at the court and say, where's Leo Laporte?  You're suing him.  He says, well, we couldn't get a hold of him.  What do you think the judge is going to say to that?  He ran away, Your Honor.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  He ran away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Couldn't get him.  The bell rang.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the best part of Pineapple Express is right at the beginning where he's a process server.  And all the tricks he uses to serve people.  Do you see that, buddy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do wonder, because I only have ever seen serving stuff in the movies.  I wonder if any of that stuff is true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I served somebody once.  Were you a process server?  No, I was given the assignment to serve, and I did.  Really?  And it's done exactly the way it looks like in the movies.  What the movies are showing you is exactly what you do.  You find the person, and you go, like it would be you.  Leo, Leo Laporte?  Yeah.  Here.  And you get in a piece of paper, and then you walk away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Man, that's cold.  Wait a minute.  Who are you working for that they made you serve?  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've got stories to tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did it voluntarily on some situation where somebody needed to be served, and I knew I could do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Were you ever a bounty hunter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Come on.  Admit it.  You have leathers.  Dog.  Dvorak dog.  And another book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'd be scared of that.  We've had a couple of situations where we serve somebody on some other thing.  I mean, you don't have to be a process server to serve.  Really?  Anybody can?  Yeah, but you would have to testify if the person refused to show up.  Interesting.  That they were served.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  On December 15th at 1142 a.m.  We'll do it at the deposition.  I served John C. Dvorak with a subpoena to appear in court.  That doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's I wouldn't want it.  That's like being a meter made.  I really wouldn't want that job.  No, I don't know as a job, but I think it pays well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe not.  People can tell us.  Boba Fett.  And they will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Twitter raises another $35 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's almost like it fell in their lap.  They said we didn't really need the money, but well, somebody offered us $35 million.  We'll take it.  That is not happening to me these days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, nobody ever offers me $35 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I understand they're now valued at more than a quarter of a billion dollars.  Valued.  Well, it sure shot up in usage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is up.  I just saw a link actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's up over 900 percent in the last year.  Is that what this is?  Yeah, I believe it.  Yeah, 900 percent.  And sometimes people say, oh, it's spam.  And there is a lot of spam now, but it's not spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The real world has arrived.  That's what's really happening.  Well, yes.  Huge, huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The celebrity factor alone, I think, is shooting up the Twitter user base.  I mean, I can't believe everywhere I turn, there's some other famous person on Twitter.  I am now, Lance Armstrong has lapped me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm now like number 12 on Twitter.  You're doomed.  I'm doomed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're going to be bragging about being in the top 100 before this is over.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, I was once number one on Twitter.  I have fallen out of the top 100.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My heart is broken.  I'm in like in the top 300 now.  I got to seven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Follow me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you know, it's saying something that you can have 87,000 followers and still be  number 12 on the list.  I know.  I mean, Stephen Fry now has 183,000 followers.  Kevin's 126,000.  Britney Spears, 112,000.  Ah, she's the one I predicted would bring it up to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not even her and everybody knows it's not her, but they still follow her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Wosse is number eight.  That's Jonathan Ross.  He's a presenter of apparently very well known in Britain.  The Brits have invaded.  It's the British invasion.  Part the British.  It's the British celebrity invasion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think, you know, once you get past a certain number, you know, there's a certain

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  number, you have a pretty good group of followers that you can you can crowdsource.  I mean, you don't really need 100,000 followers.  I keep telling myself.  What are you going to do with them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Come on.  What are you going to crowdsource?  And I did that recently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We had Horowitz and I do this little podcast on the stock market and we needed a logo for

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the iTunes and I just crowdsourced it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I said, can anybody design this little, you know, album cover art?  And we'd use it.  And I said, yeah, I think it's a good idea.  I think it's a good idea.  I think it's a good idea.  I think it's a good idea.  And I said, can anybody design this little, you know, album cover art?  And we did.  And they came up with three decent ones.  And I said, well, then I said, let's vote on it.  And I threw my, you know, threw it out to the to the Twitter Twitter followers.  Just which one you want, number one, two or three.  And so I thought it would be it was somewhat amusing because there would be these tweets  coming in, you know, one, two, one, you know, so I mean, basically there's all these tweets  were just the number.  I mean, I think the people watching this were going, what?  What is this?  Sometimes that'll happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You'll be reading Twitter and it's just like incomprehensible nonsense comes across.  It's like, I know something's going on.  I don't know how to party to it.  Well, if you go late enough at night, it's always in Japanese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's fun, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The middle of the night, Twittering.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've never I think I've gone to that Twitter front page like two or three times.  I mean, the thing is, it just doesn't.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't understand that.  I don't understand the impulse to keep throwing money at Twitter without at least asking  them to say just one time.  Is there any plan at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is there a plan?  Any plan, anything at all?  Any thought of monetizing anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Even beyond that, like, you know what?  I'm past the we have a plan stage.  Now we need to know what the H is the plan.  What is the plan?  Seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's light at the end of the tunnel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just it's the weird.  No one ever.  I mean, imagine being a person, right?  Like I joke about no one ever does this to me.  But imagine if people just came up and kept giving me money like, honey, you got potential.  You you are going to be yours for something.  Here's 20 million dollars.  Like, what the hell is that?  You know, it's amazing.  Why are these people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And this is in a time when everybody's saying there's no money to be had, no venture funding.  Everybody's, you know, dying.  They keep getting more money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's ludicrous.  It really like no offense to Twitter, but what the hell?  They have magic Jedi mojo.  That's all I can think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right.  I mentioned this before.  We always seem to get caught up on Twitter.  Chit chat is amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there's because it's a story.  Thirty five million.  And then here Pete Hoekstra, Congressman Hoekstra from Michigan.  He's a ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee.  He's in Iraq on a top secret congressional envoy.  He's Twittering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just landed in Baghdad.  I believe it may be the first time I've had BB service in Iraq.  Is Blackberry, right?  Eleven hour trip here.  Moved into Green Zone by helicopter Iraqi flag now over Palace headed to new US Embassy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This guy's pretty lucky that they're shutting down Gitmo.  That's all I've got to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Pentagon was not happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I don't see what differences it makes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He was Twittering along the route, though.  And where he was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but how many Al Qaeda's are on Twitter?  Here's his.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everyone's on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sure there's at least one guy.  Yes, you are the Al Qaeda social media expert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Your job is to follow Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, his spokesman said,  Is that your Arab?  Yeah, I didn't want to go all the way on that one.  I thought I'd hold back a little bit.  I don't think you've got the Arab down.  No, I have it, but I don't want to do it.  I don't want to be seen as racist.  Well, how is it racist?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's no more racist than any of the other accents I do.  They're all racist.  They're all bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee,  this is Congressman Hoekstra's spokesperson.  The congressman is fully aware of security issues when traveling abroad.  He believes in giving the people of West Michigan as much access as possible,  and posting on Twitter allows him to provide real-time insight into the sights and sounds of his congressional activities.  Oh, brother.  He's still Twittering.  He Twitters all the time.  Several times a day.  And when the vote was going on on the stimulus bill,  Congressman Culberson was Twittering like 12 or 15 times an hour saying,  I don't have time. I don't have time to read the bill. I don't have time to read the bill.  Finally, I just sent him a Twitter saying, less Twittering, more reading.  Seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't have time. I don't have time to read the bill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's pretty interesting, though, because we do want, you know, we geeks talk nonstop about transparency.  We want that.  We do.  And yet this guy comes off like a total idiot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's some places you probably don't want to be Twittering from.  And even those of us in our own lives have that.  Hey, John, I'm getting some echo from you. Are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, let me turn you down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm getting, I hear myself back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, how is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Whenever John wants to start playing sound effects down the road, all of a sudden we hear echoes because I know he's about to do something.  You don't listen to us on headphones, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I should.  But I don't when I do this because I'm doing other things.  Your ears itch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's flattering.  I should wear headphones, but I find them annoying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I worked on, have you ever worked on any radio shows where the guy, like a talk show, and the guy doesn't use headphones and he doesn't expect you to use them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I find it very disconcerting because actually-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's very disconcerting. I like the headphones a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you know, if you're in the same room as the person, you don't really need them.  And then I guess they use a little speaker for the phone call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you do need them if you want to modulate your voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did Larry King- Yes, that's right. And I use headphones for that very reason.  Did Larry King wear headphones when you did the Larry King?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't recall him wearing headphones. I don't think he did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The old guys, the really old guys in radio would hang, they'd have this thing that would hang on their ear. It wasn't headphones.  It was like a speaker, a little speaker that would hang on their ear and they would listen and you could hear it was so loud.  You could hear a little, you know, like a little transistor radio is on there.  You could hear it. And I know they were deaf in that ear. It was like piercing.  Anyway, let's take a break because I think we want to talk in just a bit about this new Sony camera and the new Samsung camera.  We've done our Twittering stories. Let's see what else.  Would you pay for YouTube?  There's a move afoot to charge you to watch movies on YouTube and the hackable Blackberry.  But first I got to tell you about audible.com. Have we gotten you listening to audible yet, Molly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I'm a total audible user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think when you're a mom and you have your hands full and you're shopping for diapers at Costco, audible is a lifesaver.  What do you listen to? What kind of stuff you like? Fiction, nonfiction?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was just cracking up at the thought of myself in Costco with my iPhone.  I like to listen to espionage action thrillers.  Oh, cool.  That is like my favorite audio book genre. So I'm all about the Robert Ludlum books.  Ludlum is great.  One after the other after the other. Bring them on.  And they're big and thick, so they last a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

It's got to stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's fun. You know, it's actually it's kind of fun every once in a while to pick up a book and go, wow, I haven't seen one of these in a while.  Between the Kindle and audible. It's like, oh, look, the page is crisp, crumple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's kind of funny.  It smells so interesting.  What is that smell?  Pink?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, I'm listening to the Malcolm Gladwell audible version of it and he's great.  He really gives it life as he's reading and it's really fun to listen to it.  Have you ever seen him speak?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I would love to though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, John's off doing his dinner. I'm sorry. I won't talk to.  I'm not supposed to talk to John during the commercials.  He uses these as an opportunity to do something.  I don't know.

Transcript:  Yeah, I'm really happy about that.  That's great news.  Despite the the economic so-called downturn, which I know a lot of a lot of our friends are out of work.  It's really breaking my heart.  Stuff like this seems to be doing okay.  Buzz out loud seems to be doing okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, that shows doing no I'm just kidding.  That show.  It's doing all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's it's doing well.  So did Natalie Delconte kind of take your spot?

Transcript:  But I miss you.  Oh, you and Tom.  That's a common sentiment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you and Tom and Jason.  It was just such a great show.  You were really the heart and soul of the show from day one.  And and I do miss you.  It's still a great show.  And I reckon you know whenever anybody sends me hate mail, which I mean happens once in  a while, they go that tweet you guys you suck.  You talk about Twitter too much.  Whatever I say, you know, and I'm sincere.  There is another show you'll probably like better.  That's they cover the news.  They do a great job.  It's daily.  It's called Buzz Out Loud and you're going to love it.  I'm glad to hear that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, we I do another podcast over at CNET actually called Gadgets.  I love that.  Like a total gadget show from like the female perspective where we really that's our kind  of total goof off show.  So who's on that?  We're the people for the people who like the tweet thing.  We wonder that is Kelly Morrison and then Jason Howell from Buzz.  Fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Gadgets.  Is he a gadget or is he an honorary gadget?  He's he's our gender gap guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's like there to keep us.  We have a whole segment actually called Gender Gap that is just like gadgets that dudes think  are awesome.  That's so funny.  Yeah, it's a really fun show.  Actually, it's not just for women either.  No, best place to go CNET.com slash Molly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You'll find all of Molly's stuff there.  Have you talked about these new camera phones yet?  I have no because they have come out since we recorded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This just was announced.  And they're hot.  Very interesting.  So it starts with what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And he's back.  Welcome back, John C. Dvorak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It starts with the Samsung.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's see.  No, I guess the first one.  It was the Samsung Samsung Samsung memoir.  12 megapixel.  Oh, yeah.  No, no, the memoir is eight megapixels.  You go start with a little one.  So this is pathetic, pathetic.  The Samsung memoir, which but that's going to be out in 10 days.  That's going to be out on the 10th of July.  That's going to be out on T-Mobile.  It looks a lot like it has a full screen touch screen, very much iPhone.  But but eight megapixels, which is kind of mind blowing.  And then Sony Ericsson announces their Edo 12 megapixels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  12 megapixels of blur.  Well, that's the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I mean, it's more you know, it's more than megapixels, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sony does.  Let's take a look at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's look at this objectively.  How big can the sensor possibly be in these things, considering if you look at the size  of the lens.  So it's got to be something that's got like no contrast, no signal to noise ratio that's  worth a powder.  It's like a crap.  It's crap.  It's a crap pixel.  A crap pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A crap crap pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The memoir is interesting because it's autofocus.  It's got a real flash, not one of those phony flashes.  It's got a xenon flash.  Yeah, it's got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Plus that one's got anti-shake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, that's digital anti-shake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Probably not optical.  You're right.  In fact, the zoom is digital is not optical.  But I think autofocus is great because autofocus allows you to do things like take pictures  of barcode.  That's what I like about the G1.  Take pictures of barcodes and then you could send it back to the server and it'll say,  hey, you can get this cheaper down the street.  I love that.  That is like the coolest app on the G1.  That and Latitude.  Latitude is pretty cool too.  Have you played with that?  That's the new Google one that follows you around everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't want that.  I sort of refuse to install that.  No, it freaks me out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I guess the difference between this is something like BrightKite.  BrightKite, you explicitly push a button and says, I'm here now.  This, yeah, there's a map.  And as you move around, you move around on the map always.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't need Google to know that.  No.  It is a little creepy.  Am I an exhibitionist?  Because I kind of like this.  Is there a Latitude Facebook app yet?  Because that is an excellent crossover.  You could just have a little app on your profile and everyone can see where you are at any given moment.  You're a little dot.  Crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Moving around.  Oh, look.  And somebody said, the first thing that's going to happen, some guy is going to install this on his phone and he's going to tell his wife he went to the ballgame.  Instead, he's down at the massage parlor and it's going to be all over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  That thing is terrifying.  I refuse to install it or try it.  What is wrong with me that I think that's Adam Curry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what we'd like to know.  We've been wondering about you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've installed it and I sent out an invitation.  I think I sent you guys invitations.  Say, follow me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think you've got some sort of a death wish.  Follow me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Literally.  Follow me.  Literally.  You can know where I am at every moment.  The only problem with it is that the Google phone has like a five minute battery life.  So you can only follow me for a little while.  But apparently they're doing an iPhone application that's going to even be better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think these, I think actually speaking of phones, I think these are the kinds of features that they're the only hope for phone makers, right?  Who are really trying to compete with kind of that overall iPhone usefulness.  It's like you can appeal to people now in a niche category.  Like, well, okay, you have a phone that does it all, but you also really like photography.  No, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's if I think I said that on the radio show, they tried to compete against the iPhone.  It's getting harder and harder.  The app store is so good.  You know, the usability, the interface, it's just they can't compete.  But at least they could say, hey, we've got a 12 megapixel camera.  Right.  Yeah, I agree with you.  Exactly.  I think you hit the nail on the head.  That's it's almost them saying we give up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We can't maybe we can't.  Or we're making an end run at, you know, at best or at minimum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pricing on the Samsung memoir on T-Mobile, $250 with a two year contract.  It kind of looks nice, but I'm a Sony Ericsson fan because I like the Symbian OS.  I guess 60.  I don't know about 12 megapixels, though.  You're right, John.  On a tiny chip, more megapixels actually is worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think the eight megapixel and all this sort of advanced camera features, that sounds a little bit better to me.  The memoir sounds a little better.  Although, and to be honest, I would rather have all the awesome utility.  Like, I'm really excited about the Palm Pre.  Are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am too, but I don't I'm holding off until I see it.  You know what the pre means, don't you, Molly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what the pre stands for?  What?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Pre-Bankruptcy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What can I do?  Will their next one be post?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  New from Palm, post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Post, yeah.  So I took the plunge and I got myself.  I ordered two of those converter boxes from the government.  Did you get the $40 coupon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  People need those.  Who needs those?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't believe you took that out of the hands of the poor and infirm.  That is shameful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Anyway, the one, by the way, I recommend to people out there is the Channel Master CM7000.  The Channel Master 7000, as recommended by John C. Dvorak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good luck getting one because he took the last two.  Apparently there's a shortage.  There is a shortage.  Did you also get a coupon, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I got two coupons.  Of course you did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh man, you're even spending the money of these poor.  Oh man.  Just with the government, they're giving money away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What am I supposed to do?  No, I'm too rich for your money.  Give it to the bankers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, if you go down, there's free cheese in Portland.  Don't knock it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's not bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Government cheese.  Too far to drive.  All right.  Cheese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This comes in the mail.  So I take it you actually had a need for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I got a couple of monitors that could use a tuner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm horrified.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you go to Pinnacle or HAPOG and buy a tuner and all that stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did it online at Solid Signal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because you can't get the Channel Master from anybody in a brick and mortar.  Now why do you recommend the Channel Master?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I looked at all the different reviews and all the different ones,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and this one seems to keep cropping up.  It's got an S-Video.  Most of them don't have that.  It's got other features that are kind of cool.  And by the way, someone mentioned to me that the stimulus bill includes  $640 million for these decoders.  That's right.  They're trying to refund it.  That sounds like a lot, but you know, it's a big country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a lot of people.  It's 5%, isn't it?  It's something they think it's 5% of households will need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think most people don't know that they need this.  That's what's going to happen.  They put it off, but come June 17th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're still not going to know.  They're still going to be flooded with calls saying, what happened?  I thought I did have a digital TV.  It has a digital front piece of, it's got a 12 colon zero zero on there,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  and that's digital.  It's blinking 12 after the call.  When that apocalyptic day comes, maybe John can donate his boxes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, really?  John's got two.  I'm hooking them up.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I got to use them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have an old TV in the kitchen that would use one of these.  You get cable, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Where you live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, you're not like, you know.  I use the dish network.  Okay.  You get dish.  So you don't need.  Well, I actually have cable too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have the cable hooked to a sling box.  So you got cable and you got satellite and you got a digital TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have a digital TV.  I have a digital TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you got cable and you got satellite and now you can receive through rabbit ears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, I've been receiving most of my HDTV programming already,  not through rabbit ears, but with a UHF antenna.  That's true.  That's the best deal.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the best deal in high def.  It really looks good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what I have heard that.  All right.  My child just woke up from his nap, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Perfect, because I just ran out of stories.  Molly Wood is online.  Ladies and gentlemen at cnet.com slash molly.  You're the best, Molly.  We miss you on Buzz Out Loud, but I'm glad you could be here on the Twitter.  I really appreciate it.  Thank you.

Transcript:  Thank you for being with us.  And with real Dvorak on Twitter, I can use a few more people.  Yeah.
