Legally right now in San Francisco, you're allowed, I think, a religious ceremony of  13 people total. So yeah, so it would be very small, but that's okay. We'd rather get this done.

It's always  a possibility. I know what that means because the song, the band wrote, but I had to Google what

Start time: 404.14
End time: 633.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that means, but I know that joke. So you all are Twitter lovers. Alex actually has a very dangerous  handle. It's only four letters long. Yes, sir. I am very grateful that I didn't go for at Leo  back in 2006. When I signed up for Twitter, I decided to be better to have my full name.  You are at risk. And in fact, it looks like this Twitter hack that happened on Wednesday  is involved with or was started by a group of hackers who are seeking the OG Twitter handles.  The at six, which was Adrian Lamos, old handler at why those are the ones that are at God at fear.  Those are the ones that are drawing big bucks. And some of these hackers are very good at using  sim swapping or other techniques to get these handles. And it's those guys who have been  reporting. They actually talked to the New York Times. Lucky 225 has a medium post about the  Twitter hack. Lucky 225 actually owned Adrian Lamos at six account after Adrian  passed away. And he was he noticed it had been hacked because the bad guys, which in this case,  they would change everything, including verification, phone numbers, email addresses.  So you might never know except that your password stopped working. But they forgot to change the  Google voice number. He sent out a tweet. This was early Wednesday, saying there's something going on.  And it's much more than just guessing a password or a sim hijacking. They somehow have really gotten  into Twitter. And I kind of suspected that immediately too, because when you see  Barack Obama's account hacked, Joe Biden's account hacked, you know that at least those two are  certainly using strong two factor authentication. Obama is the number one most followed person on  Twitter. So Twitter likely has additional security on his account, as they do on President Trump's.  Note that President Trump did not get hacked. But Twitter immediately kind of went crazy. So the  hacks that we all saw that I'll just recap for those of you who stayed away from the news this  week for for good reason. The hack essentially took was an account takeover. And it would be  displayed by a tweet that says, Hey, something along the lines of, Hey, I want to give back  to my community. So for the next 24 hours, I'm going to double any Bitcoin sent to this address.  And sure, I believe it, they must have meant that. And so the idea was people would send Bitcoin and  guess what, it would not get doubled in shockingly. Shockingly. As soon as we saw this, and we were on  we were doing this week in Google, when it happened, it was immediately obvious somebody had gotten deep  into the Twitter credentials, either was it a rogue Twitter employee, which has happened before  contractor leaving Twitter in 2017, disabled the president's account. So we know that's possible.  It seems to be that, according to the New York Times, this is actually really shocking. Twitter  had and Seth, I'll defer to you on this, because you're the security guru, and I'm sure you've been  doing nothing over the last three days, but writing about this. Twitter had apparently put the  credentials for its god mode dashboard in their Slack channel and pinned it.

Transcript:  At the parallax, we actually ran a story, I think it was two years ago on how you need to not use  Slack for important trusted communication. I don't know what to tell you know, it's like,

Start time: 653.16
End time: 670.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So we haven't confirmed that Twitter hasn't confirmed it, but the New York Times reported  and I think it's fairly credible. They were talking to people who were on the periphery of  this hack, these guys who steal, who sim swap and steal single character Twitter handles,  and short ones like at Alex, has anybody tried ever tried to hack you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, not that I've noticed, but I do run, I mean, I'm not going to exactly detail what security  I use, but my Twitter account was the first thing that I put on my password manager, and I have  other security stuff attached to it, just out of general, you know, general, reasonable this, but I  was most surprised that they got to Joe Biden's account and all of this because when it was so  secure, right, you would think so, right? Well, I now after I heard about the Slack thing, I was  less sure, but when they got Elon, but that's Twitter's fault. That's not Joe Biden's fault.

Transcript:  Entirely. No, I'm not a Twitter has a god mode that is accessible apparently without, you know,  severe you should, for instance, it should be IP checked, it geo located check, it should only be  accessed accessible to the most trusted Twitter employees, and it should not have its credentials

Start time: 717.06
End time: 797.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  posted in a Slack channel. No, there's one other really serious issue that came out of this,  that I find to be very mind boggling, which is that it does appear that some direct messages  from accounts that were hacked, although not the verified accounts, but the non verified accounts  were downloaded or otherwise accessed. And the problem there is, is that people like using a  service. So you're in Twitter, you want to continue using Twitter. You don't have to hop out and use  an end to end encrypted service, even though you may have signal on your phone or wire or whatever.  And people still, including in the, in the info sec world, still communicate very  very confidential information over Twitter. DM. Do not.  It really just sort of, you know, beggars the mind, like why on earth would you do this when  you know it's not secure? When you know Twitter employees have access, you know, I was talking  with somebody about it and I said, this is like, if Twitter is the public square, then you're going  off into a corner of the public square and having a conversation. You think it's private, but everyone  else is still around you. It's just the, you know, it looks like you're being a little bit  more secretive. I mean, it's really mind boggling. How much Seth, you've covered break-ins and things

Start time: 797.44
End time: 847.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  like this for years. How much should we trust, for instance, these hackers, these sim swapper hackers  telling the new plug walk Joe, for instance, how much, how accurate is this? Or I worry that this  is disinformation, that it isn't some guy named Kirk or that it maybe was some guy named Kirk,  which is what they said, but he had other motives besides merely this stupid spammy thing, which at  best netted him a hundred thousand, although we don't even know because it's very typical when  there's a Bitcoin address given for a hack like this, that the guys who control it will put money  in and take money out to make it, to obfuscate how much is going on there. How credible is this? Or  could it all be a smoke screen for something much more devious? I mean, it could be in the,

Start time: 848.58
End time: 933.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  in the grand scheme of things. We just don't know. We don't know. We do know, you know, Joe Cox over  at vice motherboard was the first person to report on sim swapping in connection to the Twitter hack.  So the fact that the New York Times seems to have also confirmed it indicates that sim swap,  at least the sim swapping community in some, to some degree was involved in this.  What were the original, other motives as they were reported by the New York Times or as they  were reported by, by Joe Cox? Probably, possibly. You know, I, this always puts me, stuff like this  always puts me in mind of the Sony hack from the end of 2015 and nobody would believe that it was  North Korea that did it. And, you know, everybody was very, very skeptical. North Korea's hacking  division was not really on a lot of people's radar and lo and behold, it turned out to be North Korea.  So are the, are the hackers that are talking to the media actually the people who are behind this  and their motives are what they describe them to be? It's possible. I think that a more paranoid  stance is probably the better one to take. Don't trust Twitter DMs. You know, really make sure that  if you're doing, if you're doing sensitive communication, do it in a place that's sensitive.

Transcript:  And, you know, I turned, I made my Twitter account private, but that's kind of, that's useless  because if somebody has access to the Godmode dashboard, they could change anything. They  could make it public again. They can do anything they want. They could, I use a YubiKey. I turned  off SMS for a normal hacker. That would be good security. But if you've got the dashboard,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. You know, if you're, if you're using, again,  if you're using services that are not end-to-end encrypted, which basically means that the only  people that can see messages are at either end of the message, the person sending it and the person  receiving it, then, you know, anyone who works for the service potentially has access to what's  being communicated, whether it's photos or whatever. I mean, Facebook probably has very similar  access that, you know, that Twitter does. LinkedIn probably has very similar access. I mean,  the thought of like LinkedIn getting hacked and whatever's being said in those messages between  people, I think is truly terrifying because that's ostensibly where so much business is being

Start time: 1000.64
End time: 1077.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  conducted. Yeah. I mean, so there were a number of real concerns that come up. One is they could  tweet as President Trump, you know, go to your basements because I'm about to launch a nuclear  attack on Russia. They could, I mean, who knows how much chaos that would cause. But the point is  the president uses Twitter for policy statements. Yes. And it's risky now that somebody could have  impersonated him. I think it's also telling that somebody did not impersonate him. That's a little  suspicious to me. Now the Kirk, this Kirk guy was a sim swapper. Apparently he sold at Y for 1500 in  Bitcoin. That Bitcoin went to the same address that was later used in this scam to double your  Bitcoin. So that ties him directly to this. We don't know who Kirk is. In fact, he has no history.  He only made his Discord account where all the conversations going on a month ago. So  who is Kirk? I don't know. Could be Vladimir. I don't know. It does seem like it was just a simple  dumb Bitcoin scam that had best netted him $100,000 at best. What a waste.

Start time: 1080.88
End time: 1083.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  $100,000 is nothing. You did all this work to get in there and you got $100,000.

Start time: 1083.88
End time: 1094.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, for instance, you could make more than that if you took some time and stayed in the god mode  and sold some accounts bit by bit. I would imagine there are people who would want Joe Biden's account

Start time: 1095.42
End time: 1105.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  for a lot of money. Right? It could easily have been a trial run for whether or not this way of

Start time: 1105.78
End time: 1137.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  getting at those accounts is effective. But then you busted it because by doing it,  you've gone very public. Even I, with no inside information, immediately knew this was an inside  job. And almost either was a rogue employee or someone had got into the administrator accounts.  That was obvious. So you've blown your cover now by doing this. There's all sorts of things they  could have done. For instance, they could have just downloaded DMs in the background without  anybody knowing for years. Sure. Maybe they have been.

Start time: 1140.50
End time: 1189.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We don't know how long they've had access for one thing. I hesitate to speculate during cases like  this, which are rapidly unfolding and we don't yet. It hasn't even been five days since this  happened. And Twitter's not been super forthcoming. No, nor should they, I don't think at this point.  I think they've said what they need to say and it's pretty clear that there is a lot of alignment  between what's been reported and what Twitter has been saying. But I think that this is the kind of  thing where there are so many moving parts and we don't know. The people who are behind this are  certainly not on any law enforcement radar until now. To me, the takeaways from this are

Start time: 1189.74
End time: 1310.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  twofold. First of all, we're wondering, is this China, Russia, or Iran, or one of the usual  suspects in terms of state-sponsored hacking? And then they invented a Kirk to be the face of it,  the young, naive face of this. I think probably this hack itself is what it appears to be.  Some dumb kids managed to stumble into Twitter and tried to make some money from it,  and they could have made a lot more and they didn't do it that well.  The first thing that this tells me is that the likelihood is that China, Russia, Iran,  certainly the NSA and others have been probably exploiting the same hack and rummaging around in  these accounts invisibly behind the scenes for probably years. The other thing is that we talk  about these risks. I know we're going to talk about TikTok later, but this is a public network.  When something like this happens and it goes public, the effect of it is visible to all of us,  most of the effects, or the fact that it exists is visible to all of us. But when this sort of  thing happens within WhatsApp, for example, we were talking about what if somebody took over  Trump's account and said there's a nuclear war or whatever, that kind of thing actually happens in  places like India through WhatsApp. People say they start riots and stuff like that through these  false rumors within WhatsApp. It's far more de-farious in those private networks where you  can't see what other people are seeing. It's certainly even worse in TikTok where you can  algorithmically show a million people a million different messages. I think all of these suspicions  we should have, but we should be aware that these kinds of things, the same kinds of things,  can be happening in the secret behind the scenes networks like Facebook, etc., which is far more  nefarious. We know it does. It happens all the time. Absolutely. Setting aside an issue like

Start time: 1310.98
End time: 1373.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  shouldn't Twitter have encrypted its DMs end to end, which we know has been debated internally  there for years and Twitter has always refused to do it. I think there's a real issue here that  gets back to the Sony question, which is what role does the U.S. government need to play  in advising tech companies as to how to protect their internal tools, how to protect their data,  and not just tech companies because it's media companies, it's financial institutions.  We do know that there is communication. There's no way that they're not talking, but  it feels sort of like tech organizations are working, going in one direction. The U.S. government  is going in another direction and there's not collaboration where there should be. You don't  want a nation state attacking a tech company without the tech company being aware that they

Start time: 1373.60
End time: 1419.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  can be targeted. The problem is the U.S. government is simultaneously going in two different directions  and multiple all the time. The NSA, for instance, has a complete duality. On the one hand,  their job, their responsibility is to protect American companies and Americans, I guess,  peripherally from hacks by other countries. On the other hand, their mission is to do those,  perpetrate those hacks on other countries. And as we found out, in the process of which  creating hacking tools that they let escape and turned into ransomware technologies like  Eternal Blue that were used against Americans. So even within the NSA, there are these conflicting

Start time: 1419.84
End time: 1431.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  goals, dualities. There's been talk for a long time of having a cyber czar,  and some one person who's in charge of- Wasn't Rudy Giuliani the cyber czar?

Start time: 1438.98
End time: 1443.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the problem. Trump initially proposed that Baron Trump do it.

Start time: 1443.50
End time: 1511.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, he knows the idea. He's all over the cyber. So really, the questions for me have to do with  Twitter at this point. Because I think, I mean, again, we don't know exactly, but it sure looks  like Twitter didn't do a very good job. Forget end-to-end encrypting DMs. They let some  bozo get access to their god mode. That is a horrific breach of responsibility. And honestly,  I think it should diminish Twitter as a public utility. They have been a public utility,  chiefly because of the president, but they have become this important public utility.  But I think this should diminish their role there because pretty clearly, they can't be trusted with  it. I would like Twitter to make a much more clear. They did put a blog post up yesterday.  As we head into the weekend, next week, we're focused on these core objectives,  restoring access for all account owners. Oh yeah, the first thing they did is they turned off  verified accounts, which actually in turn, it makes no sense, except that it won't be people  from verified accounts who are sending out these Bitcoin. That was one of the funniest

Start time: 1513.22

Start time: 1516.80
End time: 1534.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And by the way, I saw article after article of saying, this is how it's, there was a wired,  Twitter is at its best when the verified accounts can't tweet. Man, this is great. It's like it used  to be where there are none of these celebrities. Some, some, some verified accounts. There is,

Start time: 1536.48

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know what to think about that. I'm verified. I don't know what that means.

Start time: 1541.56
End time: 1560.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's apparently a Twitter account that has tweeted every word. And so some verified accounts  were actually retweeting word by word, because you could still retweet word by word, making  messages by retweeting one word at a time. I did not sink to that level. I was way worse than that.

Start time: 1561.36
End time: 1577.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's actually rather innovative. I was just texting with my friends and I had to tweet out  my texts for me and then I would retweet them when they would tweet my texts. You guys are  addicts. We were, I mean, we were having fun. Remember when Twitter was fun Leo back in the day?  That's what it felt like. It felt like a community. Twitter's first goal is to,

Start time: 1577.40
End time: 1637.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  before the president got involved. Twitter's first goal, and this was yesterday,  we want to restore access for all the account owners who may still be locked out as a result  of our remediation efforts to our second goal, continuing our investigation in the incident  and cooperation with law enforcement. Finally, at three, they get to the most important point.  Further, as a dubious word, securing our systems to protect future attacks  and then rolling out additional company-wide training to guard against social engineering  tactics. This was back when they said it was social engineering. Like somebody took our engineer out  and got him drunk and got the password. But I think, I believe the Slack story, so we don't  know yet, but that sounds like exactly what some nitwit would do. So, but what should be the  consequence to Twitter? What is the upshot of this? It's like saying what should the consequences be

Start time: 1638.08
End time: 1650.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to Facebook for allowing the kinds of political discourse that have happened there? I mean,  they're not going to face any punishment. Nothing's going to happen. But we can demand,

Start time: 1651.46

We were having dinner and they're not Twitter users really at  all. And they were like, did you hear about Twitter? I'm like, oh, yes, I did. Because I was there. I  logged off to come see you.

We know we must work  to regain your trust. And we will support all efforts to bring the perpetrators to justice.  We hope that our openness and transparency throughout this process and the steps and  works we will take to safeguard against other attacks in the future will be the start of making

So if we see, I mean, if Twitter is really sincere  about this, then we will see the security team at Twitter being taken a lot more seriously.  We will see security improvements being made to Twitter. And not unlike Zoom, where they went out  and hired a bunch of security experts and brought them in and said, what do we need to do? And they  laid out a series of steps. And for the most part, it seems like Zoom achieved that goal.  Or Google in 2010, when they revealed they'd been hacked by China. And then Google suddenly  started taking security significantly more seriously. We should see in the next three to  six months major steps taken by Twitter. And part of the problem is that I think that this is internally  a culture issue. This is an issue where Twitter's security team needs to be taken a lot more  seriously. The products need to be updated with security in mind, as well as user experience and  other very important things. But to not do so, I think is almost a criminal act within six months

Transcript:  of this presidential election. I don't think it's that big of a deal, really, because, I mean,  Twitter is facing embarrassment. Probably there's an economic downfall. Really, ultimately, Twitter  is mostly a public thing. It's not like it's a financial service. And in the larger scheme  of things, I mean, this is a case in which Twitter's probable negligence or alleged negligence  led to some users being screwed in one way or another. And it was accidental. Whereas with  Facebook, we learned that Facebook screws its users on purpose 10 times a year. And so in the  larger scheme of things, this is a relatively innocent thing. And I'm sure they'll fix it. But  I just don't think this is that big of a deal. It only feels like a big deal because big deal users

And the fact that the  president of the United States uses Twitter as his, I mean, literally primary way he could have  press conferences, he could put out memos, he could write articles, there's a million ways a  president can communicate. He has the bully pulpit. He chooses Twitter as the primary way he  communicates with the outside world, gives Twitter an unusual role, not a role it deserves. But it's  a real and as a result, I think there's a higher standard that has to be applied to Twitter.

Transcript:  Yeah, that's a good point. It's not a Twitter problem. It's a president problem. But it's just  the fact of the matter. That's, you know, as Roosevelt used radio and fireside chats,  the president uses Twitter. And so I mean, they're talking about, you know, the Republicans talk  about anti conservative bias on social media. This should concern them a little bit more.  You could put words into the mouth of leaders, not just the president, but all kinds of leaders  all over the world. If you had access to this tool, do you think we would just ignore it? If  the president said, you know, I really decided I don't like China, so we're gonna nuke him.  Or we're gonna yes, or Elon Musk said, you know, let's say you should. So one of the things they  could have done is short Tesla, and then have Elon tweet, you know, you're right, this whole  thing isn't working. We've lost a million billions of dollars, I'm going to shut it down, or, or vice  versa, buy Tesla and have Elon said, I have got the funds to buy Tesla, take it private. And I'm  going to do so at $420 a share. Oh, wait a minute. He already did that. Yeah, he already did that.

But I wouldn't believe it from his Twitter account, because I think he  would just be confused by his own process. I don't think the president would be that on the ball.

Our show today brought to you by, we're so glad to have him back,  Salesforce. We use Salesforce as our CRM, as our customer relationship management. It's our  sales team is using it all the time. I want to talk a little bit about something that we perhaps  will use in the future. Salesforce Service Cloud. This is a way that you can serve your customers,  super serve your customers. Service Cloud wants you to be prepared during these unknown times.  They know you're trying to do more with less. You're hustling to adapt to new customer needs,  new ways of business. You're innovating to respond to the current environment. That's what's so  amazing how flexible American business has been. Number one, though, you want satisfied customers.  That means you need a platform that performs quickly and efficiently to meet their needs.  That's Salesforce Service Cloud, the world's number one customer service platform,  empowering organizations of all sizes, deliver service anywhere, anytime. It runs out of the box  without any customization, but the sky's the limit. You can customize it to your heart's content,  so you can make it the best solution for your customers. Many people just install it, run it  as is, and as they use it, fine tune it to get it closer and closer to what they need to maintain  their customer's relationship. Service Cloud, out of the box, allows you to rapidly respond  to customer needs wherever those customers are. Facebook, WhatsApp, chat, text messaging.  You could do it from the house, which is good because that's where most of us are these days.  You could do it in the field. You could do it in the office. You could provide instant support  with self-service portals for your customers. Customers love this. If they can go to a website  and get articles, account info, talk to other community members, and all of this is built into  Salesforce Service Cloud. It uses AI. In fact, there's AI-powered chat bots you can embed on  your website to help resolve customers' issues quickly. They're so good you won't know. The  customers don't know that it's a chat bot. They're so good they get the job done and release you and  your employees to do the more personal stuff that you need to do too. Give your service team the  tools to provide an unforgettable customer experience. You'll be resolving cases faster  using their suite of intelligent productivity tools. You'll give your agents a complete shared  view of every customer and interaction. They love it. It just comes right up on the screen.  You could personalize every customer conversation.

Welcome to  the Twit family. We're very excited. TikTok hysteria. That's what Mike Masnick calls it at  Tech Dirt. I'm inclined to kind of go along with him. The drumbeat has started. It started with  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo saying, we're looking at banning TikTok in the United States.  It has been banned in other places. It's been banned in India, along with a lot of other Chinese  applications. Of course, China does the same thing. Twitter and Facebook and other  social media are banned in China. But we have a kind of a different style here in the United  States of America. Amazon, remember, sent out that letter saying, oh, last week, stop using TikTok on  your company phone. And then they retracted it because it turns out they have a lot of relationships  with TikTok. For all we know, they use their Amazon Web Services. Where do you stand on the TikTok  war? I'll give you one opposite opposing point of view from Mike Masnick's. Somebody I respect  equally, I think is an equally astute observer, Ben Thompson, a strataquiri, wrote a long article.  He's never written a short article that I know of. He wrote a long article. He says,  this is a prescription. I don't come too lightly. Perhaps the most powerful argument against taking  any sort of action is that we aren't China and isn't blocking TikTok, something China  would do. But if China is on the offensive against Western liberalism with a lowercase l,  not only within its borders, but within ours, it's in liberalism's interest to cut off a vector  that has taken root precisely because it's so brilliantly engineered to give humans  exactly what they want. He says, I would prefer Congress take the lead. But I think Apple and  Google should ban TikTok, remove it from the app store and make it unusable if it's already  installed on a device. So that's the extreme opposite. Mike Masnick says TikTok's never  demonstrably done anything wrong. This is xenophobia at its worst. All right, Alex,  where do you stand? I'll start with Alex. We'll move around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So a couple of things. One, the canard that TikTok collects too much information about users is silly.  Trump has been talking about this some, and we all know that many social applications are essentially  just vacuums for your information. So that doesn't really bother me one way or the other.  One thing that does, though, is the opacity of the TikTok algorithm. Now we all know that TikTok has  become very popular because it's an amazingly addictive thing to use because it just feeds you  more and more stuff and then you watch it. Without really knowing how that recommendation  engine works, we don't really know if they're pushing any particular narrative. We do know  that there has been some rules in place on TikTok back in the day that were then exposed and then  taken down that didn't show off people that were heavier in size and weren't a certain color and so  forth. And so there's always been some issues with how TikTok operates. So if TikTok doesn't  want to get banned, talking very publicly about how its algorithm works, I think would be an  intelligent thing to do. I'm hesitant to say ban it today, but I'm certainly sympathetic to  the arguments that are in favor of it. I'm a little bit less than Ben, but more than Mike,

Start time: 2581.90
End time: 2605.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think is where I land. Yeah. And I think for a company like Wells Fargo, which it has to say,  you can't use TikTok on your company phone, is completely reasonable for a lot of reasons.  For one thing, you don't want the teller behind the counter to be sending TikToks. But I think  that that's reasonable. But whether I don't think there would be any precedent for the  United States government to say we are going to prevent a Chinese app from being used. Right,

Start time: 2605.34
End time: 2680.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Mike? I don't think we've ever done that. I don't know if there's a precedent or not. I  know that they have been apps banned because they've demonstrated some nefarious activity on the app.  Yeah. Right. But I think that so I will take the devil's advocate position sort of in the  more extreme version of ban. And I think first let's characterize what Ben pointed out, which  I think he's right on everything. He points out China's national intelligence law, which means  that by law, Chinese law, any Chinese company has to hand over any data they ask for, no questions  asked. But I'm not concerned like Alex, I'm not concerned about the data they're collecting. Yeah,  they could figure out where secret bases are. They could harvest it for intelligence. I don't  think that's really the real concern. The real concern is what Ben Thompson highlighted, which  is that TikTok is an amazing tool of propaganda. Here's an example that Ben trotted out, which is  that so we all know that President Trump had a rally that didn't have the turnout he wanted.  And we found out later that, you know, they initially had a million signups for the rally,  and then like 6,000 people showed up, something like that. And it turned out that a bunch of  TikTok users were doing this grassroots effort to fake signups. TikTok and K-pop stans.

End time: 2695.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  To what extent, yes, but to what extent did TikTok, the company, facilitate the algorithmic  growth of that movement? Yeah, because the woman who posted that first on TikTok, that post

Start time: 2695.26
End time: 2700.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  immediately algorithmically got pushed to the top so that everybody saw it. So that's a little

Start time: 2700.44
End time: 2793.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  suspicious. Yeah. It's not about Trump. It's about a Chinese company influencing American politics,  which China has demonstrated, as Ben points out, a strong willingness to do. China  tries to censor globally. They try to control dissidents globally. They're increasingly meddling  in other countries' activities. And TikTok is the fastest growing social network. If it is a social  network, Ben Thompson says it isn't, ever. And so here's another one. He's found evidence that  they are sensing Hong Kong protests. Okay, that's sort of in Chinese bailiwick. They've been censoring  the Houston Rockets. Okay, they're using TikTok to meddle in the world's perception about China,  and this is an increasing trend. So his remedy is that TikTok be spun out into a non-Chinese  company that is not beholden to the Chinese or beholden to Chinese law and stuff like that.  I would argue in favor of that as well. But here's the problem, Aliyah. So some network is  going to be the global network that everybody in the world uses. And by banning all foreign social  networks, China has made it a matter of law that the only possible global network must be a Chinese  social network. It has to be Chinese, right? So Facebook can never be global because it's banned  in China, but TikTok can be global because it's not banned in the United States. And for that reason,  I think we should ban it. If China wants TikTok unbanned in the United States, then they can

Start time: 2793.86
End time: 2826.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  unban Facebook in China. I should mention the reason TikTok blocks the Houston Rockets is  because their general manager had the temerity to tweet in support of Hong Kong protesters,  at which point China said, we're going to boycott the NBA, which makes a lot of money in China.  Lots of money.  Very big in China. At one point, the NBA said we could lose $400 million due to a Chinese boycott  over this single tweet from the GM. But that's really a China problem more than a TikTok problem.

Start time: 2829.42
End time: 2898.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The devil's in the details. So for example, the Chinese government is currently in a  tussle with the government of Australia because government Australia wants to launch an inquiry  into the origins of the coronavirus. Did they cover up the spread of it, early days, et cetera,  et cetera? And Australia absolutely has a right to do this. Australians died and are still dying  from the coronavirus, and they have a right to figure out what happened. And China is basically  saying we're going to boycott Australia. We're going to have sanctions on you if you don't stop  investigating. TikTok could be a perfect way to sway Australian public opinion against the  Australian government and in favor of the Chinese government in this sort of political war.  This is the advantage that non-democratic countries like China have over democratic countries like  Australia. If you sway public opinion in China, it doesn't do you any good because it's a  non-democratic country. But in Australia, you can sway public opinion in a way that favors  Beijing's policies. And so that should be a concern to everyone.

Start time: 2902.68
End time: 2991.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a really interesting point, a much more subtle point than the one the U.S. government's  driving home. The Trump campaign has actually been buying ads on Facebook urging Facebook  members to sign a petition banning TikTok, saying the ads say TikTok has been caught red-handed  by monitoring what's on your phone's clipboard. This, of course, is because in iOS 14,  you see the little pop-up whenever anything looks at your clipboard. So you're in TikTok  and you get these pop-ups every time you type a character. TikTok says, yeah, we did that because  if there was a URL on your clipboard and you were posting, we wanted you to be able to quickly paste  it in. We stopped doing that. It wasn't, by the way, Reddit did the same thing for the same  reasons. A lot of different apps did that, including Microsoft's LinkedIn app. So I think  it's a little bit disingenuous for this campaign, but they are trying to get people to sign a  petition to ban TikTok. I think that's the president ginning up the usual xenophobia rather  than an actual fear of TikTok. But I think what you said, though, is very subtle. That's not the  TikTok spying on you. Mike Masnick's funny says, well, you got a bunch of crappy IoT devices from  China also spying on you. That's the least of the worst. And what is China going to get  if they spy on my TikTok? So Seth, you're the tiebreaker. You've got one for and one against.

Start time: 2993.42
End time: 3147.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll say this. Anytime that any major government gets involved in banning technology or  banning apps, it tends to go awry 10 years, 15 years down the line. So I'm very hesitant  to see something like that for those reasons, simply because it sets a very uncomfortable precedent  as to what can and cannot be allowed by a government. But I think that Mike hit on something  really clever that hasn't quite been highlighted, which is TikTok itself. I mean, who really cares?  The real issue, I think, is that in the way that we have yet to figure out how to manage soft  diplomacy in the era of global tech. And we don't really have a good way of dealing with  countries, not just China, but say Russia or Iran or others, that do engage in technology in a way  that we don't like. TikTok itself as an issue of controlling the message isn't too different,  from Voice of America on radio. But how are we as a country going to influence other countries  in their use of technology? Is it just allowing Facebook and Google and Apple and whomever to go  do business wherever they want? Or do we need to be a lot more thoughtful about how  we do interact with the rest of the world? And I think TikTok, by and large, and how they behave  is stuff that we really don't see any different from coming from any other country. I don't think  if you go searching on Yandex, a Russian search engine, you're going to find Russian propaganda  up at the top. I think that we need to be a lot more thoughtful about how we're going about things.  And the US, for the past three and a half years, has completely ceded any interest in leading or  guiding the rest of the world. And that's where the real problem is. It's also the case that

Start time: 3149.58
End time: 3190.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  whenever we're threatened by an authoritarian regime like China, they have advantages against  an open nation like ours. And there's always the temptation to say, well, we should be less open so  that we can fight against those that would undermine us. That's always the temptation.  It's always the wrong way to go. Because we preserve our integrity and our authority  as a nation by being open and democratic and not doing things like banning TikTok, even though it  presents a problem for us. We'd prefer to go that way than just to fight fire with fire, to become

Start time: 3190.80
End time: 3206.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  equally autocratic. Well, it would be very interesting to see a situation where the US  government said, we'll allow TikTok as soon as Facebook is allowed into China. I don't know  that that would be a good idea, but that would be certainly interesting to watch it now.

Transcript:  we just have a ban of TikTok in the United States. Right. No, but if the US does that and also gets,  say, England, Germany, Australia, other places where TikTok wants to be big on board,  you could find, I think, and this is what I was getting at when I was talking about diplomacy,  you can get ways of pressuring countries that otherwise they wouldn't do.  It's not too different, I think, from how Russia refuses to extradite any of its cyber criminals.  We know that there are people hiding in Russia who are responsible for cyber.

But the point being is that without that kind of diplomacy,  we're leaving, I think, a very crucial and important negotiating tool in the toolbox,  and it needs to be used and implemented.

Transcript:  Yeah. It sounds good. But I think the largest problem here, the big, big Uber super problem here,  is that our impulses are based on a world where free speech is where publications or individuals  say things in public and then we all look at what they're saying and we all make our decisions and  it's the free market of ideas and all that kind of stuff. That's our impulses are based on that  world. But what we're talking about here is something entirely different. The world of  secret algorithms where each individual user can be fed a different message based on data that's  been extracted over years. But that's happening on Facebook.  Exactly. A person's personality. Yeah. It's happening everywhere.  Facebook, Google search. Yeah. Yes. But that's the larger  problem that our laws don't adequately deal with our diplomacy, our policies. We basically have all  these instincts that are based on another world and then we have the problems being caused by a  new phenomenon that is far more damaging and difficult of a problem than just the old arguments  about free speech versus no free speech, et cetera. And when a foreign government can tweak the  algorithms and speak directly and privately into the ears of millions of citizens-  Interesting threat. I agree.  I think that's a different thing than the voice of America where it's just a news report thing  and everybody can see it. So I think the problem is we have to figure out how to deal with this  algorithmically generated world. And to a certain extent, my bias would be in favor of just saying,  you know what, Facebook or TikTok or whatever, no more algorithms until we figure this out.  I agree. Because these algorithms are,  I mean, this is what probably determine the election in the future.

I'd love to see independent audits of all kinds of social media  and other tech algorithms because the problems that we've had with these algorithms, especially  concerning facial recognition and other issues, has come about because nobody is auditing them

You know, the YouTube recommendation engine,  clearly the number one problem on YouTube. The Facebook newsfeed algorithm,  clearly the number one problem on Facebook. But good luck getting those companies to abandon them  because those are money makers. That's their secret sauce.

Democracies are being compromised,  but what's sacrosanct is that Mark Zuckerberg has to make billions and billions and billions of  dollars every quarter. That must be preserved. He must have the right to destroy democracy for  his own personal profit. Why do we defend that? I think the first thing we should defend is our

Start time: 3522.02

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  democracy. Right. Yes. But Mike, it's not defense per se. It's often fatalism. I don't think anyone  here is saying that the world wouldn't be better if the algorithms weren't available. It would be  great if we could see them. We're saying that with Congress, except for donations as it does  from corporations, we're not going to get it. The people in Congress are not going to be in  favor of what you're saying. My question is, in a world where, as Seth pointed out, there's no  diplomacy, no collective action, and in a world, Mike, where we don't have the ability to force  Facebook to do this because Congress is useless and the president's an idiot, what the hell do we  do? I want to know what's an actual step we can take that's more constructive because I agree with  you guys, both in principle. I just don't see a way forward from those two big ones.  No, I think you're right. In a perfect world, we do that. But what's the pragmatic solution?

Start time: 3576.10
End time: 3643.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that we could do now? Certainly, I think taking the corporate approach, which is where we're at  in America in the year of our Lord 2020, and pressuring companies to ban apps that the  government feels are risky on corporate devices is one way to do it, and especially because so much,  even pre-COVID, was done on your own devices. So much of people's work was done on devices that  they had to pay for, but also had to be tied to work accounts and had work restrictions placed on  how those devices were used. I don't think that you would encounter a ton of problems in banning  apps that way, going through corporations. It would pick people off, but that would send a message.  I say this really as a theory. I don't know that it's something that I would agree with  in the long term, but if we're looking for what levers we can pull, that's one way of getting

Start time: 3655.28
End time: 3705.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think we should do something. There's an asymmetric warfare in terms of disinformation  that we need to do something about. Probably a great firewall of America is not the solution,  but at some point, we really have a grim future if every totalitarian regime in the world can just  shape public opinion willy-nilly. Here's the other thing. One thing is a national ban on certain  types of social networks or certain types of behaviors of certain social networks, but there  is also institutional bans as we're seeing with Wells Fargo, et cetera. Did you know, and I don't  see anybody talking about this, did you know that there are lots and lots of teachers in public  schools in the United States who are seriously trying to figure out how to make TikTok part of

Start time: 3706.18
End time: 3712.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  their curriculum? What? And to use TikTok as an educational tool. But you got to go where the kids

Start time: 3713.08
End time: 3725.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  are, man. You got to... That's what they're saying. And it's like, no, no, no, no, that's a bad idea.  So I would be in favor of things like no TikTok in schools, for example. Sure. That's fine. That

Start time: 3725.32

Start time: 3737.32

Start time: 3742.46
End time: 3793.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would definitely kill it. The good news is that every social network eventually goes the way  of the boomers. Like we all used to be on Facebook back before, you know, some people arrived. And  then now we're not on Facebook as much as we used to be. Twitter is showing remarkable resiliency  over time, but I'm sure TikTok will also become taken over by brands and boring people. And then  it'll go away. The question is what happens in the short term? And I think the impending election  gives this entire conversation a lot more importance because I think we're all very scared  about influence going into this. But I'll just say there are some politicians who are reasonable  on these issues that have actual thoughts about them. Like Elizabeth Warren, I think is one of  them. Not saying that I agree with her entirely, but I maybe it was slightly too harsh on Congress  earlier saying they're all idiots. I would just now say they're mostly idiots. There are some of  them who do understand tech issues and have reasonable positions on them. And maybe one thing  we could do back to concrete steps is elevate those voices to a higher part of the discourse away from

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Trump Facebook ads or whatever the hell we're at. Ron Wyden's another one. One of the difficulties,  I think, in the situation that Congress as a whole is facing, both the House and Senate,  is that most of the more reasonable voices on tech are coming only from the Democratic party.  And when you have tech awareness being a political issue in that way, take for example,  election security and voting machine security, then you have an incredible knowledge gap  that's also been politicized. And we've seen what happens there when you politicize masks.  What we don't want are people who look at tech and say, oh, this is a Republican issue or this  is a Democratic issue, because then you wind up with a lot less wiser discourse.  These people, what's a good idea versus a bad idea?

Transcript:  It has to be said that back in May, the initial TikTok hysteria in Washington was a clear bipartisan  effort. I mean, it was both parties coming together to crap all over TikTok. And so

Start time: 3866.90
End time: 3898.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that brings hope.  Let's all come together to crap all over TikTok. Well, and you could, by the way,  substitute Huawei for TikTok in a lot of this conversation. And that goes back to the Obama  administration and the Department of Commerce. And for all of the presumed problems that Huawei  presents, there's never been any real evidence. I mean, they're kind of not a great company,  but that they've spied on Americans, that their equipment is spyware. There's never been any,  as far as I know. Seth, is there-

Transcript:  Well, that's the super micro story, right? Where this incredible story came out, it's  seen. I mean, it falls in line with everyone's paranoia. But unlike with Twitter this week,  where Vice ran a story and then New York Times ran a story a few days later, confirming independently  much of what the Vice story said, we've never seen a confirmation of super micro. And I have only seen  rumors and supposition when it comes to Huawei.

Start time: 3935.44
End time: 3950.42

Transcript:  But with Huawei, again, it would be not out of the line of reason to say, oh, well, if you open up  your devices so we can have them independently audited, or again, using other forms of soft  diplomacy, would go, I think, a lot further.  What if ByteDance-

Start time: 3991.04
End time: 4019.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I had here-  What if ByteDance- they can't be compelled by Cepheus. They could be compelled by Cepheus,  the Committee on Foreign Investments in the US, to disgorge the Musically acquisition,  which was a big part of TikTok's success, because that was a lot of the lip-syncing stuff.  But what if ByteDance, seeing this as an economic problem, said, all right,  we're going to move out of China. We're going to become a Western company. We're just going to leave.

End time: 4058.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but you're trying to create a firewall between US users, well, global users and global  data versus Chinese users. I don't think we can help Chinese individuals around the great  firewall of China. I think there's not much we can do there, but we can try to think about our own  borders and our own safety. That's why I think there are distinct issues there, Leo.

Start time: 4060.14
End time: 4133.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So one thing that I think a lot of this conversation gets around is, but it hasn't quite  hit, is that we're really talking about what role, what greater role can government play  to positively impact tech? And what we've seen, and there was a story earlier this week on how  Cisco was involved in the creation of China's great firewall. Should there be a ban on US-based  companies working with countries that are authoritarian or in other ways are known to  be bad actors in a space? I think this is really serious because we've gone so far towards the  direction of supporting private companies and allowing private enterprise to rule everything  from tech to who pays for our healthcare, that now that we're discussing what role government  can play to help people in these situations and help consumers and help the international  relations, I think is really interesting. But there has to be a lot more forethought,  and I don't see that happening until we see changes in Washington.

Start time: 4134.26
End time: 4241.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's precisely forethought that would suggest that we should in fact ban Huawei as  a provider of 5G equipment, simply for the same reason that the reason we built the national  highway system, the reason Eisenhower really wanted that, was not because the Soviet Union  at the time had demonstrated its attempts and desire to invade the United States, but that it  was a possibility at some point in the future. And if that ever happened, you'd want to be able  to get the military equipment across the country to wherever they were invading. And likewise,  Huawei, 5G equipment is a firmware update away from becoming the ultimate spy tool  or the ultimate cyber warfare tool. And so something like 5G equipment is not something  that can be left in the hands of a company that is closely aligned with the Chinese Communist Party.  Personally, that's what I think. And this is exactly what you're talking about, Seth. This  is thinking about the long term. This is thinking from the way, for example, it's a military  problem ultimately. A cyber war, especially if it's combined with actual military activity,  is something that you want to make sure that you are prepared for. And so when it gets to  networking equipment that everybody's relying on, I think that's too sensitive to be left to  a company like Huawei, which again has demonstrated a sort of bad faith, everything from stealing,  what was it, T-Mobile's robot arm once to you name it. It's a long list of transgressions.  And so I would tend to lean. But of course, this is something that the Trump administration  they were very much against Huawei until it became clear that it was just a bargaining chip.

Start time: 4241.26

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  wanted to show you that were on the top of my feed just minutes ago. And now they're they got  new stuff because it's constantly adjusted to give her, you know, actually, who was it? Was it Ben  Thompson? Somebody had a really good point comparing TikTok to Quibi because of course,  this this was that very bad doomsday week for stop watching TikTok. I'm talking. This was that.

Start time: 4502.80
End time: 4612.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And over and over and over. So when when Quibi first came out three months ago,  they offered a three month subscription. This was the platform. Jeffrey Kadzenberg,  Meg Whitman raised almost $2 billion, hired big names to make seven minute videos,  because that's all we have attention for. Not just phone first phone only, you couldn't put  it on your TV. You couldn't send it. You just that's all it was. But that three months ran out  earlier this month. And according I think was sensor tower of the millions of people who signed  up for Quibi only 72,000 kept their subscriptions. Ouch. So and so I think it was Ben Thompson  explained what's going on. And I thought this was very astute. I'll give Ben lots of credit  on this one. By the way, we try to get him on the show all the time. But because of the hour,  he's in Taiwan, it'd be very early morning. He's got the kids. Anyway, it's he can't really can't  really do it. But we, Ben, we love you. We quote you all the time. He said, Quibi is the Hollywood  model, which is that there is a scarcity of content. So the Hollywood model is we're going  to use executives and all this stuff to pick the best content we can find. Most of it will lose  money enough. It will be big hits. It'll support the rest of the economy. That's how Hollywood  works. TV, movies. That's how Hollywood works. What tick tock and YouTube did is exact opposite.  Everybody throw everything on there. And then algorithmically, we'll pick the best stuff.  There's an infinitude. There's no scarcity of content. There's an infinitude of content.  And our algorithms will surface the best stuff. And I think that we can see that in the war  between the Hollywood model and the Silicon Valley model, it's very clear Silicon Valley

And yet, and yet I don't see ads for this. I don't see people,  you know, really sort of pushing it. Even here in San Francisco, when I go out to buy something,  you know, not every place has it.

Transcript:  I went to a Costco in California somewhere and they had a perfect solution. Basically,  the, the, the protocol was you get out of the car and you, you insert your Costco card into the  gas tank to get gas. Then you get back in your car and then they have full service. So the,  the attendant touches only the gas stuff. So you touch your stuff and he, they touch their stuff.  You never touch the same stuff. Yeah, that works.

So I can sit on my motorcycle,  take out my phone, reach over, touch the contactless payment on the pump and start filling up. But,  but what we're, but the problem I'm talking about is, is that not enough endpoints have it. So you're  not seeing it in restaurants, which should be using it. We're not seeing it in restaurants.  Yeah. And, and I don't know if, and what I think is, is that back when we, when we started using  chip cards, the U S was very slow to adopt because credit card companies were blocking  the adoption of, of those cards because stores didn't want to pay for new readers. And so they,  you know, they, they didn't want to pay for them either. The, and whoever was going to bear the  cost wasn't going to step up. Eventually we got chip and signature, which was not chip and pin.  And, and we're, and I'm wondering if it's a similar stopping point here where, where we know the  technology exists. We know that some stores have it and others don't, but it's not enough of them.  And there needs to be this push to really get it out into as many places as possible. It seems like

But first a word from our sponsor, Mike Elgin is here,  Seth Rosenblatt. It's great to have Alex Wilhelm. What a panel, smart, funny, and damn good looking.  Our show today brought, I don't include myself in any of this. Our show today brought to you by  Zendesk. You know the name Zendesk. It's a service first CRM company that builds software design to  improve customer relationships.

I do not talk much on the shows. Just a little bit I have about the  EARN IT Act, which was this backhanded way to get rid of end-to-end encryption by tying it to your  Section 230 protections, or the new much more blatant act to eliminate encryption called LEED,  or it's what L-A-E-D, the Lawful Access to Encrypted Data Act. Both cases that they're intended to  eliminate encryption, but the reason I don't spend a lot of time talking about it  is I don't feel like they're very likely to get passed, or am I just completely wrong? Seth,  you're probably right about these. Should I be worried about either of these? EARN IT seems to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  have been kind of decapitated in committee. It seems to have been. It also wasn't until it was.  I think one of the problems is that these laws, which face uncertain opposition,  it's not really clear who's opposing them except for the usual suspects in Congress who fight these  kinds of things. People like Ron Wyden, right? Yeah. And what feels more dangerous this time  about EARN IT and I don't know whether to call it LEED or LADE or whatever, is that they're  tying it to the prosecution of— Depends if it's present tense or past tense.  They're tying it to the prosecution of CSAM, of child sexual abuse material.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  EARN IT is out of committee, I'm pretty sure. They were supposed to vote on it a couple of  weeks ago, but I didn't hear anything. Yeah. I think they voted it out of committee  and it's moving to the full Senate floor, but it was also just before it got voted out of committee.  A manager's bill was a rider or something was attached to it and so it's now far more

Start time: 5351.28

Start time: 5358.80
End time: 5441.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You better do it right. So what we saw is if everyone remembers SOPA and PIPA, those were  fought against and defeated. SESTA and FOSTA, which was the next turn of the screw of those,  did get through. And when you read the accounts by adult sex workers, they have been harmed by those  bills, not helped. EARN IT is really, or at least as it was, was really bad. LEAD is just a straight  up attempt to force backdoor access and that's not going to end well ever because encryption is  simply math. I don't know if you guys have seen these face masks that have been going around that  have a hole in the middle. So you can fit your straw, your e-cigarette, also terrible for  coronavirus. So I tell people that these bills are what they want to do by mandating a backdoor  and encryption is like wearing a mask with a hole in the middle. It's not really going to be effective  because at some point something's going to get through it. But what it will do is keep

Start time: 5448.98
End time: 5468.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the argument is that end-to-end encryption is already in use, often enroll your own situation  by cyber criminals. So they already have this. You're not really doing anything more to get at  them when you're using encryption that's been intentionally backdoored. My real question is,

Start time: 5468.40
End time: 5485.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the reason I don't talk about it a lot is I just feel like is this security theater or is there  actually a chance, I think there might be a chance it'll get out of the Senate. Both of them are  Senate bills, but I don't think it'll get out of the House. Do we want to risk it? I think there

Start time: 5502.36
End time: 5586.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Right. That seems likely to me. Another issue and one that I feel is really important  and not being discussed enough is that CSAM is a serious problem online. It's definitely something  that needs to be addressed more and better by bi-tech companies. And for too long it hasn't been.  Part of the problem here is that now the anti-encryption groups have a very compelling  argument that CSAM needs to be stopped. Everybody agrees with that. Wyden actually proposed a bill  to counter earn it that would increase funding to national organizations for prosecuting CSAM,  for tracking down these people, for throwing them in jail, and for getting aid to the victims.  Unfortunately, it doesn't have a clever acronym, so I can't remember it at the moment.  But it's one of those things where this is a bill that may actually help prevent CSAM, and it's not  being discussed and it's not being talked about by other news organizations anywhere near as much  as it should. Every time we talk about earn it, we should be talking about this other bill because  the idea that stopping CSAM is going to happen when you poke a hole in encryption is just silly.

Transcript:  It's not how it works. And to follow along on Mike, on your contention that it's the secret stuff  you've got to worry more about. I didn't even know this. Thank you, Seth, for putting this story in  the rundown. Apparently, the president has issued what's called a presidential finding,  a secret authorization, to give the CIA more sweeping powers in their international operations.  Who it targets? Undoing a lot of restrictions that have been placed by other administrations,  previous administrations. The CIA will now have easier time authorizing its own covert cyber  operations. They don't have to get approval from the White House. This is what some are calling a  very aggressive finding that lets the CIA take the fight offensively to Russia, China, Iran,  North Korea. Those are specifically mentioned, but it could be any country. There wasn't a lot

Start time: 5653.30
End time: 5716.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  of coverage of this story at all. It's an abrogation of executive authority over foreign policy.  There are two ways to abrogate foreign policy. One is that you find out that Russians are paying  bounties to kill American soldiers and you go, well, who cares, whatever, and you move on.  That's one way to shirk your responsibility. The other one is the CIA comes to you and says, hey,  we want to be able to make all our own decisions. That way you don't have to deal with any of this  stuff. We'll just make the decisions and act on our own more than we've been doing. Yeah, go ahead  and do that. That's another way to shirk your responsibility. We do want the CIA in specific  areas to take the fight, as it were, to other countries that are attacking us with asymmetrical  warfare. We want to push back with asymmetrical warfare. Absolutely. But that needs to have  at least some oversight. Not just go ahead and do your thing because that's how we get.

Transcript:  To be clear, this happened two years ago, but we're only now, because it was very closely held,  we're only now learning this is a story from Yahoo News, Zach Dorfman, Kim Zetter,  Jenna McLaughlin, and Sean Naylor. This is their scoop because they've seen now this memo.  And if this is accurate, this basically gives the CIA free hand to run cyber war without any

Start time: 5743.14
End time: 5751.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 5756.08
End time: 5787.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just some people wouldn't get it. So one of the interesting things in this story is that this is  something that the CIA has been asking for since the Bush administration, the second Bush, not the  first Bush. They asked for it under Obama and both times they were denied. And they were apparently  expecting to be denied again because at this point, if a Republican and a Democrat say no,  why would anything change? And Trump said yes and signed it. And one of the issues-

Start time: 5787.46
End time: 5793.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can just see the CIA guy running home from the White House saying, he signed it. He signed it.

Start time: 5793.50
End time: 5798.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It worked. It worked. I can see the CIA going, just tell them Obama was against it.

Start time: 5798.96
End time: 5818.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Obama hated this. It's just a bad idea. That may be exactly what happened. I mean,  who knows about that? But one of the interesting things here is that it's not just going after  countries in some kind of nebulous cyber warfare. It's going after critical infrastructure.

Start time: 5818.86
End time: 5840.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's- See, and the real risk of that is the escalation of this kind of cyber warfare.  So if we're doing it, they can do it and it just escalates. And honestly, you could talk about the  devastation created by nuclear warfare. Fortunately, everybody on both sides kind of understands that  and steps back a little bit from it. But I think you could devastate a country just as much,

Start time: 5841.10
End time: 5877.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  if not more so, with economic damage. The hacking tools that we saw used in Stuxnet,  which at the time were cutting edge and in use only by the Israelis and the US,  since have been found in use elsewhere. Codes from Stuxnet have now made it into commercial  malware. These things have a very clear trickle down effect and can be quite detrimental within  a very short period of time, far beyond anything that they were originally intended for.

Start time: 5877.76
End time: 5915.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Mike, what were you going to say? Well, I just think that what we need is to have our pushback  against cyber warfare attacks on us to be part of a strategic program. For example, I'd love to see-  We're just getting our butts handed to us in terms of disinformation for mostly Russia,  but also China and other countries are getting into the act as well because everybody's noticed  that the United States is just an easily influenceable country. And so I would love  to see a strategic vision that put a lot of wood behind the arrow of fighting disinformation  with information. That fits more with the openness that I was talking about.

Start time: 5916.34

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's pursue that as opposed to secret cyber warfare.

Start time: 5922.94
End time: 5940.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And when you're going to attack infrastructure like a Stuxnet type of attack, Stuxnet,  that was mostly Israeli technology. The US kind of went along with it. It was kind of like a  Middle Eastern thing and going after a specific problem. Well, also it was reasonable because

Start time: 5940.84
End time: 5959.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  they were enriching uranium for making the atomic bomb. So we wanted to stop the uranium  from doing that. The Israelis really wanted to stop the Iranians from doing that. They said,  hey, you know what we could do? These are air gap centrifuges, but we can actually blow them up  if we could just get somebody to pick up a USB key and stick it in. And it worked.

Start time: 5960.50
End time: 5997.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What you don't want is to have this low level constant attack anything you can attack because  that leads to all kinds of other problems. You need to have a policy, a strategy, a vision-  And a proportionate response.  ... for why we attack, when we attack exactly because if the United States is going to be a  global leader in these things, we need to basically try to, the best we can, to set the boundaries and  the rules for how these sort of low level cyber attacks are going to happen. Because if we don't,  it's just going to be a free for all and chaos. It's going to evolve in a bad way very quickly.  And we don't want that.

Transcript:  So we have an all day talked about any of the big companies, Google, talk a little bit about  Facebook, but Google, Apple. I've got a Google story that I don't understand, but you guys,  you're so global, you're so smart, you'll understand it. And you can tell me why this  thing with geo is a big deal. And you're a finance guy, Alex, maybe you'll understand too.  But first, a word from our sponsor. I was talking to a guy called The Radio Show saying,  I use a VPN, a lot of people do at home to protect themselves against the snooping of  their internet service providers. And I couldn't get on YouTube TV. How do they know I'm on a VPN?  And so there's one way that IP address has been used by other VPN customers. And as a result,  they kind of know that you're on a VPN. There's no way to sniff the traffic. It's from the IP  address. What you want is a VPN service that doesn't reuse those IP addresses in the same  way. You want ExpressVPN, which works not only with YouTube TV, but with Hulu and Netflix and  everything else. ExpressVPN is the only VPN I ever think about. Think about all the times you're at  home surfing the net and you searched for something that maybe you'd like to keep to yourself.  The hemorrhoid cream or whatever. Your internet service provider is sitting there going,  he's looking for a hemorrhoid cream. Quick, send him some ads. And they are, by the way,  legally entitled. They're actually explicitly entitled to sell that information, to make a  little extra money because gosh knows you don't pay enough for your internet service. That's why  you got to, even at home, even when it's not a security issue, when you're not trying to stay  safe at the open wifi access point, you got to run a VPN. Incognito mode is not incognito.  Private browsing is not private browsing. Whenever you're at home, whenever you're around town,  you got to use ExpressVPN. You can trust ExpressVPN. They've had independent third party audits. They  do not log. In fact, they go so far to prevent logging. They actually run something called  Trusted Server. When you press the button, it's so easy to use ExpressVPN. There's an app for  every device, even smart TVs and streaming devices. You press the button, you get on the VPN  server. That VPN server spins up in RAM only a copy of the Trusted Server. That's what you're  running through. It's sandboxed. It can't write to the hard drive. It cannot keep track of what  you're doing. And then when you leave, when you log off, it disappears. It's RAM only. There is  no trace of your visit to ExpressVPN at all. So your privacy is absolutely protected. I don't  care what ISP you're using. I don't care if it's the big boys like Verizon or Comcast, a little one.  They all can legally sell your information to ad companies. ExpressVPN keeps them from snooping on  you. It reroutes your internet connection, your DNS, everything through their secure servers.  The ISPs can't see the sites you visit. It's all encrypted with the best encryption available.  By the way, you can leave it on because ExpressVPN is awesome. This is because they're a really good  company. They have so many servers that they're fast. You can watch HD video. You can watch Netflix.  I will go to England to watch Doctor Who on Netflix in England. It doesn't slow down. You can watch  it in HD. Very few VPN providers can say that. So much so that I just leave it on. I don't even know  it's on. Sometimes I'm surprised. I go, oh wait a minute, my VPN's on. Apparently I'm emerging on  the internet from Belarus. I didn't know that. Sorry about that. All the devices you use,  all of the places you go, ExpressVPN is the way to protect your privacy, to protect your security,  to expand the TV shows you can watch, eliminate geographic restrictions, protect your online  activity today. It's the number one VPN. Not just me. It's not the only one. CNET said it.  Wired said it. If you look at the webpage, you'll see lots of other places rated very  highly everywhere. Protect your online activity today. ExpressVPN.com slash twit. Go to  ExpressVPN.com slash twit. The best deal, you'll get an extra three months when you sign up for  a one-year package. It gets it down to about seven bucks a month, a little less. That's the beauty of  ExpressVPN. They charge a reasonable amount. I think it's a very fair amount and that's how  they can do it so well. ExpressVPN.com slash twit. Thank you very much for your support, ExpressVPN,

Transcript:  and for keeping us safe. Leo, I'd like to second what you said and I'm glad you emphasized a couple  of points because it's not often emphasized. VPNs have limited capacity and everybody's suddenly  working from home and some of the lesser VPNs are just groaning under the strain. ExpressVPN,  which I just use constantly. I never turn it off. It's just there. I forget about it because it's  no performance hit. Everything's fast. Like you say, you can pick a country, any country.  When you're abroad and you need to access your bank, which doesn't want you logging into a US  bank from another country, you just decide to pop up in the US. If you're in the US, you want to  access a foreign resource, you pop up in that country. It's just brilliant. For those less  technical people who are afraid or have tried other VPNs that are really slow, ExpressVPN is  amazing. You just turn it on, say, always be running, and then you never have to think about it.

Transcript:  I leave it on everywhere. I mentioned this story and we probably should mention it.  894 gigabytes of records left on an unsecured elastic search cluster belonging to UFOVPN,  which is a Hong Kong VPN with multiple affiliates. I think there were seven other affiliates,  UFO, Fast, FreeVPN, SuperVPN, FlashVPN, SecureVPN, and RabbitVPN. They do white label VPN service,  so you may actually be using them and not know it. They've all claimed that they don't log,  but somehow, actually the total amount was 1.2 terabytes of data, including more than a billion  entries, many featuring highly sensitive information, just left hanging out on an elastic  search cluster. They included websites, visited connection logs, people's names, subscribers'  email, home address, plain text, passwords, Bitcoin and PayPal information, messages to support desks,  device specifications, account info. The thing that pisses me off is they all pretend to be no  log VPNs. Speaking of the internet creaking under the load, CloudFlare was out for about half an  hour. Did you notice any of that this week? This was on tweets. July 17th, so that was Friday,  right? They were out for 27 minutes affecting locations in San Jose, Dallas, Seattle, Los Angeles,  Chicago, Washington, Richmond. I can go on and on and on. It just shows how much traffic goes  through CloudFlare. CloudFlare is widely used by sites for DDoS protection. For other reasons,  we use it for authentication. They have a great authentication service. They're really good. I  really love CloudFlare. Apparently, an engineer, while working on a segment of the backbone from  Newark to Chicago, updated the configuration on a router in Atlanta to alleviate congestion  thanks to COVID. Unfortunately, they fat fingered it. There was an error that caused all the traffic  across the backbone to be sent to Atlanta, which immediately overwhelmed the Atlanta router. This  is John Graham coming writing for Cloudware and caused CloudFlare network locations connected to  the backbone to fail. If you noticed, you wouldn't notice it as CloudFlare. You'd notice it as your  site loading slowly, or in some cases, not at all. It's too easy to fat finger BGP tables,  all of this stuff. We've seen this happen over and over again. There's got to be a better way  to do this than have somebody typing in to Emacs. Let's get that right here. We're just

Transcript:  making a mistake. On the other hand, it's just part of the reality of the distribute.  The charming nature of the internet. Exactly. There is no internet. It's just a bunch of computers.  This happens when AWS goes down or has a problem. Basically, there is no big gigantic ocean. It's  just a bunch of little ponds that we're all accessing through. One fat finger attack and  we have a bunch of problems. The plus side is that the internet is not centralized.

Start time: 6555.44
End time: 6603.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they fixed it in 27 minutes. It is, though. That's part of the problem because it is more  centralized because so many people use CloudFlare and so many people use Amazon. There is some  centralization happening, which is not good. This is my favorite visualization. This is the CloudFlare  traffic conditions. What you're seeing, green means normal traffic. You see the yellow, orange,  and red. That means super huge amount of traffic. That's the Atlanta knock.  And then all these white spaces are no traffic. So this chunk...  IP not happening.  That's nothing happening. This chunk got sent to there.  I shouldn't laugh. John's a friend and I sympathize. I can imagine what that board looked like as it  lit up.

So the result  of this sort of thing isn't really sharp in the financial market.

Start time: 6711.38
End time: 6759.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's correct. I think the main answer is the revenue stream unchanging means the share price  doesn't change because the stock price is just today's estimate of the value of future cash  flows. So if those cash flows don't change, nothing really matters. So if Twitter goes down for a day  it'll make that quarter slightly worse, but the long-term trajectory of the business doesn't  really shift. So this is why Facebook stock isn't really under duress during this advertiser,  kind of like blackout surge, whatever you want to call it, because people presume they'll all  come back and in five years we won't even recall this. So why is the shares down now?  Well, I'm trying to make the stock market seem less dumb. Yeah. No, I mean, Tesla at $1,500 a share  makes us point that things can get a little wild. But I mean, I think that investors tend to look at  short-term downtime as that short-term downtime as opposed to a long-term change.

Not giving investment advice, but if you are a fundamentals  minded investor, it's an interesting share price to try to deduce the reasons behind.  And I think the real reasons are optimism and retail investors. So yeah, but remember for a

But there's always an example that makes any sort of caution  appear to be bad advice. I don't think that that caution is apparently the wrong way to approach  things. Cloudflare though, you know, worth 10, 11 billion dollars today, a 1% hit. I think everyone's  kind of shrugging this off as one person making an error. By the way, they came back incidentally,  they're now on 5%. So if they did this every weekend for six months, they might lose some  business. There's no pattern here other than, you know, Matthew Prince on Twitter having to go out

See, now maybe I was stupid,  but I thought, dumb me, that the COVID crisis, that the shutting down of Main Street America,  that the bankruptcy, that the millions of people unemployed, the bread lines, I thought that'll  probably hit the stock market. So I got out of the stock market back in I think February or March.  That was a dumb move. I guess I was too cautious. Who knew? Bread lines, Leo, people are lining up

I do find it very funny as a markets observer lately,  that every time there's a rumor of a vaccine somewhere out in the future, shares just surge.  People are bullish about America. Yep. Yep. And whenever there's a 1.3 million new unemployed this  week, the stock market goes, eh, you know, it's going to be fine. I've lost my ability to kind of  figure out what's going on. So I'm just sitting back, you know, with the metaphorical martini

I don't have to look at the  returns all the time. And I should mention just to reassure everybody, I never buy individual  stocks because I'm not smart enough to do that. I buy by the dumbest. I buy index stocks. I buy  the dumbest thing I could buy, you know, so I don't have any dog in this hunt. So having established  my pro bonos or no, my bonafides or some Latin phrase in terms of investing, I am puzzled.  And I don't even know if it's a big story, but Google just bought a big chunk,  a giant chunk, and they're not the only American company to do so in GEO, J I O, which is I think  the most valuable company in India, right? Reliance. Well, the owner is the most rich,

Start time: 6959.56
End time: 7020.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  is the richest person in India, Mukesh Ambani. And yeah, so this is a company that is really,  it's like a four year old company or something like that. And they're just kicking butt in terms  of offering what the Indian market really, really wants, which is reasonably good quality, very low  priced internet connectivity. And they're just, they're just a rocket ship. And so Facebook  invested in them, a bunch of American companies did, now Google is. And, but to me, the most  interesting thing is that they're actually going to work with Google to develop an India specific,  presumably India specific version of Android that will facilitate the low cost distribution of  a version of Android that does access the Play Store and does support 5G. So this is actually  probably a very good thing for the Indian market. It's not the investment  because they got plenty of investment. It's the partnership with Google that will result in a

Start time: 7020.24
End time: 7047.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  better version of Android. So Reliance Industries, which is India's most highly valued firm, 10% now  owned by Facebook. They put in 5.7 billion in April. Google just put in seven, four and a half  billion for a 7%, 8% stock. Google makes more, well, I guess they both make sense. Google making  their own version of Android for Geo makes a lot of sense, I think. I think it's about access,

Start time: 7047.90
End time: 7120.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Leo. So, you know, when I think about companies putting a lot of money into Geo, which is the  subsidiary of Reliance, it's just the kind of the mobile telecom version, as it's 360, 380 million  subscribers. If you want to have access to the Indian market because you think that you need to  keep growing your revenues globally, having a stake and therefore maybe a bit of a say or some  protection from the most important wireless carrier is critical, especially after Facebook pulled the  trigger on its deal back in April. Now everyone's scrambled to put money into the company. It's not  just these two groups. It's many other people trying to get a piece of this for two reasons,  upside and then of course access. I mean, if Facebook is not going to play particularly fair  in India, they can use its ownership to box out rivals. So now everyone has to have a piece for  safety. Also, we spend a lot of this show talking about China and the lack of access to that market.  Well, India is 1.3 billion people. And so you probably want to make sure you have a big open  door to all of those folks. And so it's about access. It's about partnerships. It's about money  as well. It's probably the most interesting story in tech today that isn't a crisis. I feel like  everything else we talk about is about a crisis. This is just, yeah, this is optimistic. This is  about the future of having many more people on the internet in some capacity. And so in one way  it's fun, but I think it's also very strategic and the money is used here to buy bargaining chips.

Transcript:  Right now, the geo phones use KaiOS or Kaios, which is kind of a, it's not a smartphone. It's  not a feature phone. It's kind of in between. It does run apps, including WhatsApp and YouTube  and Facebook and Google Maps. Google is an investor in Kaios. So they have some stake in  that, but it makes sense for Google to put what sounds like a lot of money, four and a half billion  dollars into Reliance geo. But that's a pittance for Google, especially to get them into that market

Start time: 7152.86
End time: 7196.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and to get Android on those Kaios phones. So money well spent. This has been a long time desire of  Google to get Android working on cheaper phones, on cheaper hardware and get it functioning as if  Android normally would. And if they can pull this off with India, then suddenly a whole bunch of  other markets, especially those in Africa, become more open to Google in a way that they're not open  to Apple and in a way that, you know, Facebook hasn't really been investing. The only other major  investor that I'm aware of over there has been China. So if Google here is proxy for the US,  that's probably a good thing geopolitically.

Transcript:  Apple joining a list of companies eliminating racist terms in their language. GitHub eliminated  the master branch. The Linux kernel community has decided not to use blacklist, whitelist,  master and slave in their terms. They're going to replace them with, frankly, terms that are  more descriptive. I mean, blacklist and whitelist isn't nearly as good as deny list and allow list.  That makes a lot more sense. It tells you a lot more about what it is. And the thing is,  we're so inured to it because we've used those terms for so long. We forget that they are offensive  to a large portion of the world. And blacklist, whitelist is one thing, but master and slave is  really pretty bad. But host or controller and client, those are more descriptive. I'm happy to  see that. Twitter's doing the same thing. I have a little more problem with the master branch  because I don't think it's master slave. We talk about mastery and mastering something. Is that  the same? I guess it's the same route. Different use. There are lots and lots of words that

Start time: 7333.22
End time: 7390.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  were associated with slavery. One of them is even more out there is plantation, which is  being objected to. My own view is that this is one of the ways that language evolves.  There are lots of us who have the luxury of not being offended by words like plantation and  master, et cetera. But there are lots of people who hear those words and they just cringe.  And since the truth is we don't care that much and they do care, I say let's change it.  As somebody who was born in Los Angeles County, let me give a shout out to Los Angeles County  because this is like a trendy thing right now because of Black Lives Matter. But Los Angeles  County was demanding that computer suppliers in 2003 not use the words master and slave for their  technology products in any way.

Start time: 7408.18

Start time: 7414.34
End time: 7525.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Who cares? Exactly. So two points I want to bring up that are related to this. One is that  while most of what I've seen of the InfoSec community's discussion of this on Twitter has  been fairly reasonable with some debate about white and black list versus a lower block list  and things like that, there was also one Google security person who was going to speak at BlackHat,  which is the big... What are they going to call BlackHat now? Well, so that's really interesting  because it looks like... Is it bad hat?  Right. And so one Google executive said that he wasn't going to speak, which actually created a  bit of backlash from some InfoSec people who pointed out that for one thing, nobody who is a  bi POC InfoSec person was really calling for that change at BlackHat. And for another...  And really the bigger point is that while this changing of terminology is important and there  are people who are arguing for it, what's really important is making sure that these tech companies  start implementing much better diversity programs, have much better pay scales. And really,  you know, these HR departments that are protecting companies and preventing them from moving forward  need to get on the ball and really start diversifying these organizations and making  them fair. It's not enough to just bring in bi POC. You also have to make sure that the environment  is going to set everybody up for success, not just the white men who've already been there.

And in this book, which was written, I believe published, I believe, in 1901.  Are you reading that to Princess Squishy Face? Or is this for your own?  I started to but she really likes the movie better. And she's bothered by the differences.  So I kind of backed off on reading it to her. Maybe in the future I will.  Lots and lots of differences. But basically, everybody is very color centric in terms of  their clothing in that book. And so the way you know the difference between a good witch and a  bad witch is that the good witches all wear white, and the bad witches all wear black.  And this is the kind of thing that you'll find throughout culture and history, these references  to black being associated with badness and white being associated with goodness. And so I hope we  don't attack the past in this way in terms of language and culture.  But I would like us to see us fix the future. And I do stand corrected my memory. I actually

And basically, our panel made it very clear that  this all begins with education and universities and stuff like that. And I was very happy to hear  what I thought was a big piece of news coming out from my own mother, which is I went to UCLA,  but the UC systems incoming freshman class is the majority of them are Hispanic.  And so this is like, you talk about putting your money where your mouth is. Everybody's  always talking about, oh, we need more diversity. We need this. We need that.  The California State University system exists as a place to give a high quality university education  to Californians who, for one reason or another, are being denied that education elsewhere.  And in fact, in terms of the college age population in California, the majority is Hispanic now.  And for the University of California to represent that majority, they don't quite  meet the same percentage as the population itself, but they're approaching it. That's a huge deal.  And I hope that is also reflected in engineering schools as well. Because we talk about who's  underrepresented, who's overrepresented in technology. Probably one of the biggest groups  that's underrepresented is Hispanics in technology. And so I think this is a big deal. And technology  industry, Silicon Valley, it can be done. You can do this. Look at the University of California.

I don't know if it's happened yet, but  I know it's demographically soon. Not that I bothers me in the least, honestly.  Let's take a little break. When we come back, we're going to say farewell to a friend of the  network and a friend of geeks everywhere. But first word from our sponsor, the people who buy  us this beautiful studio, the LastPass Studios. Of course, our friends at LastPass, keeping us  safe for more than a decade. In fact, it's exactly a decade ago that Steve Gibson. So I've been using  LastPass for a few years, and I've been singing its praises to Steve Gibson. And about it was  exactly 10 years ago that he talked to Joe Segrist, the creator of LastPass. Joe showed him the code,  explained what they did. And Steve was super impressed. Did a whole show on it,  a whole security now on it, and started using it. Steve's been using it ever since for a decade,  because it's done right. It's secure. It's done right. We started using LastPass Enterprise in  the business because we realized all well and good if people who work here know about security  and password. But we have a lot of people in the business office and others who maybe don't have  the same understanding, or maybe reusing passwords, or maybe putting passwords on post-it notes on their  screen. And those people have, by virtue of their job, access to our most important data,  our everything, our websites, our databases, our bank accounts. So we decided, we better use  LastPass at work. It is a challenging time for your IT department. Very big job right now. There's  more devices. People are bringing their own. There's more applications. And people are going  home to work. So they're not even working on your company network anymore. Add that to new  threats, new regulations. Strong security has gotten harder than ever. Fortunately, LastPass  is here to be your partner, to provide your IT with strong security, both easy to use and easy  to manage. Both are important. If employees don't like LastPass, if they don't find it easy,  then there's no point in using it. They do. They love it. If IT can't manage it and get  centralized control, then you're not doing the security job you need to. LastPass secures every  entry point from shadow IT to apps to mobile and cloud services. The key here is their access  solutions give you, the IT department, visibility and control over every access point to your  organization. With employees using their own devices, their own phones, they're at home,  suddenly you lose track of who's using what where. But LastPass identity solves this. It offers a  simple integrated view across every access and authentication task. So you can see who's accessing  what, when they're accessing it, where they are. That's the information you need to keep your stuff  safe. Too bad Twitter didn't know about that. Increased security without increasing productivity.  Your employees will love it. Things like single sign-on, which makes it, you don't even use a  password. It's just easy. Multi-factor authentication, adding contextual factors  to fingerprint and face recognition. Things like geolocation, IP addresses, reduces friction  and prevents threats better. It's kind of the holy grail in security. More convenient and more  secure. Is that even possible? It is. And of course, passwords, which are the number one  vulnerability in the world right now. LastPass's password management is the best. It secures all  those passwords, generates them. You don't have to think about it. It lets employees do their work  securely, whether they're in the office or working from home.

And I was very sad to see Grant Imahara,  who was just, if you watch Mythbusters, of course, you know how great Grant was,  passed away suddenly at the, from aneurysm at the age of 49. I will never forget Grant coming to  the Brickhouse back in 2013 for a triangulation episode. First thing I knew is people were going,  Grant Imahara is here. It's Grant Imahara. But he was so unassuming, so sweet, so normal. He was  friendly, said hi to everybody. I didn't get to do the interview. I was jealous because I as actor  got to do the interview. But I did get to talk to Grant and everybody just was so impressed by  him. He was such a sweet guy. And it's such a loss to the geek community. He was a professional  engineer. I did not know this. I probably should. But he designed, rebuilt R2D2 for the prequels  and was one of three operators during the movies. He was amazing. He built the robot that  Craig Ferguson used. Jeff Peterson? Who's that? The robot's name was Jeff Peterson?  That's a pretty mundane name for a robot. Yeah, Jeff, the robot that Craig Ferguson,  G-E-O-L. Oh, well that makes it all the better. Jeff Peterson. Anyway, Grant Imahara, surprise,  shocking, passed away at the age of 49. A really talented electrical engineer, roboticist,  and of course, myth buster. He will be missed. I don't want to end with such a sad  note. Oh, I could play a promo. That'll cheer us up. I forgot all about it. A little movie  celebrating the week. A little promo to cheer everyone up.

Actually, I look even  weirder now because I have a dental 3D printed, what they call a fitter that was 3D modeled by  my face that holds the mask in place so that it's sealed. So now I look like I'm wearing a muzzle.  I look like Hannibal Lecter. But I'm safe. So did you want to talk about that grab and go cart,  Mike? I thought you mentioned that earlier. Well, yeah, it's very interesting because,

Start time: 8457.92
End time: 8596.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  of course, Amazon owns, they own Whole Foods, which is a pretty big grocery chain store. And  they're intending to sort of roll out their concept stores that include, originally they're called  Amazon Go, which are tiny little markets where you just go in and you shoplift, and then they  charge you anyway. You just grab whatever you want. That's an interesting take.  What's fascinating about it is that they have these carts that are, they basically have almost  no capacity because almost all of the space of the cart is taken up. You saw how small that  looked in the picture. Yeah. They're so small in fact that they're Woodland Hills, I think it is,  store where they're going to roll this out near Los Angeles. They're going to offer both carts.  So if you only want a couple of things, you can get the high-tech cart, but if you're going to get  a normal shopping load, well, just get the old fashioned thing and do the checkout the normal way.  But they're dash carts, they're called. Actually, the best part is they allow you to weigh the  produce that you're buying in the cart. They have scales. Yeah. So that's pretty cool. And you can't  film too high. Otherwise the cameras and all the sensors can't tell what you're buying. That's the  whole point. You load, you put some products in this cart and it says, oh, we know what you're  buying. We know who you are. We'll just charge you for this stuff when you walk out. So it's kind of  a cool concept, but I think that they have many years to go before this is kind of a mainstream  thing that can roll out into all the whole foods. And I just think that during a pandemic, it's  actually kind of ideal. You sterilize the handle of the cart and then you never interact with a cashier.  You're never swapping credit cards, any of that stuff. It's all just charged your Amazon credit  card. The same one you use for your prime account or whatever. It's pretty cool that we're trying to  figure out this technology. But like all of these things that require kind of AI and image recognition,  which includes self-driving cars, it's going to take a lot longer for us to really nail this than  we think it is. And I think that they're little tiny carts that only allow you to get a couple of  items is a perfect example of how you have a super aggressive company that's trying to make this  mainstream, but they're really clearly not ready for the way Americans buy groceries, which is in

This to me looks like, remember when Amazon showed off  the drone deliveries that still haven't happened like five years ago and got an amazing press run  out of that. This feels like five years ago.

And in Carrefour,  you have to actually wait in line to weigh your produce. Oh, that's silly. One item at a time. So  if you buy six or seven or eight produce items, that's six or seven or eight times that you have  to wait in line to weigh it. Wait a minute. You can only weigh one thing at a time? Oh, no. I mean,  you typically would. Like you can't go with like a whole bunch of things. You get stink eye from  people who are also wait. One item a line or less.

This was something that was supposed to cut through the problems with European customers  of American companies data and where it's held. The idea was privacy shield would balance the  requirements of us national security, public interest, law enforcement, and the privacy rights  of citizens of the EU. And the court said, it's no good. You gotta go back. So this has been going  on, you know what? I'm sorry. I haven't brought it up. It's been going on since like 2013. Shrem's  to succeeded.

And if they can store data wherever they have a site or if it has to be specifically in that  country, the way that China mandates that its data must be accessible and so on. I think that this is  going to put a big damper on how companies develop. And it's going to lead to the ongoing  and ever-growing balkanization of the internet. If Bulgaria, with 5,000 people and it decides that  you need to hold all of their data in Bulgaria, that sets a very bad precedent. And I don't know
