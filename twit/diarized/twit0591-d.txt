Transcript:  Well, what happened we broke the internet. I think this is really what happened  The internet started out really great  And then we broke it  We broke it in a number of ways with monitors the monetization models really  promoted  things like link bait and and  Punch the monkey banner ads ad tech went crazy  Hate speech found a way to express itself and all of these things kind of converged to take what was this kind of utopia and  Turn it into a dystopia and it feels like that happened in the last year. Oh

Start time: 761.80
End time: 766.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, it's been happening forever. Well, it's been getting worse and worse, but it feels like it just kind of came to a head

Start time: 767.34
End time: 782.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know link baits been a problem for years. I guess I think it's had an impact on the real world outside of the internet  Maybe in this last year. Yeah would be a way to think I mean like it's been happening forever  But most people could avoid it. I mean as part of tech encroaching on everyday life everywhere. I guess you're right. So

Start time: 783.46
End time: 810.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which makes Ohms empathy gap even more important. So what do you mean? This is a New Yorker piece  And by the way, it's been great to read you in the New Yorker. I just  thrilled to see this  Silicon Valley this was this week in the New Yorker has an empathy vacuum  Is it the job of a company to  have empathy or merely to  Return a good in a good dollar to its investors. I

Start time: 811.40
End time: 943.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mean depends on what kind of society we want to live in  right, I think at the end of the day if you are going to create a society in which only the winners get to  You know have it all  What happens to the rest of the society? What happens to the whole economic system down the line?  Where do people go people who are purchasing?  You know things which allow companies to market their ads on Facebook are  Fewer and fewer those ads are also going to become fewer and fewer  So it's not just the question of like being charitable  But it's more about having a more equitable society in a way that you're actually actively thinking about  The disruption you're causing and what are the things you can do to help bring, you know  Bring along people whose lives are getting disrupted. I'm not talking about charity here, but I'm talking about are there  Opportunities for retrenchment are we thinking about in a longer term how a technology has an impact on other things?  And I think that's what I mean is in order to even think about those things  We have to put ourselves in the shoes of other people and I think if this election showed anything  we refuse to put us in other people's shoes regardless of what side of  Political spectrum you really are and what kind of and I think it is more and more  prevalent in Silicon Valley where everything is so focused on building returns and and  Growth and then just kind of moving on to the next thing and my view is  Let's not let's not you know forget that there is  People at the end of this technology who are going to get impacted and we have to think about those things  We can't just run away from those things. That's the whole piece was all about that. That's like how do we internalize?  other people's  Reality as well and which probably will lead us to build better more thoughtful products in the future

Start time: 945.26
End time: 957.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's good business to consider  your customers and and  Society and the impact what you do has on them  But it's more long-term thinking than quarterly results

Start time: 958.42
End time: 1051.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's that is exactly the case and I think companies need to stand up to  Those kind of values now if you know look at I don't know if you saw the news from Facebook  Yesterday, I think December 2nd. They said oh we're gonna do 20 million in donation and spend on  affordable housing in Menlo Park and East Palo Alto and  I think that's a great idea in a large scheme of things  But like how does it going to work out for the entire community?  If all the houses are being bought by people who live and work for Facebook  You know, there are certain demographics. So suddenly people who are lower-income  Housing, you know users they don't have a place to live in the entire ecosystem, right?  They can't afford, you know, the whole food is gonna move in and not like, you know, it will be it will be the  the schools and the you know health system everything is gonna evolve around the people who work for  Facebook not for people who have lived there and eventually they will have to move out  So to say that 20 million dollars is what we are doing. That's like that's nice charity, but in the end  That's the lack of empathy right right all the way through, you know  Oh, you know Zuckerberg and Cheryl and whomever and they they don't seem to  Kind of even think about those things

Start time: 1052.74
End time: 1107.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Also is a really good example of I mean people who don't know Silicon Valley Palo Alto is a very affluent town. That's  Near where Steve Jobs lived and when the Palo Alto Apple Store  Started selling the iPhone that's where Jobs would go  The downtown Palo Alto is very gentrified cute thing. But like a lot of American cities  There's this, you know pretty part and then there's the part where people live who work there  East Palo Alto and it's very poor and  It's often ignored by the residents of fancy pal West Palo Alto  So it's a really good it's a very microcosm an example of what's happening all over the country  But but how could it be bad that Facebook is donating 20 million dollars towards affordable housing that's a good thing, isn't

Start time: 1108.32
End time: 1119.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah on paper. It sounds like a good thing, right?  But I'm trying to say is that five years down the line when all the houses are built  the people who are living there are the engineers and and the

Start time: 1120.06
End time: 1123.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Building they're just building more housing for their people. Exactly

Start time: 1123.52
End time: 1213.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then will the people who are in the affordable housing can they afford any of the services in the area?  Can they afford the doctors can they go afford to send their kids to the school?  Can they even go grocery shopping there? Can they do all these things which?  You know, normally people are able to do because once you know, the the yuppies move in  does you know the cost of living goes up and what that means is  You know people who can't keep up they're out right which is unfortunately the reality of our  Modern society, but just to kind of say that we are giving 20 million dollars  I think that is completely, you know missing the point and that is another proof point of  You know Silicon Valley missing that empathy gene  It's like really you don't you don't think that five years down the line  This is going to be a problem and they have started to treat everything as like a can we negate  Press negative press attention by giving some money. I think this is like something which really makes me mad  It's just like yes, you can do whatever you want to do  but then figure out you know use your IQ to figure out ways to  bring together all the people you're going to impact and  Like take them and lift them through the through the boom that is the Facebook housing is gonna bring there  But again, that's not part of the conversation  20 million dollar check is not the answer

Start time: 1215.58
End time: 1278.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Should it be part of the conversation?  I think you know, I think about the atom bomb and all the scientists in the United States who joined the Manhattan Project  Robert Oppenheimer who very famously said now I've become  Was it Kali the the goddess of death?  And now I become destruction when the atom bomb was first set off  Oftentimes, I think technologists work on stuff  Well in this case they had a motivation they wanted to beat  Nazis to to to an atom bomb but  I think oftentimes technologists work on technology for technology sake science for science sake and say, you know  We can't be responsible for the impact technology has and I wonder if you know  It's interesting that you you write this article at this time because there's also I think it's in the Wall Street Journal this week  And there's this growing movement of empathy is actually bad for public policy. You've probably seen this as well

Start time: 1280.30
End time: 1331.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That if that action go ahead I was gonna say that makes sense  One of the things like oh when you're talking about empathy I think about externalities right the economic kind of  the impact of your stuff beyond what you're paying  Your profits and that sort of thing and you can't  There has to be a limit if you're a company that is  trying to think about other people you have to you have to draw the line somewhere and  Everyone's gonna debate where that line is in I think it's important for any kind of tech company or  person in technology to think about the externalities of their  Whatever they're developing whatever they're doing  but  At the end of the day, they still have to focus on profits  And the question is how far do you take it?

Start time: 1332.88
End time: 1360.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sure ohm that you were aware of and probably maybe even responding to Paul Bloom's New Yorker article earlier this year a case against empathy  in which he points out that empathy suffers from this identifiable victim effect where  You can identify the specific victims and as a result make public policy that may also may help the specific  Identified victim and hurt the kind of invisible victims over the long haul

Start time: 1361.46
End time: 1413.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or it's just the unsympathetic victims. I mean we're seeing that in Texas when they're yes  instead of debating whether or not Texas should  Take care of its Medicaid obligations because they're kind of in a fight right now with with Obamacare basically  Instead they're crafting these crazy laws and they're doing these crazy exemptions to the policies and  funding and then some group that's really sympathetic like children who need  Prostatic limbs or children who need mental health therapy  Suddenly they're like, oh we're in the fire the fire line for this and then the politicians come in and they're like, okay  we'll take care of everyone X or we'll take care of these guys and everyone else who's unsympathetic goes away and  That's a terrible way to impact policy, but that's a different conversation. Maybe we're just want a larger

Start time: 1414.84
End time: 1421.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  An empathy that has a larger sense than I think baby Jessica in the well or you know, I

Start time: 1422.62
End time: 1617.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Think there's a lot of people who confuse sympathy with empathy and I think what I'm trying to talk about is actually trying to understand  What other people are talking about what other people are?  Dealing with what the impact is on other people. I'm not saying take a sympathetic action  I'm just saying if you do not understand, how can you build better products? How can you build a better society?  Sympathy is not going to lead to a better society  listening better and trying to internalize other people's issues and trying to figure out how to  better improve  The environment we live in or the products we build is important  so I like you saw the whole issue with Facebook and fake news and  Just to they were denying it for so long and how can you deny?  something you are  Complicit him and just kind of just because you say you you you are not able to fix it  We should believe you and that's kind of what I mean is like wait  You're not even thinking and listening to people who are talking about fake news  You're just like just dismissing them with the wave of your hand and and so that's what I mean is like that's not where  We are as an industry. We need to kind of listen better  Internalize a lot of things and then start to see what we can do and what we can do  I mean if you know, Stacy you're talking about  What is the limit for the companies? I think if they are  If you know they are doing this for a profit reason they are building housing right next to their offices because  People can come and work longer hours in there in the company office, but remember the company  cities  Whether it was Cleveland or Pittsburgh or wherever they the big companies paid for health care. They paid for schools  They even paid for colleges and schools engineering schools all those things they paid for by the because  That was part of the social contract. They had this is not like socialism  This was like a capitalist company like US Steel or whatsoever was looking out for its own interest  And I think that's what if Facebook is looking out for its own interest  It should go beyond giving 20 million dollars in housing subsidies and you know and saying okay, that's good enough  No, if you want to do this, you know build build up the whole East Palo Alto Menlo Park area  Provide the services which will lift not just their  Their you know engineering teams, but also people who are not engineers people who work in the back of you know, Facebook offices  There will be more jobs like that. Can those people stay within the community?  Can their kids aspire to go to the same college and school as you know, everybody else's kids?  So I think that is what I mean  It's not don't be sympathetic to the cause and just say oh here is some money  Now empathy is like kind of saying what is other people's problems?  What are their hopes and dreams trying to understand that is very important. That is good corporate  You know management that is good capitalism and I think  It's time to actually think and talk about those things

Transcript:  Dr. Bloom who just wrote a piece in the Wall Street Journal and whose book against empathy comes out next week  I think agrees with you actually own but he prefers the word compassion. He says there's a difference between empathy and  compassion  and that when we and there's even a brain chemistry difference between empathy and compassion compassion is  More having a sense of  Conscious feeling for and not feeling with  It is characterized by feelings of warmth concern and care for the other as well as a strong motivation to improve the other's well-being  empathy ends up just like using the word sympathy actually  Is more feeling what the other feels as opposed to?

Transcript:  you don't need a technology you need it you need to have your company or as someone who's inventing tech or  implementing technology  Think about how it affects others and try to understand the other point of view  I was gonna give you an example actually of and it's gonna come from a company that only get upset or not upset with but  it's not a favorite company of his but  AT&T actually is aware that its business is kind of under threat and it's changing  Its corporate infrastructure and its technology to do software-defined networking and as part of that  It's retraining a huge chunk of its workers  It's offering a lot of Udacity courses and paying come paying its employees to take these courses to help  Get them ready from the world where they you know  physically manipulated cables to a world where they're gonna do it digitally and I think that's actually a really good example of  saying hey, we're gonna implement an entirely new technology across our business and  our people aren't gonna be able to keep up and  We can argue that AT&T is doing this because a lot of their workers are unionized and yay  But at the same time it's kind of a nice example of a tech change being met with empathy or compassion

Transcript:  I mean you look at what just Stacey just said he said you are  Essentially helping retrain the current workforce for a new future  Now out of 50,000 people maybe 20,000 people will have a job and 30,000 people won't  But it's still better than 50,000 people not having a job. I'm not saying I am not against the idea of technology  I love all the progress we make but I'm also trying to figure out is what more can we do?  To start bringing people along as we grow go into this future  Can we figure out new jobs? Can we figure out new opportunities?  Can we figure out how to retrain the workforces?  of the of the of the industrial era for this new new time frame can we  afford to give up on three to four generations of people  Before everybody starts to kind of become part of the workforce all over again and the answer to that  Can be yes because that is a very fruitful, you know fearful future. I fear for  So many people who will be just left without jobs and then what are we gonna do to this to them?  Like how will we take care of the society and I think it's important to figure out  Even even a little little bit of effort is more than no effort  And that's what this whole piece was all about. Yes, and we're heading there's Palmeil

I mean the solution is not to  recreate the steel industry in the United States and  There are tough challenges and automation is one of them and that's not going to turn around and stop. I agree. We need to consider it  But I don't know if Silicon Valley has the has the so outside of solving social issues and inequality

Transcript:  There's also a part of Ohms thing possibly or maybe it's me adding to it  Think about how your products perpetuate  Inequality or yes, yeah help people maybe avoid interact  I mean like so, you know filter bubbles is a is a very simple example, but another is  Things like when you're starting to use algorithms to you know map out safe routes home. Where does that take people?  That this was kind of part of the weapons of math destruction. I mean, it's basically  We are we put so much faith in technology that

Oh, let's just you know, let's let's grow flowers and  Cut the soles off of our shoes. It's not gonna happen  I you know, and so let's talk about the filter bubble. I mean ohm you talk about this in your piece  Facebook  Makes he says Facebook is a company makes these bubble blunders again and again  But what is face? What is Facebook to do Facebook right now?  optimizes its algorithm to improve  You reader engagement  period and  It works we can see the numbers we can see it works  Is it Facebook's job to change how human beings work?  Because what do you mean by that? Well, I'm just saying if Facebook look it let's say it's Facebook's responsibility to optimize  It's you to make TV has by the way TV is grappled with this for years  do you give people what they want and  get increasing ratings or  Do you say well with a spoonful of sugar  We're also gonna make the medicine go down and we're gonna beef up our news operations  Even though nobody watches them because we have a societal obligation is supposed to do the same thing

Transcript:  That's a pretty illogical argument to be honest. I think you  Get spam in your inbox  Do you not get mad with Google or sending you spam and don't you think it's their problem to fix the spam problem?  Fake news is the equivalent of spam on a media centric platform  Like Facebook, but Facebook is a business designed to optimize for profit. So is like Gmail optimize around  Delivering more email to you the more spam email you get more you're gonna stick into their stay in the inbox  So they're gonna have to figure out a new business model around that  So I think what I'm saying is that as a platform  Which you know is based on now they're like the media platform for the planet  It is important for them to make sure that there is no fake news platform  Origin stories popping on to the to the system. It's just like spam. It's like it's just they are preventing us from  Using you know, like like getting spam

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's all right to extend your analogy though some spam  It's obviously spam if the word Viagra is in its spell with a one  I know it's spam the problem is and Facebook has this problem and Gmail has this problem. There's some email  That is debatable. There's some fake news that's debatable  should  Should let's say an atheist decides well anything about God is patently fake because there is no God  So I'm going to eliminate all God stories from Facebook  that's an extreme example, but

Start time: 2204.60
End time: 2227.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think that is an extreme example to prove your case when I'm talking about it. Mrs. Clinton  Killed a child or did some murder like is responsible for so many murders. There's some so some fake news  We can all agree coming out of Macedonia from a Macedonian website  How the hell that is they should block them and I write and then why didn't they do it like that's the basic problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The obvious stuff was the bigger problem than just the non obvious stuff. I just agree because I think

Start time: 2239.46
End time: 2275.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The the bigger problem is not I mean the Pope endorses Donald Trump  blatantly fake eat provably wrong  Not a big important thing frankly the conspiracy theory  That the that a pizza parlor in Washington DC is a child porn ring or that the president is a Kenyan born  non-american citizen those things  Have a life of their own regardless of Facebook  Has nothing to do with Facebook because people want to believe them people do believe them  Is it Facebook's job to say? Oh, no. No, that's not true  the I think I think a

Start time: 2276.48
End time: 2293.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Lot of people see that and think about it. I mean  The number of things you see just flying by you read it. It becomes part of your consciousness  You don't even think about it and in Facebook that happens a lot. And so then you pull these things out  Oh, I saw that somewhere. There's like a child porn ring staffed by right. I understand the mechanism

Start time: 2293.92
End time: 2302.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But is it is it really Facebook's obligation?  Yes, it's it should be as a platform, but there's lots of people who would argue it's true

Start time: 2302.44
End time: 2310.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not true and it causes actual detriment  And this is the problem with people see theories is it's very hard to prove them. Not true

Start time: 2310.76
End time: 2329.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't prove the negative and so I think it's provably true that the Pope did not endorse Donald Trump  Just ask the Pope it is much more difficult to prove some of these other things  That's why they live on their conspiracy theories and I don't know if I want Facebook to get in the job of a  censorship at that point

Start time: 2331.29
End time: 2337.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Transcript:  It depends on where they're coming from if they're coming from some  Website in you know eastern europe or they're coming out from some dumb website and you know  It's like some other country like that. Yeah, they should be blocking those and you know, if those stories are on let's say, you know  Any of the alt-right websites?

Start time: 2385.24
End time: 2407.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think then you have you have  One group this is more polarizing denying the truth of another group saying it's obviously not true and  The other group saying well, it's obviously is true. Show me where it's not true  And then it becomes very difficult for Facebook to say well, we've decided this is true. And that's not true  I don't want Facebook to be in that business

Can you tell me how profitable can you tell me what your expenses were?  Who owes you money what your accounts receivable are if you had freshbooks you could you just go to the right to the front page  And you'd know  Redesigned from the ground up and built just for the way you work most accounting systems.

So you'll be more productive more organized and you'll get paid more quickly  Create and send professional looking invoices in less than 30 seconds. No formatting. No formulas  Just clean professional looking invoices with your logo your color scheme  It reflects your brand and by the way when you send the client the invoice you'll know on the dashboard says whether they've seen it or not  So so they can't say oh I didn't get your invoice. Yes, you did you read it  Set up online payments for them with a couple of clicks who get paid according to freshbooks research up to four days faster  There's also a super handy deposit feature so you can invoice for expenses and payments up front  When you're kicking off a project so you don't have to do it out of pocket right now  You can try it free a 30-day unrestricted free trial just by going to freshbooks.com  twit  Enter this week in tech in the form when they ask you how'd you hear about us that would help us  Start your 30-day free trial today freshbooks  saved my life when I was  Uh going to canada one week a month doing the tv show and I had to invoice them and do expenses.

Joining which was terrible  Flawed and apple doesn't do that  But I think any router that's more than a couple of years old should be replaced  They wear out the technology changes and I think there are much better choices out there now you're in a you're in an apartment, right?  so  Yeah, one router probably gets to every corner of the place, right?

Wood arrows ended the day apple  I do think that the new mesh routers are better, but you know, but they're really for  The solving the problem of congestion and spread so you don't have any trouble with your wi-fi home, right?  No, no, none at all. The apple router is still perfectly secure and as far as I know will be for yeah  I wanted to ask the two of you. It's ac  I see

Transcript:  The question I wanted to ask the two of you is i'm trying to figure out  What is the best way to protect your?  personal information in a sense  VPN and like encryption and all that kind of stuff  Especially for somebody like me who travels a bunch. Yeah, what's the right way to do this?  Without like adding too much overhead  In terms of like, you know slowing down the machine and stuff. You're screwed. Um

Transcript:  Obviously encryption is your friend, right?  In fact notice that since the election for the downloads of signal the encrypted messenger  Uh from open systems has uh have quadrupled  So, uh clearly there are people and I it may also be related frankly to the passage of the investigatory powers act in the uk  Um, that may have been a precipitating factor too. I I at this point  I don't feel like here in the united states we have any more  Issue with privacy than we've always had you know, i'm talking about all these  Traveling is another issue. Yeah

Start time: 3235.64
End time: 3364.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah  So here's what I would do  Uh, and this is actually what I use there's a little device called a tiny hardware firewall  And you can buy it. It's not very expensive. It's a you it's it fits on your keychain. See then it's a usb  Key  Uh, what this is is it's a built-in vpn and tor  They actually have bigger devices too if you want but this little you this thing I would you could put this in  You know in your laptop bag  Whenever you're at an open wi-fi access point you plug this into the usb port  It picks up the wi-fi signal from the coffee shop  Passes it through a vpn and or tor depending on what you want  To your computer  So that your computer is now on a vpn and or tor the whole time you're using it in the coffee shop  Which absolutely is more secure  Gotcha  This also has optional malware blocking and ad blocking  If you want to turn that on as well  So basically it's like a filtration system. Yeah, I have I have one of them here  I just got this is this is a same people tiny hardware firewall.com that do this is a router  So this is a little portable router. You see has the wi-fi and the ethernet  The safest thing to do would be turn off the wi-fi on your laptop entirely  So that you're not an attack surface at all  Put this on your laptop have it get the wi-fi signal and then go into your laptop via ethernet  And then your laptop is truly not an attack surface. Okay  You want to use anything that goes out of your laptop is going through vpn  I don't know if you want an anonymizer not tor is you know, as we know the fbi is cracked tor and  Tor may not be perfectly anonymizing  But it's better than nothing  And then you probably want to use encryption on your email and that means gpg not proton mail or something like that  Do you use a pgp or gpg?  I use gpg. Yeah  And that so that means you have to use an email client that supports gpg. Apple's mail does

Yeah, I wouldn't recommend it  And then so now your email is encrypted because otherwise it's a postcard  It's encrypted  uh  Your web browsing is encrypted  If you don't have your wi-fi turned on your laptop, uh, an attacker would have to have physical access to your hardware  That's you know, they don't have that right?  Don't let them have that I wouldn't carry around a smartphone with you or if you do carry around a smartphone that's not connected any  of your accounts  Because because this is a real in fact, look at the latest story on android  Um, there's a real problem.

I think if your job is to provide  internet access or banking  if they are  unable to provide protection and  encryption of data  They should they should be heavily penalized for it. Yeah

Start time: 3809.26
End time: 3841.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, so here's an interesting thought because I had a dude, okay, so  There's a the broadband internet technical advisory group actually put out a report last week talking about this  And part of it was the role of isps  So the challenge they face with securing their routers and we can argue about this. I  It'll be fun  Um is that if they block these attacks what happens is or if they block  You know certain whenever they block anything or close off a port on a router they get a technical support call

Start time: 3841.72
End time: 3844.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, it's hugely expensive for the big isps

Start time: 3844.96
End time: 3857.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So they're like, ah, it costs a lot of money. Now the downside now though is people are like with mariah  X number of their routers might be compromised easily. So then they're like is it more expensive to do it this way or that way?

Start time: 3857.48
End time: 3911.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. So well for a long time be like proactively looking to  Block these things even before the attacks arise in a sense part of their you know  OPEC should be devoted entirely to  fixing the problem before they it's sort of like, you know very much like the medical system where we have  You know, oh you can go to the hospital after you've fallen sick. It's the same thing  It's like but we try to close the door after the freaking horses, you know, you know bolted  Like why would you do that? Like why not try and you know provide provide ways to not cause problems  You know already and I think that's what I mean is like if your job is to manage people's identity people's internet access  people's banking  You should be like  At the ultra edge of of you know preventing these attacks not if only that were true

Start time: 3912.64

Transcript:  Comcast very famously, you know  internet service providers  Hate it when you have a email  Server running at home and they're often  Put there by malware to send out spam. It was a big problem for years and the solution was very simple  Which was merely the block port 25  uh the uh the smtp port  And comcast resisted for years because they said and you know when you have millions of customers  This makes sense that they would get millions of phone calls. It would cost them millions of dollars  If they did it they eventually did it though, and this is the point they had to  And I think that you're going to get resistance from these companies saying well, that's expensive  But I think you're right. Um is hold their feet to the fire. So you have a responsibility  If you're making equipment that's on the network  To keep to preserve the network  Isn't that what ma bell used to say with the right before the carter decision ma bell said well  You can't put just any old equipment on the network because we got to preserve network integrity.

That means now you've associated all the traffic on this router with me personally and they said well, yeah  We'll protect your privacy, etc, etc. But the reason we do that is so that we can update it for security  having an account  Allows us to to you know, kind of improve your router specifically your router  And the other thing but at the same time in the past my asus router didn't know who I was, right?

And so he changed the whole system. He was like screw it  We're gonna do this like double opt or two factor of a sort  so now you have to ask when you log into your account you give them your email address or your phone number and then you get a  Email or a text and then you enter that code and then you can log on so they're really trying  They're using that to make things more secure.

Transcript:  Let me talk about tech, please  Hey, let's talk about net neutrality, please

Start time: 5035.31
End time: 5085.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, stacy wants to talk about net neutrality. I want to talk about all right. So this is a good one  I really enjoyed this article the fcc  Came up with the opinion that at and t  And their new direct tv  now  violates  violates net neutrality  Because of course at and t says we're not going to charge you for bandwidth you use when you watch direct tv now  On as an at and t customer zero rating, right?  But there's a little problem  like  The fcc is the ultimate lame duck agency at this point  In uh in a few weeks january 20th  The new president will get to nominate a new chairman of the fcc. In fact congress has already said to the fcc  Don't do anything

Start time: 5086.38
End time: 5130.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the fcc has already yes, they stopped they stopped doing stuff. So this must be like a leftover  Well, yes, and this is something. I mean tom wheeler is banking big on net neutrality being his  Actually protecting consumers rights, which he's done a really good job of he is not the dingo that we thought he was  He is he is not um  So yeah, this is so frustrating because this is what everyone said was going to happen when we allowed zero rating  This is not a surprise to anyone. Yeah, and  Oh look it's happening and  At and t and verizon by by ignoring t-mobile and not going after the the first mover the weakest one in that

Start time: 5130.34
End time: 5133.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because t-mobile started this with their binge on program

Start time: 5134.06

Transcript:  Binge on and zero rating for spotify and some things which everyone's like hey free spotify

Start time: 5138.58
End time: 5189.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're like, no, this is like this is why it's so hard zero rating is so hard because customers love it  Right what they don't understand and it's I feel like i'm preaching at them when I say this is  You it's not good for you  You shouldn't I know you're not paying anything for listening to spotify  But the problem is the next hot new exciting music service  Is disadvantaged you won't listen to them because they cost you bandwidth  So in effect you're telling john ledger and and t-mobile you guys get to pick who the winners are  And we don't want t-mobile to pick who the winners are we don't want at&t to pick who the winners are  We want the market and consumers to pick who the winners are  Did I describe that accurately you were so good

Start time: 5190.20
End time: 5193.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm, so glad I didn't have to do that because I would have just gone part of the problem is the is the term

Start time: 5194.08
End time: 5208.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Net neutrality is terrible  Yes, and I wish we could come up with a better name I keep thinking uh, maybe net discrimination or bandwidth discrimination  network freedom  Well, it's for freedom, but it's against discrimination

Start time: 5210.18
End time: 5237.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it's yeah, but discrimination they the they got that  They took advantage of that word because discrimination in the fcc sense now means a lot of crazy things but on this story  so  at&t with direct tv, that's their own service  So they're basically like  Ooh, you belong to us and that's why the fcc went after them. So with t-mobile t-mobile wasn't being as egregious  Well, it is it's worse. It's worse today

Start time: 5238.42
End time: 5257.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's not really worse because ultimately the whole problem is  Picking winners whether it's you or somebody else  And we don't know what deals t-mobile is making with these companies to get zero rated zero rating is it by the way another terrible phrase  These phrases are chosen to obfuscate the problem

Start time: 5259.26
End time: 5297.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because the people in their marketing departments are great, uh at&t sponsored data, uh, so with this  I'm just i'm so sad because  At&t even if the fcc does go even if the fcc had the ability to go after them  Which I don't think given the people who are in trump's transition team that's going to happen  at&t and verizon will fight like hell to make sure this goes through and  They fight the long game. I mean the fact that we're still talking about net neutrality  How long ohm has it been since we've been doing that neutrality like 2008 2009?  I mean before 2005 was the term was invented or

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I cannot say I think like take a step back and just say what is  How are we going to train people to think about?  Medicine which has been so far  Prescriptive not preventative, right? I think that's the bigger challenge we have right from a social standpoint  It's like how do we make people?  Healthcare system and all these other issues including you know, how we pay for medicine and medical care  to come to terms with the predictive nature of the of our  Of our you know technologies as they go forward and I think that is again part of my whole  conversation about  Technologies having empathy is understanding that aspect of it  Yeah, right like I mean it might be good for people  Who can afford to go and get you know treatment?  and what if you don't have  any  Any ability to you know pay for treatment?  Are you sentenced to death in that sense? And how do you live with something like that?  And I think the ethics around these issues are pretty  You know important to discuss and talk about  And I I think most technology companies need to start doing that especially  Google, you know in my opinion they need to take some time  along these issues

Start time: 6016.26
End time: 6067.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, and even if it's not a death sentence per se  If your phone says hey, you might have parkinson's and you don't have insurance or you can't afford a doctor's appointment just  even getting a sense like  You know even getting an okay there  Becomes like to see if you're okay is expensive and prohibitive or it usually takes I mean  I know to go into my doctor  It takes me sometimes like my neurologist has like a six-week waiting list, right?  and so  Thinking about living with your phone saying you might have something wrong with you for a long period of time  I mean even a doctor doesn't call you on the phone and tell you  Negative test results usually they make you come in and they give you a lot of information  I don't know it just  I can see this going very bad very poorly

Start time: 6069.18
End time: 6176.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Leo what do you think?  Well, I think there's two different issues. There's the infer I I love what you said, which is it is completely rethinking how we think about medicine  Although there's always been preventative medicine  um, and the and the best  medical  uh treatment is  Is kind of holistic and proactive as a as opposed to treating an illness, right?  And I think many uh, you know, even even some enlightened health insurers  Particularly hmos are starting to think that way  Although the economics of health insurance it turns out discourage that  paul krugman in his book, uh, the conscience of a liberal talks about  The fact that uh health insurers don't think long term because people move around a lot  So they don't like to ensure  proactive diagnostics  Because you're going to find a problem that they're not going to have to pay for in many cases. So why pay for the  proactive treatment  If they're not going to have to pay for the reactive treatment when you get the heart attack  Uh  And uh, so that's why modern health insurance isn't doing a very good job in terms of that  but I think medicine in general and doctors understand the real value of kind of  finding problems before they occur and  And uh and treating for them  That's not there's no that's nothing new. Is it?  Uh on the other hand we do and and this is a boy  That's a really good example of we were talking about incoming inequality  You could talk about that in many ways besides just money and that's a very good example of an inequality  That's created by information and then the ability to do something about it

Start time: 6177.04
End time: 6209.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the information is a lot like now the inequality  Is based on data and information and some some people  Will have more information if you can afford it, right?  Just like me i'm asking you how to secure my  My computer systems and my phones  When there are poor people whose phones are being hijacked  By malware, so I think the disparity  In the society is also starting to reflect in our technology products in that way as well

Start time: 6211.24
End time: 6246.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I do hope that we you know, we get better at um, you know, i'm all for genetic testing and  Uh, yeah things like that. I mean there's an ethical issue, but I don't  You know this burka 2 is or barka 2 is a good example where uh, and it's used primarily because  the  Response is so is so dramatic, right?  Right, and so if it were merely well, you should start taking vitamin c you would go. Yeah. Well, whatever i'm gonna do that  But if it's a double mastectomy  Uh, that's so dramatic that then well now we got a question about whether we should diagnose that or not

Start time: 6247.44
End time: 6250.18

Start time: 6259.08
End time: 6332.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, well in technology will help us refine things and make it better too. So  The more data we have  from patients  And we have the compute capability to analyze this at a way that we've never had before and in a way to do it  really cheaply and quickly so  It's possible we'll get to a point where soon we can be like, oh you have brca  One and you have this other crazy gene up here and in in  88 percent of the cases we have this, you know that that merits a double mastectomy. Yeah  so  I want to I want us to be cautious and I want us to think about how we because we  We don't often talk about this, but how do you deliver that data?  What are the next steps from because that's where technology falls short we we don't think about anything beyond like we can do this  And we need to think beyond that and I  With genetic testing it becomes really scary with health testing  It'll it has the potential to be incredibly accurate but also incredibly disruptive if you tell someone that you know  And we don't have data sharing and privacy mechanisms in place really for this either

Start time: 6332.74
End time: 6359.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, this happened all these technology stuff is happening so fast that it's taking a lot longer for human institutions to adjust  I mean that's just really the kind of the story in a nutshell of the last few years  It will be the story of the next decade and maybe forever  Technology moves faster than our human institutions can adjust to it and there's lots of disruption as a result of it  And we are in a we're in easily the most disruptive era of inhumanity right now

Transcript:  I don't know. I would argue the opposite  Uh, I I think human history if you if you look at it is pretty bleak  And pretty grim. I just finished a book, uh 300 years of romanoff zars  Those people were nasty  And they really subjugated  Millions of russian people in the most horrible way possible  Uh, and I think we are the the fact that we even have these discussions is a massive improvement  over years gone by  I admit we're not perfect. We got a long way to go, but I think that we're maybe more  Perfect than we've ever been

That is that is true  I'm not i'm not going to argue that that but I think the  Understanding of what people can do with your data and how you can  Subjugate people through pricing through access to information  through  All of it's so much more subtle, but it's still

But I mean look at uh, for instance, uh women's rights  It's far from perfect  you know, uh women still are  Mistreated in some parts of the globe horribly, but I think you mean north america  Yeah in north america, but but I think there's progress has been made even you could even say globally admittedly  There are some places where it's not very good, but at all but globally there has been progress  I think it's and which is not to say a we shouldn't work on being better  We got a long way to go and but it's also to say we shouldn't say be well, it's so terrible  I mean we are making prior we have to acknowledge we're making pro. I think we're generally  Maybe i'm wrong. Are we not generally making progress in the world? It's not evenly distributed. I understand
