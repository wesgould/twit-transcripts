Transcript:  This is Twitter.  This is Twitter This Week in Tech, episode 830, recorded Saturday, July 3rd, 2021.  Meet us in Singapore.  It's time for Twitter This Week in Tech, where we cover the week's tech news.  A little bit different today because Sunday is the 4th of July.  I looked back.  Lisa told me a couple of weeks ago, oh, no show on Sunday.  I said, what do you mean?  She says the 4th of July.  I said, we don't miss a show.  What are you talking about?  And she said, oh, we always miss it on the 4th.  I said, what do you mean?  So I looked back.  There has only in the 15 years of this show, there's only been one other time.  The show was on the 4th of July and we did the show on the 3rd.  So I thought, okay, there's a precedent.  So we're doing this today on Saturday the 3rd.  Let's hope nothing no big news breaks in the next 24 hours.  And of course, I'm thrilled because we were able to get two wonderful people to share  their Saturday evenings with us.

Just give me the facts because the information is great.  It's a CBT.  It's cognitive behavioral therapy.  They help you understand why you overeat and how you're overeating and become aware,  mindful of the whole thing.  And it's very, it works, but it's a little cutesy.  I agree.

Transcript:  No, it's not.  Did you know sidebar?  There's a new documentary that Dave Grohl has out on one of  the networks, maybe Netflix or maybe Amazon.  It's called Cradle to Stage.  Have you seen this yet?  So Getty, so basically it's like Dave Grohl's mom had a book  come out, whatever.  So and it's not the greatest show.  There's a lot of problems, but he does interview musicians  and their moms.  So there's an episode with Getty Lee and he's you hear, I  mean, she tells the story about surviving the Holocaust and  like the whole family went through and then there's a really  weird transition to Dave Grohl's daughter wanting to become  a musician.  But it's pretty amazing and Getty is like super, super  interesting.  There's also an episode highly recommended featuring Tom  Morello and his mother.  Tom Morello's mom is a badass.  Oh my God, that woman is so cool.  So totally off topic, but highly recommended if you're  looking for something to do on July 3rd, if you're listening  today, which is a holiday, it's it's National Fried Clam Day.  So there you go.

Transcript:  My favorite.  There is a wonderful Rush documentary on Netflix.  If you haven't seen it time stand still that I really  enjoyed.  Oh really?  I'll download it.  Yeah.  Oh, I love yeah that you should watch on the plane.  Okay.  Yeah, that's really really good.  Wow.  We haven't done any tech news and then it's already we're  six minutes in.  This is my kind of show.  I love it.  Well, we're gonna because one of the stories probably our  biggest story of the week is that this is the week that Jeff  Bezos will step down as CEO of Amazon.  And you know, Andy Jassy will be taking over kind of he's  been a long time Amazon guy.  But the question in a lot of people's minds is can is Andy  going to bring to the table what Jeff Bezos unquestionably  which is Jeff Bezos brought the guy who wrote the everything  store and has a new book about Jeff Bezos did an opinion  piece in today's New York Times.  He calls it the Jeff Bezos paradox.  We're talking about Brad Stone and he says, let me see if  I could find the he says I've written two books including  the one you just read which I'm gonna ask you about chronicling  Amazon's history have come to the to view both the company's  never-ending expansion and declining reputation as by-products  of Mr. Bezos personality his towering intellect along with  a notable deficit of empathy and fear of stasis.  So those are the three kind of he says and this is a guy who  studied Bezos morning almost anybody his three kind of pillars  of his personality and of the company as a result brilliant  guy.  Nobody questions Amazon strategy has been perfect almost  perfect except for the fire phone but also as it's it's the  most becoming the most successful company when the most  successful companies in history.  It's also getting a lot of heat for its poor treatment of its  employees.  That's he says because of Bezos his own lack of empathy and  of maybe perhaps moving too fast or trying too many things  and that's Jeff's fear of stasis.  He that he wants it always day one is his kind of his saying  he never wants it to be the second day of a company.  It's always the first day of the company says day two is  stasis followed by irrelevance followed by excruciating  painful decline followed by death which seems a little  expensive Jeff talking not for that little extreme.  What do you think is that is that let me let me start with  you Brianna and then because Amy's read the book that we  have yet to read which is the new Amazon.  Do you think what do you think of Jeff Bezos says as the  head of Amazon?

Start time: 585.68
End time: 647.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, it's so hard because the political part of me is  kind of appalled by a lot of the way he treats workers,  right?  I saw this firsthand running for Congress the tech part of  me is really in admiration of the way he keeps pushing the  boundaries on what his company can be look at Amazon Prime  video when that came out.  I thought that was stupid.  I would bet you probably did too.  And now all these years later, it's like, you know, Apple is  doing this all these different things are doing a video  service.  Look at his plays in the video game industry every single  game Amazon has put out has been a financial disaster.  They've dumped tons of money into it.  It's gone nowhere, but that's that refusal to just sit still  and stack me.  I really really respect that.  So I think he's very much a man of contradictions and I  think that empathy quote it really comes through in looking  at the history of the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's going to be there'll be big shoes to fill though,  right?  Now one of the things that's kind of interesting as Jeff  Bezos steps away from Amazon Thursday, the company changed  its list of corporate values and added some things that  maybe Jeff Bezos would not have wanted to add the new  leadership principles.  This is from an article in Bloomberg by Matt Day a couple  of days ago the new leadership principles strive.  These are two new ones strive to be the Earth's best employer  and success and scale bring broad responsibility.  These two new principles require employees to take into  account the well-being of their co-workers and society beyond  the company's walls when making decisions.  Which is I think kind of interesting as Jeff Bezos steps  down suddenly they get some empathy you so you've read Amazon  and about Amy you were saying it's really good.

Start time: 710.74
End time: 715.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I have many many thoughts first of all, I've read excerpts  of it in the excerpts.

Start time: 715.86
End time: 718.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Brad you're taking it on vacation with you.

Start time: 718.10
End time: 719.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so Brad is such a good writer.

Start time: 720.42
End time: 739.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's phenomenal his first book the everything store was  really by the way Bezos and his wife hated his ex-wife hated  it.  Yeah, in fact Mackenzie famously put a very nasty review  on Amazon site of the everything store, but really the  nastiness came down to it was too accurate.

Start time: 740.50
End time: 804.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, listen Brad's a really good reporter.  He's a very good character-driven.  He's a very very good writer.  I've read excerpts of the book and I couldn't put it down.  So I decided to this is my treat for myself for vacation, but  good.  Sure.  Let me say just a couple of things.  So going back to what you said initially and what Brad says  in the op-ed, you know that Bezos is kind of the the intersecting  vector of intellect lack of empathy and fear of stasis is  Bezos but you know, I think you could say that of many many  many CEOs.  So my you know what I do for a living.  I'm a futurist, but I'm a management consultant and my company  advises the CEOs and the C-suites of enormous corporations  all over the world and governments and our elected people.  I would say that those three criteria also describe lots of  CEOs that I work with and a lot of them fear death.  A lot of them feel like they're running out of time.  Oh interesting.

Start time: 804.60
End time: 806.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you think that's a trait that makes you a good CEO?

Start time: 808.20
End time: 853.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I would say I don't know that it's mandatory, but I  would say that I do see this among lots of the executives  that we work with.  There's also another but what's what separates Jeff from everybody  else I think is the drive and he he has he invests himself in  thinking about the longer-term future and that that is difficult  to do because it takes courage to confront the future to imagine  yourself and your organization in the biggest possible terms  in the future and you know, the new principles I think are  pretty interesting but for totally different reasons the  word Earth is in there.  Did you notice that Leo?  It wasn't in previous ones, but they're now talking about the  planet.

Start time: 854.02
End time: 856.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's about climate change you think or?

Start time: 856.50
End time: 872.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I think that's about I think that's an overt announcement  of global expansion and pretty soon intergalactic maybe not  intergalactic but an expansion off-planet is what I think is  happening and one just last quick thing.

Start time: 872.50
End time: 875.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well Jeff because he runs Blue Origin is very much about

Start time: 876.08

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  space exploration right and the space economy.  There's you know, so we we FTI produces an annual tech trends  report and we did in 2021 this year's had it was a 12 volumes  anyways in the this is the volume that just deals with  technology trends having to do with health medical and  wearables Amazon is so doing so much in this space that we had  to to write an entire section about all of the different  things that Amazon's doing.  And my point is I think what is I think what makes the company  so prof interesting and Jeff such a profound leader is that  they are completely disrupting so many different industries  from pharmaceuticals to logistics to you know, you name  it.  And I and another way listen some of the the the human  rights the employee complaints, you know are are certainly  important and should be looked at.  I think we also need to to acknowledge that humanities  in this period of transmission at transition and also  transmission but transition where we're moving from people  doing things to people and machines doing things together  to machines and cognitive systems making decisions and  telling the humans what to do and pretty soon the humans  won't be in the loop anymore and collaborative robots will  will do a lot of that manual work for us.

Start time: 969.66
End time: 974.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So and we may look back and say Amazon started that all  with X Alexa.

Start time: 975.72
End time: 998.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it's certainly part of it.  But the but the other piece of this is all of the warehouse  technology, you know, Amazon's AWS automated the warehouses.  Oh, yeah.  Yes, but in.  So yes, but what is automated?  It's the decisions that otherwise would have been made  by people the humans are just labor humans are the robots.  That's right.  That's right.

Start time: 999.70
End time: 1068.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow.  That's a weird flip-flop.  By the way, I have all three hundred volumes of this.  I highly recommend the digital download, which is free to  everybody at the Future Today Institute website because I  can barely lift this.  I asked him.  Yeah, it's pretty big.  I had to run and get it and he kind of hands it to me with  his pinky.  But this is actually a great read really fantastic.  So well done.  Thank you on that.  And it was nice of you to divide it into chunks because I  don't think I could lift the whole the whole thing.  So let me read you.  This is the the one of the new principles that Amazon has now  adopted as of Thursday.  Quote, we are big.  We impact the world and we are far from perfect.  We must be humble and thoughtful about even the secondary  effects of our actions.  Our local communities planet planet and future generations  need us to be better every day.  That's actually lofty.  That's a great goal.  And it's an acknowledgement of how impactful Amazon is not  just in the US economy, but on the global economy.

Start time: 1069.80

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess I would find that more credible if they hadn't just  invested a ton of resources to squash a unionizing effort in  a way that I think a lot of other people found to be really  really concerning.  You know, I was thinking about what you were saying Amy, and  I think this is so interesting and I don't mean to get  political here.  But you know in the last few years, I think a lot of us have  thought about the trait of narcissism and a lack of empathy  in our leaders.  And I think we've seen the effects of that in high  government positions.  If you know, basis kind of has that as well and you're telling  me that's something that is a common occurrence that kind of  lack of empathy and the highest levels of leadership.  That's it makes sense to me like imagine everything you could  get done if you didn't have to to care about people or the  effects in your wake if that's something that's kind of a  congenital to these higher level positions.  I mean it explains a lot but I think it also it makes me  pessimistic that you know these lofty goals that they're going  to put in a marketing slogan might result in not squashing  unions.

Start time: 1140.56
End time: 1154.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it Amy the case that companies founders tend to be  more like that and that at some point in the natural evolution  of a business the founders are replaced by people who are a  little bit, I don't know more sedate.

Start time: 1156.80
End time: 1224.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I just back on what Brianna said so I would say narcissism  and lack of empathy are adjacently or or fagonally related  maybe but not necessarily the same thing.  You know, if you stop and think about and sort of reverse  engineer what it takes to build a company like Amazon or Tesla  or you know Apple pick any any company you want that's the  you know Facebook.  You know you you have to be willing to make great sacrifices  whether that's in your family or the relationships that that  you might have and if you reverse engineer, what would it  take to make that kind of a sacrifice right?  You would have to feel a little less than other people.  And so I think probably some of this must be qualities that  you're born with.  I think I think a lack of empathy would be probably  difficult to cultivate especially if the main goal of that  was to you know have an amazing company.

Start time: 1232.92
End time: 1287.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, you know, I'm not qualified in any way to  talk about people's personalities.  I can just tell you what I've observed based on all of the  work that I do with you know, these executives most of the  people that I work with at the highest levels of business  and government I would say have what you would expect which  is just unparalleled just unbridled drive which again you  it's you could try to cultivate that but you either you know,  you have it or you don't they have a fear of stasis and many  of them seem, you know when we've discussed it is a fear  of not having enough time to get accomplished what they  want to accomplish.  Obviously, they're very very smart and then there's this  other piece where they're willing to take risks or make  decisions that people who have just lots of an empathy may  not do.

Start time: 1288.10
End time: 1332.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is going to verge into the realm of armchair psychology  but Forbes had a piece a few years ago called the psychopathic  CEO and they quote a study that said, you know in the average  population about 1% of people are clinically psychopathic  roughly 4 to as high as 12% of CEOs are psychopathic 15% is  the rate found in prisons.  So there is some evidence that CEOs tend to have those traits  particularly lack of empathy and a and drive.  Yeah, and it makes sense just in the you know generalized  point of view.  Go ahead Brianna.

Start time: 1332.50
End time: 1371.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I was just gonna say, you know all three of us here have  exist in the startup world right like and I think a  commonality I see with people working in startups is a you  want to put your values into action right like you see  something in the world and it doesn't exist.  You want to create a company your way Leo here.  It's hard for me not to notice you.  I've never seen a show you've done.  You don't have an underrepresented group on I imagine that's  something you sit down and you're like we do these are our  values that that's your value.  Right for me the way I run rebellion.  There are certain values that I stick to same thing with my

Start time: 1375.88
End time: 1406.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So no, but my point is I don't think you can necessarily link  like the I mean maybe at the highest levels.  It gives you a certain edge because there is a human cost  especially on the labor side.  But I can just I can see that being a superpower where if you  just don't have to care about your workforce if you you know,  just care about market share and know at all cost I can just  I can see that being the factor that puts you over the top and  makes you win.

Start time: 1421.16

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it makes it makes perfect sense.  But again, my question is isn't that something that you see in  early stages of companies especially startups that doesn't  yeah, doesn't wear well in the long term and maybe Andy Jassy  coming along.  This is it and you know kind of a natural transition for Amazon  from the founder the you know, the kind of driven founder to  something more humane.

Start time: 1443.14
End time: 1481.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Andy was employee what number six or something.  He's early early days guy.  Right.  So I mean in most cases there's a number two who's been there  the entire time who is acting as a translator, you know, or  the connective tissue who understands the founder but also  understands humans.  You know, I think we see that at lots and lots of companies  again from like Tesla to you know, Sheryl Sandberg at Facebook.  I mean, I think I think we see that behind every incredibly  successful CEO is like an incredibly perceptive, you know,  is a person who knows how to connect that CEO and their vision  to the rest of the company.

There's a piece about him in the Wall Street Journal in which  they say he is people work closely with him describe him as  soft-spoken and approachable.  Some say he's more even keeled with employees than Mr.  Bezos.  He's detailed focused which psychopaths or I'm sorry CEOs  typical startup CEOs are often not so detailed focused.  In fact, that's one of the complaints that Brad Stone  mentions in his op-ed piece is that Bezos is always looking at  the next thing.  And so as a result the last thing kind of loses focus.  It doesn't matter anymore doesn't matter anymore in which  he says this is why maybe the Amazon store has become riddled  with fraud fraudulent reviews fraudulent sellers because it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  not I would argue that that's but that's not you know, there's  this is the problem.  There's the chief executive officer, which is what CEO  stands for and then there's the visionary person who's both  the leader and the founder and the lead idea generator.  You know, sometimes if you you don't have both skills and at  some point when you go beyond that vision then you need, you  need to have that chief executive in there and the chief  executive is a management an executive manager.

Start time: 1565.96
End time: 1581.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right.  So I think maybe for anybody who's listening the the insight  and the takeaway here is you know, if you're an entrepreneur  if you're somebody who's a founder, you know, it's probably  lessons to learn from both both groups of people from the  psychopaths and from the operators.

Start time: 1581.38
End time: 1604.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You need both.  Yeah, and Jobs was smart enough.  It looks like Jeff was smart enough to have a number two or  somebody around cultivate that person and cultivate that person  knowing that he's going to need an operations guy now and  someday perhaps to run it.  What is your experience Amy with the boards because Jeff Bezos  will continue as chairman of the board.  Yeah, how much operational influence will he have?

Start time: 1605.62
End time: 1666.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So again, you know a lot of these boards of directors.  They start to get nervous.  Well, they get nervous for all kinds of reasons.  I mean at some point Steve they didn't like Steve Jobs so much  they got nervous.  I was doing it.  They fired him.  Yeah, right.  So, you know, ultimately it's the the vision.  I think there's there's some belief that the vision can't be  replicated.  I mean, you know, it comes from that person and when that person  leaves some of that vision goes away you you know,  you need the vision and that's that's hard to replicate finding  an extraordinary CEO who is a an operator who's a manager who  can be who can work with that visionary and eventually take  over for them.  You know, there are many many more talented CEOs than there  are true visionaries.  So I think boards, you know, my hunch is Bezos isn't going  anywhere.  He's just he's just not doing the day to day.  He's going to space.  He's going yeah, which by the way if he were CEO and I were

What is it the 22nd and so Branson says I'm going into  space the 11th.  That is by the way another quintessential hallmark of these  high-end CEOs is their competitiveness.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean who the hell cares who's the first to go into space or  who has very famously the tallest yacht Larry Ellison  built a yacht with his mask just a little bit taller than  the number two guy.  In fact so much taller that he couldn't get it under the  Bay Bridge anymore.  But he wanted the tallest yacht.  Yeah, that's just dumb.  Absolutely.

Start time: 1727.64
End time: 1810.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I just want to say like no, thanks.  I just want to say we have this discussion a lot when you  know Steve Jobs sadly passed away and you know, obviously  Tim Cook took over and there were a lot of naysayers saying  you know, this is the end of Apple Tim Cook obviously had  much more of a background in logistics and there are people  asking if he was going to have the vision to keep the company  going Apple did several things.  They instituted Apple University to kind of codify the lessons  that they had learned under the Steve Jobs era to kind of  facilitate that kind of visionary leadership and what I  hear from a lot of my engineer friends that work at Apple is  it actually improved in the post job years because this  kind of tolerance for a holes.  It was just a lot.  I hope I could say that Leo Bay was just it was not as  far as I'm concerned.  It seems great.  It's the perfect word.  You know, I think in a lot of ways Apple and getting bigger  and a better and I think Amazon more than Apple is less  dependent on your product hits and more on a supply chain  like going into further and further markets.  So I think that is a more I don't want to diminish this  but it's a more fungible skill.  It's less dependent on like a Steve Jobs type.

Start time: 1810.34
End time: 1874.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I would disagree on that because I Amazon isn't a  product based company.  Whereas Apple is very much tied Apple is its products.  Amazon is very much not its traditional products.  Amazon is a enormous.  I mean Amazon is the invisible infrastructure now powering  enormous parts of everyday life that that range from you know,  huge parts of our economy to to logistics to you know,  web hosting to literally to pharmaceuticals and medicine  and and you know, I could go on and on so I'm I don't know.  I would be curious to know what's actually going on over  there.  I mean it's hard not to also look at the changeover at  Amazon in the same, you know, while also looking at some  personal decisions that Bezos made kind of sort around the  same time.  So, you know, we have these enormous tech companies.

So so yeah, but there's another piece of this which is the  world is quickly being divvied up by China and you know,  China is also making huge advancements in some of these  same areas and you know China under Xi Jinping is in the  process of a infrastructure land grab and literally just a  couple of days ago when when the CCP had its hundred-year  parade in Beijing, you know, she showed up in a Mao era style  suit like a great suit.  So he's making it.  Yeah, that's very very he's the fifth leader I think since  Mao and he is very clearly saying that, you know, they're  going to be more like wolves than sheep and aggressively  pursuing CCP ideas, which makes sense.  I mean he sees like a very short window of time.  So they're pushing pretty aggressively, you know, so I don't  know.  We'll have to see what shakes out with our company.

Start time: 1962.89

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did not see that.  Here's a picture of the 100th anniversary of the president  Xi in a Mao suit, which is not widely worn anymore in China,  but it is very important iconography for the Chinese people.  I when I was in Beijing some years ago, I went to Mao's tomb  and there's long hours and hours long lines of people from  all over the country coming to see Mao's body in that suit.  And so I think he despite the fact that he did some horrible  things in China killed millions of his citizens, but he still  revered I think by some and it's certainly significant that  Xi was wearing that suit.

Start time: 2005.72
End time: 2039.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, and that's like totally and there's so there's a  rise in nationalism.  People are very excited about Chinese companies in China and  Alibaba, you know, is one of those companies and it isn't we  do a ton of work overseas and Scandinavia and Western Europe  and you know all over, you know, and Alibaba is pushing hard  into some of these markets.  So again, I look at the new values statement from Amazon  and I'm seeing this a little bit less as a like a sustainability  goal and more like we're going to be more globally dominant,  you know outside of the US for example.

Well, but it starts it starts on Monday.  One of the things Amazon has done maybe maybe it's Jeff Bezos  last act has asked to have the brand new chair of the FTC Lena  Khan recuse herself over any antitrust actions against Amazon  because she's clearly biased says Amazon's attorney.  She's written many papers saying the big tech companies ought  to be broken up both as a professor and as an attorney.  I think it's a reasonable thing for Amazon to try.  I don't know if a judge will will back it up.  It's kind of an interesting way to fight this antitrust furor.

It sounds like it sounds like a like you said, employees.  It's a Hail Mary's right.  Yeah, I don't know how credible it is.  It's it's it seems like working the refs right.  Like you got to yell at the referees and you know, hope that  it helps more the calls go your way and they've shown that it  works.

Transcript:  I feel like you know, you can't know a lot about these things  and not have opinions about things and I think the better  question is can you be fair and you know everything I've  seen this does seem the Biden administration in general is  going to be a lot tougher on antitrust and anti-competitive  action, which I fully support and I think she's going to be  in that vein, but I think she'll I don't think she's going  to be underhanded.  You know, I think she'll be fine.

Transcript:  I hate them and I'm going to get them.  Yeah, although you could look at the EU Commissioner of  Margarita Vestahia and she clearly hates big American tech  companies so much.  So what was the latest thing she said?  Well, we don't you know, I'm not sure if what Amazon and Apple  are up to in protecting privacy.  I she said Apple's privacy protections might just be a way  of trying to become more dominant.  So I'm going to really have to look at this.  Wow, you know, it's like.  I have to say there you might have a case that she actually  has an axe to grind.  She's really already decided how the case will be decided.

Transcript:  I kind of love the fact that Europe's main contribution to  the future of technology at this point is regulations.  Yeah, I mean, you know, I can I can I offer a counterpoint to  like another way to do this?  So I was talking to some folks in the government of Dubai a  couple weeks ago and they were telling me that in Dubai's I  think everybody knows they're starting to test all different  types of drones that can carry different payloads.  So drones to take pictures drones to carry small packages  around and of course those ridiculous flying taxis drones  that would carry one or two people from from place to place.  And so as this technology is being developed and tested,  they've actually launched a beta testing group within the  government to pilot to like develop and pilot and beta test  policy, which is really really cool.  So basically what they're doing is as the tech is being  developed, there's a group of people who are thinking about  and trying to like beta test policy and they're talking to  each other rather than it being totally siloed.  So by the time that the technology is actually ready,  there's policy ready to go with it.  And it just seems like such a smart a really smart approach  hard one really really difficult but also like a much easier  path forward for everybody.

Transcript:  Yeah.  So here's the Margaret Marguerite.  I don't I got to get work on her name Marguerite Vestaiger.  She warned against warned Apple against using privacy and  security to limit competition.  Yeah, we wouldn't want that.  But you know, I mean she's right Apple is focusing on privacy  and security as a differentiator with other companies in tech  and yes, they would like to beat the competition by doing so  but I can't see any benefit to the EU penalizing them for  that.  Maybe other companies should do their best to improve privacy  and security too.

Start time: 2373.44
End time: 2406.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or maybe you sent them instead if you if you approach all of  this punitively then these companies are going to fight back  and ultimately what is the end goal you want better privacy  for people I would assume right and and so is there another  approach that doesn't result in years and years of protracted  legal arguing and I think there is is there a way to to you  know, in sent these companies to change their policies in a  way that everybody benefits that is a much more challenging  approach.  I think it's the smarter approach in the long term.

Start time: 2408.10
End time: 2474.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think I think all of us here, you know, we're hyper  educated on these tech issues.  I do want to say though I can understand how someone from the  outside would see some of Apple's stuff as anti-competitive  I do I just bought a very very top-of-the-line Windows  laptop this week.  It kills me that I cannot get my eye messages on that.  Yeah, all of us here all of us understand, you know, the  encryption and if they open that up to things like Windows,  it's just drastically less private.  It makes the entire ecosystem weaker.  We understand that but I can understand how regulator would  look at that fact and the fact that Apple music it's much more  difficult to use it on Windows laptop and a lot of that lock-in  I think there's a discussion you can have there.  So I think again it comes back to can you trust these regulators  to be fair and then ultimately like what is the legal  environment that they're working in or the laws going to  be fair and you know, I personally fall on the side where  I I have faith in that.

Start time: 2474.99
End time: 2506.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right.  Now you're forcing me to be fair to Margaret the Vestager and  point out that her this response was in Apple said look  we can't allow sideloading in our store because it would hurt  privacy and security.  And she says no, I'm not against privacy and security, but  I want to make sure that that's the real reason they're doing  it not as an anti-competitive move there to feel you know,  they're they're hiding behind privacy and security as a  shield to allow them to be monopolistic and I guess that's  not unreasonable.  So I apologize.  I agree.  Don't it please don't investigate me.

Transcript:  Yeah, the public beta came out this week.  I've been playing with it.  You know on the iPad it really is nice and I they've fixed  up the multitasking.  They've added some nice features Apple is really good and  I hate them for this at making you want to live entirely in  the ecosystem.  That's the whole point of not putting iMessages on Android  or Windows.  That's the whole point of adding features that work only  as long as you have a Mac and iPad and iPhone.  So then for instance notes Apple's notes app which comes  with all three devices now as a nice feature you could swipe  up from the corner and add a note to a web page the next  time you go to the web page that note is available.  That is a great feature.  That's kind of cool.  Yeah, I'm going to use that a lot and I'm kind of a reason  I'm very aware hyper aware of it is I'm into note-taking  apps.  I have the weird fetish looking for the best note-taking app  and it's going to make me mad if there are features in Apple's  notes, which is not the best note-taking app, but that I  want in all of my apps.  And the similarly you're going to be able to drag this is  wild.  But if you have an iMac or a Mac desktop with a iPad you  can drag a folder from one to the other just by dragging it  with the mouse over to the next screen.  These are things Apple does very well and ecosystem plays  that Apple does very well that make it very attractive  and to people like you to both of you who are in hybrid  universes.  I don't know if you're you're you're not getting the worst  of both worlds.

I had slowly gotten not used to how much I was giving up  being on all 100% Apple.  You know, I'm one of the people that around 2007 I kind of  discovered the Mac and just went all in, you know now with  Unreal Engine 5 coming out and really wanting to learn.  There's a good example.  Yeah, I've spent a lot of time, you know, like working in  Windows now.  I just bought this, you know, this is a razor blade Apple

But my point is like I was talking to Christina about  this, you know, I feel like for people like us we do like  to play with things and tinker and what I found spending  more time in Windows lately is there's this joyous experience  of tweaking things and downloading whatever I want that  I've really just kind of it's like I've shut that part of  my brain off and then you know, they introduce the M1 chip  and you give it up a little bit more and then you know,  you give up unsigned apps and I've just I think I've come  to the point where I really feel like I need both machines  like one to do my fun, you know, experimental play stuff  with and then an Apple device for you know consuming stuff  for having a phone, you know, doing that kind of stuff  where it's very secure and predictable and easy to use  but you know, very very locked down.

But but some of these central challenges still still persist  and I think beyond just like being able to open up a  document which is harder than it should be still these are  communication devices.  They should we should be able to communicate the same way  on all of them, you know, I have plenty of friends with  iPhone.  So no, I don't use messenger on my my Android but I can run  a system, you know, I can sort of couple together and make  things work.

Transcript:  what I'm saying is I'm wondering if some of the concerns  that that regulators are talking about and people who are  funneling up the pipeline if what they're really talking  about is their frustration around interoperability and not  always just and I mean some of this is clearly anti  competitiveness, but I think there's a lot of it that is

Start time: 2921.54
End time: 3012.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  definitely not about interoperability.  I mean look at you know, one of the things like Amazon  Facebook have a real tendency to gobble up any competitor  that's out there.  That's not like a data transfer issue.  That's a it's a monopoly issue.  And I also have to say there's a you know, every time you  do that you are you're opening up privacy issues, right?  Like something that I think many people have thought about  is opening up all the Facebook data to competitors so you  could have more people using that data and allow Facebook  competitors to come along that also would be a privacy  apocalypse just to give you a really specific example, you  know rebellion pack is making a really big data play right  now.  We are getting in and using hyper micro targeting in a way  that just political people don't have a way to do it hyper  micro targeting.  So let me give you a very specific love it.  Yeah.  Okay.  We have the voter file over here so I can go and find people  that just registered to vote in order to vote Trump out of  office and I can find people that based on their location  data have spent a lot of time in hospitals or health care or  read articles on how to file for bankruptcy and then I can  show them ads on universal health care.  That's how targeted it is like that's so much information  the voting information is public record.  How do you get that to pay a ton for that?

Transcript:  Yeah.  The FTC did vote this week to expand their enforcement  powers 3 to 2 along party lines to repeal a statement  policy policy statement from 2015 that said they couldn't  challenge unfair.  Now, I don't know why in 2015 they agreed to this that they  couldn't challenge unfair methods of competition.  If they don't violate existing antitrust laws, so I guess  the Commission said look there's got to be a law against  it before we can investigate it or challenge it.  I guess.  Lena Khan, this is one of her first actions as chair of the  FTC said the 2015 statement doubled down in the agency's  long-standing failure to investigate and pursue unfair  methods of competition.  The guidance only hindered the agency's enforcement efforts.  Certainly definitely a statement by the FTC.  No, no, we're going to start getting much more active.  This is the same FTC, of course, that allowed Facebook to  buy Instagram and WhatsApp without any noise and is now  saying well, they shouldn't have been able to and Facebook  quite rightly saying well, you let us get you can't unwind  that you gave us permission.

Transcript:  this was an Obama era guidance.  However, so I don't know.  I don't know.  FTC did have a successful action this week against Broadcom.  They had accused Broadcom of monopolizing the market for  semiconductor components.  There is a consent decree and Qualcomm has without admitting  guilt, of course agreed to a settlement.  So they had been charges were filed or at least the FTC had  voted to file charges and now Broadcom said, okay, let's  let's work this out.  They've settled in October with the European Commission.  What was Broadcom doing?  This is is this 5G?  Is it wireless?

They made long-term agreements with at least 10 OEMs that  make set-top boxes and broadband devices preventing those  OEMs from buying chips from anybody else.  You can't do that.  And they got caught and so they're not going to be allowed  to do that any further.  Broadcom used to be an American company, but I think it is  no longer American.  I feel like I remember that they were bought by a Chinese  company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think this kind of access to chips, it's just going to it's  going to get to be more and more of a problem.  And I think you can expect these monopsies that companies  like Apple create.  I think you can expect it to be under further and further  scrutiny moving forward.  I mean the reason you know, Leo, you know, I love to collect  old cars and every single one of my collectible cars is worth  a ton of money right now because the used market is so  hot because you can't buy new cars with the chip shortage.  So, you know, I think more equal access to the to the things  you use to to build a high technology.  I think very correctly that should be under more scrutiny.

The reason they're calling it the new Shepard is because it's  essentially paralleling Alan Shepard's flight, which is the  first manned space flight the US attempted and all he did was  go up and then come back down.

I've listened to it probably 20 or 30 times every single one  of the books in the series quite a few of them to right.  Yeah, that's long.  They're eight of them and they're not short at all.  But he writes in a way that you really it's one of those  books.  You have to read twice to understand it and that first  series that first season I'm telling you I know that book  backwards and forwards and I'm just like people are going to  bounce off this.

And actually I have to say that I've said this a few times  the DOJ investigation of Microsoft on late 90s turned  Microsoft into a better company as a result and they have  under satya nadella pivoted in such a way that I think they're  very strong company much more than stronger than they had any  right to believe.  You know, they were turning into the next IBM and instead  they've actually shown that they've they've got a future.  They might be the next Apple.  Go ahead.  Yeah.

I thought I'm going to see anchors of ink over this stupidity  and then it'll be done and instead Microsoft decided, you  know, they said hold my beer.  We can really make a problem here.  We're going to say you can't use it with a processor is as  little as two years old and oh by the way, you have to have  TPM 2.0 and then all the people who are about ready to say I  don't want Windows 11.  I'm going to stick with Windows 10 because that's the usual  refrain when a new version of Windows comes out instead got  to wine.  I can't get Windows 11.  I want it talk.  I think this is brilliant marketing on Microsoft's part.  They made people want something that they were prepared to  hate.

If you don't know this is HDR is a photography technique  that oversaturates and undersaturates an image and for  post-processing and game engines.  You can do that same kind of process is not actually that  expensive and Microsoft is enabling auto HDR.

I've dug into the API myself to learn how it works, but I can  say the results of it are stunning.  The processor overhead from my own experimentation with these  kinds of post HDR processes.  It's not terrible and it's like a lot of I wouldn't say home  runs, but a whole lot of doubles that they announced with  Windows 11 to have me really excited for it.  Let's see.

Transcript:  Yeah.  That actually I have to agree with you the the course all  the controversy is about Microsoft's seemingly arbitrary  requirements for compatibility.  You know, I think it's their right to do this Apple does this  every time right this they just so and I think the unsaid  supposition is that they're doing this to sell PCs to get to  help the PC industry sell more PCs to require you if you  want to use it by a new PC, but I always buy a new PC  versus what a phone upgrade no versus so PC industry by  the way had a great year last year in 20.  That's what I'm saying.

Maybe because they're getting to work from home.  I don't know, but I think there was some concern the PC  industry would see a big dip and that the supposition was  well Microsoft's going to juke it by offering a new version  of Windows traditionally in the Windows world.  That's how you get the next version of Windows.  You don't upgrade Windows 10 broke that mold but prior to  Windows 10 you just use Windows until you got the new computer  and then you make use the next whatever it came with people

It's not what's up.  Yeah.  So I mean, yeah, so if that's the case then every one of  your you know, we're moving into this sort of BYO bring  your own device.  That's right.  You know, so that has helped.  Unexpectedly I think that's gonna.  Yep, right and that will probably continue as people sort  of sort out and figure out where they're going to be but on  the other side of that, you know, if I was a see-saw right  now, I would be hair on fire trying to figure out what I'm  going to do for security because you know, what's the  over-under on your employee patching firmware or whatever's  updating their router, you know, I mean, oh, I completely agree

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  with you.  I think that in the long run the only thing that went wrong  with the Windows 11 launch was PR and that Microsoft's, you  know, not handled it.  Well, the communication has been poor.  I think they'll probably solve this by changing the requirements  over time and I don't think it's going to end up being a  long-term black mark, but I think the PR was terrible on  this.  Now, let's talk about security because there's a lot of stories  there and go ahead finish the finish.  No, no, no, go ahead Leo.  So big supply chain attack just announced the are evil  ransomware gang has taken over the case a VSA because say  is cloud-based MSP platform a lot of managed service  providers use it MSPs.  We use an MSP.  If you're a smaller company, you don't have a full-time IT  staff.  You might use a managed service provider to do your IT a lot  of them use caseya, which is a patch management management  client monitoring platform caseya has been compromised and  as a result the fear is so have thousands of MSPs all using  caseya.  Huntress Labs, John Hammond told Lawrence Abrams a bleak  keeping computer.  We're tracking 20 MSPs where caseya was used to encrypt over  1000 businesses rent with ransomware and are working in  close collaboration with six of them.  The biggest so far looks to be a Swedish supermarket chain  called coupe.  They've closed 800 stores in Sweden.  Look at this.  This is a great sign.  I T problem.  There is something that goes that's cross cross-barriers  cross-language barriers.  I can't read the rest of it, but I T problem.  I understand ransomware has shut them down.  They can't take payments.  They're cash registers stop working.  So the close stories had to close.  They're hoping they can reopen tomorrow.  But this is going to be a net.  This is another nasty one and supply chain is very tough.  Solar winds is also a supply chain attack.

Transcript:  But did you know I was just I was just going to say, you  know, this is ransomware in general.  It's been really really really bad lately.  There was a story that came out this week about Russia actually  going through and brute force it trying old-school brute force  attacks to get passwords on various companies in the in the  in the energy sector.  You know, this was Fancy Bear doing it, which is a part of  the GRU.  You know, if I could buy stock in ransomware continuing to  devastate companies, I would do that because it's almost  certainly going to happen.  You know, it's it's such a difficult problem to solve to  because like here in Massachusetts, we had a company  that shut down because three foreign nationals came in  interned for the company and stole the entire code base and  left and thousands of people lost their job because of that.  You've got attacks from the inside.  You've got attacks from the outside for nation states.  You've got problems not updating software like with like  with Equifax where they didn't run an Apache update.  I mean, this is it's such a massive problem to solve and  the thing is it the pipeline to address this is so astonishingly  inconvenient for everyone and it's it's it's just going to  get worse from here.

Start time: 5057.78

Transcript:  What's really I think the part here that's so challenging is  that so so we've all lots of people have been talking about  the need for digital transformation, which is like a  gobbledygook ridiculous jarkony made-up phrase.  But essentially what that means is like you got to automate  your stuff, you know, like stop using paper records.  You got to digitize got to put yourself in the cloud, you  know, use security all that stuff and Leo as you mentioned  at the top, you know small to mid-sized businesses.  They can't hire a full-time, you know, IT person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So right and so what's smart about, you know, from a hacker's  point of view attacking that MSP, you know and targeting  all these tiny businesses a lot of these places don't have  cash in the bank.  They don't have runway.  So if you target, you know, thousands tens of thousands  hundreds of thousands of tiny little businesses, you know,  a lot of them are going to do whatever they have to do in  order to get back online so they can keep working.  So it's a really thing that that, you know, they've done but  also kind of a unfortunately, it's a it's a vulnerability.

Start time: 5151.00
End time: 5190.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's that's the issue.  I wrote about this in my last book.  So it's a big nine.  Right.  The one of the big challenges we face going forward is that  we don't have a definition for warfare outside the realms  that we've currently defined it.  So if you've got a nation state attack, you know, that is  targeting bits and pieces of our technological and economic  infrastructure and you are in some way creating wreaking  economic havoc on parts of our society, you know, that does  cripple us in some way.  It makes us weaker as a nation, but we don't currently define  that type of attack as a, you know, as warfare.

Transcript:  I think we do.  And, you know, another thing, this may be a controversial  opinion, but, you know, you don't expect yourself to defend,  you know, I don't need to defend Massachusetts from external  attack. I do think there's a role for the Pentagon to play  here and maybe we need to subsidize certain systems to  give small business access to basic cybersecurity tools.  That would be a very good investment, I think, as far as  being a subsidy.  I think it's time to really think about this holistically  because it's about our economy.  It's about our ability to function.  It's about our schools, our hospitals, our privacy.  There's clearly a national security interest here.

Start time: 5268.58
End time: 5290.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think there's also an issue though, because I would say  Russia is a failed state or close to and as a result, they  have less to lose.  I think we might be able to go to China, Amy, and say, look,  we won't attack your infrastructure if you don't attack ours.  But Russia at this point is punching up and they don't have  much to lose, right?

Start time: 5290.74
End time: 5319.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they have a lot more to lose.  Putin is also not quite as strong of a leader.  And then the pantheon of autocrats, Putin is standing on  slightly shakier ground than Xi Jinping.  So, you know, I would say trying to cut some kind of a  Cold War era deal.  But, you know, mutually assured destruction, but make it code.  That's interesting.

So the mob is over there conducting a lot of, it's like  one of the most profitable sectors in Russia is the Russian  mob will go out and get a young coder and, you know, will do  all these cryptocurrency schemes.  So, you know, it's really hard to negotiate with the mob.  Well, that's my point.  Like they are, we are constrained by rules of warfare and  largely they are not.  And, you know, I think that's where something like a Geneva  convention for code could be very helpful.

Start time: 5367.90
End time: 5597.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, unless they don't play the game.  They don't play along.  Microsoft has a zero day that's actively being exploited in  its Windows print spooler.  Somebody, some way, some security firm has named this  print nightmare, saying for published, unfortunately, the  proof of code accidentally.  It's been, it was immediately forked and as a result, the  code is out there resulting in multiple zero day vulnerabilities  in the Windows print spooler service.  Sang for was going to show it at black hat, but once the proof  of code got out, they immediately ran over and said,  uh, whoops, whoops.  The vulnerability allows attackers to use remote code  execution through the print spooler.  You can remotely install programs, modify data, create  new accounts with full admin rights.  The vulnerability exists in all versions of Windows.  Not clear though, if it's exploitable beyond server versions of  Windows.  So this is another one where your MSP is going to have to  come on over.  And there are some mitigations mostly which involve taking  your print spooler offline.  I don't know if that's a long-term fix.  That's add that to the zero day with the Western digital  the drives and now you've got a lot of fun going on my book  live.  This is one that might make an interesting movie.  At first we thought that the reason that owners of this  already out of date, I mean, and they stopped selling it in  2015, stopped supporting it in 2015 network attached storage  device had a flaw that was exposed in 2018.  We thought this was the flaw being used to erase these  drives.  Many many users said that their data had been completely  erased after a reset of the drive.  Then it turns out maybe it wasn't that there was a remote  code execution flaw zero day.  Nevertheless, Western Digital is not patching these there.  Their fix is take your drive offline.  Now there's a problem in the my cloud OS 3.0 firmware which  may affect many many more devices.  Western Digital's solution to that is you need to upgrade to  OS 5.  Some say yeah, but that's a complete rewrite with lots of  functionality missing.  So there's kind of a mess maybe get a different manufacturer  for your NAS very interesting story.  Dan Gooden had a good breakdown of it on ours Technica.  But just an example of you know, an IOT device that is not  being patched is a recipe for disaster.  It's just going to happen.  It's just going to happen.  Apps with 5.8 million downloads on Google Play stole users  Facebook passwords nine apps that and this is something you  should just be aware of the apps did actually work.  They actually unusually they actually did things like photo  editing and framing exercise and training horoscopes removing  junk files.  But at some point the apps offered users an option to log  into their Facebook account in order to disable ads.  They saw a genuine Facebook login, but the Trojans used a  mechanism to steal that login.  So unfortunately 5.8 million people downloaded those apps  like processing photo app lock keep rubbish cleaner horoscope  daily horoscope pie app lock manager lock it master in wealth  fitness and pip photo do not give them your Facebook credentials

But I think a lot of them are you know Microsoft does which  I really like is a single sign on with its authenticator.  It'll say, okay, I'm firing up authenticator.  Give me click the button that says this number they give you  four buttons you click it and the logins done.

They've got probable cause they've got a good reason to  use facial recognition.  There's actually oversight with it where that use of facial  recognition has to go into place where the public can review  additionally, it shuts down a lot of the a lot of the tricks  that they had used to kind of skirt this by maybe someone  in Maine law enforcement would call up a friend in Massachusetts  and say hey, can you run this search for me and it basically  shuts that exactly down.  So I do worry about like a federated state-by-state approach  for this but it seems to have good stuff in it as best as

A court has allowed a lawsuit against Apple to go ahead using  Illinois's protections.  So this has been very effective.  In fact, we all kind of I think owe a little debt of gratitude  to Illinois because that was a very forward-thinking law and  we've all benefited because of course nobody nobody wants to  do business in everywhere except Illinois.  Six Flags America is 36 million dollars settlement over the  parks use of finger scan entry gates.  So it's been very effective very effective.

I was calling Rick Ron DeSantis past this was a by the way,  the Republican Florida legislature was, you know,  overwhelmingly in favor of this.  It's the state can find large social media companies a quarter  million dollars a day if they remove an account of a statewide  political candidate $25,000 a day if they're moving account  of someone running for local office.  Obviously, this is a response to Twitter and Facebook  deplatforming the former president.  But on the face of it, it violates a couple of important  precepts in federal law one being the First Amendment the  the other being regulation the states cannot regulate  interstate commerce.  The US District Judge granted a preliminary injunction  stopping the new law from being enforced the day before it  was to take effect on Thursday.  Now it's a preliminary injunction.  So suit will go ahead and but it seems unlikely that this  will and I don't think the intent ever was to have it be  a law because it did exempt anybody who owned an amusement  park, which I think Disney is a pretty big important company  in Florida.  I might be wrong.  So the Loon Law was aimed at social media businesses and made  exemptions for Disney and their apps by including the the  provision that theme park owners would not be subject to.

I don't know if it worked but the problem with that, of  course for those who just want a little explication is you  can't you can change a lot of things, but you can't change  your face.  You can't change your thumb.  And so you're giving them biometric information that is  permanent and if they don't keep track of that database that  could be problematic.

And the governor said we are disappointed by Judge Hinkle's  ruling and disagree with his determination that the US  Constitution protects Big Tech's censorship of certain individuals  and content for others.  They're going to appeal to the 11th Circuit, which will also  throw it out instantly.  Qualcomm is working on an M1 competitor.  So you talked about how oh, you know that Apple M1 is very  compelling Intel doesn't have anything like it.  Qualcomm's CEO, their new CEO, Christiano Amon says no, we're  going to work on a chip that will compete with the M1.

Tried it on my iPad Pro with an M1 chip in it and it was  stuttering like crazy.  I was trying to play Sea of Thieves.  It was just unacceptable, but I'm hoping xCloud will get  better.  Stadia was pretty decent.  I played Cyberpunk on it and it was the only way I could play  Cyberpunk and it was pretty decent.  It wasn't as good as a console or PC would be, but it was  if you have a device like an iPad, at least you could play  those games, right?

Transcript:  Yeah, I just I feel like for Apple and for Microsoft rather  to really compete with things like the M1, the issue is the  latency, right?  Like you were talking earlier at Leo about people.  They're angry that they're only supporting devices that are  roughly two years old.  That's great to have a lot of that, but by chopping off like  the end of it, you can move forward and you can make the  UI more responsive because the layer is thinner and I just  I think I want to see Microsoft be more aggressive with some  of their products in that way to really truly compete.

So do you have faith in that relationship  enough to invest hundreds of thousands of dollars,  literally?  I can say for the studio we're thinking about, no.  I personally would not do that.  What's really interesting when I'm trying to figure out  is the actual game development pipeline,  like some of the things like the number of tries  you see up close for some things in Unreal Engine.  How do you take that and put that in a viable Unreal Engine  pipeline?  Is it just an LOD trick?  That's all the things that we're trying to figure out right now.

When I first saw this, your AI pair programmer,  I thought it said your O pair programmer.  I thought, wow, that would be an interesting O pair.  No, the idea is as you're writing something,  your pair programming, normally pair programming  is two programmers in the same editor working together.  In this case, copilot is an artificial intelligence  watching you work, making suggestions for code  you might want to use.  So it's clippy.  It's clippy without the annoying,  I see you're writing a log in sequence.  Would you like?  Apparently it will.  But already people are saying, hold on there.  This is one tweet I saw from Armin Roenacher.  He says, I don't want to say anything,  but that's not the right license, Mr. Copilot.  He's actually, Copilot is typing in a hack  for square roots from Quake.  Wow.

There is a profane comment in this fast inverse square root  routine where the guy offers a constant in hex.  And the comment is, what the F?

Some of these things should be easy to do,  things like repetitive code.  It'll have autofill, just like Excel does, basically.  Tests without the toil, it'll automatically  write test code for you, which is a good thing, right?  That's good.  Yeah.  Want to evaluate a few different approaches?  Copilot could show you a list of solutions.  But where is the description of where the training set is?  Is that what you're asking, Amy?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It looks like here the training set is public code and text  on the internet.

Transcript:  I feel like I'm less pessimistic.  I would like to try this and see if it's  giving you useful suggestions.  The way pair programming works is you write something,  and then maybe someone sitting next to you  sees a way to do it in fewer cycles, right?  Like lightly refactoring it.  If it's more of that, I could see it being useful.  If it's just pasting in garbage, maybe a little bit less useful.  But I think it's interesting.  It's certainly a technology I would like to see us start  developing.

Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, I love the idea.  OpenAI is doing some interesting things.  They said that they've trained this on publicly available data.  And they can say that means it's considered fair use.  So you can reuse this code because it's fair use.  It's been trained on a selection of English language  and source code from publicly available sources,  including code in public repositories on GitHub.  By the way, if you have a free account on GitHub,  your repositories are generally public.  That doesn't make it open source.  That doesn't mean it's licensed.  So I don't know.  It's interesting.  It's interesting.  You know, I would say don't use it whole cloth.  But maybe if you get an insight from it,  then you can write your own code around it.  Who owns the code GitHub Copilot helps me write?  GitHub, this is from their frequently asked questions.  Copilot is a tool, like a compiler or a pen.  The suggestions Copilot generates and the code  you write with its help belong to you.  And you are responsible for it.  We recommend that you carefully test it.

Start time: 6874.24
End time: 6882.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

I mean, I think if it's not looking at what you're writing  and adding that, like using it to train itself to figure out  what's useful or what's not useful,  that would be giving up the biggest tool it  has to refine itself.  So obviously, I would assume your code is going to go into it  and help it train.  So that's just an assumption on my part.  That would give me serious pause.

Bagram Airfield has now been completely given back  to the Afghanis.  But apparently, the airmen there played a lot of Pokemon Go.  And you can, by doing some location shifting,  go look at the various gyms.  Here's the Air Force Gym at Bagram Airfield.  It was hit by mortar fire later.  There are still Pokemon gyms that  are held by servicemen that are no longer there.  Bagram once had a thriving Pokemon Go community of troops,  contractors, and civilians who played the game while exercising  and after work.  US Army Specialist Cory Olson, an electrical technician  for attack helicopters, who played the game with his buds  from his shop in 2019, says, we weren't expecting Pokemon  Go to be thriving in Bagram.  And yet it was.  And by the way, if you play Pokemon Go in Afghanistan,  you're going to catch some monsters you  can't get in the United States.  Here is a Pokemon guarding location much longer  than they normally would, because nobody else is playing  anymore.  So you can be down to two health points  and still just be sitting there.  Nobody's taking over the gyms.  I've got to get my wife to go over there.  She's always looking for gyms that are abandoned.

So we were at the bookstore, a bookstore yesterday,  and the clerk says, oh, I like your key chain.  It's a Pokeball.  And Lisa says, oh, that's no key chain.  That's an actual Pokeball.  I'm playing Pokemon Go.  Yes.  The clerk thought that was super cool.  One last story, then we're going to wrap it up  for the 4th of July weekend, which is coming strong.  I hope there's some hot dogs and hamburgers on the grill.  Tim Berners-Lee, as you know, offered  an NFT for his source code for the World Wide Web.  It has been sold.  The final bid, $5.4 million.  Unidentified buyer, he sold it at Esotheby's.  The opening bid was $1,000 back in June 23.  There were a flurry of bids in the closing minutes.  Profits go towards causes chosen by Sir Tim and his wife.  You would get a time stamped file of the source code,  an animated video of the code being written,  a letter from Sir Tim, and a digital poster of the cold.  Whoever bought it probably didn't buy it to make money on it,  but just to support his causes.  But he should be aware there is an HTML error in the code  as written.  Apparently, when they made the animation,  it encoded some of the HTML, left bracket, right bracket,  as ampersand LT and ampersand GT.  The poster has been corrected and apparently they fixed the animation.  I don't know.  The question now is, did the NFT that you bought,  does that have the error in it?  Because they can't change it now.  So, I don't know.  If it was, actually they can't change it once the NFT is created,  you know, then that freezes it.  It's immutable.  It's immutable.  So, it's my guess that that error will be in there.

Start time: 7291.76
End time: 7299.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do and I haven't woken up to an actual alarm in months.  So I'm up at 540 every morning.  So the software...

Start time: 7299.84
End time: 7320.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the whole idea of these mattresses, 8sleep.com, spell that, is it lets you control the temperature in the mattress.  And it has heating and cooling coils.  So the software, you're saying the software Amy says, okay, when you want to go to sleep and it cools the mattress and then when you want to wake up and it heats it up.

Start time: 7320.14

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it gives you a bunch of other metrics like what your REM cycles were, what your respiration is, what your heartbeat is, makes suggestions about how to get more restful sleep.  It's actually up until this...  I'm sure they're going to fix whatever the problem was.  And actually they would be a good advertiser for this show because I'm sure everybody listening is...  I know.

Start time: 7346.14
End time: 7355.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I didn't.  No, we just have a cover.  That's a lot more affordable, I'm sure.  It is.  And if you've got a mattress that you really love, you don't need the whole thing.  Holy cow.  Huh.  I have a cat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I have mine set to plus eight.  I don't know what the actual temperature is, but I think it's around 115.  115 degrees.  Okay.

Start time: 7400.73
End time: 7406.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's eight above your body temperature.  It's not about making you so uncomfortable.  Oh, you do get hot.

Start time: 7406.62
End time: 7429.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no, no, no.  I get so uncomfortable that I don't know the...  It might be 120.  I don't know.  But no, no, it's like you want to be up because you're...  It's too hot.  Yeah, but you wake up and you're like, I'm awake, I'm ready, I'm well rested, versus  jolting awake to an alarm clock when your body's not quite...  You haven't gradually come out of your sleep yet.

Start time: 7429.18
End time: 7435.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Start time: 7449.72
End time: 7461.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Bose makes headphones that you can sleep in.  I have those.  Those ridiculous earbuds that make sound.  Yeah.  I also use those.  I work with brown noise during the day and I sleep with pink noise at night.

Start time: 7462.63
End time: 7525.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, I found the trick.  The way I hacked my insomnia, because Amy, I'm exactly like you, I just have fought it  for years, is I found out if I get an audiobook that I really, really, really know well, like  something I've read so many times, I kind of can guess what the next sentence is going  to be.  Like The Expanse, yes.  Like The Expanse.  This is why I've listened to it so much.  What I do is I crack an audible file.  I hope I can say that on here.  I own it legally.  And then turn it into an mp3 and I put it on an iPod touch.  And then I get earbuds and I listen to this novel again and again all night long.  And the way that reason the hack works is because when you get busy brain at like three  in the morning, it's because you're thinking like, oh, I've got to do this tomorrow.  I've got to do this tomorrow.  I've got to do this tomorrow.  But if it's a story you've listened to a ton, then you can kind of follow it.  But you can also drift off and just start thinking about random things.  And this has been the magic bullet for me, Insomnia.  I think that's like a linguistic...

Start time: 7526.78
End time: 7531.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I don't want to miss anything.  So I love that idea.  Listen to something you already heard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Start time: 7533.80
End time: 7551.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like linguistic counting, right?  Like counting sheep, you mean?  Right.  Most people who count already know how to count.  You already know sequentially what's coming next.  Right.  It's reducing the processing power.  And when you're focused on a single thing, all of the chatter gets quiet.

Transcript:  There you go.  Hey, Leo, before we go, can I ask you one last question?  Yes.  So have you NFT'd?  I have never NFT'd.

Start time: 7573.22
End time: 7592.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are you going to?  Never going to.  No?  John dug up a bunch of old recordings.  He said, you know, we could turn these into NFTs.  You know, the first Twitter, me exploding my ball or whatever.  I just...  It feels a little scammy to me.  So I didn't...  Why do you want to know?  Do you want to make an NFT?

Start time: 7593.67
End time: 7597.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I was just curious.  It feels a little, you know, of the moment.

Start time: 7597.41
End time: 7662.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a little of the moment.  Yeah.  Actually, funny you should say that because  remember when Kevin was immersing himself in liquid nitrogen or something?  Yeah.  That was a big fad, right?  A friend of mine just rented a space in Marin that was a former cryo facility.  And they just left.  They left 250 bath robes, all the tanks, everything.  Just they skipped out.  It was over.  The whole fad is gone.  And I think Marin...  This is not a thing.  People aren't freezing themselves anymore?  I think Marin is at Bellwether for the future of cryo tech, cryo fitness.  Oh my goodness.  Actually, Ms. Futurist, how about this one?  I'm wondering, we've been talking about this a lot in the family.  Vatgrown Meat, there is a Israeli company about...  That is looking for FDA approval to start growing meat in bioreactors.  FuturMeat is talking with US regulators to start offering its products in restaurants  by the end of next year.  Cellular Meat.

Start time: 7663.61
End time: 7753.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, this is actually kind of awesome.  It is not the same thing as a plant-based burger that you would get from Impossible.  So this is meat cultured from the...  So it shares genetic material with the original animal.  So whether that's a chicken or a salmon or beef.  And rather than it growing in an energy-intensive, resource-intensive,  oftentimes incredibly inhumane space, instead it's...  It's just a vat.  It's brewed in a bioreactor.  And chicken nuggets have already gone on sale.  In Singapore, you can get a chicken nugget.  That's right.  So it is chicken meat, but it never had a heartbeat.  It never came from an actual animal.  I will probably get in a lot of trouble for saying this on your show,  but I'm going to do it anyways.  In the books that I just wrote, there are scenario chapters in the middle  to describe what does the future of synthetic biology,  which is what we're talking about, look like.  And I wanted to write a scenario set in the 2030s  that had to do with how we will brew our food  rather than growing it on a traditional farm.  And so that chapter is called Akira Gold's Weird Eat 2032.  And it's a restaurant guide.  It's a restaurant guide.  And it rates the best bioreactors and the best molecular whiskies.

Start time: 7763.66
End time: 7775.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Plus, if you just grew undifferentiated chicken muscle cells,  it's not that.  That wouldn't be any good.  I mean, meat has to have more than just the same cells.

Start time: 7782.66
End time: 7805.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but you can program that, right?  So you could genetically engineer marbling.  You can?  That's the question.  You can. You will be able to.  And it's plausible, Leo, that 10 years from now,  the freshest sushi that you can get will not necessarily be flown in from Japan.  No, we're overfishing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're killing our oceans.  That's right.  Cows are terrible for the environment.  That's right.  But we want to eat meat, so this might be great.  By the way, guess who the big investors are in future meat?  Tyson Foods,  Archer Daniels Midland,  big meat producers.  They see the future.

Start time: 7827.00
End time: 7846.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And again, this future can't come fast enough as far as I'm concerned.  And I just want to say one quick thing, because people start to get squeamish  and they conflate this science with GMO and genetically modified organisms,  which we heard a lot about in the 90s, became highly, highly politicized.

Start time: 7846.78
End time: 7848.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I hope you're debunking that in the book as well.

Start time: 7849.10
End time: 7895.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I absolutely am.  And we have to keep our minds open here because we're not going to make it alone  on our own in the current conditions we have on this planet.  And quite frankly, as exciting as it is that Bezos and Branson and Musk  and everybody's lining up to go into space,  I mean, how plausible is it that we're going to lift everybody off this planet  onto another one and somehow escape all of our problems?  We're not going to.  So we have to come up with much more sophisticated solutions and synthetic biology.  And what you're talking about, which is meat, cellular meat grown in a bioreactor,  brood in a bioreactor is something we ought to celebrate and be excited about.

End time: 7939.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, we'll have you out. Let's do a special triangulation when it comes out  because I would really love to spend some time.  It's all about things like mRNA and CRISPR and all of the things that we're doing.  Are we about to experience an elbow, a hockey stick, a revolution in biotech?

Start time: 7940.62
End time: 8025.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. Yes, we are.  So there's trillions of dollars invested in the bioeconomy.  The best way to sort of understand where we are right now is if you remember the story of Watson being on stage  and like making the very first or Alexander Graham Bell being on the stage and making the first telephone call.  In Chickering Hall in New York and people watching this exchange and thinking it was some kind of hoax  and they demanded to go behind the stage to see what was happening, to see the magical genie or whatever.  And when they realized it was real, it completely blew up everybody's mental model for what it meant to talk to each other.  And today there is no way to create a valuation for telecommunications.  It is, right? It's a basic technology. It's a fundamental part of our economy.  We're at the Chickering Hall stage of synthetic biology, which means that you're going to start to see significant development over the next decade.  Some of that is investment, but some of that is just compute.  We finally have the machines that we need and now a proven business case and a use case  because MNRA, the messenger RNA that's in Moderna and Vizor BioNTech was in development for 10 years for a different purpose.  But that is synth bio.

I agree with you.  And, you know, something I learned running for office is you really under, you have no idea how bad a lot of political operatives are and their levels of technological literacy.  I think we're starting to learn.  So, I don't know if I agree with that actually, from what I see.  So for what Rebellion is doing, we actually just, it's almost like a seed round.  We're working on a really exciting, we have a major donor that got involved in letting us do a bunch of stuff with a really big data play to start using these really advanced analytics for political messaging and basically getting voters out to show up.  That's the hundred million dollar question.  And, yeah, I feel like if we don't seriously figure this out, I have real fears about the country.  So if you want to support us, you can do that by going to helptherebellion.com.

When we were trying to figure out what we should do for the 3rd of July, special Saturday edition of Twitter, I said, look, just get Amy and Brianna on and my job will be very easy.  You two are amazing.  So smart, so interesting.  Thank you so much for spending this Saturday with me.  I appreciate it.  Thank you.  Thanks for having us.  Great to have you.  We do Twitter normally on a Sunday afternoon.  In fact, we'll be back on our Sunday afternoon schedule starting next week.  2.30 p.m. Pacific, 5.30 Eastern, 21.30 UTC.  You can watch us do it live.  There's a live stream, audio or video at Twitter.tv.  If you're watching live, chat live at IRC.twit.tv.  Club Twitter members are also chatting live in our Discord.  That's another place you can go.  We sometimes take comments and questions from our Discord stage.  We have lots of great conversations all day, all night.  And of course, ad free versions of the show, Twitter.tv slash club Twitter.  After the fact, on demand versions of every show we do, including this one, are available in a number of places.  You can also subscribe to our YouTube channel.  You can watch the shows there.  Not in 8K, I'm sorry to say, but not even in 4K.  But 720p, okay?  There's not that much to see anyway.
