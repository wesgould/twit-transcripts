This is a last week, but are two weeks ago, but  So the December 14th Thursday and I'm looking at the things that says fan event and I thought oh crap  I hope I could see the movie. I realized I might have bought tickets to some event as opposed to the actual movie  So we get there says their movie they guess there's no no, there's no movie  You know what what he said now kidding of course you get to see the movie. In fact was your first disappointment  They showed because they the director Rian Johnson came on and said you're seeing it, you know  You're the first people to see it aside from the famous people who've already seen it  And I'm thrilled that you're here to see it and we made a special featurette on John Williams and the music of Star Wars  Which is great  That and then we started the movie and the projector died about 10 minutes into it and everybody's going that is so harsh  But fortunately they started up again and started the movie at the beginning again  So we got okay a double dose of the first 10 minutes. Did you catch anything that you miss?  Yeah, actually a lot come to come to think of it  So it's worth seeing a couple of times at least the first 10 minutes and then this died again halfway through and they rewound it  But they didn't rewind it to the beginning, but they were a little bit. It was fun  It was good it kept Patrick Dillahand who was in line to see the next show  Waiting for an extra 15 in the cold in the cold. No, he was in the lobby

End time: 442.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Spoilers the Star Wars spoilers cause more angst than anything else.

I was talking to Lisa. She said yeah, this is what we do now the week before Christmas  Star Wars, they know that she's a bigger fan than you are actually that's the big story at the end of the year is that  Disney has now acquired episode four. Oh and the rest of Fox but  But I think they bought it just because they only they didn't own all the Star Wars movies the first Star Wars movies still on

End time: 589.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Samuel Jackson returns  Never mind. It's a it's it's worth seeing but let's what we were gonna do today. I think is  Go through the year and talk about the big stories of the year and each of you have different perspectives  About the stories of the year. So I'd love to hear what you think we could start in January  By the way for me the big change happened December  2016 when I got my surface studio  Changed the way you podcast it and this was the for this all year. I got to do the twit with this giant touchscreen  Computer and I have to say  It's not necessarily the computer everybody should buy in their home  $3,000 starting price and father Robert had to soup it up with better drives because they put terrible drives in it  But for what I do sitting here at this table, it's  Telestrating and everything. Yeah, this is amazing and it gets out of the way  It's it's you know kind of lies flat. So this was for me the year of the surface studio

Start time: 590.44
End time: 631.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like that story just because this was one of the surprises and every once in a while we get this out of Microsoft where  People were saying this is the design I would expect to see from Apple not from Microsoft  And in fact that was the comet that you you had in several stories saying the the Apple Microsoft crossover  Where you've got a design that's so beautiful. They weren't so focused on the specs which Microsoft typically does instead  They wanted to give a good experience and this was an excellent experience as you mentioned Leo  It's not on every one computer unless you're an artist or a podcaster  It's it's not the best device for you  But it did show people that there's a couple of things going on at Redmond that we don't know about that

Start time: 631.68
End time: 669.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Might actually blow us away. I think it's safe to say that 2017 was the year Mike the new of the new Microsoft  That Microsoft really emerged doing things that the old Microsoft would never have done partnering with  Linux for its bring  You know they they released laptops for the first time ever the surface laptop surface book came out the year before but  Surface book 2 came out this year. They their hardware has gotten better and better effect  Yeah, I think it's an interesting a new company. Of course Microsoft released the creators update the fall creator the spring creators update  early in the year  I think it was a good year for Microsoft overall. Absolutely

Start time: 670.14
End time: 709.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean a big part of that is kind of undoing this legacy thinking right around how they run their business  Also, you know like it seems throughout the year. They've kind of relinquished their their kind of clinging to  Their mobile efforts and and allowing themselves to be okay with the fact  Being okay with the fact that they can be a software company on some of these other platforms and that's okay  They're doing they're doing that really well. I know at least on Android there  Their apps are really impressive anytime they come out with a new app. I'm very curious to see it  They're doing it right same for iOS effect

Start time: 709.64
End time: 712.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Arguably the best apps on iOS and Android come from Microsoft

Start time: 712.85
End time: 735.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely  And I'm gonna push back a little bit on the creators update because I don't know that there was that much for creators  Like I think there was a lot of funny me  Yeah  I mean there was a lot of promise that I don't know  If they really delivered on like I haven't heard of a lot of people saying, you know  This is a great operating system for me as a creator  Like I still do think that Mac owns that in a lot of ways

Start time: 735.96
End time: 757.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How much of that was though in response to Apple and Apple's kind of falling away from the the the pro  Market, I think pros were in fact, we're gonna have a story in March Apple  Actually apologized for making such a hash of the Mac Pro  I wonder if Microsoft's looked at the turmoil among Apple users and said here's an opportunity

Start time: 757.54
End time: 801.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sure they have looked at that and but I don't know if they've delivered a better solution to people yet  And I mean you know, so this is great for podcasters, but I think it's really just great for the way Leo podcasts  You know way that someone would use this but I don't know I mean I think I tried so hard to  To use the Surface Book instead of the MacBook and I just couldn't there's just that's interesting  Yeah, I mean I really wanted to I just wanted to to get used to something else  Just to know another operating system. I always go back to that and maybe it's muscle memory  I don't know  But yes, I do think this is beautifully designed except for this dinky pen like this is still an ugly pen and it falls

Start time: 801.94
End time: 806.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I'm actually with Megan on that  You know what would make that pen much better if you had to recharge it by sticking it into a USB

Start time: 807.76
End time: 812.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would be fantastic. And you know, why did Microsoft make it magnetic stick to the side of the monitor?

Start time: 814.42
End time: 818.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It always I stick my the Surface Book and then pen always falls off and I lose it

Start time: 819.32
End time: 840.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It does tend to fall off the Surface Book. It's better for a desktop where you're not gonna be shaking it around and so  Yeah, no, I  Look Microsoft's not perfect. In fact that surface had a lot of woes in 2016 by 2017  I think it had settled down a little bit and I do think I think this  What what it what it is is a story that you don't see much in technology, which is a company

Start time: 841.60
End time: 871.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Coming back from the dead, right and Apple's done a really good job over the years  I think we could all agree  Kind of hedging their bets on the fact that not only are they creating?  Devices that they say are fit for the people that are using it  You're really made for the user  But they also create very beautiful devices devices that you're proud to let's say pull out of your pocket and show to people  I feel like this was a year where Microsoft really kind of their laptops in the yeah  Kind of met Apple  You should be proud to use this and for people to see it. It's a beautiful piece of hardware

Start time: 872.42
End time: 906.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's funny when we go back to January 2017 there were Apple was having trouble Apple had a down quarter  People were thinking it's Apple's gonna struggle Apple said we're gonna cut back iPhone production by 10% in January  Saying you know  The demand is off and there was this kind of sense that Apple might have been stumbling for the first time ever  We can look back in hindsight and say that was completely wrong  Oh us it also began the the year-long rumor  Fest about what was gonna be in the iPhone the new iPhone. We didn't know it was gonna be called the iPhone 10

Start time: 908.94
End time: 917.00

End time: 952.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Ellen, you know, she goes up into the audience  And she goes up in the audience and asked people for stuff and she started asking for an iPhone X  Yeah, and everybody and when Ellen says it's the iPhone X  I think that that carries a lot of weight Apple's gonna might have some regrets over their naming scheme  Let's go back to the beginning of  2017 it began as all years do with CES and CES  Was really at least in our recounting and I looked back at the old episodes all about Amazon's echo  Was this the year of the echo in many ways?

Start time: 952.86
End time: 992.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I feel like it might have been if you had stopped the year after CES  That's what you would have assumed because it had gotten to that point where you had put the Amazon voice assistant into literally  Literally everything you could walk around it was in refrigerators. It was in dryers. It was in speakers. It was in headphones  I saw a  Amazon voice assistant enabled pen  And you know once you get to that that craze where it's no we just want to throw this in there you think okay  I guess this is the trend for the year. I  Oddly it didn't shape up that way. I mean yes, it's it's big. It's important  It's it's a it's a large ecosystem, but after CES the buzz just started dying off you went to see yes

Start time: 992.56
End time: 1010.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 1024.66
End time: 1028.12

Transcript:  Oh  Don't push it again. No, there's no stop button unfortunately there we go. Oh, thank God. I'm sorry I did that  What else was it?  Do you remember anything else at CES that what's funny is we never do this and I wish we would once in a while  Look at CES and say all this stuff they announced was gonna happen in 2017 what happened that didn't right?

Start time: 1048.76
End time: 1072.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You saw sort of the strengthening of the high-resolution TVs  So 4k was definitely a thing, but they actually started looking at 5k and 8k  In even a 10 and 11k just for prototype  And it was interesting because yeah, they looked nice on the source material that they created specifically for that  But you had the same thought as you wandered that hall saying who makes anything close to 8k 10k 11k

Start time: 1073.52
End time: 1091.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Resolution source material it's just never gonna happen, but that happens every time they announce a new technology  I remember when HD came out there was no HD content when 4k came out there was no 4k comment right right this was  For sure the year that 4k hit big 4k hit big, but it wasn't really the 4k

Start time: 1092.64
End time: 1108.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was something that came along with the newer 4k TVs. I know where you're going and that was HDR high dynamic  Oh my goodness  Because look we've gone through the the high definition craze and yeah that helps it makes it look better  We've gone through the 3e craze which I think that was a stupid.

It'll make it 50% darker right yeah  That doesn't and it was real real d which is the worst of the bunch  I just really please just we they killed it in TVs this year. Let's kill it in movies next year  Can we make a pack to do that no more?  Let everyone know more 3d, but I agree with you HDR is fantastic

Start time: 1155.84
End time: 1183.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When you see HDR for the first time and especially if you see side by side like the same material and standard  But then in HDR you you say okay that I want that actually does make a difference that that makes it look better that makes  Fantastic it makes it pop it gives me a representation that I did not think was possible and for me  More than Alexa the HDR was the story of CES  It just didn't get reported that much because people still don't really have a way to describe it unless you're looking at it

Start time: 1184.06
End time: 1224.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Netflix came out with some really strong HDR content including stranger things too boy  That sure looked good if you could see those blacks those dark dark blacks  There was some scenes in it, which I am convinced they shot intentionally for HDR  I don't know spoilers again, but there's a scene that repeats several times  Where 11 is in a very very dark a black room, but there's a spotlighted figure in that you remember that scene  That shows up several times and it shows HDR because the dark is rich velvety very very dark no macro blocking no errors  Perfect and then the stuff that's illuminated is very very bright and that requires HDR to really do well

That's a thing  I think a lot of people discovered with blue bottle the fresher the beans the better the coffee when you place your order online  The beans are roasted within 48 hours and delivered directly to you  So they're practically still warm out of the roaster and when you grind those fresh roasted beans and you smell that amazing  Coffee aroma you realize yeah, I don't want any more stale beans.

Transcript:  Although a new year's subscription to blue bottle might be a great way to start the year. We just got a new one. This is  Ethiopia, Hambela, a state buku and then each one has a card  This is the subscription by the way twice a month. You'll get a amazing fresh coffee. You do want it twice a month  It's only 10 ounces. I think or 12 ounces twice a month  You don't want to buy like all your coffee at the beginning of the month and have it be stale by the end  This is it. Okay. I'll read to you the description on these cards. It's kind of like remember the  Peterman catalog on Seinfeld  In Ethiopia's coffee lands, Hambela a state supports its community of workers and their family with uncommon devotion  In this specialty world, Hambela's exemplary washed and natural coffees have set new standards for the famed guji zone  The estate grows its own cherry, but it also outsources from surrounding neighborhoods  The buku is one such coffee named for the farmers in the buku neighborhood who contribute ruby red cherry  Dry processing often makes for round syrupy and unctuous coffee  This one however reveals such delicacy and clarity both the senses and the mind exclaim with delight  This is the best one. Okay, so that's the details. Here's the digression  If the coffee were a tone wood, the kind of wood that carries sound waves well  Then the indigenous arabica trees of buku would play windblown songs all year round  I want to be the person who writes these. I know. I can have so much fun with this. I know.  Blueberry, vanilla, and coriander seed, but that's not the one we're drinking. We're drinking, so I don't know what the notes are  I lost the card for this one. The Mexico Oaxaca, but it's good. Now you're smart. You're drinking it black  But I have to say the coffees of Blue Bottle are so rich and delicious  Add a little cream. It's okay. It's okay. You don't drink with cream? I don't. No. I don't. I don't drink with cream  It's okay. You don't drink with cream? I don't. No. I don't. You know what? I, when I drink my Blue Bottle, I'm going to admit a shameful thing

I don't know. Who would do that? What?  Well, but you know if you buy a lot of cheap coffee grinders, that basically is what you're doing. They have the blades that spin around just like a blender. That is not how you do it. You need a burr grinder  And I think, did you get a burr grinder? No. We have one here you can look at. Okay. Grind your, bring your coffee in, grind it and bring it home. Okay, okay. That's what I had done. And then drink it the very next morning  I just hit it with the robin of it. We actually have a very fancy burr grinder here. I have ground my beans here and then I thought it took too long and it was so I don't know. I bet you the store grinder is a burr grinder but then you can't get the blue bottle.

Transcript:  I have never before seen uniformly positive comments on YouTube. Not one nasty comment.  I think that would actually break the YouTube.  It's like everybody was nice about it.  Anyway, this was also at the beginning of the year you remember that President Trump newly inaugurated told the National Park Service to get off Twitter.  And that created as a result alt Park Service and then a bunch of alt Twitter accounts.  And they're they're everywhere alt everything.  In fact, this was the year Twitter became politicized.  President Trump tweets there.  The resistance tweets there.  And this was I think very good for Twitter.  This made Twitter's year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well it certainly raised the public knowledge that there is a company that exists called Twitter that you can communicate on.  Did it really materially change how the company was doing though?  You would think that in any other time if the president of the United States of America is using a service or a thing so frequently and for so much important important communication.  He's even said that.  That's how I communicate.  That's how he was able to kind of bypass, let's say the mainstream media to get the voice out to the people directly.  But even in all of that, you still kind of got the feeling that like Twitter was missing out on an opportunity.  Like how do you turn that kind of attention, that kind of exposure into wow, Twitter's doing amazing now because the president of the United States is on board.

Start time: 2011.42
End time: 2026.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that didn't happen.  That's always been the bane of Twitter, though, because yes, this got the more traffic.  This got the more mindshare.  There's no one on the planet who no one who any longer says, well, what's Twitter?  However, Twitter's big problem has always been how do we monetize that?  We really have no idea how to monetize it.

Transcript:  I have to say, if you look at the stock price, Twitter was in the basement at the beginning of the year.  Their stock price was $16.30.  They stayed low right through May, but started to improve and a gradual uptick and they're now at $22.  So, you know, I think that you can say that in net, this was a good year for Twitter.  You know, a 40 percent overall gain stock price, at least it's one way.  Biz Stone also came back in the spring.  He said, I'm one of the founders.  I'm coming back to Twitter.  It needs my help.  I don't know if he made any difference.  Towards the end of the year, Twitter did make rules that they have been gradually enforcing over the last few months.

Start time: 2068.48

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Twitter's almost been forced to address certain things that, you know, certain minor things.  Or I don't know if it's minor to say, you know, the jump from 140 characters to 280 characters.  But they were forced to look at a number of different elements of the service that I think up until then, it was easy for them to just bypass, not address at all.  And now, you know, they're doing things like, you know, cracking down on who they give the verified tag to.  Is that seen as some sort of an endorsement of that person or is it merely just, you know, verifying that that person is who it is?  Are they cracking down on the content?  The messages that are being delivered and where they've had a very firm First Amendment free speech stance on this in the past.  They've been forced to make a lot of do a lot of soul searching, I think.

Transcript:  It was also the month, January 2017, that Vine died.  But funny thing is that Twitter killed it and said, we're going to make a Twitter video.  All the benefit, though, went to YouTube.  Vine stars who took their act like Jake and his brother, who took their act from Vine.  Logan. I don't I don't like to think about that.  Jake and Logan, you know that. Is that because your kids? Yes.  They watch Jake and Logan. Oh, a lot.  Because they're in the top 10. They make millions. Yeah.

I got to know anybody over 25 has no idea who any of these.  Yeah, there's a point of which you're 25 until you have teenage kids where you're totally out of the loop.

They were they were pissed and they and they went to a what is essentially a different medium because Vine was what?  Six seconds. How long was Vine? I can't remember. Six seconds.  They went to YouTube and started doing longer form video, but they took their fan base to YouTube.  And that is a lesson that every million subscribers.  Yeah. No, they're doing great.

Transcript:  There's there's too many Twitter moments for me to pick a favorite.  But I will say that one of my favorite things throughout 2017 that involves Twitter is my own personal discovery and infatuation with the moments functionality.  This was the year where I got I understood why moments existed.  And now it's become a daily part of my ritual.  It's it's almost it's almost part of how I first check in on on what's happening, which is exactly why it exists.  I have yet to do that. I mean, I remember when they announced it.  That was more than a year ago.

I don't know if I'm necessarily going to like political news sites as frequently as it was at least earlier in the year.

Transcript:  Clearly, the me too hashtag was a big part of Twitter late in the year.  Absolutely. In fact, you know, Time magazine picked the true what they call the truth speakers, the truth tellers as their person of the year and all year long.  And it started with Susan Fowler's memo.  What month was that? That was February.

Start time: 2428.44
End time: 2459.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  February. I just read it.  And it's amazing to read it now in light of what has happened since then, because I feel like there was I mean, I remember reading it and thinking, gosh, this is amazing that she was able to say this, that she was brave enough to write all of these things about a company that she had worked for in an industry that she's I mean, she's very young, like that she hopes to stay.  And I was like, wow, this is really amazing and unique.  And now it's so common.

Transcript:  And it was so risky, as you say, at the time, but it started the whole conversation.  It toppled Travis Kalanick, the CEO of the Uber was forced to resign or at least step back and become a board member only.  And it did, I think, open the doors for others to come forward and talk about their experiences.  And it eventually became an avalanche that took down CEOs, VCs, producers, people all over in every industry.  And it's not over, by the way.  It seems to be escalating.

Transcript:  When you read this certain paragraphs of this where she you know, she went to HR and said, here's this engineer that I'm working with, who has sent me these text messages that are very inappropriate, implying that like he's in an open marriage and basically asking to have sex with her.  And so she went to HR had screenshots of the text messages.  And they said, I'm sorry, but here are your two choices.  You can either switch teams and go somewhere else or you can just stay there.  He's probably going to write you a bad review.  And, you know, that's that's that's your only two choices, which is amazing.  And basically they were saying this engineer at Uber is so important that we are going to keep him.  And then when you compare him to like Harvey Weinstein or, you know, you know, keep naming him Garrison Keillor, like any of the people that you would think are very important.  Matt Lauer, like now we have a zero tolerance policy for all of that stuff.  And that's just amazing to me.  And I do think that she opened the door to all of that.  I mean, of course, you know, Jody Cantor from the New York Times who did the Weinstein story, she might have been influenced by that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, very much so.  I have to think, though, that a lot of this and there's no it's no accident that it happened a month after Trump was elected, that a lot of this is.  Stimulated by the fact that another person has been accused of this by 20 women is in the White House and we can't see people can't seem to do anything about that.  And so it almost feels like the frustration that women felt with that has now created this movement.  And who knows where this will end.  And I wouldn't be at all surprised if it didn't end at the White House or at least get to the White House.  Maybe it won't ever end.  But but I think men are listening.  And that's the that's the really good news.  I think it's going to make a big difference.

Transcript:  There's an important corollary here.  If you if you wind back to the start of the year and even to the end of 2016, part of this narrative, it's the anti me to narrative was, well, look at all these people who are having their lives ruined by these unjust accusations.  Fake news.  That was that was actually the narrative.  That's what people were saying.  They're saying, look, these these this new generation of leadership coming in, they're going to get rid of that.  And this was a pushback saying, no, no, no, you get your facts right.  If anything, we're underreporting.  If anything, people are getting away with things that that normal, decent folks shouldn't be able to get away with.  So in a sense, this movement was the counter to that movement, which was a counter to a previous moment.  So you've got this pendulum swing back and forth.  It's just right now.  People are so shocked that that pendulum had swung so, so far to the side of of the perpetrators.  And now it's going to swing all the way back.

Because prior to that and who knows their intention of coming out ahead of something is that to beat a story that might come out.  And so it's still a very self-serving move.  Or is it a true look inward to say, wow, you know, this is really opened my eyes and I want to learn.  I want to move forward.

Transcript:  There was a hysterical article I think was last week in Gizmodo.  The 2017 was the year of the bad apology.  Yeah.  And there were a lot of there were a lot of them.  A lot of them came out of the Me Too movement.  People who didn't apologize, the non apology apology.  They mentioned Robert Scoble's very bad blog post.  I would say he was might have been one of the worst.

Transcript:  I still don't understand how that actually happened.  Like how Mark Zuckerberg actually ended up in a virtualized environment over the top of this stuff.  Because you have to have you have to imagine.  I'm sure we could all agree.  Facebook in terms of companies that have money to have smart people to think through these things and prevent bad PR situations must have seen something.

Transcript:  I was at OC4.  I was at OC4 and I could kind of see how it came about because the first step would have been what if we were able to show people what it actually looked like down there.  So we set up some 360 cams and people could actually put on their their VR headsets and see.  That's a good idea.  That actually does promote empathy.  But then I'm sure they had someone in the marketing team saying, hey, oh, by the way, at OC4, we're releasing this new feature that allows people to come in as avatars.  And they said, OK, well, as long as we're going to be doing that first step, why not do the second step?  No one thought, wow, putting cartoon avatars over scenes of devastation may be not a good idea.  Yeah.  So it was one of these was a good idea at first.  Right. And then just what did it evolve to or devolve to?

Because Chelsea Manning was sentenced was commuted last one of the last acts, President Obama, before he left office commuted the sentence of Chelsea Manning.  And I think this was a little controversial.  People said, well, but Chelsea Manning was a traitor, released information to WikiLeaks about U.S. military operations.  She had served a significant amount of time.  The sentence was not overturned.  It was commuted.  Right.  Time served in effect.  And let's see.  I think that OK, now we can move on to February.  Only 11 more months to go.  Now we'll move quickly.  We'll move more quickly.  February began the drumbeat of rumors about the next iPhone and Ming-Chi Kuo in February.  And I want to give him credit.  I said Apple will make a glass iPhone with wireless charging, will not include a wireless charger in the box.  All of that was true.  Then we saw a lot of rumors about wireless charging at a distance.  Remember the company?  I can't remember its name that said, oh, no, you're going to be able to sit across the room and your phone charge wirelessly.  I have to say, I want to take credit.  At the time, I said, yes, that's not possible.  And in fact, never did come out.  That's next year.  But we did have Scoble on the show.  And remember, he said and made a bet with me that Apple would release a clear iPhone at the end of the year.

Transcript:  No, I don't know.  The only bet I have.  This is, again, an example of me not making bets.  Well, I said I'd take him to dinner at the restaurant of his choice.  He chose Paris.  Thank you, Robert.  But I forgot to give him a consequence.  So maybe the consequence was that his own natural consequence, his own natural consequence, something you were covering.  I'm sure Jason on all about Android Razor bought next bit and killed the Robin phone.  We liked the Robin phone.

Start time: 2942.38
End time: 2987.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the Robin phone was a was a very interesting and unique phone.  I'm not sure it necessarily stood up to the test of time.  Ron Richards, of course, had one and it's the battery started going bad on it pretty quickly.  The design of it razor kind of coming in and what we saw later in the years with the razor phone, you know, kind of co-opted a lot of the design notes.  The kind of like boxy, strangely boxy yet sometimes curved design of the next bit Robin with the razor phone razor really wanted to have a gaming phone.  And so that's kind of what led led to that.  But I'm not sure any of Robin's kind of cloud cloud management, dynamic cloud management that would make it so that you know storage under device was a moot point going forward.  I don't think any of that good idea, bad implementation.

Start time: 2987.94
End time: 3082.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And in fact, that idea has really been co-opted by progressive Web apps.  Google talked about it at Google I.O. in the spring this year.  And now Google and Microsoft both are all in on the idea that you would go to a website on your mobile device.  The website would be specially designed to download assets to your phone.  The phone would have service workers that could keep the app working even when the phone was offline.  The only company that's not all in on this is is Apple.  Ironically, Apple was the first to do a web store that was web apps.  But now with HTML 5, I think progressive I'm bullish on progressive Web apps.  You write one app.  It looks like a website, kind of works like an HTML 5 website, but it becomes a mobile app when people visit it.  And it's completely cross platform.  One app runs everywhere that HTML 5 will run.  To me seems very interesting.  And I think so that's in a way I want to give Robin credit for the right idea, the wrong implementation.  Yeah, absolutely.  And of course, Razer resurrected in a way they bought.  They bought.  Oh, yeah, they bought.  Next bit.  Oh, yeah.  Remember, oh, yeah.  The Android games machine and the designers from those two companies went on to make the Razer phone, which came out late in the year.  Congress did us a favor.  A solid.  A solid.  That's the word I was looking for.  Thank you.  Now we're even.  Congress did us a solid by saying, no, you know, email that's older than six months still needs a search warrant.  Until February of this year that anybody could look at your email because six months old was deemed abandoned.

Transcript:  Abandoned.  But they they overturned that.  Thank goodness.  And, you know, you know why Congress, the only reason Congress does something like that is because they realized their old email would also be vulnerable.  And they said, we better protect that.  It wasn't for us.  PewDiePie did his Nazi videos.  Was that February?  It was in February.  And parts of this year seem like it was just yesterday.  I know YouTube dumped him from their ad, you know, their high end ad network, which ended up costing him about 15, 20 percent of his revenue.  He's still in the top 10 at the end of the year.

Start time: 3116.68

Transcript:  Yeah.  Although YouTube did kind of come around and, you know, reckon with that and passed the last, I would say, half of the year.  Kind of change a lot of their policies around what of their content they would allow ads to appear in front of.  And part of that actually, I feel like goes directly back to everything that happened with PewDiePie.  That was the moment where I think as a parent, that was the moment where I realized, you know, PewDiePie is known by very, very many kids.  But I don't watch all of his videos.  And he's just one example.  Like how what is the filter here other than me watching every second of everything that my kids watch?  Maybe we need to be careful with this YouTube thing, at least be more aware of what's happening.

Start time: 3192.68
End time: 3218.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, of course, late in the year, in the fall, we learned about these weird kids programmatically created kids videos on YouTube using keywords to automatically generate animated shorts that in many ways would be horrific.  But the kids would see because it was even on YouTube kids because the algorithm would offer it as the next video and the kid just mashes a nonverbal kids.  Kids under two would mash it and see the next video.

End time: 3265.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was just the natural progression from what we had seen on the platform in 2015 through 2017.  It was people gaming.  Exactly. That's how PewDiePie built up his empire.  He would pick up a germane topic or two and build something that was kind of maybe loosely associated with it.  Then he would get that traffic in addition to his regular customers.  Well, OK, if why don't we just skip the content side and now I'm just going to game the search optimization and the screenshot.  And I will count on the fact that the people who are watching this aren't developed enough to actually know that this is not what they want.  Because it's a kid with a tablet that's auto playing to the next video and the next video and the next video.  And it worked.

Transcript:  This was the first year and I predict next year.  Twenty eighteen will be a big year for us seeing the failure of programmatic in general recommendation engines, programmatic ad sales.  Of course, Russia used rubles famously to buy ads on Facebook.  Nobody's paying attention. It's all automatic.  These programmatic videos on YouTube.  People started to wake up that the algorithm isn't your friend necessarily and can allow some really bad behavior.

Transcript:  And it comes back to the bottom line of these companies.  Like they claim to have humans curating this, but they don't.  I mean, not even in YouTube kids, which they're selling to kids like they you're right.

Start time: 3307.62
End time: 3343.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The algorithm is failing us and they need to hire people on both YouTube and Facebook said, oh, we're going to hire 10,000 more people.  I don't think that's enough.  I don't think you're going to drop in the bucket.  And you nailed it. It's their business model.  They can't really abandon it.  There's not enough humans in the world to make it really human moderated.  Even the app store, even Apple has kind of acknowledged towards the end of the year.  They said no more templated apps.  That's an acknowledgement that our human review process is not good enough that we can't catch the bad apps.  So we're going to have to make rules that block a lot of good apps in order to block some bad apps.

Transcript:  But no one like Susan Wojcicki at YouTube didn't go into this thing like, hey, let's figure out how to monetize really, you know, nightmarish videos and sell them to kids.  You know, but they did say we can do this because we're going to use the algorithm and we're going to depend on the technology.  And we're not going to really think about how given the opportunity, there will be people that will do the worst thing possible with the technology.  But now here they are. And what are they going to do?

Transcript:  Not too long ago, even even at this table with guests we've had here who are very good at what they do, they all agreed, hey, we trust the algorithm more than we trust people.  That was that was the tagline. Right. I mean, the algorithm, it's cold. It's calculating.  Maybe you tweak it a little bit, but the algorithm is always going to give us more unbiased results.  Google's a big believer in that.  Google's a huge believer in it.  And this is the year where we started realizing, hey, you know what, that algorithm, it's only unbiased as long as people don't figure out how to game it.  And unfortunately, we've gotten very good at gaming.

Transcript:  Kevin Rose learned that and dig years ago and it killed the business.  But we still, you know, I think there's a reason we don't learn that lesson.  And P.S. Chaps in our chat room said, you can't abandon the algorithm.  It's our it's the only way you can handle it at scale.  That is true.  Two billion users on Facebook.  No, I remember the phone company at the turn of the century, last century, the phone company used human operators.  And at one point, somebody at AT&T said, if we if we can get you to grow at this rate, all the women in the world will be employed as operators by the year 1950.  So they had to solve it. They came up with electronic switching.  But I don't you know, I think we have the same situation now.  And I don't know if there's a better way.  Maybe make the I think the problem is Google and other technologists always think, oh, but we can make the algorithm better.

Start time: 3452.64
End time: 3482.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah, that's at the core of what they do as a company.  Right. We know that we have the money to buy to basically hire the very best, smartest thinkers in technology.  And those thinkers build things that make our easier for us to make money.  They're smart enough to think about all these things.  There always seems to be a little little way around it.  And there's also the myth that algorithms in and of themselves aren't biased because, well, quite frankly, they're built by humans.  So there is a certain level of bias built into them.

He saw in his tiny community, his online community that he created in 1999 or 2000.  These are like, and Kevin saw it too in Dig.  We all saw this. You saw it too at Leoville.  You see when communities can fail in certain ways,  but they're just like once they get to a certain size.  And so why is it that every, I mean, that's what I think we're a good example of this.  We're a good size. I like how big we are.  I'm not saying like don't listen to us. Do listen to us.

There's a lot of work.  You know, when we've tried forums, when we've tried comments,  when we've tried, we had our own Twitter for a while, the Twitter army.  And unless there's all that human intervention, no computer can do it.  You've got to have a human involved.  And that's expensive and hard, especially at the size that YouTube and Twitter and Facebook are at.  March brought us some big stuff, though.  Maybe the product of the year, Time Magazine, third was the product of the year.  We'll talk about that in just a moment.  We're not even through the first quarter.  Guys, you got to do it.  No, it's my fault. I'm slowing you down.  Let's talk about Rocket Mortgage.  It's been a good year for us with Rocket Mortgage, one of our best sponsors through the year.  They're back in 2018.  I'm very happy to say and very happy to do their ads because Rocket Mortgage is something for us, the geek.  You you probably are familiar with the Quicken Loans, partly because they what is it?  Cleveland, Quicken Loans Arena.  And of course, they revitalizing downtown Detroit.  They're the number two lender in the country.  Ninety two billion dollars in loans last year for home loans.  They're actually the best lender in the country because I want the number one.  I don't have to tell you is a big bank and is not good because that's who I got my loan from when Lisa and I bought our house almost four years ago.  We went to the big bank and it was the strangest.  It was straight out of Dickens.  There's a guy there.  The only thing he's lacking is the green eye shade in the sleeve garters and a quill pen.  But in many respects, the loan process hadn't changed since he had a sheaf of papers.  I guess they print this out daily with all the loans and the loan rates.  He was thumbing his finger, thumbing through them.  And then he was very proud of his loan calculator, his mortgage calculator.  It's a well, here's a rate.  And he got you to check and he entered the down payment.  Here's the rate.  This would be your monthly payment.  And he holds it up very proudly.  Look, I figured this out.  And it was it took a long time.  We finally said, OK, we'll take that loan.  Then then the pain began.  We go home.  We have to start sending them documents.  They wanted more.  Send them more.  A month later, we're still sending them more.  The guy we're buying the house from says, guys, it's been a month.  I'm going to sell it to somebody else.  We're saying, no, no, no, it's almost over.  The big bank's going to give us a loan.  I promise you.  We ran on vacation.  We're faxing stuff from a cruise ship.  Debbie Lisa's sisters faxed us stuff from here.  It was nuts.  We finally got the loan, got the house.  Happy ending.  I could tell you next time it will not be that big bank.  It will be Quicken Loans and a product they made for us.  Rocket Mortgage completely online.  Mortgage approval product completely online.  You don't have to go get dressed to go to the bank.  You can do it on your phone.  You could do it.  It's so fast and easy from the open house.  You can go to an open house.  Say, I like this house.  I like it.  Let's buy it, honey.  Well, we got to get the loan.  OK, watch.  You whip out your phone.  You go to rocketmortgage.com slash twit two.  You answer a few easy questions, questions you already know the answer to, right?  Birthday address, social.  They have partnerships with all the banks.  So you don't have to get your bank statements or anything.  They get it all from the banks, of course, with your permission, completely securely.  They crunch the numbers and then they come up with the right loan for you based on income, assets, and credit.  They will get within minutes.  They will say, you're approved.  There's a green button.  Download the approval letter.  You can print it out or you can just hold it up and show the realtor.  We're approved.  We got the loan.  Can we buy this house?

Transcript:  By the way, this was also the year Snapchat said we're going to rewrite Snapchat so you know how to use it.  Yeah, I don't know if that's a good thing.  I think part of the reason it was successful is because only teens knew how to use it.

Transcript:  They felt like they needed to do something because I mean they went public and everybody you know the expectation was high that Snapchat was was going public at the right time for them.  You can't hit those growth numbers forever.  Man, it just it really just began to tank almost immediately.  Let's look at that was more attributed to Snap doing Snapchat doing things wrong with their with their their service and their app.  Or if that was more attributed to the success of competitors aping those features and doing it better.

Transcript:  And actually, that's a trend that you can take all the way back to now with Disney buying up all these different studios.  Now they own Fox.  It's this idea that if you're going to be a successful streaming provider, you got to start thinking your own content because you cannot assume that those studios are going to sell their content to you anymore.  Disney is definitely not because they're going to start up their own streaming.  So for Netflix and Amazon, it's absolutely vital that they put out the money now so that they own content that people will keep coming back to.  Netflix's House of Cards.  Amazon has things like Mozart in the Jungle.  You know, Stranger Things over on the Netflix side.  So we'll see more and more of that.  I think that was really the start of it.  It's like, yes, this validates the idea.  The studio doesn't just make stuff that we can stream.  It makes stuff that people want and that they'll reward.

Start time: 4179.18

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think actually now it's every Yahoo account has been hacked.  Let's see. WikiLeaks began the year with the revealing of the CIA with the reveal of CIA hacking tools.  This was the Vault 7 hack that was in March.  I think it was the following month that the NSA tools were released.  The shadow brokers release.  And of course, that ended up being the source for the WannaCry ransomware the next month.  I guess we can jump ahead.  Well, let's go back to March just real briefly.  The Turkish crime family, remember them?  They demanded a ransom from Apple because they said we have ways to get into the Apple iCloud and Apple just ignored them and nothing happened.  So nice job, Turkish crime family.  And then there was the other one that they hacked the Netflix, right?  They said we've got all but the last episode of Orange is the New Black.  Netflix said, hey, thanks for the promotion.  Yeah, exactly.

Transcript:  Well, he had he didn't leave right when that was revealed, but it was revealed that he had paid a company to do memes like just funny memes, mostly anti Hillary Clinton memes.  And he just said he did it for the lulz.  But then it was later that he left and basically, you know, just left.  He said he left under his own. He wasn't kicked out.  Yeah. And neither did. But they didn't speak about it much.  I mean, they were hiding him for a while.  Yeah, he was really MIA for a while.  And then he allegedly invested later in the VR company that was going to go under and then didn't go under.  We spoke to them.  Oh, what was that? It was the VR community.  Not the Magic League.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, he was he was public on Twitter about the company.  And then very soon after, they got this huge influx of money that survived that, you know, brought them back to life.  And if you connected the dots between the time that he tweeted those comments and when everything happened and a few other clues,  they were pointed pretty strongly at the fact that Palmer Lucky was was involved in that in some way, shape or form.  But I don't know if we ever found out for certain if that was.

Start time: 4410.62

So this was also April the month that Kendall Jenner gave a Pepsi to the police during the protest.  Now, remember, we've already forgotten this.  This was the year of outrage.  This was one of the big outrages was this Pepsi, this kind of tone deaf Pepsi ad where it was a protest,  kind of a non-specific protest, inviting you all to join the conversation about whatever.  And there were Muslim people drinking Pepsi and there were there was a model in taking pictures.  And there was Kendall Jenner and she was the model.

And they get to these police officers and you think it's going to go bad because there's kind of like a standoff.  And then Kendall Jenner walks in and she walks up to one of the police officers and she hands him a Pepsi.  And then that Pepsi brings everybody together.  Isn't that like the best ad ever?

Which will not age well because I mean, this is one of the funny things about outrage.  It moves fast.  There's always something new to be outraged by.  Apple began to open Apple Park in April as well, though it took them another eight months before they really kind of got it open.  We had new emojis in April.  Huge. Probably the story of the year.

But that's an example of how technology has changed the landscape, changed the conversation.  Because it was people, two or three people with camera phones not only recorded it, but then tweeted it.  And United, the outrage immediately changed United's policies, changed airlines policies.  And rightly so.  The poor guy, whatever resistance he was putting up, he ended up getting beat up pretty bad by the airport police.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Will it make people behave better?  I don't think it's going to change human behavior in that way.  We knew this would happen a few years ago.  Remember, it was a big problem in schools that every fight, every confrontation, somebody would post it on Facebook.  And it was started even a few years ago, it would be a concern for teenagers that there might be a video living on after your high school years of you behaving badly.

Start time: 4742.68
End time: 4769.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's why Snapchat happened.  Yeah, that's a good point.  But I think it's the worst for that because it makes you believe things are going to disappear, but anyone can screenshot it.  So it's really like a recipe for disaster, I think.  Because you live under the idea that this is going to disappear.  I'm not putting it up on Instagram where it's going to stay there.  But then, you know, so you do all these crazy things that someone is inevitably going to Snapchat and then share and it will live on.

Start time: 4770.14
End time: 4778.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm with you, Megan, in saying that it's not going to change human behavior, but it won't change human behavior during the event.  Because people get mad and they do stupid things.

Start time: 4778.46
End time: 4782.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The last thing they think at that moment is, oh, but there's going to be five cameras.

Start time: 4782.36
End time: 4827.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Precisely. But it will change human behavior after an event.  Because after an event, you have to think, well, someone might have video of that.  So I better do a really good job of recalling exactly what happened and get my story as close to the truth as possible.  Because that's how you lose something like that, right?  You put out a statement and then the video evidence contradicts it entirely.  So that part of human behavior has to catch up.  I will still do stupid things because I am a human and I get upset and I do things I wouldn't otherwise do.  But now I have to be clear enough to say, OK, well, assuming someone has a video of it, I better make sure I don't put out a story that is so easily contradicted.  So, in other words, learn to lie better.

But in general, the live streaming, and I realize 2017 wasn't the year where live streaming from your pocket began.  But it certainly was the year where we realized it wasn't as nearly as big of a deal as a lot of people were making it out to be when it did begin.  Yeah. It seemed to kind of fade away throughout the year.  We won a Webby in April. We did.

Transcript:  Which I feel like is a greater is a greater message around the online ad industry in general than it is just about Facebook.  I'm not surprised at all to know that you could do that.  Obviously, it's great that Facebook is making changes.  But, you know, part of part of it is holding Facebook to account for that.  I think the bigger part of it is taking a look at the ad industry in general and just realizing like that really falls in line with how that's managed online.  Because it's a data driven.  It's an easy, you know, it's an easy world to be able to get very specific with things.  Of course, as we've talked about earlier, people can be horrible.  And so they will find a way to use that to their advantage and to somebody else's disadvantage.  That's a bigger problem than just Facebook.

Start time: 5235.89
End time: 5261.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I get that.  But the thing was with Facebook saying, OK, we're going to start more closely monitoring these things as they're developed, as the data starts creating these categories on which you could buy ads.  That seems like that's one of the places where you absolutely would have human interaction because they're not generating that many saleable tags.  And the fact that you had saleable tags that were obviously racist and inflammatory.  It's like, well, anyone looking over the generated tag should say, no, we probably shouldn't sell ads against that.  Right. I hate Jews.

Start time: 5264.04
End time: 5316.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The point being that Facebook has this data where so I suppose Google might have some of this data, but Facebook has a richer trove of data to mine.  And the fact that they're willing to sell against it.  By the way, ProPublica discovered it earlier in the year.  Facebook said, oh, yeah, you will knock that off.  And then in September, ProPublica did it again and they hadn't knocked it off.  So this is another trend with Facebook of them doing bad stuff, apologizing, but then not stopping or stopping in a limited fashion.  Here's the here's ProPublica's example.  This is a screenshot of buying an ad for people who are Jew haters.  How about that?  And by the way, Facebook says your audience selection is great.  Potential audience size, one hundred and eight thousand people.  You can buy that ad.  Now, Facebook probably buried that feature.

Start time: 5316.46
End time: 5323.34

Transcript:  Last year was that Facebook ProPublica bought an ad that blocked African-Americans, Hispanics and Asian-Americans.  Facebook said they prevented they built a system that prevented.  But well, now you can buy ads for Jew haters.  That's been blocked as well.  But I'm sure this is maybe a reflection, not on Facebook, but just how possible it is to game systems like this.

Start time: 5345.50
End time: 5366.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Well, that's the thing, because we complain that these systems have been gamed.  But that's what advertising is. Advertising is gaming the system.  That's the whole point of advertising.  It's gaming your Google Home, you know, to figure out how to get it to fire off for your ad campaign.  How do you go to how do you go to an advertiser and say we would like you to stop the gaming of the system in the system that games the system?

And I think that there's an argument to be made that it should be regulated.  I don't I'm not willing to make that argument now.  But I mean, I think that it's yeah, I mean, there is a way to my dad was an advertising like, you know, since the advertising started and there were all kinds of regulations that they had to, you know, they still figured out ways to game.

Transcript:  And I do think that this is an advertising wide problem.  But it is interesting to consider the difference between YouTube's targeted advertising and Facebook's targeted advertising because Facebook is dealing with our social graph.  You know, it's all the people that we know and all the people we communicate with.  And that's different than what YouTube is dealing with.  And we're also handing over that information to Facebook.

Transcript:  We're willingly doing it.  And that's one of the reasons lately, as we get towards the end of the year, I've become more and more vociferous about getting off Facebook.  I'm starting to really come to the opinion that Facebook is malign.  I don't do Facebook.  That Facebook is a problem.  I have a Facebook account.  And you're giving Facebook so much information.  But the thing is, you know, that isn't going to matter because two billion people use Facebook.  It's too late.  You've already given them.  They already know everything about me.  But at least I won't see the Facebook ads if I don't visit Facebook.  I keep my account only because I need to because we cover it.  We have to talk about it.  The other big story that Facebook kind of reminded me about during the F8 conference is 360 degree video.  We were all excited about it.  They gave away a 360 degree Giro optic camera for iPhone.  They touted their Facebook camera.  The similar camera was at the Oz.  I want to say Osmo.  It was the Oz something.  Thirty thousand dollar Nokia 360 camera that went out of business.  And I'm starting to think that maybe we kind of over like 3D video that we maybe overdid 360.  It didn't really or or is it going to persist in some limited way?

Transcript:  It falls into the falls into the same category of our kind of view this year of virtual reality.  And maybe we're getting more into the augmented reality.  But how how connected are we really to surrounding ourselves with a virtual representation of something?  Last year, VR seemed like, you know, the next big thing this year.  I wouldn't say that VR was a failure necessarily, but it certainly didn't have the steam that it had last year.  Really slowed down 360 degree video.  We thought, well, this is a really great way to pull you into that basketball game when you can't sit courtside.  This is how people are going to buy tickets to watch these games.  Five minutes be there.  But then you realize that for that to reach like maximum capacity of users, we've all got to be perfectly comfortable with the fact that we each have a headset that we sit on, you know, put on our face and we just sit there.  I think long term comfortable is not practical.

Start time: 5568.06

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  360 and VR fight against one basic truth of all the content that we make.  And this is no matter what content industry you're in.  And that is there's a narrative you're trying to tell a narrative.  That's why people come to you.  You give people a 360 degree technology and suddenly the narrative doesn't really come through because they can look anywhere they want.  I mean, as a director, you control where the cameras are pointed, which camera you're using, what angle you're giving to the audience.  Once you put on that 360 set, you're just looking around going, OK, I guess I look over your oh, wait, I missed something.  Oh, wait, that's that you're doing the entire time.  It's a fun technology demonstrator.  It is a horrible way to actually absorb content.

And there may be a time when it checks all those boxes and you put it on and you truly feel like you are experiencing something.  I don't think we're there yet.  And I think that's going to shoot 360 degree video and ultimately VR.  At least slow it down.

To the point to where now when I go to one and I see all the amazing flashy things that they're showing off on stage,  I know inside my head that a certain percentage of these things might never see the light of day  or might actually launch next year and be limited compared to what we're seeing right now  or might actually be great as well.  But this was not a good year for Google when it comes to living up to the expectations that were set out at Google I.O.

Transcript:  Well, OK, I want to say I'm a Pixel 2 XL user.  And I am too and I love it.  I think this was an example and we saw a lot of it this year because there's such pressure  to publish, to be the first out with a review.  And this was an example of people rushed their Pixel 2 reviews out and overplayed,  I think, the problems with the screen.  I've been very happy.  Google did release an update that lets you to turn on a saturated mode that makes that OLED  screen look every bit as good as a Samsung screen.  I have no burn in on this screen.  And what people did miss is the very good camera in here that has only gotten better  because Google just released Oreo 8.1, the new Android, which it announced at Google  I.O., Android O, it talked about.  And what they didn't tell us, they still didn't tell us when they finally came out with the  phone, people discovered it.  I think I fixed it maybe when they took the phone apart.  There's a separate chip not turned on to support camera processing.  Pixel Visual Core.  It was just turned on with 8.1 and I've been taking pictures with the Pixel.  It is way ahead of anything else out there.  It's the best phone.

But I just I feel like the color, the HD, this is an HDR shot.  You can see it's actually coming alive because it's starting to process.  It's processing and turn off the light.  Yeah, if you turn that off, you get the better the resolution.  And I think that this is an example of very dark with a tree trunk and very bright with  the grass where HDR just excels.  It's natural.  It doesn't look weird and painfully.  But I think this is so credit to Google.  I think and I think this is an example of and we saw this with the Essential phone also,  which came out this year, where early reviewers said, oh, no, the camera app is terrible.  But Essential over time was able to get the camera out better and better.  And anybody who stayed with the phone, you have it now.  It's actually gotten quite good.

Start time: 5935.67

Transcript:  Isn't that interesting?  And that's where I think having a review that has to come out the next day is really a problem.  And so I would just say it does a disservice to our viewers and our listeners who are in the market.  Wait, listen and pay attention to the reviewers who come back two, three, four weeks later, a month later,  because you're going to get a different perspective on it.  I think I have no hesitation recommending the Pixel 2.  I would completely agree.

Start time: 5982.54
End time: 6044.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think early on I was a little worried because it really did seem like one after another after another display issue was called out.  I really think the problem or at least part of the problem for Google this year was what you're talking about, right?  Like they were releasing a lot of hardware.  There were reviews that were hitting almost immediately, kind of following Google's really good at doing the and maybe good is the wrong word,  doing the we'll release our hardware and it's it's beta until it's not anymore.  And the problem with doing that is that the perception, the public perception of Google's hardware release category this year is that a number of different  pieces of hardware had problems out of the gate.  They've addressed almost all of them, I would say.  And if you were to start writing reviews from this point in time based on where that hardware is at right now, all of that would be erased and everything would be great.  The problem is there's that history that leads up to now that now puts a sour taste in your mouth to think like, OK, well, then what's going on with their quality control?  How did so many things get through that they then had to fix later?  But that's normal.

Start time: 6044.36
End time: 6110.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's normal. And I suppose it is normal.  Why does it know if there weren't this rush to review?  And it doesn't just affect Google, it affects other companies as well.  And I think what's interesting is companies like Apple are fostering this.  So Apple has twice now with the iPhone 10 and most recently with the IMAQ Pro seeded done short review turnaround times with the iPhone 10.  A number of people only had it for a day.  But because there's such pressure to get it out, we're actually reviewing the phone after one day of use.  Apple, I think, felt like this is good for us because people will focus on the new stuff.  They won't focus on battery life and other things they can't test.  And they just did it again with the IMAQ Pro.  Right.  And I feel like that's a disservice.  Companies are this is about gaming.  They're gaming the review system and sometimes to their benefit, sometimes in the case of essential and Google to their detriment.  So as I think all we can say is to people reading reviews, be more patient.  That first rushed review is almost always going to have mistakes in it because you don't know what a phone or any device is like until you've used it for weeks and months.

Start time: 6110.54
End time: 6118.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So watch us.  I do think, though, that there are a few.  I'm starting to see a few sites saying a month in.  Here's what we think.  And I hope that we see more of that because I think that's really much more fair to a product.  And people don't rush.  I mean, some people rush out day one and buy a product, but you shouldn't necessarily trust those first day reviews.  Those are often just not completely accurate about the product.  I just want to say that I don't know what the answer is, but it's really been.  It's because of the pressure to publish and get those clicks because you know what?  If you're going to publish a review of the Pixel 2 XL, all of the clicks are in the first week.  After that, nobody clicks.  And so when sites are driven by clicks or views, then they're going to then they're going to be giving you rushed reports.  Yeah, it moves them to get it out soon.  It's kind of another side of the link bait issue.

Start time: 6181.64
End time: 6204.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's tough because the way that we used to do it here was we would do the unboxing.  We would do the first look and then maybe a couple of weeks, maybe a couple of months in, we'd actually do the real review.  We use this thing as a daily driver for X number of time.  This is what we found.  And when we started going back to our numbers, we're like, look, that first look gets a ridiculous amount of clicks, a ridiculous amount of views.  No one cares about the review.

Start time: 6204.56
End time: 6246.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Fortunately, we're not driven so much by that.  And it is it's one of the reasons I have a policy of in general buying these products and using them and continuing to use them.  So you do you do that. You do that.  We all do that.  And I think that a lot of publications can't afford to do that.  A lot of individuals, YouTubers and stuff can't afford to do that.  But when when it's possible, I think that's the right way to do it is to live with these devices.  And so if you watch all about Android, you're going to get a much I think a much more nuanced, rich perspective of what's out there and how it works over time.  Then if you just quickly read a review on a gadget and say, I make my decision.  Same thing. I was today. You're going to get a much better idea of what you can do with these devices.  That's a little self-serving.

Transcript:  I also feel like I'm not in the business to tell you whether or not you should buy something like that's not I mean, I'm not a professional tech, you know, gadget reviewer.  I mean, I like to talk about how we don't say we're reviewers.  Like how is it changing your life? How can you use it?  How do I use it?  Like how is it changing the world?  How is it changing your family?  Like that's more of it.  I'm not saying like buy or not buy.  Like that's not what I do.  So it's one of the reasons we stopped doing before you buy.  We had a product review show that made that recommendation.

Transcript:  And I didn't think we did it as well as people like Marcus Brownlee.  If that's what you want, you want those quick, you know, quick video reviews.  There are there are really good people doing that.  That's not what we do.  We do a little bit different kind of in-depth experience with the devices.  Speaking of which, at Google I.O., Microsoft did this this year as well.  Both announced virtual reality standalone virtual reality headsets that I can't imagine anybody wants.  But they're cheaper than buying an Oculus Rift or an HTC Vive.  So they're I don't think the market for Rift survives is that big anyway.  But now they're going to get a except for one thing.  Oh, in that market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we'll see what that.  I'm sorry.  Five to a megs.  I see this verge.  This verge review says again, this has been out since since May.  512 gigs of RAM or less.  Oh, man.  If I get a phone with 512 gigs, I think they as little as 500.  I think they meant I think they meant megabytes.  Don't you?  Yeah, probably.  But but but this is a perfect example.  Nobody has come back to look at that.  Yeah, nobody edited it in the first place and nobody's come back to look at it since then.  Google did announce the TPU, the processor, the TPU chip designed for artificial intelligence, TensorFlow optimized.  I think we're starting to see that.  In fact, one of the things that did happen this year, AlphaGo, we mentioned that it it beat early in the year, beat 50 hardcore Go players around about this time.  I think it was in May.  AlphaGo beat the Go champion.  And then a couple of months later, AlphaZero superseded AlphaGo actually beating it with one day of training.  And so huge strides have been made in artificial intelligence and machine learning.  Some of this because of TensorFlow and the TPU processors.  And now the new thing is and we'll see how important this is.  Every phone that comes out this year, this coming year in 2018, will have some sort of AI hardware built into it.  Apple's going to do it. Google's doing it.  And I don't know, Qualcomm announced with its Snapdragon 845.  No, we're going to have a little AI capability built into that.

Start time: 6425.48

Google I.O. if there was one like keyword to pin on it, it was artificial intelligence.  Everything about that that that presentation earlier this year was either about assistant or about moving AI onto the device that you don't have to do all this stuff in the cloud, making everything smarter.  The world of technology is better for AI.

You could also call it machine learning or neural networking or deep learning.  So those are other buzzwords you can toss in there.  When you're not sure, just use all four.

And by the way, there were more breaches, NSA breaches later in the year.  This was the year of NSA exploit.  Wanna cry, which was a very malicious ransomware that took among other things, took advantage of some of those NSA exploits to spread from machine to machine was simply the worst case of ransomware to date.  Right.

Start time: 6576.52

I got I got I have one hundred thousand dollar Bitcoin wallet lying around somewhere.  Steve Gibson, though, beat me.  He's got fifty Bitcoin in a wallet worth as much as a million dollars earlier this year.  But I asked him the other day on on his show Security Now.  He said, well, I don't know if I lost it. I built a Bitcoin miner.  It overnight mined fifty Bitcoin.  This is a few years ago when you could do that. You can't do that anymore.

But you now have people who are investing in Bitcoin with no idea of how it actually works.  That's always dangerous.  And now with the futures, you've got take you've got people taking out mortgages to buy futures for BTC.  That's horrible.  The last time we did that, we crashed the market.  Yeah, that's a mistake.

In fact, Apple, of course, had a famously had a blank root password exploit.  That's a good idea.  Yeah.  On Mac OS, the newest version high Sierra and iOS has had all sorts of, you know, both both cosmetic and I think maybe even more serious flaws in it.  Certainly driven some people crazy.  But the HomePod did not come out in time to compete with a variety of other devices.  The Google Home Max, which is right behind me, the 18 different new Sonos.  I'm not Sonos.  Amazon Echo devices, including the Echo Show, which was announced in, I think, May of this year, the first Echo with a screen.

That means it's worth it.  Automated do not disturb driving mode was a part of iOS 11.  I think that may save more lives than anything else released this year.  I hope so.  I mean, it certainly has the potential to I think I turn it on and I and certainly if you have kids turn on do not disturb so that they can't get texts or calls while they're driving.  Absolutely.  It also changed really the user interface and it made me think that Apple is moving more and more away from Mac OS and toward an iOS user interface.  They had a permanent dock.  They had multiple multiple windows, especially on the iPad Pro iOS 11 really was becoming a desktop operating system.  And Apple kind of capped that off with ads towards the end of the year that ended with the punchline.  What's a PC?

No, I mean, I think that they were getting a lot better at multitasking in iOS and it just makes sense to have everything working the same.  I do believe in that like Windows, you know, like that was the whole phone tablet desktop thing.

I read, I write, I, you know, respond to emails.  I don't edit video.  I don't, you know, do any of that like hardcore stuff.  So I'm unique, but I would like it because already now.  My laptop and my iPad and my phone have essentially different operating systems now because I mean, iOS 11 on the iPhone 10 is very different than iOS 11 on the iPad or even on the iPhone 8.  And so it would be nice if they all looked and acted a little bit more similar.  And I do think that the iPhone makes a lot of sense and the iPhone 10, the way you use it, the way you swipe through things and just.  It just, yeah, it's more the extension of my brain into the device.  I could see that in June.

When we come to the end of the year, was this a good year or a bad year for Uber was started.  This was the culmination of Susan Fowler's memo that we spoke about earlier was the departure of Travis Kalanick.  They brought in a very, I think many agree, a very good CEO towards the end of the year, Dara Kazrashok.  And I'm sorry, they just they just call him Dara.  And he has done what he can.  But but certain revelations came out, for instance, that Uber had been hacked and that records from seven million drivers and 50 million users had been released.  But that Uber last year covered it up, paid a ransom, paid a ransom to the hacker of one hundred thousand dollars, pretending that it was a bug bounty.  Then asked the hacker to sign an NDA so that no one should know.  This is, by the way, a violation of federal law.  And there will be, I'm sure something.  Well, we'll see.

It's still really kind of early to see, but seems like his head is in the right.  I like him in the right place.  And I've liked what I've seen so far.

Delete Uber.  Twenty seventeen was a good year for Uber's competitor here in the States.  Lift for sure.  Lift got a lift from from all the bad stuff that's happening with Uber.

Transcript:  I mean, prices are a little bit cheaper sometimes.  And for some things you can order things on Amazon and pick them up in the Whole Foods.  You know, the world hasn't fallen apart yet, but I think this is just the beginning.  And I think like Facebook, they Amazon has so much of our data, our purchasing.  Facebook has our social graph and Amazon has everything that we buy and why we buy it and where we buy it and when we buy it and how much of it and how much we're willing to spend.  And what?  Yeah. And I think that they're doing a really good job of telling the difference between the people who have a little bit of time and a lot of money and the people that have a lot of time and a little money.  And they want both of those people.  And they're you know, they've gotten into some great neighborhoods and they're figuring out all of the organic food that we're willing to pay high prices for.  And I think, yeah, it makes sense.  We also, I mean, there's the Amazon Go that was announced this year too, which was the grocery store where you walk in and pick up your food and then you walk out without talking to anyone.  Those are there. Some of those exist already for Amazon employees, but that's probably our future too.

Start time: 7508.22

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Juicero came and went in 2017.  It was a quick trip for Juicero.  It started in the spring of 2017.  I'm still waiting for our review unit. I want to try that thing out. Come on.  In the spring of 2017, I can't remember who it was that did a review of the hardware saying, you know, I understand why this costs so much.  This is way overkill.  But the death blow for Juicero was when Bloomberg showed that you could just squeeze a Juicero back with your hand and get exactly the same result  instead of buying the three or four hundred dollar Juicero juicer.  And by the by the few months ago, the end of the year, Juicero was no more.  Everybody who bought a Juicero got their money back though, supposedly.

Start time: 7546.36
End time: 7574.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So now the fun thing about the fun thing, but the interesting thing about the Juicero saga is there were two other fruit juice startups around the same time.  And they were taken down by the backlash against Juicero.  They basically said in this market with that story, there's no way we're going to be able to go public.  They killed it. So that that's collateral damage.  If you make a business plan that is so snooty, you will not just destroy your company, you will destroy all the companies around your company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well done. Yeah. Well, and it's weird that it was Bloomberg that outed Juicero Bloomberg, of course, a business journal.  But I guess one of their jobs is to show people that some business, not all businesses are created equal.  And of course, the CEO of Juicero responded to this by begging you, please don't squeeze the juice bag.  Please buy the $400 machine.  The reason it's a big story is they attracted $120 million in venture capital and for what was essentially a very expensive squeezer, kind of an overbuilt squeezer.

And just like the fact that maybe you were the first person to retweet it  or the first joke, the first everything, there's a whole community on Twitter that I find joy in.

Start time: 7760.36
End time: 7843.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Walt Mossberg retired. In fact, that was in July.  And they talked quite a bit about, July was the 10th anniversary of the iPhone release, June was, I guess.  And we talked quite a bit about the first four reviewers.  The world has changed completely.  In fact, if you just look at Apple alone, in 2007 when they released the first iPhone,  the four review units went out to Walt Mossberg of the Wall Street Journal,  Ed Begg of USA Today, David Pogue, who was at the time at the New York Times,  and Stephen Levy, who was at Newsweek.  The print journalism was ascendant.  And it's funny because here we were doing podcasts at the time thinking,  gee, we'll never get any, we never got invited to any events.  We had a hard time even getting into events at CES and so forth.  And then somehow it's completely passed by podcasting and blogs became ascendant.  Now it's passed by blogs already and it's YouTube.  And so if you were to say who were the first four reviewers of the iMac Pro,  it was more than four, but they were mostly YouTubers.  And I think the same thing for the iPhone X.  It absolutely didn't go to any of those four except, I think, for Stephen Levy,  who is now at Wired, and so he's still okay.  He's moved to an online journal.

How did you know at the time?  And we forget, like our memory is so short.  Like we already knew that it was going to change everything.  Like it was so highly anticipated.  Oh, yeah. I remember back then.  It wasn't a shock.  I mean, surely now no one could say like, you know, in 2017,  10 years from now you're going to go into a restaurant or walk down the street  and everyone's going to have their face in an iPhone or something iPhone-like.

Transcript:  I think we underestimated how big.  I mean, we knew it was going to be big, but what we didn't realize,  first of all, was how it would change society in that way.  But we also didn't realize how it would change innovation and hardware and manufacture  because what eventually happened, thanks to Apple and the iPhone,  is China became this amazing powerhouse of manufacture.  I don't think you'd have Kickstarter and all the crowd-sourced hardware opportunities  if it weren't for the fact that Apple had gone in there  and built this incredible supply chain and then was extended to other companies.  You wouldn't have drones.  Here we are sitting next to the Quad Father.  But the technology that made drones possible first emerged.  Came from phones.  Came from the iPhone.  And I can go on and on and on.  The iPhone launched, it's the product that launched 1,000 industries, really.

They liked being connected.  And then you saw the iPhone and you compared it to the Blackberry,  and you're like, oh, yeah, that's better.  And we knew it was going to be at least as big as the Blackberry.  What we did not realize was that it wouldn't just be professionals  and bankers and stockbrokers who would want it.  It would be everybody.

What we didn't mention, and this has really been a drum beat all year long,  started in 2016 was Russian intervention in the election.  And Russian bots.  And it's still denied by some.  Some say it still didn't happen, mostly the guy in the White House.  But I think it's widely agreed by the intelligence agencies that Russia is in fact attempting to affect our republic,  intervene in our republic, not just through elections, but primarily through elections.  And of course, the big question is next year in 2018, there's going to be another election, the midterm elections.  And it doesn't seem that anybody's doing anything about this, whether it's Facebook or Russia.  Well, Russia is, I'm sure. Or the White House.  I think this is a story that will be big in 2018.

Our show brought to you by GoToWebinar, the webinar platform.  You know what a webinar is, right?  It's a seminar over the web.  It's 2.7 million interactive web events this year, 60 million views.  That's a lot of people using GoToWebinar.  We've used GoToWebinar. I love GoToWebinar.  It's a great way to give a lecture, a presentation, one to six presenters,  an infinite number of viewers, both in real time and on demand,  and they have all the features to make your webinar a huge success.  A great way to meet prospects and customers, to present to your company,  to present to your investors.  With GoToWebinar, it's easy to start a webinar, custom email invitations,  confirmations, or reminders, all with your company logo and custom image.  Automated email templates make it as fast and easy to create a webinar  as to send an email.  You can create and schedule pre-recorded webinars that can be watched later  but are just as interactive as live events.  These technologies are really cool.  It's mobile-friendly, both for you as the presenter and for the viewers.  You can schedule a webinar, edit a session,  track performance on an iOS or Android device with the GoToWebinar app.  Create polls, too.  I love the polls because as a presenter but also as a viewer of these webinars,  if you can interact, it's great, it's huge.  You can create multiple polls, up to 20 of them, 20 questions per.  It's a great way to engage participants, also to find out if they're getting  what you're talking about, if they have further questions.  And when you have a large audience, you can chat,  but you can't chat with everybody.  The polls are a really great way to assess the audience.  And you not only can do them before the session,  you can do it during the session.  If you're sitting there saying, are they getting this?  You can literally poll them.  Up to six presenters can share their webcams, participate face-to-face,  but you can also broadcast a view of their desktops or a specific application.  And the analytics are phenomenal.  You'll know exactly how your webinar does.  You'll get qualified leads, data to improve the webinars.  It's secure, 128-bit AES, point-to-point.  Number one in customer satisfaction, and now you could try it  at gotowebinar.com slash podcast.  Turn your next presentation into a conversation.  One of the best ways I've ever used to engage an audience,  gotowebinar.com slash podcast.  We thank them so much for their support of this year-end edition of This Week in Tech.  Well, here we finally, finally, finally are in the fourth quarter.  Chapter 27.  Oh, my gosh.  It's fun to watch.  I went through, you know, going through the old shows and rundowns,  looking at the speculation of the iPhone at 10 as it slowly converged on the truth.  And I have to give credit to Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities,  who is the supply chain analyst of all of the people guessing.  He was the one who nailed it again and again and again.  The only thing I'd say maybe that he got wrong was, and everybody got this wrong,  there was the thought that Apple was going to be much delayed on getting the iPhone 10 into people's hands.  It was delayed.  It came out later than the iPhone 8.  But on the other hand, they've been able to ramp up production.  By the end of the year, we're making 50 million phones a month,  which I think is enough to feed the supply chain for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it was June that Ming-Chi Kuo said there will not be Touch ID.  It will only be Face ID.  And remember that the Galaxy S8 had come out at Mobile World Congress,  I think it was in March or April, Jason,  and within a month the Chaos Computer Club, the Berlin hackers,  had hacked the Galaxy S8's Iris ID.  It was pretty easily tricked.  And so there was some concern that Face ID on an iPhone might not be fully secure.  In fact, there's still some concern about that,  but now that it's been out for a month,  there's been one case of a South Korean group making a great expense 3D printing.  They had to scan the guy's face, took minutes, then they had a 3D printed mask.

I think we could safely say at least Face ID on the iPhone X is better  than Iris ID was on the Samsung Galaxy S8, certainly faster, easier to use.  Yeah, no, that's pretty safe.  Apple's always denied that they ever considered a touch ID on the new iPhone.  And I think they've also said, and Ming-Chi Kuo is saying now,  that all future iPhones going forward will have Face ID.  It'd be interesting to see if they add that to the iPad.  There is now quite a gulf between the iPhone and the iPad.  iPad Pro 10.5 inch, which had been rumored, came out middle of the year,  and to great success.  Also, though, Apple did something very big.  They, in the middle of the year, announced a $329 iPad, just iPad, no designation.  And that sold like hotcakes.  Quarterly results subsequently showed the iPad sales up for the first time in many quarters.  People liked a cheap iPad. It sold very, very well.  Tesla this year announced a new Tesla Roadster, a new Tesla truck,  and finally started shipping the Model 3.

Transcript:  In Soviet Union, phone listening to you.  All year long, we knew that starting when Ajit Pai was appointed in the spring to be the chairman of the FCC, that he would repeal net neutrality.  We protested.  We, you know, I mean, I'm looking at huge pro net neutrality protest plan for the week of July 9th.  Didn't make any difference.  We commented by the millions.  Didn't make any difference because there were, according to the attorney general of New York, two million fake comments.

Start time: 8746.28
End time: 8752.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Transcript:  But this doesn't make any sense to me.  Like, why do we have, why is our voice not important?  Like, I think eight, what did our guests from the EFF say yesterday?  Like, eight out of 10 people disagree with this.  Seven out of 10, the conservatives disagree with this.  This is not a conservative versus liberal issue.  I'll tell you, you want to know why?

Transcript:  We didn't pay enough money to members of Congress to get our voices heard.  That's really what happened.  Congress got bought by the big ISPs, by Verizon, by Comcast, and that's that.

Start time: 8811.66
End time: 8841.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's going to be the interesting thing.  People may be right.  There are people, I get people on my Twitter stream all the time, they're probably Russian sock puppets, but people on my Twitter stream all the time say, oh, you don't want the government intervening here.  You don't want regulation of the Internet.  By the way, we're not talking about regulation of the Internet.  It's quite the opposite.  We're talking about regulation of Internet service providers to preserve a free, open, unregulated Internet.  These people don't want a free and open Internet.  They want an Internet that you pay more for.  And maybe they're right.  Maybe nothing will happen.  We'll find out.  We'll be watching.

Start time: 8842.36
End time: 8845.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It won't happen for a while because the ISPs aren't going to want to prove all their oppositions.  Gradually rule it out, right?

Start time: 8845.36
End time: 8847.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they've already said they're not going to do any of this.

Start time: 8847.82
End time: 8929.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah, the funny part is if you go, if you take a snapshot of Comcast, they have a page that pledged to net neutrality.  They've taken three things out specifically that they're not going to block websites, that they're not going to throttle, and they're not going to prioritize.  So they had promised that when they were saying, oh, no, no, we're cool with net neutrality.  And now that this has passed, they have said, no, we're probably going to do that.  Now, I think the next step was actually spelled out by one of the guests on This Week in Enterprise Tech two weeks ago.  We got Chris Mitchell, who is from the Institute of Local Self-Reliance.  And they've done a big broadband initiative.  And the whole idea is to push this idea of the municipal network.  If towns and municipalities actually own their own networks and we're able to link them up, then you just bypass this.  It's like, look, if you don't want to, as you promised in the 1984 Cable Communications Act, act in the best interest of the people that you serve, we'll do it ourselves.  We gave you a functional monopoly because we thought that you, in exchange for a functional monopoly, would do what is right for the people.  So if you don't want to do that, then we no longer give you that functional monopoly.  We take that power back.  And we've already seen that work in over 200 cities and towns in the United States, most notably in Colorado just a couple of weeks ago.  So there is a motion.  There's a movement here that could render the FCC, now the FTC, completely moot.

Start time: 8930.40
End time: 8964.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is, of course, a battle over this.  One of the FCC rules is that municipal Wi-Fi or municipal regulations on net neutrality are illegal.  They don't supersede federal regulations.  There's also been a very strong move in all the state legislatures across the country to ban, prevent civic Wi-Fi because it competes with the businesses.  So there's a fight.  And we're going to see it in court.  Already, more than a dozen states have said we're going to sue over net neutrality.  This is going to be the battle of 2018 is to preserve a free and open.

Start time: 8964.36
End time: 8994.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it'll be really interesting to see how that influences the election going into 2018.  I bet it won't.  Well, I'm curious to know that.  And we actually asked our guest from the EFF Ernesto Falcone.  What did he say?  That yesterday he seemed to feel like it absolutely would.  I hope so.  I would hope so, too.  At what point does this bubble up beyond the people who really kind of have taken the time to read up on net neutrality and what it really means when you get down the court up into kind of the public knowledge of it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you talked about things like zero rating, what T-Mobile is doing with Bin John, which is a violation of net neutrality, it's favoring some companies over others.  People love it.  It saves them money.  Nobody's going to say that's bad.  But the minute an ISP says, oh, you want to look at Instagram, that'll be an extra two dollars a month.  If they ever go that far, I don't I think you're right.  But I think I hope they're smarter than that.

Start time: 9018.69
End time: 9030.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We'll see.  They'll be smarter than that for a while until people forget.  And then they'll say, oh, hey, you know what?  Netflix won't cost you any more, but it will count against your cap.  Now, if you want to use Comcast streaming service, that's completely free.

Start time: 9031.35
End time: 9036.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's how you've got zero rating.  And I suspect that that's the sneaky way it gets in.  They were already doing zero rating.

Start time: 9038.00
End time: 9046.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They wouldn't say if you want to look at Instagram because then just Facebook would pay that.  But if you want to look at Twitter for extra two dollars a month, maybe that smaller.

Start time: 9047.33
End time: 9073.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's why it hurts us.  And if companies like YouTube can afford to pay any bounty that the Internet service provider asks for access to its customers.  Hey, if you want to if you want Leo to watch YouTube, you better pay us some money.  Won't be Leo paying.  It'll be YouTube paying.  YouTube will do that.  But Twitter, I can't afford to do that.  And it would absolutely hurt us if it started to cost people a lot of money to watch Twitter, but didn't cost them money to watch YouTube.

Transcript:  And remember in places without net neutrality like Portugal, this has been the big example during this entire debate.  They actually do charge users more per service.  So there's the social plan.  Well, we'll give you Facebook.  And then there's the new social plan that also gives you Facebook and Twitter and Instagram.  And they have tiers that you add on to your plan.  Now, there's a lot of people from Portugal who are just accustomed to that so that they don't see a problem with it.  For us, that would that would stand out like a sore thumb.  That's a way to make the entire thing I used to be able to get to.  I now have to pay you extra.  And you're not the provider of that service.  And hopefully they're smart enough to realize that that's not going to fly.  Yeah.

Transcript:  This also is the year that Europe started to influence the Internet here in the United States with the right to be forgotten.  And now GDPR, the General Data Protection Regulation.  They make it hurt.  It will go into full effect in May of next year.  But already companies are responding.  For instance, Facebook added a page where you can delete your data today, which you never could do before.  You had to wait for a while.  It would make your account inactive, etc, etc.  I think you're to see more and more of that.  And I'm not sure that's a bad thing.  I have mixed opinions on the GDPR.  But I think in many respects, if the U.S. isn't going to protect our privacy, well, it's good news.  The EU might.  They may overstep.  They have overstepped.  Right to be forgotten clearly is a technical challenge.  But I think that some of the things that the GDPR does are going to call American companies to account and rightly so.

Start time: 9166.44
End time: 9210.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, what the GDPR will do is it will actually allow if the United States were to format something like that,  it would allow them to levy fines that actually hurt.  Because, for example, the Hilton breach where it wasn't just that they lost customer information, it's they lost customer information.  They didn't tell anybody about it.  And they basically assumed it doesn't matter because ultimately they were fined like a million dollars.  It may not even a million.  I think she was under a million dollars.  It was one of these.  That's not even a fine.  That's a rounding error.  Where versus if you did the exact same thing under the GDPR, we had this on twilight a while back.  It would be something like a 300 million dollar fine.  OK, that hurts.  And now they actually have to take it seriously.  So thank you, you.  You've you've done good.

He says he's enjoying life.  And there's some question about what the indictment, which hasn't been  fully revealed, contains, what he did.  It seems to be as a youth, he was involved in creation of ransom, of spy malware.

Transcript:  They're getting at him for that.  They're basically going back through his history and they're saying,  you did some bad things before you did this good thing.  And it's probably true.  We'll see.  That will play out.  But the big juxtaposition was here's a guy who did something good for the  internet and you got him on charges from years and years and years ago.

Of course, he can't talk to me.  But he's a very nice person and I do feel bad for him.  But it's one of those times where you can always reach out to people when  they start attacking you.  He wasn't the one that attacked me.  But he sort of did believe that we were all.  Everyone at Twitter was saying that he had started WannaCry.

Start time: 9364.50

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's very good.  Yeah.  Twitter's made for that kind of innuendo.  People believe in just a little word of warning to anybody who reads stuff on  Twitter and believes it.  At least look and see.  You know, we make all our video available.  You can watch what happened and see if you agree.  People say stuff on Twitter that is not necessarily accurate.  Oh, no, I've lost what I was going to do for the next thing.  It was a big story.  Darn it.  Equifax?  James Damore.  Oh, James Damore.  Damore.  Damore.  The admitted on the spectrum Google employee who wrote a memo saying, well,  maybe we shouldn't be so active in hiring women because women just really don't  have the skills to be programmers.

Start time: 9437.50
End time: 9456.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He, you know, he of course got fired within a week.  It took Google a little while to figure out that this was going to be a problem.  The memo had come out months before.  Circulated it privately at Google.  Once it became public, it became such a problem for Google.  They had to fire him.  I bet you he's got a pretty good job now.  I don't know.

Start time: 9458.10
End time: 9475.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The last we heard of him, he was saying it was because he was autistic.  That's why he wrote this.  Right.  That was November.  Which was offensive to a lot of people as well.  I love that it opened this conversation because I really do think that it did  open a conversation about like are all like, are there just a bunch of liberal  bullies in Silicon Valley?  That was his point.

Start time: 9475.68
End time: 9506.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Partly was that it wasn't okay to be a conservative at Google.  It wasn't okay to have conservative points of view.  But he ended up hurting a lot of women because the strong implication of that  memo was you don't deserve to be here or if you do it is in a diminished role.  And he works with a lot of very accomplished engineers at Google who are  probably better than him.  In fact, his managers and other Googlers said no, he's a low level employee and  this is not representative of our point of view here.

Start time: 9506.94
End time: 9518.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And yet this memo came directly to their inboxes.  Basically everyone got a message saying if you're a woman you might not be as  good as the person sitting next to you because they're a man.  Very hurtful.

Start time: 9518.75
End time: 9572.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Anyway, that was again kind of one of those things that blew over.  I don't know if anything changed at Google.  Man, it was so strong therefore.  But remember Google had been fighting for months earlier in the year to prevent  the Department of Justice from seeing hiring information that might have  implicated it in discriminatory hiring practices particularly with regard to  gender.  They didn't want to tell people how many women were in management roles.  They didn't want to tell them whether they were getting, most importantly,  were getting equal pay.  And I don't know what came of that but I don't think they ever did turn over that  information even though the Justice Department demanded it.  I think they managed to get off.  There was a total eclipse.  Not of the heart.  Of the sun.  Of the sun.  A lot of people went up to see that.  A lot of beautiful pictures.  And then was it Neil deGrasse Tyson who said what's the big deal?  This happens all the time.

I'm going to get them.  I'm going to hoard them.  It's just this general need to have things that is sort of crazy because then it was  like, I need it.  I need it.

But I had 10 of those glasses from Maker Faire.  They were just giving them out.  So I got a stack and I shared them with all the people.  You didn't share one with me.  Well, John had them.

Start time: 9907.52
End time: 9924.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and the thought going into that was that, or at least the rumors were pointing  to, oh, Google's buying HTC like it once bought Motorola.  It's not a good or a bad idea.  Instead they just kind of bought a bunch of people.  Yeah.  And HTC said.  Not HTC as a whole, but just a bunch of HTC.

Transcript:  We're hiring all the BlackBerry folks.  They're coming over.  Yeah.  Big story, of course, one of the biggest stories of the year, Equifax.  It got breached 143, 157, 100, who knows how many records exfiltrated from Equifax.  The credit reporting company that knows everything about every American.  And one can pretty much assume that your information was in that hack.  But helpfully, Equifax put up a website at another random address that didn't really  seem to be Equifax, but was offering you a free, a year's worth of free credit monitoring,  which would then of course convert to paid credit monitoring.  Because if you can't make money on a data breach, what can you do?

Our good friend and dear contributor, Jerry Pornell, passed away in September.  It was a great loss.  We love Jerry.  And we made a nice tribute to Jerry that week.  In fact, you probably could find it on youtube.com slash twit.  We were, we were sorry to lose him, but he was a great contributor for many years to  our network.  Boy, I think we're almost to the end of the year.  Have I missed any massive stories that happened?  Equifax is the big one that I'd almost missed.  Uber lost its license in London.  We mentioned that the iPhone 8 came out and the iPhone 10.

Transcript:  Oh, Twitter, 280 characters.  That has not, as everybody thought it would, has not ruined Twitter.  In fact, it seems to have made Twitter kind of a better place.  More usable.  I kind of understand tweets now.  Many tweets in the past have been completely cryptic to me or now make sense.

Transcript:  So it's easier to share a tweet storm now.  Ah, OK.  I never did like tweet storm.  Also, another big story.  Since we last mentioned Bitcoin, I think it's risen to about $50,000.  And it's back down.  Oh, wait, yeah.  Two weeks ago.  It's up.  It's down.

Start time: 10080.36
End time: 10093.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's up.  Yeah.  You know what is up and down also were the stories that Sprint and T-Mobile would merge.  Then they wouldn't merge.  Then they would merge.  T-Mobile is like the poison pill.  Then they wouldn't merge.

Transcript:  Still, by the way, in limbo, the AT&T Time Warner acquisition.  And there's an investigation going on.  And some say it's politically motivated because Time Warner owns CNN.  That's being held up right now by regulators.  So there's nothing to report there.  That's been going on all year.

Transcript:  This was the year Apple decided that if you tweeted uppercase I, you really should get an A and a question mark.  I saw recently a decal that said A question mark, heart, New York.  I love that.  It was primarily celebrities that didn't notice that auto correction.  Even though it has been fixed.

Transcript:  I think this was also a general trend over the year of people sort of regretting what they had created.  Around the iPhone anniversary there were a lot of people, I think Johnny Ive said,  sometimes I do regret that we've created this phone that is taking over people's lives.  Two people from Facebook.  First, the Napster guy who's name is Justin Timberlake.  Sean Farrin.  Sean Parker.  Sean Parker.  He said he regretted being part of Facebook.  Just this week.  Someone else said his name I can't pronounce also said that.

I feel like we had a great time on 2017.  We're looking forward to gathering again next year to look back at 2018.  Let's ask as we close out our year end.  What do you think, I didn't prepare you for this, the big stories ahead for 2018.  What will be the trend, what will 2018 bring?  You don't have to be innovative or original.  You can come up with something that you just think, let's start with you Jason Howell.  You look like you might have an idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think regulation is a big key point going into 2018.  Like we were talking earlier, these really big companies have lived their lives very successfully at the top of the heap.  By moving fast, breaking things.  I think that's going to start slowing down a lot.  The EU is already putting things into place that's placing pressure, setting precedent for the United States.  For other countries to follow suit.  I don't think that the tech companies will have much choice but to oblige.  Hopefully that helps to clean up shop a little bit.  So we don't find ourselves in such muddy water as we have.

Transcript:  I do not think we've seen the end of people pulling away from Facebook like we talked about earlier.  And thinking maybe I don't want this to be my social network.  I don't think we've seen the end of the Me Too movement of women coming out and saying I was treated this way.  And people apologizing, people leaving quickly.  Like I said before, I think there is a zero tolerance policy.  I don't know where it ends.  But I hope it doesn't end where it gets so bad that women start being not believed.

Start time: 10351.49
End time: 10386.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would be a bad pendulum swing.  I agree with you.  I think that that's not going to happen.  I think that we'll look back and feel like there was kind of this crazed frenetic frenzy of accusations.  Some of them overblown, some of many of them not.  But I do hope we don't have a regret about that.  I hope what we do is we learn the lesson of it.  And men particularly moving forward learn to behave better around women.  Father Robert, what do you think 2018 will bring besides a return to Rome?  Indeed.

Transcript:  I'm thinking that 2018 is probably going to be the year of machine learning, of neural networking.  Not just as a buzzword or a research topic.  You're actually going to see some major manufacturers who are baking it into especially security products.  Because that's one of these places where we need it.  We need something that can actually learn from attempts to disrupt a system how to keep that from happening.  I think a corollary to that is we're also going to see a major screw up with machine learning.  There's going to be something.  Huge.  There's going to be something that some people who are going to figure out how to game machine learning on a particular vendor.  And it will be used to.  We've seen hints of that already.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So and I think I think 2018.

Transcript:  But worse than that, because with this rush to get machine learning into an actual product,  there's going to be unfinished, untested technology.  And anytime you have unfinished, untested technology, you get really bad results.  So there will be at least one really, really bad result for machine learning in 2018.

Transcript:  I think 2018, the chaos will deepen.  This has been a very chaotic year with the news coming fast and furious.  Oh, man.  The new normal.  Yeah.  Silicon Valley has been rocked by that, but so has the rest of the country.  It's been a very tough year.  But most importantly, I think 2018 will be the year we could safely say the headphone jack is gone for good.  I think that's that's my number one story.  Is that a good thing or a bad thing?  I'm not making any judgment.  It's a thing.  I'm just saying this will be the end of the line for the headphone jack.  Twenty eighteen.  Yeah, folks, we have always had so much fun.  We feel so lucky to be able to do this show.  I mean, this is amazing that we can get together and talk about tech every day and that you give us the privilege of joining you in your daily life, whether it's in the car in your home.  We thank you so much for listening and watching and participating.  We couldn't do this without you.  I thank my great colleagues, not just the four of us in front of the camera, but the many people behind the camera who work so hard to make it happen.  Like our producer, Karsten Bonny, and our studio manager, John Slinina and our CEO, Lisa Kensel.  Actually, she's got married.  So Lisa Laporte, who, in fact, keeps the money flowing in so that we can keep the cameras and the lights turned on.  We have a great team here and it is a real privilege and honor to work with them and to create this for you.  We thank you so much.  I wish all of you a very peaceful and happy New Year 2018.  And we will be here for you each and every day.  Thanks for joining us.  Thank you, everybody.  Have a great New Year.  Happy Christmas.  If you haven't celebrated yet, Happy New Year.  We'll see you next time.  Another twit is in the can.  Bye bye.  Have a good New Year.  Have a happy New Year, everybody.
