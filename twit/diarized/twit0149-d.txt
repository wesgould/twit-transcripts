Transcript:  Oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  to love from people you trust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is twins.  Bandwidth for this weekend completa  is provided by Al radio.  ali alto com slash podcasting  This is twit this week in tech episode 149 for June 30th 2008.  Bill Gates, not even.  This week in tech is brought to you by audible.com for your free audio book.  Visit audible.com slash twit and by listeners like you.  Thanks for your donations.  So we've got the panel here.  Bill McCrone, of course, longtime editor of PC magazine.  John C. Dvorak, who is famous for so many things, including the work.org slash blog,  but also a longtime columnist at PC magazine, among others.  And Jerry Pornell, for years wrote the chaos manner column,  the user column at Byte magazine.  And it's appropriate to have a bunch of old timers today because  Friday was Bill Gates last day at Microsoft, or at least so they say.  John's looking at the ceiling now. Am I driving you crazy already?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I'm telling you, this Bill Gates thing is a bunch of PRBS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's not leaving. He's not going anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, just to get right to it, I have a column running in PC mag dot com on Monday,  which kind of expresses my feelings.  If he's still on the board of directors as the chairman, this is not retiring.  Retiring is leaving the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, he's not going to be there for day to day.  So what?  OK, well, it's been a great show.  Thank you all for joining us.  I thought we could do, you know, kind of so long, Bill, we hardly knew you.  You know, we hardly knew him. Great story.  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yesterday's face constantly. Yeah, we knew him way too well.  Yes, we knew him all too well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yesterday's account.  I've been doing a count on a daily basis of how many articles  or redundant articles about Bill Gates quitting.  And it's been running about nine hundred a day.  And then we hit eleven hundred hit a thousand on Thursday,  then hit eleven hundred on Friday.  And so I did the count yesterday on Saturday and it was sixteen hundred.  Holy cow. But it's a great story.  What's the story? I'll tell you the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll set it up since you don't want to give me the time of day.  The story is 311, by the way, the story is 311.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The story is here's a guy who, you know, 30, what was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thirty two years ago, 33 years ago, was an undergraduate at Harvard.  He gets all excited about the MITS Altair computer, writes basic for it  without even access to the machine.  Paul Allen wrote the base. Well, he and Paul Allen, whoever did it,  without access to the machine, they write an emulator, they write the base,  they fly to Albuquerque, they pray it works.  It does work.  They start a little business with just a handful of people.  Very geeky looking people, if you look at those old pictures,  that eventually becomes one of the great success stories of all time.  He creates an industry where none existed.  He created an industry about selling software.  There's plenty of it.  Now you're taking the tack that Bill Gates invented the business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm saying he...  Even though his software ran on CPM and would have done just,  and the whole business would have done just fine if it wasn't for,  you know, if he existed or not.  Well, but I guess my position is that he invented the notion of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You could pay for software. Don't you think before Bill Gates...  CPM wasn't free.  And worse than that...  CPM.  See, the problem is I'm here with you now, so you have to actually deal with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have to deal with you. I could just ignore you otherwise.  The difference also is that during that era when the competitor was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  CPM was basically free. You got it with the computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There was elections involved with CPM.  No, it wasn't free.  But you did have to write bios for it for most of the machines.  Yeah, no, that's not true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The real fix of all that crap was not really until Windows came out in the 90s.  But let's go back to this...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what is Bill Gates... What is his accomplishment?  I don't think that he really has one.  I do.  Okay.  Jerry Pornell.  Why should we credit Bill Gates with anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Unlike Jobs, Gates really did have the vision of a computer in every house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And on every desk and in every classroom.  And he really meant it.  They had that written.  That was the mission statement for Microsoft.  It had it written in concrete as you come up the path of Microsoft and Redmond.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But people always leave out the last part.  A computer in every whatever office, home, desk running Microsoft software.  Well, I think that's the problem.  Well, that's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the first part of it is the real vision.  And nobody else had it.  So the idea of ubiquitous computers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  I have to give you...  I think that that's something you can give him credit for.  Absolutely.  IBM didn't have that vision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  IBM had a vision of a hundred thousand computers all running IBM software.  Absolutely true.  Let me mention one more thing.  OK, I'll give him credit for that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  And that's probably a good observation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Although I'm not absolutely sure that he didn't lift that from David Bennell when Bennell was at MITS or who knows what.  But let's say that he's got that down.  I think to be honest about I think his real genius, which was explored in an early interview done with him in PC magazine.  And I don't know it's before or after as if Davis took it over.  But there was this long interview with Bennell.  Where he talked about the fact that you could write bloated software and seriously.  And he saw the fact that you could write this kind of bloated software and the CPUs were going to improve so much on a yearly basis that it didn't make any difference.  And so you could you could really, you know.  Well, he certainly lived that dream.  Yeah.  Now actually, actually, the software has never gotten this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, it used to be more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't do bloated software jokes in any way.  Because the CPUs and the hard disk.  He was right.  Yeah.  No, he was dead on.  It was.  But it was a weird concept.  And it was a very.  That was visionary.  So he was.  So, OK, correct me then.  So you're saying that it wasn't he wasn't the first company to make really make software be a viable business proposition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He didn't.  I haven't.  I haven't.  I haven't say Gary was doing reasonably well with digital research.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It isn't as if that company were doomed.  The problem is, Gary didn't have the kind of ambition that Gates had.  No one has the kind of ambition that Bill Gates had.  I understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But Gary wouldn't have thought in terms of 100 million computers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  So it was really Bill Gates' goal to make software be a viable business proposition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Bill Gates grandiosity that made him unique.  I think it was focus.  Focus is another word for it.  Grand vision and focus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it the case that he really isn't a technologist that he uses his real skill set was in business?  You think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it became that.  But I think initially he was a coder.  I mean, that's what he always bragged about.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He was a hell of a programmer.  You did not want to go head to head with Gates in a programming contest.  Believe me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  We sent our best guy.  We sent Charlie Petzold to compete with him and he lost.  Compete?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How?  Actually, it's a story I had in mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tell me that story, Bill McCurry.  Gary, you were there, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think Gary was there.  Well, you go on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was your guy.  But yeah, nobody was better than Gates in those days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Jerry, what's the story?  There was a competition?  There were plenty of them.  Bill would say, okay, come on.  I'm going to take you on.  Who could beat me?  Cage match.  Who's the best programmer in the world?  What do you mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly.  He would have coding contests.  Talk about hubris.  About what year is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is this at 84, 81?  When is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is in the 286 to 386 era.  No, it was later then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's see.  I'll get it.  Keep going.  A little high.  86, 87.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But in the late 80s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There were earlier ones in that too.  Boy, in the 286.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So how would these, Jerry, how would these competitions go?  Would you have a problem set that you had to solve?  How did this work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was the one I was at was that you had a problem set to solve.  Use any language you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What language did Gates use?  Basic.  He used basic.  And Charlie Petzl did what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He actually wrote in Assembler.  Wow.  Which he set himself a really wicked task.  Could you bring your own macros or anything or you had to start from scratch?  Well, you would bring your own programming library,  but you had no idea what the problem was until you got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you remember what the problem was in this particular competition?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you had to draw circles of varying sizes on the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this is kind of, I think this is something that people who know the Bill Gates of our era probably find a little hard to believe.  So he was actually in there programming.  He would sit down at the computer and write the software.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Let's put it in perspective here.  Trivia question of the moment is what was the last product that Bill Gates actually wrote code for?  Jerry, you probably know this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I probably know it and don't remember it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK.  Well, I'll jog your memory.  And it was the TRS-80 Model 100.  Oh, jeez.  OK.  Which is a 1983 machine.  Is that the basic for that?  No, he wrote part of the operating system, rewrote the basic for it, and did a couple of other odds and ends, wrote some of the I.O. stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's pretty impressive.  Nothing to knock either.  That's one of the great computers of all time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Isaac Asimov used the damn thing till the day he died.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're kidding. Really?  That's what he wrote on?  I am not kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isaac loved the TRS-80.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But he wrote no other commercial code after that.  What he did was desk review.  And that's when some of those infamous incidents happened where he would climb up on the table and scream and throw printout around saying, I could write better code in my sleep.  And kick piles of printout over and yell at people and have tantrums.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He had some credibility in that.  I mean, if this guy's a good programmer, you listen to him, right?  Otherwise, you just laugh when he does something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It might well have been true.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He scared people into doing a better job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I remember that, and I've talked about this book many times, because it's still one of my favorite books as a budding programmer, it's a Microsoft book called Programmers at Work.  And they have a chapter with Bill Gates on it.  And he proudly shows how tight and concise his original basic code was.  And you could tell he took great pride in the fact that he wrote such tight code.  I mean, that was the thing he was most proud of.  Well, we all did then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You had to.  Let me bring up an anecdote then.  All right.  In the book Barbarians and Bill Gates.  There's a book, there's a Barbarians at the Gate.  No, that's the one about Nabisco.  Barbarians and Bill Gates, which was written by Pam Edstrom's daughter and one of the head guys at Microsoft.  Oh, nice converts, by the way.  Thank you for suggesting that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And a guy who was, I can't, you guys might remember who it was, but it's one of the guys who went to the head of Windows Project.  And it's a story about Windows and how they changed the name because it was going to be something stupid.  And he tells the story that he was looking at some advanced code, supposedly, and I guess it was in Windows.  And he looked at it and he says, this is unbelievably bad.  This is the worst code I've ever read.  It's like amateurish and crummy.  This is in the book, by the way.  And he says he turns around, it was Bill Gates and he found out later it was Bill Gates who wrote that code.  Somehow I knew that was coming.  You guys don't read the book, I guess.  It's a good book if you want a history of Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So is Bill Gates the programmer that he seems to think he is or not?  That's the question.  We've talked about this before.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you give me a second, I'll answer that.  All right.  I'll give you a second.  It depends on what you mean by how good a programmer.  What Gates did was exactly what John pointed out in that interview.  He understood Moore's law.  Right.  If you can make it run at all, ship it.  Right.  Because the hardware will bail you out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  IBM never understood that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They kept trying to write tight code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  IBM was going to make it perfect before they shipped it.  The result was what you see.  Now, is that good programming?  It certainly is good given the way the world works.  It's pragmatic.  But more than that, it was foreseeably good.  Yeah.  It was the right strategy.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that that's a reasonable...  Yeah, no, I think it was genius.  ...point of view.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And Vista is the latest example of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Good enough.  Vista on a quad, 6,600 or better, works just fine.  Yeah.  But I sure don't like it on a core two duo of an earlier era.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Steve Jobs, when they were designing the Macintosh,  the Macintosh is famous for saying, you know, great artists ship.  If you don't get it out...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, what good is it?  What good is it?  It's like me and my book on the Depression.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, we'll see it someday.  Where's that book?  Let's hope it happens before the Depression  because nobody's going to want it after the Depression.  I'll be out in shortly.  Is it?  Shortly is when?  Like a month?  What am I doing sitting here?  Get to work, Dvorak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  John, John, send me a review copy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll send you some proofs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, good.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Really?  It's already in proof?  When I get it in proofs, I'll send you some proofs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got to go through one other editor guy who's going to help me out.  I understood him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He'll send proofs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He spoke the words.  I'm speaking the lingo.  The lingo, the writer's lingo.  We make our living writing books, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So let's address this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Then there's no reason to write the epitaph for Bill Gates.  He's still going to be just as much of a player at Microsoft.  He's just going to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, according to my column running on Monday in PCMag.com.  Did you mention that yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because I think we should probably give that a little plug there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm of the belief that we're going to hear more from Bill, not less.  More?  Publicly more?  Yeah.  Well, I believe you're right.  He's going to be more of a pest than he ever was when he actually had to work the day to day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wish he were more of a...  When I read that email that he sent out, we talked about this last week, from 19...  A few years ago, bemoaning how hard it was to use Microsoft's website and download updates.  I thought, gosh, that's right on.  I think we should hear more of that kind of Bill Gates.  I hope he's beaten up on Microsoft like that.  Could be.  He's apparently not making any headway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, he certainly hasn't since that memo.  Maybe that's the case.  I want to hear more from him, but not in computers.  I want him to change the world.  If he would put up a $10 billion prize for the first outfit to put 31 Americans on the moon  and keep them there alive and well for three years and a day,  he would be remembered when Isabella the Great is long forgotten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, maybe he's paying attention.  He might be listening to this.  Bill?  Well, he's going to spend $30 or $40 billion on philanthropy.  $10 billion of that on...  Is that all it would take, Jerry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's all it would take me to do it as a prize.  Like the X Prize.  Like the X Prize, yeah.  Right. The first outfit that does it gets the money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, how much is Google putting up for the trip to Mars?  What is Google's X Prize, the new X Prize?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like a hundred million, but they've put so many rules around it  that nobody seems to want to compete for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wonder if they can keep 35 people alive in Redmond.  Not without life support.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's harsh.  I mean, Microsoft is not...  I mean, okay, it's a demanding place to work for, but it's still...  It's not the tech prize that it once was, but it's still a place where you can,  as a programmer, contribute a lot and make stuff happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have you ever heard the story of why the offices are all the same size?  No, why?  Gordon Ledwin took a tape measure to Chris Peters' office  and discovered Chris Peters had two more feet of room in his office.  And Ledwin went mad and Gates said, that did it.  And from that point on, they were all identical.  Huh, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Could be true.  I totally believe that.  That is true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I tried to do that at Tech TV, but nobody would listen.  You wanted a bigger office or a bigger...  I just wanted an office.  Good luck.  Any office would have done.  So will Microsoft be a better place, a more productive place,  a more successful company without Bill at the helm?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why not?  I don't think Balmer has vision.  I think Balmer is a captive of the bottom line boys.  And I don't believe Gates ever was truly dedicated to just the bottom line.  He wasn't the bean counter that Balmer is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bill McCrone, do you agree?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't see Steve as so much a bean counter.  I mean, Steve is...  I've been there at times when I guess I wasn't supposed to be,  and I snuck into the back of rooms and watched him haranguing the troops  and firing up the salespeople and so forth.  He's good at that.  Yeah, he really is.  And we've certainly seen the monkey boy and some of the other videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Developers, developers, developers.  Yeah.  But that's his job, right?  That was his job anyway, yeah.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And he remains really good at that stuff.  So I give him a lot of credit where that goes.  And I've also been in situations, and interestingly,  all three that I can think of off the top of my head have involved Intel  where there has been some kind of an impasse  that I and others felt would hurt the industry between Intel and Microsoft.  And I got to at least mediate or officiate or bring people to the table  in three instances.  One was the Lotus Intel memory spec,  which became the Lotus Intel Microsoft spec.  The other one was that crazy fax modem spec that involved  memory again.  What was that called?  C?  I'm drawing a blank on it.  And the third was benchmarking, the whole WinStone thing,  which was a huge behind-the-scenes battle between Microsoft and Intel.  Each one had control over the benchmark.  And it's pretty ugly.  So much so that I made my own benchmarks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was in the 286386 era.  And I actually invented my own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, I remember that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That wasn't the CIV benchmark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, that wasn't you.  No, the one I did was inverting matrices because it uses both

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  floating point and integer arithmetic and uses a lot of it.  Arithmetic and uses a lot of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was a pretty cruel benchmark, as I recall.  But the interesting point about Steve was that when Push came to shove,  it was Steve who came to the table and negotiated with the Intel guys  and told me, okay, we're about to make the sausage, Bill.  You can leave the room.  Oh, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Bill would leave.  Bill would actually leave.  You wanted Bill McCrone to leave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, Bill McCrone.  No, Bill McCrone had to leave because my editorial goal was just to get  them together and make them see each other's viewpoints and why it was  good or bad for the industry and then get out of there.  Gates never was involved with that stuff.  It was always Steve who would be butting heads for months and then finally  see the light, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I always thought of Bill as being a tough negotiator, though.  Was Bill not a good negotiator?  I don't know.  I never negotiated with him.  It seems to me like, I don't know, the deal that he made for DOS, for instance,  that was a good deal.  But who made that deal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We have to talk to Patterson to figure out what really happened there.  I know it was kind of a scam of a deal.  But maybe what McCrone is saying here is that the two of them may have been  better partnered up that way.  It's like Lennon and McCarthy.  Because without Gates, I just, you know, Bomer's a guy.  I like Steve, but I can't even imagine him sitting at a computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, he doesn't seem like a tech guy at all.  He's a salesman.  Yeah, he's like a sales guy.  He's the guy you want to motivate the sales force.  I've known a million of him.  He's the guy, the general sales manager at every radio station I've ever  worked at.  That's who he is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, I understand.  I never said he was a bean counter.  I said he is more likely to be influenced by them.  I don't think he has the kinds of vision Gates is a Gates is a guy that once he  focuses on a vision, it takes sledgehammer to get him off it.  Well, John, you want to weigh in on this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, you've been one of the people who said that the Microsoft is going to  be a better company without Bill Gates.  You still I did.  Didn't you?  Am I wrong?  If I did, it was a passing thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was a passing fancy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I may be I may be misquoting.  I don't want to miss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think it's gonna be a different company.  In fact, I in my Market Watch column, which ran last week in MarketWatch.com.  Is that that's a different one, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  You get one per.  Oh, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I thought that was one an hour.  OK.  So anyway, I got the clock.  I don't care.  Plug all you want.  So anyway, I thought that Microsoft would tend to be fall into the role of kind of  a Honeywell or a Unisys without Gates.  That's depressing.  That's a big they're big money.  It's not interesting.  Unisys.  Are they still around?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  You know, yeah, they make banking systems.  Honeywell.  Are they still around?  Yeah, I have a fan that it says that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, I'm a fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you this is you this is not only around.  They have a very nice conference house over in the south of France near near Marseille.  They took me over there a couple of years ago to spend two weeks lecturing to their  senior visionaries and things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But do they have fine pate and your allsberg and a good versterminer?  I mean, I don't know if there is.  Oh, they have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Believe me.  They're in France.  I'm sure there's some good wine and cheese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There must be something there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have not been to a better luxury hotel than the Unisys conference house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll keep that in mind the next time I get an invitation from.  I'm going to work it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My wife, my wife keeps bashing on me to take her back there sometime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe it'd be more apt to say Microsoft would be kind of like an IBM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think IBM is becoming like Unisys and Honeywell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're all the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  More infrastructure, less vision, more solid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're going in the direction of services and boring, high end enterprise crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  What company files gets more patent awards?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  IBM's got all.  John taught me that.  Year in, year out.  John taught me that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They always.  I know, but IBM is slowly giving up that whole part of the business.  When they sell Vermont, you know, Vermont Junction or whatever it is,  their last microprocessor development area and fab, I think it's over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're still doing a lot of basic research and there's darn few companies who are anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They sold Almond in research to Hitachi.  I just think it's a downhill slide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is there a natural kind of life cycle in tech companies?  I mean, is Microsoft at the kind of the down, not on the downhill slope?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Happens pretty fast, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It does happen.  They're 30 years old.  That's a long time in tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But one thing is Microsoft seems to have lost its soul in the last few years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, isn't Bill Gates Microsoft's soul?  Who better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He somehow wasn't.  He lost interest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He got married, had kids, found philanthropy.  He lost interest.  That's a piece of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they used to be a code house.  They used to make money selling code.  That was the original.  They don't do that anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they don't do that anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the old Bill Gates speech that I always was so fond of.  He used to give this great speech about what they did, which was sell, make and sell code.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  So I want to hear some stories.  I want you old time.  I brought you old timers on for a reason.  I want to hear some stories about it.  Thank you, Jerry.  I want to hear some stuff.  Jerry, we're going to have to edit your coughing out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no.  That's what I'm saying.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I need to get a cough button on this damn Microsoft phone.  I push the button and it flashes red for mute.  It mutes us.  Not you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the problem.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm afraid so.  That's all right.  I think it's great.  As soon as I say old timers, there we go.  No, but the reason I got you guys on is I wanted to have people who go back to the beginning  with Bill Gates, who have some stories to tell.  I mean, John, you used to make, you used to give speeches with video of the Bill Gates.  You'd take his speech and you'd edit it all down and you used a video toaster, which is  a precursor to this tricaster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  I actually, the one video I made was I caught one of his keynotes at CES and that's, and  he swallows a lot while he's talking.  He kind of swallows.  I think they trained that out of him later.  And makes a little gulping thing.  And so I edited together so there's nothing but that.  And it went five minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a good video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Five minutes out of 45 was just gulping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's pretty cool.  He's never been, but you know, that's part of his charm.  He's never been a, you know, a great front man.  He's a geek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, he had, when he was, one of my, one of the memorable speeches he gave  once when he was pushing the CD-ROM business, information at your fingertips was his keyword,  which I was told was stolen from, what's the name of Gibson, Bill?  William Gibson?  No, no, no, no, not that one.  Not that one.  The, what, what, what's the name of the, the Bill, the guy who was one of, he was, there  was like Gates, Jobs, and then the guy who ran personal software.  Oh yeah.  Gibbons.  Fred Gibbons.  Fred Gibbons, I'm sorry.  Fred Gibbons.  Fred Gibbons.  Fred Gibbons came up to me one day about a few years after that term was going around.  He comes up to me, he says, and this was after he had a stroke, which is really a problem.  I really feel bad about Fred having that stroke because he was one of the main players in  the industry.  He comes up to me, he says, John, you got it.  He says, this is bull, this information at your fingertips.  I'm the one who gave Bill the term.  And he had this long anecdote about when he told Bill.  Oh man.  And he just thought he was ripped off.  And I wrote it up in a PC magazine inside track, but you know, nobody cares.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it may even be true, but that is the whole point, isn't it?  Gates was the guy who saw that CD-ROMs would change the world.  And he put on that big conference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They only changed the world for a year and a half, by the way.  It was kind of a brief fling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, because something else did.  But the point was that the readers went from the thousands of dollars down to under a hundred  in a very short period of time.  And it really did change the world.  Everything after that was incremental improvement.  Now, once again, Gates had that vision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And he had the pulpit from which he had the pulpit and the position and the power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that first conference, you may remember that Phillips had its own plan for marketing CD-ROMs  through record companies.  And Phillips came to his conference and rained on his picnic.  And that was when Microsoft was a, what, a $12 billion company?  And Phillips was a $40 billion company.  And they basically threatened him with ruin.  Gates just went right ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that's another thing that we probably don't remember very well,  at least that those of us who remember Bill Gates in the last few years,  is Microsoft wasn't the dominant power until the last 10 years that it is today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Lotus was kicking their ass early on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. When did it turn for, was it for Microsoft? Was it with Windows 95? When did Microsoft?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When Windows 95 closed the door on everybody.  But the real disappointment was the Lotus people were brain dead.  And there's this theory that goes around the industry.  People bring it up and both Jerry and Bill have heard it.  And Sun brings it up occasionally. And pundits bring it up, which is that, yeah, you're, you know,  and it refers to Sun, actually.  If Sun, if Sun, Microsystems, had Bill Gates as the CEO, they'd be kicking Microsoft's butt.  It's just the guy.  It's just the guy because, again, like Jerry says, he's focused and he has a vision and he sticks to it.  I think with the CD-ROM thing, he stuck to it too long, which is why they missed the internet.  But Apple missed the internet too in a much bigger way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, you know, you make a good point about the guy at the helm because,  and being over-focused because Scott McNealy and Bill Joy could only think in terms of mini computers  and distributed computing and just like deck, you know, Ken Olson could only think in terms of deck computers.  But Bill has been extraordinarily facile in moving from technology to technology as long as Microsoft had a finger in the pie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and do remember why Gates went so agitated back in that period when Microsoft was not so dominant.  The internet computer was going to put him out of business, remember?  They bragged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  May still, by the way, put him out of business. It just took longer than he thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It took a lot longer than you thought.  Meanwhile, he had this running fight with IBM over OS2.  John, you were there. He had that big conference.  John was a huge OS2 fan. I remember that very well.  Well, but he had Gates had that big conference where we met over in Bellevue and took buses out to the new campus.  We had a new building set up for press events and he was putting on the big show OS2.  And it was a company with a guide for the future.  And it was all going to be OS2. That was the vision of the future.  Gates gave his talk at like 830 in the morning, 9 o'clock.  The IBM guy got up and said, I think that's wonderful.  Now I got to go back to Florida and left and literally, literally left.  Well, I was at Bill's table at lunch. He had six glasses of wine.  Oh, man.  And you could see the steam coming out of his ear because he had just been dissed in front of the entire technology press and financial analyst community.  And what was supposed to have been his big show.  It was another declaration of war.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And was that when the relations between IBM and Microsoft really took a dive?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Obviously.  Yeah.  Bill introduced the IBM guy as as a friend.  Right.  And all of their charts showed Microsoft as this little piece doing presentation manager.  But OS2 was the new coming operating system.  And this guy, well, he defecated on him from a great height.  He allowed it to reach terminal velocity and then walked out of the room.  I was sitting with Esther at the time.  I looked over to say, yeah, I said, Esther, this means war, doesn't it?  She said, you better believe it.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that was a very volatile time because IBM wanted to reassert.  I mean, it has lost hardware control of the PC market.  But when you started 100 percent of the market, the only way to go is down.  And they thought that OS2 would be their ticket to reasserting their control over the market.  Well, that and Micro Channel.  Well, yeah, Micro Channel was supposedly a hardware solution, but they forgot a few things along the way, like compatibility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like trying to collect back license fees.  It was the stupidest business, stupidest business this station ever made.  You want a license Micro Channel?  Fine.  Pass for the original P.S. Butts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I thought I don't maybe.  Wait, wait, before we finish that little thought on this on this transition period.  You also have to remember what a bunch of boneheads IBM were at the time.  And the fact when they brought the P.S. three, they switched prematurely to the three.  And a lot of people don't remember what a big deal this was, but they prematurely switched to a three and a half disk drive, three and a half inch disk drive with really no five and a quarter inch option except a drive you could buy as an add on that was the size of a truck.  It looked like an aircraft carrier.  And I would say 99 percent of the software at the time was being distributed on five and a quarter inch disks.  So it wouldn't work.  It was ridiculous.  And wait, wait, there's one more thing.  They also brought out the P.S. two line.  And Bill, you'll remember this because we wrote about it extensively with a series of monitors that were flat out fuzzy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they were poor monitors.  The 7514.  I still remember ragging on it.  But, you know, Leo, you said a key word about Bill earlier and pragmatic was the word you used.  And I can give you a good example of Bill that is most pragmatic.  And that was when the Lotus Intel memory spec was being developed.  And if you recall, Lotus needed more than the PC's maximum memory in order to do its job.  So they they invented this wacko bank switched memory scheme and kept it a deep dark secret.  And through a lot of digging and digging and digging, we finally figured out what it was.  But we weren't sure how it was going to work.  So they did a PC magazine technology day up at Microsoft's campus.  And every team that we went to, I closed the interview by asking, so how does this work with the new memory spec?  And the PR guy who Marty Tucker, who was following us around, you know, had no idea why I was asking this question.  And sometimes I get a real technical answer and sometimes I just get a, you know, like a what planet are you from look.  And so by the end of the day, we our last meeting was with Bill and it was comical because it was pure Bill.  We were sitting in this conference room and it was a long, narrow room.  And there was a whiteboard down at one end and we were all seated at the other end.  And every time Bill wanted to make a point, he'd run down to the whiteboard right on it and then run back.  But that was his manic energy. Part of the charm.  You've all seen it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's fun. I mean, that's actually kind of cool that we do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's famous for jumping over chairs, right? That was one of his circus tricks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He used to do that at our party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  At our party? You remember that night? He dabbed there.  I thought either he or Paul were going to throw one or the other over the side there at the hotel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, now you got to tell that story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just want to finish up the. Yeah, go ahead. Yeah.  Yeah, because there is one one juicy thing here where, you know, at the end of his meeting, I said, so what are you?  What do you think about the this new memory spec?  And he slams his fist on the conference table and he says, it's garbage. It's a kludge.  And then he turns and looks at me, says, but we're going to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's the pragmatist right there.  But there's also the engineer.  That's one thing I love about talking about to engineers as opposed to marketing people is they the world is black and white for them.  It either works or it doesn't work. And they'll tell you the truth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'll tell you the one thing I always liked about Bill, even over the years, he's taken a dislike to me.  Has he really? Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's because I'm not you're on the you are on the enemies list. You're on Marty Tauker's enemy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I don't know. That's true. But it's possible.  But anyway, the the I was on a list where I was banned from getting any information.  I have the documents. It was shown up in that Combs versus Microsoft case.  Oh, really? I was there.  Somebody sent me a whole bunch of the documents. Hey, check this out.  You're on these lists. And I was on the list. Do not send this guy anything.  Oh, man. So anyway, so I don't know what the deal was.  But but one thing I have to say, you could always go up to Bill and ask him.  So what have you seen that's interesting?  And you could do that any time.  And he'd always rattle off about six or seven really cool things you've never heard of.  And if you recall him, it's like myself.  You take a mental note or write it down.  You had some really good material.  This guy would have been a gold mine if I could get a hold of him more often.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I used to do that every year at WinHack.  I was never on their bad list. I always went to WinHack.  Bill always showed up at the party that night.  And I would ask him exactly that question that what have you seen that's interesting and mad.  It was hard to stop him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, he was like that's why I think the difference between him and Balmer is that I can't imagine Balmer ever doing that because I still can't see Steve at a terminal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's not a technologist in the way Bill was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's true. Yeah.  Although Esther Dyson once tried to explain, I think we were on the Charlie Rose show or something.  And Charlie's first question was, Win 95, why now?  And I said, because it's a year late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And of course, Rose wouldn't get it.  No, that's the funny thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no. But Steve Law and Esther did.  But the funny thing was that Esther tried to paint Bill as a non-technologist.  Really?  Well, Bill isn't really technical.  That's a surprise.  And I said, well, I guess he wasn't one of her visionary crowd that she was hanging out with at the time.  Weren't they dating though? Didn't Bill and Esther date for a little bit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, never, never.  She dated Bill's girlfriend.  I don't believe so. I don't believe so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, never.  No, that's not Bill's type.  Yeah. Heidi Rosen he dated, but that's another story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. I don't think we need to go into Bill's love life.  Oh, why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, let's talk about a 30-inch vertical leap.  I mean, this guy could leap as high as Michael Jordan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Straight up too, not a running start. We're talking from a standing start.  He tucks his legs. It's not the same thing as a true vertical leap.  Oh, see, this is why he doesn't like you, John. You're dissing his vertical leap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know who cares about it, but you know, the one thing he was good at was ping pong.  And I'll give you another story. No, sir, you think it's funny. He was like a major league ping pong coach.  I don't know why. I'm not surprised in the least.  And then he took up golf because his wife, the golf story is actually kind of interesting.  He took up golf because his wife played a credible game and he couldn't see a woman beating him.  Bill's not a very athletic person naturally, but he hired a full-time coach and his dad used to golf.  And so he played and played and played, and he was coaching, coaching, coaching.  And I've talked to this coach once, and he says, you know, Bill is not...  He plays a credible game now after years and years of being coached, and he can actually play a good round of golf.  And so he's part of that group of golfers who are CEO golfers, which is like a club.  He prefers Bridge though. And the other thing is his Bridge game.  He and Buffett play Bridge nonstop. So one time, here's the, you want these Gates anecdotes.  So one time, and I won't reveal the source of this because I wasn't there secondhand, but apparently they took, you know,  Bill liked to take the rent an entire train and for the friends of Bill and then go traipsing around some part of the world, like Orient Express maybe.  He does this every year. This is like his big vacation. I don't know if he's still doing it.  But whatever the case is, one time he did one in the Grand Canyon.  So he rents this train and he gets special permission.  And this is from the story from somebody on the train, and it wouldn't take much to figure out who I'm talking about.  But anyway, so he gets special permission to go on a kind of a semi-abandoned track that's actually in the bottom of the Grand Canyon,  giving some of the most spectacular views in the world.  Permission and some money, no doubt.  Well, maybe. So he has a bunch of, and meanwhile, apparently during the entire trip, Warren and him,  and I guess another couple of people, played bridge the entire trip and never once looked out the window.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And were they playing for money?  I don't know.  You got to think a penny a point.  Yeah, I would think. Well, Buffett for sure.  I've heard that story too. So I think that sounds like a true story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well, they don't care. They're not. These are not guys, Buffett included.  They're not into the view.  They're not. They don't care about seeing the scenery.  They're not into the view.  They're making their money and playing bridge or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Jerry, did you have the ability to call Bill at any time and say, hey, Bill, what's going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For a while, for a while. But I'll tell you something, until he got married, anybody did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, it was the wife that got in the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All you had to do was call the Microsoft switchboard at about 10 o'clock at night on a Friday night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's who was home. Did he answer the phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nobody. He answered the phone himself.  Microsoft.  Is that your Bill Gates?  Microsoft.  I won $100 from, I won't tell you who it is, but he's a pretty well-known journalist, saying,  I can have you talking to Bill Gates tonight, right now.  Oh, that's hysterical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, you can't.  Come on, tell us, Jerry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I'm not going to. But anyway, I dialed it, handed him this guy the phone and said, he'll answer it.  Microsoft.  I didn't want to. Well, Bill knew my voice. I damn well wasn't going to say anything myself.  Nice, Microsoft. Who can I talk to? Who do you want to talk to?  I got my $100 too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's answering his own phone. And this, by the way, this isn't when there's 20 employees. This is much later.  Yeah, but that ended.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It ended in the mid-March.  It ended with him marrying. But yes, I used to call him in the daytime, even after he married. I got along with Marty all right.  Because Marty understood that I wouldn't waste Bill's time with long rambling nonsense.  Let Bill talk as long as he wanted to. And then I cut him off saying, I got to go.  Bill, I'm sorry. I don't have any more time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't have any more time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What Marty was worried about was the same with Pam Emsner.  Either one of them could get through to him and they're both old friends.  What they were worried about was people wasting Bill's time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you only got one Bill Gates. You got a big company to run.  Speaking of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He called me once too. My phone rang. I picked it up and said, hi, this is Bill Gates. You're about to run a story I don't like.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. I've been there, done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was, well, it was all true. Remember that business when the rumor was that they had spiked up one of the versions of Windows that if you ran a pirated copy, it would trash your hard disk.  Ooh. And they did that? Really?  No, they did not. But a terrible thing happened.  A summer hire at Microsoft put into the code.  They did the test to see if it was a pirated copy, but it did nothing.  Except a summer hire put into the code a message.  I see you're using a pirated copy now, trashing your hard disk.  Oh, yep. I remember that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's all it did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It didn't actually trash your hard disk. It just scared the hell out of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It did. But at the exact same time, there was a virus that set things up so that a file was never closed. And anything you wrote to the disk went into that file until it overflowed and blew everything up.  Now you hadn't lost anything except what you'd saved to that bad file.  That had nothing to do with the message you understand.  And Bill basically called to tell me, look, it was a summer hire put in this stupid message and it has nothing to do with the real problem.  And the way you solve the real problem is this way.  Give me a damn good call.  I bet it did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you remember him calling you, Bill?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, several times.  To complain?  Yeah.  What a pretty call. To say hi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To invite you to a bridge game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We were at a, I guess it was one of the developer forums.  No, it must have been either the Dyson forum or one of those things.  And he was on a panel and I was sitting in the audience.  And as the room was emptying out, he stood up from behind the cloth covered table and started yelling at me.  That review of Microsoft Project was so unfair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's good. By the way.  That's better than yours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Bill McCrone has now officially the best Bill Gates impression.  That's kind of a swallowing a thing.  It's a little Kermit the Frog kind of a thing.  A little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Exactly. But he harangued me for about five minutes.  People who were leaving the room stopped dead in their tracks.  They all turned around. They started filing back in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sure. That's a kind of notoriety, Bill. That's something to be proud of.  I think I remember that one.  You're probably there, Jerry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Too bad you didn't have a bunch of magic tricks you could have done right then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Bill, I'd like to impress you with my magic now.  Let's get on with the fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I first met...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go ahead, Bill.  Okay. First of all, your audience probably doesn't know that he was an instant sleeper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No. I don't even know what an instant sleeper is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He did not require any time to fall asleep.  He was like Thomas Alva Edison. He could nap anywhere, anytime.  When he was on planes, he always flew coach.  I remember seeing him many times on San Francisco to Seattle, kinds of runs and things like that.  He was always the guy with the blanket pulled over his head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's famous for arriving at the airport one minute before the gate closes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. There's a great story about that too because it was a contest.  He and Balmer would travel.  Hopefully, all of the top guys would do this and they had kind of a running thing to see who could make it.  How late you could leave.  Who could run from Redmond to Seattle and dump the car and so forth.  Bill told me one time that he wanted hands down that no one would ever beat his time, which was like 17 minutes.  But there was a caveat and that was that he left his Jaguar running outside the terminal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what happens when you're worth billions. I don't need the Jag. I'm going to make the plane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was one of those old 3.8s. It was really a disreputable car.  But he kept it forever.  He had to call from the plane and get to ask somebody to come down to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Steve, will you go turn the Jag off? I left it running.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sure it was towed in no time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is pre-911. I'm sure it was there. All right. That's funny.  So he would get in the plane. He would cover his head with a blanket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know who else does that? Esther Dyson.  Again, it was Esther.  I wonder if they got that from each other.  Maybe they taught each other the trick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Esther was into yoga and she would fold herself up like a jackknife.  She would put her feet up vertically with her calves on the back of the seat in front of her and fall asleep.  It was the most astounding thing.  Oh, and Bill hated when all of his other employees would upgrade and sit in first class.  For some reason, Bill thought that buying a coach ticket and flying coach, no matter how many miles you had, was the thing to do.  He doesn't fly coach anymore. He doesn't fly commercial anymore.  In the late, Bill, I saw Gates a couple of times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, by 1995, he was still buying coach tickets, but he was not flying coach, I can assure you.  I was on a Delta flight with him and it was like they literally dragged him out of coach.  They wouldn't let him fly coach.  They wouldn't let him fly coach.  And put him in first class and kick somebody out of first class, some poor schmuck who actually paid for a ticket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, if Nick Nolte showed up and is sitting back in the coach, they're going to drag him up front.  I mean, that's just the way the airline is going to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It depends on whether he combs his hair, but whatever.  But I got to tell you.  I have a rim shot.  Anyway, I don't think he's flown coach since the mid-90s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He doesn't fly commercial anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'm sure he flies his own NetJet.  Well, you know, he's got a Challenger.  What's a Challenger?  Is that a private jet you can stand up in?  You know, it's like a G-Fly.  It's one of the big, big, point-nail-prime knows what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, sure.  Got to fly out to my DCX launching in one of those.  Oh, how fun.  Well, Congressman Rohrabacher arranged it, of course, not my airplane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You want real money, go to a congressman.  Those are the guys.  Yeah, those are the guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Belong to McDonnell Douglas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And so did Congressman Rohrabacher, I understand.  No, no.  Okay, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it certainly was the biggest employer in his district.  So he's certainly going to pay attention to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Absolutely, absolutely.  I don't think you've had anything to do with one another.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Dana was my student as an undergraduate, so he's a little afraid of me to this day, I think.  Oh, that's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So what other Bill Gates stories do we...  I remember, you know, I've read all the trashy biographies of Bill Gates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because they're actually, they were probably overdue for another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we are.  I'll tell you, when I met him, I went to, you remember the Southern California Computer Society?  Sure.  Well, they met at Harvard School, which is about a mile from where I am.  And I went to one once.  This is before I was writing for BIDAR, just as I was beginning to.  I had an old Crumemco...  Crumemco.  Crumemco, yes.  CPM.  S100.  Yeah, S100 bus.  And I went to this, and here is this squirt.  I mean this kid who is selling Ailtair BASIC on paper tapes.  The meetings were two nights, and he's selling them for $20.  And he's hawking them out of a bag he's got of them.  And the next day, everybody else is selling copies for five bucks.  Oh, he was pissed about that.  He almost went out of his mind.  I think that was the night on which he really got this bug about piracy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's quite a famous...  He went to the Homebrew Computer Club.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was going to say, Homebrew was where he's famous for that speech about...  He came out.  You're stealing my tapes. Stop stealing my tapes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but this was about a week earlier than that meeting.  He was making all the computer society meetings.  And SCCS in those days was bigger than Homebrew.  Says you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Says a Los Angelino, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Bill is famous for being kind of an autodidact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They talk about in one of these books,  vacationing with girlfriend at the time, Anne Wimblad of Hummer Wimblad,  and bringing with him big books about biotech,  the red books of lectures of surely you, Jess, Mr. Feynman.  Right.  Yeah, and just really loved to learn stuff more than...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You never got his degree, so he never relaxed.  I mean, it's like I don't read anything.  Yeah, you got your degree.  You got nothing to prove.  I don't need to read.  You can relax now, John.  I let some other people tell me stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I just listen. I don't need to learn.  People will tell me. If I didn't know it, I'm sure somebody would tell me it.  It's a fact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, I read a lot and I've got a couple of doctorates  and I'm supposed to know something about a lot of things.  I don't believe I ever stuck up a conversation with Gates  in which he didn't know maybe not as much as I did about the subject,  but he was certainly up there with what I would have said  would have been my best student.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He was a smart guy. There's no doubt about that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He reads a lot, he remembers a lot, and he organizes what he knows pretty well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Some say he had a photographic memory.  Would you say that's the case or no?  I have no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I doubt it.  I don't think so.  I think he's just voracious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, voracious.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it would depend on...  Leo, it would depend on when.  I had an adectic memory until I was about 21.  It's all downhill after that, isn't it, Jerry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  For one reason, I got interested in Dianetics for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought I could get my adectic memory back, but you can't.  Oh, really? Were you a Scientologist, Jerry?  No, Scientology didn't exist in 1950.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you were probably friends with Ron though, right?  I mean, you must have known him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I never met Ron, but I read his book, and of course Mr. Heinlein,  who was one of Ron's friends, was a good friend of mine.  Right.  But no, I thought maybe it would work.  I could get my photographic memory back, but in fact, you could not.  It didn't work for me at least.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe I could get one in the first place. That would be nice.  Why?  I don't know, that I'd remember stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can just do something to brag about. It's useless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you have the Internet now. You don't need it.  You know, Google... I got what they call Google-assisted memory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's so much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's an astute observation.  Google pretty well does substitute for an adectic memory,  so long as you can remember enough of a phrase to have a unique hit on.  I think that's absolutely true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I tell you, during the radio show, frequently,  I'll pull up what I need to know from Google fast enough  that it sounds like I'm actually remembering something.  It's unbelievable.  You've heard me do it.  Yeah, so let's bring up one more issue here,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  which is that...  What do you guys think about the commentary by Steve  that Microsoft is going to generate more than half of its income in the future  based on advertising revenues?  That's a pleasant fiction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's where they're going, though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's where they want to go is online.  Mesh advertising?  You know, the market economy isn't big enough to support that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I'm just saying that off the top of my head,  but I'm sure I could Google up something that would prove it,  but I just don't think it's possible.  And not only that, what would be the point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I said in one of my columns that Microsoft dodged a bulletin  when the Yahoo deal fell through.  It was the best thing that could ever happen to them.  I've said the same thing from the first day I heard that rumor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so if...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look, the problem is within three years,  we're going to have 64 core CPUs.  64 cores.  Within how long? Three years?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Four.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Three or four?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you one of those people that believes the singularity is near,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the Ray Kurzweil singularity?  I've had that argument with Ray, and no, I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the point is we're going to have computers  that have what amounts to infinite computing power,  infinite memory, and infinite mass storage.  And we have got software that can't strain what we have now.  The people that are going to make money  are the ones who are going to figure out how a guy  who knows how to do something useful  and doesn't care about computer science  can sit down and teach the damn machine to do something useful  without having to spend four years learning to program.  Never happened.  Given all that computing power, I think it will happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Never happened, Jerry. You're living in a dream world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We've talked about this before, though, the notion that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Texas Instruments essentially gave up on natural language programming.  They worked at it for a while, and they did some fairly impressive stuff,  but the hardware limits were just too good, no good.  They couldn't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're saying that they're going to catch up.  Hardware is going to catch up now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the hardware has gone way ahead.  What I'm saying is that the people who can write software  to make use of this bloody hardware  are the ones that are going to get rich.  The heck with advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How long before computers start writing their own software?  Why do humans even write software?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Computer-assisted programming was a big deal during the 80s.  It went away.  I never hear of it anymore.  It never worked.  I think it didn't work, but again, the hardware couldn't support it.  Just as.  Jerry, not to be argumentative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But why not?  I remember the first time I saw voice recognition stuff from IBM,  and they kept this promise.  It'll work eventually, John.  It'll work eventually.  Let me just say the one thing that I've subscribed to,  and I picked this up very early on in the late 1970s  from Lee Felsenstein, of all people,  who was the original architect of the.  And the Homebro Computer Club, early member.  He made this interesting comment that I've always thought was interesting.  He made an interesting comment that I always thought was probably salient.  Yes.  Thank you.  I thought I'd throw in a word there just to see if it worked.  Anyway, Lee says, you know, it's just like with horses.  It is.  He says with horses, you have, you know, there were words that you could tell a horse to do,  like, and he had like.  You can lead a horse to culture, but you can't make it say you could horses do not understand plain English.  Dogs don't either.  And the fact that, but they do understand certain kinds of commands when they're set in a certain harsh way.  So we've adapted to the animal so they would understand this is the best we can.  And he always felt that you have to adapt to the limitations of the machine, which will always be there.  And in other words, you have to talk to the machine in a way the machine can understand you.  And to expect more than that is crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't disagree, but I think you can.  I think you can expect the machines to understand more.  Look, you know, I think that's the same.  It was always easier to write a program that would run properly in Pascal than it was in assembly language.  Again with the Pascal Jerry's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Always.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't let go of strongly typed languages that are logically consistent and which find your mistakes in the compiler rather than you're having to debug the damn thing after you get it compiled.  But I think that in a way.  The reason the reason that Pascal and modular and the other vert type languages didn't catch on is because they were slow.  They were slow to compile and their runtime packages were slow.  We no longer have to worry about slow.  I can't write a slow program for a quad sixty six hundred.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's an excellent point because the language that we, you know, if any of us goes to our screen right now, we're executing XML, we're executing JavaScript, we're executing Java.  Very slow languages, but still we have our force power.  Still we have our force power.  We fell out longhand, you know, and once was a time we worried about, you know, tight homepages, you know, like let's only send them like nine or eleven or sixteen K of homepage.  Now, you know, any page you land on is half a megabyte, you know, and it's doing all kinds of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, Jeff Hawkins would say that it isn't the issue of speed.  It's the issue of how they think and that they can't ever really.  Computers just don't work the same way that the the the Von Neumann machine is just the wrong metaphor for thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They always say that they can't get anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, Numenta is trying to create a new kind of chip that thinks more like the human brain does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As John McCarthy was fond of saying, the problem with big massively parallel systems is that they are immune to programming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that may be another issue.  That's cute. I like that funny line.  That's another issue. I got it.  I think we all did, John.  You really don't need the glory in that.  I think that was pretty obvious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But coming back to our friend Bill Gates, he would he would be the first guy to jump on it if somebody had a breakthrough or he'd be the second person to know about it.  And he'd be all over it.  Well, he's only 52.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, he's not down and out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which gets us back to the original point.  He's not really retired.  This entire episode that we've been witnessing is nothing more than a grand publicity stunt.  And we're going to see more of Bill than ever.  And I'm actually already sick of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You might be right.  But you put that far stronger than I would.  I think he's buying himself more free time.  A little space.  But as chairman of the board, he can always come back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I would hope I would like to see him maybe focus a little bit more on these bigger issues.  And and and you know, he doesn't need to prove anything.  He doesn't need to show himself, you know, the man times man of the year anymore.  He maybe with a little free time, he can put that on for the Nobel Peace Prize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I get it.  That's the thing.  I mean, he needs the money.  He needs the money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What is it?  A million dollars now?  A Krona?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, actually, the Nobel Peace Prize, I think, is given away in Norway.  And the Nobel prizes are given away in Sweden.  Well, there you go.  That's correct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you don't get to meet the Norwegian and give away the Peace Prize.  Yes.  Why? How did that happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Norway and Sweden were the same kingdom when Nobel died.  And when when they split apart, that was part of the provisions for dividing into two kingdoms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You get the Peace Prize, we'll get the rest.  I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a really good factoid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jerry is so full of that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love it.  That's the best.  I love it.  Hey, Jerry, how's Inferno 2 going, by the way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Be out in January.  They're talking about promoting it.  The title of the book apparently is going to be Escape from Hell.  And we're booked on some talk shows with themes like, are you going to burn in hell?  You and Larry Niven.  Yeah, real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Niven, God knows what Niven will say.  I never do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You stay out of that discussion?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I usually have to do most of the discussion.  You and Larry will come like with Lucifer's hammer.  Here I'm trying to write a very accurate, technologically accurate book, right?  Niven throws a damn surfer in.  And that's the only thing anybody ever remembers about the book.  We got a huge review in Nature magazine last this month.  I mean, a really great review of a 30-year-old book.  Wow.  Amazing.  But of course, the first paragraph is about the damn surfer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You sound bitter.  No, I'm not bitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look, I know Larry writes better than I do.  I think better than he does.  There you go.  Between us, we write damn good books.  You make one pretty good novel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's not that many collaborative authorship like that.  Congratulations.  It is kind of amazing, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, Nordolph and Hall with Mutiny on the Bounty is one of the few that's made more money than we have as collaborators.  That's pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's very difficult to do.  That's pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, Jerry, I really appreciate your joining us with some memories of Bill Gates.  This was kind of a special twit.  Even though John says it's a...  Scam.  Scam.  Scam, full of sound and fury and signifying nothing.  I think it was worth spending a little time to think about this guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's a Guinness Book of Records thing going on here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, let's face it, whether or not he's retiring...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He beat Britney Spears in total page views yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's all I'm saying.  You know, you could be a pregnant, fat...  Never mind.  I'm not going to go any farther than this.  She's lost some weight.  She looks good now.  Or you could be a geek.  And he's doing it for us.  He's doing it for the geeks of the world.  I think whatever you say about Bill Gates, I think he can only say good things about  what he's done for the technology industry and what he's done for personal computing.  He's been a benefactor and a boon to it.  Anybody disagree?  I disagree.  Oh, John, you're looking funny at me.  I think you're a bit much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've often wondered what would have happened if Dottie hadn't refused to sign that non-disclosure  agreement and Gary and his outfit had been the ones to write the operating system for  the IBM PC.  It wouldn't have been the same world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, as you said, digital research could have written it, but they don't have the instinct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Gary, there's always a rule that was going, and still believed in the valley, is the following.  If some one company doesn't take over and dominate everything, some other company will  take over and dominate everything.  So it would have just been the same thing with a different company.  And that's just the way the whole tech business has been, especially the tech business that  stems from the semiconductor industry, which operates that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, but suppose that company had been IBM.  It was for 20 years in the 50s and 60s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It seems unlikely because they had already gone through their period of dominance.  I've never seen a company do a comeback like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But then there was a compact to the IBM and there were all the Eagles to the compacts  and the everybody else's.  The industry was too big and had too much upside potential for any one company to dominate  the hardware side, but it did need one company to call the shots on the operating.  That's partially true, Bill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But wait, one company did dominate the hardware side, Intel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's true.  Infrastructure.  But you needed that operating system.  You need that consistent operating system to make the whole economy work.  It didn't have to be Microsoft, though.  Well, it wasn't Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, actually, it was digital research because they copied MS-DOS.  Tim Patterson rewrote it as an AD86.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Where is Tim Patterson these days and why isn't he speaking up?  They gave him some money to shut up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know that in DOS 1, you could make Gary Kildall's name appear on your screen.  Yeah, I've heard that.  Well, I've heard it.  Gary showed it to me.  Really?  How did you do that?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He put his stuff through a code translator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He wouldn't show me how.  So this was code that was left in by accident.  He had left in by accident.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's pretty serious proof of the contention.  Well, yeah, which is why Kildall died a very rich man.  Aha.  And why whoever owns CPM will never have a look and feel lawsuit.  Aha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who does own CPM?  So, Water Under the Bridge.  Well, it's gone now.  That's why I got you old guys on.  Experts on Water Under the Bridge, ladies and gentlemen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We rock.  Well, I'm sure if Gary had done it, he didn't have the ambition Bill did.  He would not have tried to build an enormous software house out of it.  He would have been happy to take the revenue from IBM and let IBM do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Interestingly...  Now, whoever dominated the operating systems was going to have a lot of revenue.  And they would have invested it in the ways that Bill did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Single best deal probably in the last 50 years...  Good investment.  ...was the deal to give IBM DOS without giving it to them, but licensing it per copy.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, there's another player that we're missing in the whole thing.  And I don't want to...  This show should be over by now.  I was trying to wrap it up.  Let's bring up the one thing.  We've got to remember Seymour Rubenstein, who's the guy who promoted the concept of licensing, shrink wrap licenses, largely his invention.  Actually, he was taken from it, some ideas he had.  And he was running...  He was pretty much the dominant player until he was scammed out of his company while he was supposedly...  Or they tricked him into thinking he was on his deathbed when he wasn't.  You're kidding.  Yeah, no, it's a great story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Seymour, you're dying. Sign over WordStar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Seymour, you're dying. You've got to sign a proxy over for me to run...  Who did that? His family?  No, the guy who took over the company, Haney, I think was his name.  There was some real scamming going on in that whole story.  But whatever the case was, that company could have just as easily become some domineering company, because they had the same kind of hardball style of marketing and pushing people around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All you guys are convinced me of is that you needed a Bill Gates to make any of this work, and that Bill Gates was the guy, the only guy who was able to make it all happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, all we know theoretically, but all we do know is that Bill was never really an evil person, so that's a plus.  Yeah.  Yes, definitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I liked him.  You liked him?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I have to make it a... I still do, but...  He's not an unlikeable guy.  He's not going to telephone me anymore.  He doesn't telephone anyone, and he never will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's kind of good-looking in this picture here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not like we're going to pal around, but he still says hello to me.  Yeah, he says hello if he sees you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I'm glad we could do this show with some guys who still think Bill's a nice guy and not evil.  John C. Dvorak.org.org.org. Don't forget, of course, Tech5.  Tech5.mevio.com, newagenda.mevio.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  CrankyGeeks.com.  PCmagazine.com, and MarketWatch.com.  Can you just get one? Dvorak.org.org.  We're actually going to put a site together that just consolidates everything.  Yeah, I keep saying that too.  Yeah, I know. That's all I've been saying for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jerry Pornell, it's so great to have you on as usual.  I'm glad you're feeling better. That's wonderful news.  Yeah, it's JerryPornell.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We know that.  The one place to go, Jerry's column is available now.  You can subscribe to it.  TheKarisMannerReviews.com, but just go to JerryPornell.com.  And please, Jerry, come back again soon. It's really great to hear from you.  I'm glad your voice sounds so much better.  You sound like you're in great spirits, great energy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  After 50,000 rads of hard x-rays, I guarantee you, it's great to be back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That'll wake you up.  Good morning, Bill's character.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And Bill McCrone, you're the best, mcrone.net.  I always give out that address, even though you don't really care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I put a couple of more things there, but not much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I do have to mention that this show is brought to you by the good folks at Audible.com.  Have to. I'm always glad to.  Audible sponsors all of our Twitch programs, and they are a really great source.  Jerry, you have some books on Audible.com, I think.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We did this last time.  And getting more.  And more?  My agent just made another deal.  I don't know what they are, but I just got about $5,000 in advances from Audible.  So apparently some more of my stuff is going on there.  I couldn't be happier to hear that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're buying.  Yeah, no kidding.  Lunch is on Jerry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, the only way to make a living in this business is to sell stuff you wrote 30 years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's not a bad way to make a living.  It takes less work.  Currently, Star Swarm, which is one of your juveniles, is up on there, but I look forward to more.  They bought a, they're doing their own sci-fi stuff now, which may be the deal that you made.  I was over there on Monday and they have, I think.  I think it was.  Yeah, I think they have eight studios now.  I recorded a short.  Oh yeah, how'd you do in your recording?  It was really fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did a little kids book.  Yeah, I said, the best you can do.  I wanted what you wanted.  It had to be public domain.  I want Mutiny on the Bounty or something read by you.  Call me Ishmael.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I did, I was fun.  I was, they couldn't afford Little Red Riding Hood, so they got.  Mr. Christian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mr. Chrism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They got Little Golden Riding Hood.  It was, I guess, apparently the variant that was in public domain.  Or the original.  Maybe it is, yeah.  Or a prequel.  It might be a prequel, yeah.  So I read that and that was really fun.  They're going to offer that for free, but they have many, many great books.  And I have to say the science fiction, I found out that, because the first time I went to Audible, which was in 2000, it was eight years ago, that was underwhelmed by their science fiction selection.  But I found out that one of their principals, their foy, who's a great guy, is a huge science fiction fan.  And he's done a yeoman-like job of getting some of the best sci-fi in the world on there.  And it's growing all the time.  Charlie May needs Moten God's Eye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you're right.  Hey, by the way, now we got Jerry here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wanted to ask you something, Jerry.  Do you think you're underrepresented at that crazy Paul Allen museum up in Seattle?  The sci-fi museum, yeah.  You know, the one thing that I found in that place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah, but remember what it was.  It was the Jimi Hendrix museum.  It was the museum in Lincoln, Nebraska, from the University of Nebraska.  Oh, is that where he got that?  And he just bought it and turned it into that.  So much of what's there is legacy, is legacy from a university science fiction club.  Well, he could have.  In Jimmy Gunn's English department.  So Jimmy Gunn, James Gunn is in there, for instance.  Neither Niven nor I are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well, here's another one that cracked me up.  I was going through that thing.  I was actually, I found it kind of insulting to a lot of the writers that were missing.  And for example, they had some of those little tribbles that David Gerald, I guess, was marketing  or somebody was selling these little balls of fur.  They had them in there, but no mention of David Gerald in the entire place.  Yeah, isn't that interesting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who's David Gerald?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  David Gerald wrote The Trouble with Tribbles.  He's a science fiction writer.  He's a friend of Jerry's.  We both know him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  David's a good writer.  I love him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's a great guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So they're more into the merchandising than they are into their writers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think anybody really pays attention to how curated they are.  They need a curator.  They need a curator.  That's really the problem.  It's ridiculous that medium.  This is not curated.  It's an embarrassment.  They need somebody who knows what he's doing.  They don't have Ron Hubbard in there.  Now, you may think Hubbard was crazy or not.  He's got to be in there.  But he's significant.  He was enormously significant to the history of science fiction.  And yet he's not in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The whole thing is, it's embarrassing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the fact that I'm not in there may or may not be significant,  but it is certainly bloody significant that Larry Niven is not in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, you should be in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, see, here's the thing I like about audible.com.  In the science fiction section, they've got all they've now divided it  alternate realities, classics, dramatizations, epic fantasy, fantasy,  fantasy, fantasy, hard sci-fi, which is my favorite category, short stories,  space exploration, kid and young adults.  They have a complete they're getting the point now where they can really  break it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I just want to know those people.  Tell them that my do be a very good mode and God's eye would be a great  thing for them to put in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a classic.  That's an important book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They should put that in Jerry from your lips to God's eye.  I will I will tell Don Katz and coming up.  It's good.  We'll get it in there for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What you have to do, Jerry, is come up with some little three handed dolls,  you know, with a big arm on one side, two little arms on the other side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I've already got a phrase that everybody's using on the one hand and on  the other hand and on the gripping hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How did I feel that one?  I love it.  Oh, seriously, if you get those into into the museum shop, then you just  follow on their little coattails.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I might point out that Jerry also claims credit for tinstaffle.  Never heard of it.  Tinstaffle, which ain't no such thing as a free lunch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you give that to Heinlein?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, I have a letter from Robert acknowledging it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, I think that's significant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What is it?  You've learned one thing here today.  You've learned that Tinstaffle was really there is no such thing as a free  lunch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There ain't no such thing as a free lunch.  Oh, he's not impressed.  No, I'm very impressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm totally impressed.  He's knocked out.  He's just not really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's true.  That is true.  And, and, you know, I meet young guys who listen to this show and, and I tell  them that, yeah, we recruited you way back when, way back when.  Original TV.  That's right.  And they say, wow, that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thank you, Bill McCrone and John C. DeVorek, who gave me my start in radio.  So, you know, I got, I got my, all my, all my benefactors here.  Wow.  Well, not radio per se, but in tech radio.  Yeah.  I was doing regular radio.  You were doing the whole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I had no, no credibility in the tech.  And the, and the, and the, I always liked them.  I don't know if Leo actually appreciates my mentioning this, but he is actually one  of the few, like it's probably many radio personalities that was actually bumped off  the air.  By?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Rush Limbaugh.  Yeah.  550 of us were bumped off the air by Rush Limbaugh.  Is that right?  So there should be a club.  We should have a little club.  A bump club.  Rush Limbaugh killed me and put me out of business, although he put me in business.  He actually did you a favor.  If it weren't for Rush Limbaugh, I wouldn't be sitting here today on this small internet  channel with probably more listeners and viewers than we ever had on the radio.  Thank you everybody for joining us.  We'll see you next week.  Another twit is in the camp.  Do you want to do video also?  We could do video.  He has to be hard.  Well, I guess we can do video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Look at all I'm doing here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is hard work.  He used to be a combo man at a radio station.  He can't get over it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm Jamie Davis, the pod medic from the MedicCast podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I'm Mark Pelce from Futures in Biotech on Twitt TV.  We're here to ask you a really important question.  Are you at risk for deep vein thrombosis or DVT?  I was working on my computer for days on end.  Little did I know that this would almost kill me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, Mark, you're right.  The CDC reports that between 30,000 and 60,000 people in the US die every year from complications from DVT,  a blood clot that forms in the large vein, usually in your legs.  The sad part is this is almost completely preventable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So if only I had stretched my legs every couple of hours or tapped my toes,  I would have avoided three days of intensive care, a week in the hospital, and five weeks on disability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Absolutely.  So for the listeners of this podcast, if you're sitting at your computer right now playing a game,  if you're on a long drive listening to the show,  make sure that you take the time to get up and walk around every couple of hours.  And if you're sitting down, move your legs around, tap your toes or tap your heels.  For more information on DVT and prevention, look at the link for the CDC in the show notes for this podcast.  I'm Jamie Davis.  And I'm Mark Pelce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We want you to be a long-term listener to this podcast.
