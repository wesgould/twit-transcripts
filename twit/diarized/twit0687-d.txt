I actually got a great panel for you I want to welcome start off with Daniel Robina will start on the all the way on the right Daniel is the executive editor windows central it's been an age since you've been on so I'm thrilled to have you on again thank you for being here where you located.  I'm in Worcester Massachusetts what's the spelled wrong but okay spell Worcester Worcester Worcester and you were at the the surface event I take it correct awesome so we'll talk we'll definitely talk about that and.  Kind of a shocker from Microsoft on 1809 but that's that's to come right also joining us from the fabulous tech republic ant Pruitt.  It's great to have you and he's a little more Clemson shirt he's got his orange that's a tiger right tiger Paul the tiger Paul baby tigers for life yeah.  And welcoming for the first time to twit but i'm thrilled to have not the first time in our studio rich tomorrow from KTLA hey rich.  Thanks for having me on Leo it's a pleasure to be here tonight it's been a huge oversight not having you on before rich is my designated filling.  I'd likened you to Lou Gehrig today on the radio show.  Thank you.  I told the story of Wally pips the first baseman for the New York Yankees who got a bad headache and couldn't play that day and he went to the manager said, can I take the day off manager said yeah I got this kid Lou Gehrig.  He could fill in for you to rookie Gehrig never left first base for some 1000 games 3000 games something like that and no one remembers Wally pips except me.  And I don't want to be the next Wally pit but you're you're definitely a Lou Gehrig so I appreciate you're filling in rich it's nice to have you thank you I appreciate it thanks for having me oh my pleasure.  And i'm glad you're all here because there's a great conundrum facing us in the tech journalism community today and it started on Thursday with Bloomberg business week.  And some amazing reportage 11 i'm sorry 17 anonymous sources in government you know three letter agencies Amazon and apple said that Chinese spies had placed a tiny.  Rice sized microchip on super micro motherboards in 2015 these super micro motherboards were used in many, many places servers by apple the department of defense we even had one because.  This all came to light according to now i'm going to say this a couple of times in the story because I want to emphasize according to Bloomberg business week.  We even had one because it was first discovered by Amazon when they were doing their due diligence they were about to acquire a company called elemental technologies elemental.  Makes a streaming box a box we've used for some years very expensive box that takes our video compresses it and then feeds it out to you stream YouTube twitch mixer whoever it is that's restreaming our stuff.  These elemental motherboards Amazon during a routine security odd before the acquisition found this little chip parent parent according to according to Bloomberg business week.  The chip was posing as a support a minor support chip on the motherboard nobody would pay any attention to it.  But when the mother was first booted in a server would modify the operating system phone home the Chinese military and help the Chinese military hack these servers servers in the Pentagon.  Every elementals widely used as I said we use it I presume our if this is true our motherboards were hacked.  But then the story gets weirder so 17 sources anonymous sources Bloomberg business week highly credible source.  The next day Amazon Apple even the freaking Chinese government unequivocally deny it.  They say it never happened Apple said it was the story was wrong and misinformed.  The Department of Homeland Security yesterday well actually their denial was a little less unequivocal they said.  We have no reason to doubt.  We have no reason to doubt that Apple and Amazon are telling the truth.  That's not exactly like no it never happened that's like well we have no reason that in this particular circumstance.  We currently have no reason to doubt nevertheless the denials from Amazon and Apple were were really strong.  Now it didn't happen that Bloomberg's completely wrong how does this happen is this a tree.  Actually I'm going to poll you we'll start with you rich who's right.

Transcript:  Oh man I I feel like this is kind of the biggest fear of kind of the tech world right like all this stuff is made over in China.  This is kind of the perfect way of infiltrating the systems with a tiny chip that nobody recognizes or even cares to notice.  And you know they can take control these things they can modify the system on startup whatever they want to do.  So it's tough for me to believe that business week has this many people saying this happened.  And it hasn't happened and I understand why these big companies including Amazon and Apple are strongly denying this because it's pretty bad for them.  If this happened to them.  So I sort of believe it and I think that just reading the story I mean it's it's fascinating I mean I couldn't put this thing down.  You know it was like so well written and so like I just wanted to know more and more and more.  But I think what was missing in this story to me is kind of the the consequence like like concrete like what they did with these little chips and maybe I missed that but I didn't.  See like you know did they take down something did they you know or is this all just like kind of laying in wait for something that they want to do in the future.  That was kind of the part that I was confused about it's a great question.

Transcript:  Initially my gut is actually siding with Apple just because of their their history regarding security and privacy.

Start time: 526.26
End time: 531.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And why would they lie right.  Well I mean that would be a big deal for Apple PR to issue and they issue two statements.

Start time: 532.48
End time: 558.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah all right they they come forth pretty quickly about it and then I just think back to other scenarios in the past with Apple far as like when we had that shooting at that school in California and they wanted to search the phones and Apple was trying to do the right thing.  From a privacy and security standpoint so I just my gut just says I'm going to go with Apple.  Now had it just been Amazon saying no that's not true.  I had the Harry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apple said specifically quote on this I mean this is as strong as you can get we can be very clear.  Apple has never found malicious chips hardware manipulations or vulnerabilities purposely planted in any server.  Daniel Rubino what do you think you've been covering this for a long time what do you think.

Start time: 579.06
End time: 679.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah I'm leaning towards this is there's got to be some truth to this now but we may not know are the exact details actually we don't know the exact details and there could be some crossed wires here and information maybe some hardware was shipped to Apple but it was caught in time and never deployed it.  In which case both things could be true.  But yeah you know there's been a lot of reports around Huawei and other companies to write about this possibility this threat and it works both ways you know there's concerns to the US companies doing the same.  I don't know my hunch says that there's probably some truth to this it's just a question of to what extent the damage was done but.  None of this is surprising to anyone who's been covering this industry for the last couple of years as his big concern over the strength of Chinese tech and its influence on US economy everybody knows that the way you wage war is changing from a pure.  The way you wage war is changing from a pure you know military exercise to work technological or information in case of what Russia has been doing or accused of been doing a lot recently so.  Just because the companies deny this stuff if it's an issue of national security they can be quite funny told to don't talk about this because.  You don't want to expose those vulnerabilities maybe there's active investigations going on.  We don't know all the details here but I find it hard to believe with 17 sources that none of this is true I think it's more about degrees at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Zach Whitaker who writes about security at tech crunch and has worked most recently at CBS he's been covering security forever he says welcome to the murky world of national security reporting.  He he says even with this story my gut is mixed.  I there is one potential scenario that maybe means both of these that the companies aren't lying but the story is true I I have to say to add myself to this poll.  There's no way Bloomberg Businessweek runs this story.  Unless and they stand behind it by the way unless they absolutely have unequivocal.  Evidence of this 17 sources all anonymous yeah but you'd have to say Bloomberg Businessweek is making this up.  This is this that's too many people to not be true so here's maybe a very narrow.  Maybe the Apple PR team to respond and this is John Gruber's theory didn't know about it right if something like this happens.  You're not going to send out a memo to everybody in Apple saying hey by the way look what we found you're going to keep it very quiet.  So maybe a handful of people at Apple know and the ones who don't know are the ones making the unequivocal denial.  There's also a possibility there's a US government gag order although Apple again says we are in no way under a gag order.  But again maybe the people who are under the gag order are a handful of people not the people writing the press release.  That's the only way I could see both sides being accurate and I don't I don't think Apple PR is lying in such an outright.  They would say nothing or they would say little or they would say there's lots of ways they could slice this without saying no it did not happen.

Start time: 790.00
End time: 834.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah it's odd that they came out so strong in their denial of this like immediately and emailed the media including myself.  And that rarely happens when they you know usually the way Apple works is they kind of talk to the certain media that covers the beat that they want to get the story out with.  This time they just sent out a blanket email through their legal guy denying it and kind of linking to this which I found to be very heavy handed.  So it's like one of these things where you want to believe Apple but at the same time it seems like it's overly like what what are the.  I understand they have a lot to lose in in this but it just seems like they really want to make sure that like no we are not involved in this.  This is not true at all.  I wonder if their reporter is going to be invited to the next Apple event.

Start time: 836.14
End time: 851.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's Apple's stick baby.  Right.  Probably not.  We won't be seeing you at the next Apple event.  As somebody who hasn't been invited to an Apple event in years I can say that stick isn't that isn't that weighty.  Go ahead.  I'm sorry.

Start time: 851.56
End time: 873.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was going to say another angle to this possibly is more the conspiratorial angle is that this is really a story.  The U.S.  Government has a vested interest in undermining Chinese tech or at least eroding the trust in it for such circumstances.  We all know about the Qualcomm Broadcom attempted buyout and how that was blocked.  And you know I got played by the U.S.

Start time: 876.84
End time: 924.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean in a way no 17 seems like a lot.  On the other hand this is kind of what intelligence is supposed to be doing.  And so I don't think we can discount it.  I still think there's actually a threat from China in this sense.  Why.  Because why wouldn't they.  Right.  Right.  It's just that's how counterintelligence works.  We do the same thing.  So there may be some you know like I said there may be some truth to this but it may have been played up by some people in the government to to you know even this current administration is very much against you know giving China too much leverage when it comes to China.  And so I don't know.  There's it's a hard story to follow and believe especially when you're talking about espionage counterintelligence and national security.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bloomberg writes the company's denials are countered by six current and former senior national security officials who in conversations that began during the Obama administration and continued under the Trump administration detailed the discovery of the chips in the government's investigation.  This has been going on for several years.  And it sounds like Bloomberg reporters have been working on this story for several years.  One of those officials and two people inside Amazon provided extensive information on how the attack played out at elemental and Amazon.  That's another thing you would not only have to.  It's one thing to say well you get you can easily get 17 CIA people to say yeah yeah this happened.  I mean that's their job.  But then you're getting people inside Amazon saying confirming it.  The details match the officials and one of the insiders also described Amazon's cooperation with the government investigation in addition to the three Apple insiders four of the six U.S. officials confirmed that Apple was a victim.  Seventeen people confirmed the manipulation of super micros hardware.  The sources are granted anonymity because of the sensitive and in some cases classified nature of the information.  Daniel that's an interesting theory though.  I kind of maybe this is it.  You know it's clear something's going on.  Yeah I think that's the truth.

Transcript:  But we don't know what it is.  Information warfare is the new battle of the 21st century.  Super dangerous super hard to counter.  It's who do you believe who do you trust and when you undermine all institutions around you.  People can't even trust new sources right anymore.  So it's a very brave new world.  It's not.  I'm kind of nervous about it.  During my did political science undermining classic institutions is the first way you destabilize society.  So it's exactly right.  Is there a threat to it.  It's exactly right.

Transcript:  Well and from the consumer standpoint I mean obviously this was kind of big server things but for the average consumer I think it makes you think twice too.  With everything that you have in your house.  I mean we're all putting these smart speakers in our homes.  Yeah.  Where are those manufactured.  I mean this is this is becoming a reality for the average person to think about the stuff that we're carrying with us and the stuff that we're putting in our homes the routers the systems.  And this becomes like very clear that oh my gosh like this is something that of course we've thought of but not in to this detail.  And you're just like this is exactly how it's done.  Right.  In a big way.  Right.

Microsoft's trying to counter with Azure Sphere which has been in headlines recently is their first attempt at making these sort of systems more secure for everybody anyone who's manufacturing devices.  But right now it's wild west people are just putting microphones and Internet into all these devices.  We're putting them in our homes and there's no regulation or checks.  It's going to come back to bite us.  I guarantee it will.  It's just a matter of time.  Well really if you believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go ahead.  As much as I said I trust you know what Apple's response was at the same time I still have that little fear in the back of my head of the button that the Chinese could just push at any time because of everything that I'm looking at right now was not made right here in the U.S.  And they could easily just push a button to make things just go nuts on me and maybe cause some even bigger problems if they want it to because we don't know.  I can crack this machine open and I don't know what all of these transistors and capacitors and all that.  I don't know what any of that stuff is doing.  I just know it's my motherboard.

Start time: 1144.38
End time: 1196.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well I mean you make an excellent point.  Very few people understand the complexity of our modern world and fewer still understand the security issues and could detect these problems.  And if you have a determinate adversary with governmental with nation state level resources behind them even if it's just North Korea it's it seems to me that it would be very very difficult if you had somebody wanted to do this to prevent it.  Everything is made in China.  Almost everything.  So the supply chain is coming out of China.  And even if you're buying a phone made in Korea or Taiwan or Thailand or India or Brazil many of the parts are made in China.  So I doubt there's one consumer electronic device in your house that it hasn't something that was manufactured in China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's like the equivalent of the Intel inside sticker.  Can you imagine if Supermicro had one of those and now everyone just sees those.  I'm going to go from the flip side though on the fact that China knows that all this stuff is big business.  And I think I mean clearly we love to believe in these conspiracy theories and we love to imagine that it's like us versus them versus you know Russia.  You know I do think there of course are elements of that in our world but at the same time I want to believe that they know that the business that they're going to make off these components are way better than you know the business they're going to make off of the whatever marketplace they're dealing with.  Absolutely.  The shady stuff.

Transcript:  What's going on in China.  And it's true in other places too is there's more than one constituency.  So there are absolutely I would say most of the Chinese government wants to maintain good relations because after all we're their biggest market.  On the other hand there are and this hack it's presumed came from the Chinese military there are I'm sure hardliners in the Chinese military say yeah just in case let's be ready for cyber warfare.  I don't think it's monolithic in other words.  And I completely agree with you Daniel this completely could be a conspiracy from the United States government who wants us to say exactly that.

Transcript:  Yeah.  What a world.  What a world we live in.  But it was almost inevitable when when the tools we use got so complex.  Jerry Pornell I mentioned this to Jerry before he passed in his book Lucifer's hammer.  The story is a giant asteroid hits the United States.  The great book.  Yeah isn't it good.  And there's just a few survivors in the world who kind of have to cobble together existence again.  But he points out that we live in a world where where we use stuff every day we have no idea how it works.  Nor could we recreate it if we had to.  And that's your car.  That's your freaking microwave oven let alone your computers and your phone.  Guilty.  We're all guilty.  It's and I don't think there's any one person who could do this who could recreate this.  So that's kind of the consequence of that is there's a huge amount of trust in using all of this stuff.  And if you had an actor who decided that he didn't care about being trusted or wanted to subvert this.  It's a it's a little you know is it chilling or is it industrial espionage.  I mean a lot of these servers are used by the Department of Defense.  These these these elemental servers alone are used all over the place.  The CIA the NSA the they're used in drone in drone you know placement.  They're used to controllers.  They're used all over the place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And OK but here's the question.  Has anyone cracked one of these open and found this little chip.  I mean wouldn't that be the first thing that one of these companies would do is kind of look in there.  I mean I know it's only been a couple of days since the story came out but wouldn't that be part of this reporting.

Start time: 1420.84
End time: 1444.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean I think that's what the original report actually did say was that the day when Amazon was looking to buy elemental they sent their boards into for review to a third party company who found a little chip on there that was not part of the original diagram designed for that chip set.  And that's what the red flag was.  And then I think trying to figure out what it does or its potential was a matter of sort of reverse engineering it.

Transcript:  But well I can get everybody who has a super micro motherboard and has the capability.  The problem is who has the capability.  These are there's a lot of little chips on the have you ever looked at a little motherboard and they're labeled.  But I mean I don't know how you would have to you would have to take the thing apart test each one individually.  All right.  Non-trivial.

Transcript:  An elemental cost thirty thousand dollars.  I am not taking my.  I actually propose this to our engineering team.  I said we have because we have a new elemental from AWS so that we just got a few months ago.  So that will not obviously.  But we had the old elemental from this time frame.  We were using it back then.  But unfortunately we had to send it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I fix it maybe could do that.  Yeah.  They specialize in identifying.  Unlabeled or poorly labeled or incorrectly labeled chips.  I think we all we can all agree that.  This is there's potential for this to happen whether it actually did happen or not.  And I think Bloomberg didn't get it wrong.  I just don't understand.  What happened.  You know what the response is and why the response is that.  And I don't think it's I don't think Apple is so venal as to say well that will hurt our business.  We better lie about it.  I agree with you in that case.  There's no way that's the case.  I think it's much more than whoever issued this release didn't know if anything.  You know and nobody's nobody's talking.  Maybe even Tim Cook doesn't know.  I don't know.  All right. I thought that would be fun to start with a mystery story.  Let's take a break.  We'll come back and talk about stuff we do know.  One thing we know an awful lot about is what the Google event on Tuesday is going to be.  This is the most leaked product I have ever seen in my life.  Air quotes.  OK. So there.  So you think there's.  Well let's find out.  You have a theory about why all this stuff has been leaked.  Maybe maybe this is intentional.

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by IIT Pro TV.  A recent study from MIT found that IIT occupations between 2004 and 2017 grew 19.5 percent.  That's eight times the growth rate for other jobs over that past decade.  Eight times.  And I know for from other research that there are one million I.T. security jobs unfilled.  Ready for you.  This is a great career path.  If you're watching this show you obviously love tech.  Listening to the show you obviously love tech.  If you thought about a career in I.T.  We I talked to so many people every day when people come to the studio they say you know I'm in I.T.  because because I became a geek because of you.  I.T.  Pro TV is the way to get the skills to get the job because unfortunately if you're just starting in I.T.  You need to get those certifications.  That's how you prove to your future employer that you you've got the skills.  A lot of people go to technical schools for they spend tens of thousands of dollars or try to do it themselves on their own.  That's hard to I.T.  Pro TV makes it easy to start a career in I.T.  Or if you're already in I.T.  To accelerate your career 4000 hours of binge worthy on demand training you can watch anywhere.  They have I.O.S.

Tuesday Daniel you went to the strangest place in the West Village.  I saw I saw pictures.  It Microsoft had set up couches and invited a bunch of journalists with laptops.  But nowhere to put them to cover it to cover the new surface release nor did they stream it.  Was the strangest thing.

Start time: 1980.60

Start time: 2006.52
End time: 2061.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah yeah he was going on about being creating and then making the right tools to enable people to go out and do their jobs and.  It was just I he again brought in his children it's been a recurring theme in his talks and that's not just a brag about his adorable kids but also just talk about the human element technology.  And he showed his daughter playing piano and it's like one moment she had where she got really inspired because she was like kind of nailing it.  And he was like how we all have these moments during the day where we get really inspired and everything just kind of clicks and that's what technology is supposed to do is just say I mean he always gives these kind of like really inspiring.  Talks but this one is probably like one of his best considering the event which you know what was announced was mostly refreshes versus a new form factor device that was really going to wow us.

The surface laptop is the Alcantara black as well or just the yes it's all black.  It's all black and they have the other colors too and then.  I love I'm using a surface studio and I was kind of hoping they didn't announce a new one because it's ridiculously expensive and they did and it's even more expensive it's been two years but $3,500.  Yeah and it's kind of low end hardware but the screen is just stunning I don't I don't feel the urge to buy a new one here's a picture the USB C.  It's by the way can I point out the only computer Microsoft sells with USB C.  Well service on to service book to it has USB C.  Okay but not the laptop that's right the go does doesn't it.

Transcript:  Yeah but wait I want to go back to those the couches because here's the thing like this has always been kind of my problem with the surface and I love the surface the you know the pro but like isn't it really tough to actually type on it.  It's not as Mary Jo's like calls it's not lappable.

End time: 2261.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But think about the just the ability to type on these smaller devices in your lap  is not necessarily your lap surface area whatever.  I think more about just how my hands are placed on a lot of smaller devices on my  lap versus having them up on a tabletop or something.

End time: 2269.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't mean to make a huge thing out of it's not that big a deal.  It is a cozy nice event.  It's just odd to bring these journalists and their laptops in and make them put it  on their lap.

Start time: 2269.78
End time: 2302.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think in part that was because as much as we all want to take notes we were live  blogging it everything.  They don't know you were actually going to this effect of chill out relax.  You don't need to take every note here.  And to be honest the presentation was pretty vague anyway.  It was a lot of detail.  It was just like service laptop 2 and surface pro 6 but they didn't go into demon talk  about the actual processors.  They just had like a generation.  We don't know what the processors are.  We do now.  We do.  We don't know at the end.  Yeah.  And we had to go dig around.  But I could tell you all the are they all why processors.

Start time: 2302.58
End time: 2305.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is it.  Tell me about your processor.

Start time: 2305.20
End time: 2361.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So surface laptop and surface pro get the eighth generation you processors.  But these are keep you like are.  So these are technically announced late 2017.  Basically every laptop that we've been using from HPE and Dell and Lenovo for the  last year have used these processors.  What they are not are the brand new whiskey lake series which are actually coming out  now October November from new Manifac from Dell and Lenovo and all that.  So they are like actually kind of a general I want to see a generation because Intel's  their eighth generations split up into like three generations.  So confusing.  It's just crazy.  But they're using basically last year's chip and this is key because I was hoping  and I wrote an article talking about if they go with whiskey lake whiskey lake allows  them to get four extra PCI lanes 12 16 versus 12.  That's the big thing with the 15 watts and that would allow them theoretically to put

Start time: 2361.32
End time: 2386.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it on Thunderbolt 3 that now you can have the type C connector and have it really be  a Thunderbolt report everything they want to be.  This is the big problem with type C.  My point has always been I bet you it's why Microsoft didn't do it.  It's confusing.  That thing could be USB 3.1.  It could be Thunderbolt 3.  It could support power.  Maybe not.  It could support video but it might not.  And you can't.  You look at it.  It's just this thing.

Start time: 2387.44
End time: 2431.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the other hand they use it on Surface Go.  So they do.  I find I find the confusion argument a little bit getting old.  Like I feel like you could do 3.1 with power delivery now and be fine.  Thunderbolt 3 is another bag.  But the reason they have such problems because Surface Pro has a surface the keyboard  connect uses PCI lanes and the actual surface connect uses around four PCI lanes to  you think of the service connect port as basically a modified version of Thunderbolt  3 already.  So when you do all that you ran out of PCI lanes.  That's why they need the whiskey like that's why they need whiskey like.  But that would also involve a significant redesign both internally and also externally  now with the ports.  And it's clear they came into this with we're just going to refresh this line at a  minimum cost.  That's really what it is right.

Start time: 2431.84
End time: 2452.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not.  Yeah.  We know what one product that does have type C.  You know Microsoft Surface headphones.  Yes.  That has a type C connector but it's just for it's just for charging.  These have multi-level noise canceling which is kind of cool.  Why is why do you think Microsoft is going into this business.

Start time: 2454.90
End time: 2506.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK.  I'll spoil the news here from our reporting and sourcing the big story behind this  event was originally this event was going to be to announce a drama the affordable  pocketable PC.  Oh.  When you think of this event in that context it all makes a little more sense.  Surface Pro Surface laptop and those other refreshes become little side stories that  are super cool.  But they're you know not the main focus.  And if you think of surface headphones they were supposed to be an accessory  supposedly for Andromeda as a way for working with communication as well as enjoying  music and all that.  And that's why they kind of came out of nowhere.  But a drama is on the back burner or rather they're doing a lot of work on the  software experience because that's not straight Windows 10 that's Windows core OS  new drama experience which is now still being worked on.

Start time: 2507.18
End time: 2517.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this has been this has been leaked out and people have been talking about Andromeda  for months and months and months.  What is a foldable tablet.  I don't even know what that means.

Start time: 2518.26
End time: 2549.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the at least going by the patent designs and everything we hear this is actually a  two screen device.  But Microsoft has invested a lot of research into and you can just read their patents  online about this because you're going to have like a hinge in the center where the  two screens meet.  So they've been working on technology such that the way if you have the curves just  like a book on the inside the glass just like a binding works.  But they've been working on technology so that the light emitting from the LCD at  that curve does not appear to be curved.

Start time: 2550.96
End time: 2556.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this way let me understand.  There's a hinge in the middle but is it one screen that folds.

Start time: 2556.74
End time: 2567.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's two screens two screens.  Yes it's not a single LCD.  We've seen that technology before.  Samsung supposedly working on it as well as well as LG.  But that's not it.  Yeah these are two separate displays.

Start time: 2567.72
End time: 2571.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's kind of like the courier thing that was rumored for exactly.

Start time: 2571.24
End time: 2669.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah the roots of this go back to courier.  It's the idea of a pocketable journal that you carry around.  So how big is this thing.  We don't actually know.  I believe it's between six and seven inches but it's tiny.  Yeah it's supposed to actually be able to fold up and you should be able to fit it into  your pocket.  But we don't know the exact dimensions of it.  They probably presumably have a few prototypes that they're toying around with.  But the technology is you can use either display.  It rotates around you can keep the displays open.  They can turn off independently.  I've seen some of the way the software operates already.  It's like it looks like a combination.  If you take Windows 10 with some elements of Windows 10 mobile with some of the gestures  of Windows 8.  This is what this kind of looks like.  There's still a start menu but it's sort of like the start menu Windows 10.  You can bring up an app list.  You have swipe gestures and when you turn on the device the first thing that comes up  is a new app called Journal app that you take notes on.  But it's built around the idea of a pen and this idea of inking.  It's not it's not a phone but it can make phone calls.  Yeah don't call it the surface phone they'll get upset.  So it's supposed to redefine what a companion pocketball PC is supposed to be in 2019 2020  whatever it's supposed to come out.  So this idea if you take a phone today like a smartphone how we use them and you start  from scratch and be like OK do people even make phone calls on these anymore.  No OK so let's rethink about what people are doing on these things and want to do with  them. It's clear people want large displays but in a form factor they can carry around.

Start time: 2669.20
End time: 2674.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is actually pretty cool.  Is what you know about this all from the patent filings or are there other.

Start time: 2674.94
End time: 2693.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No no because we've we've seen bits of the operating system and we've talked to people.  It's very it's the Verge Tom Warren did an article.  I mean this is supposed to be Panos Panay's pet project basically.  It's like his kind of you know ultimate device.

Start time: 2693.14
End time: 2708.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It would be. I mean it would be a big deal if they released this potentially iPhone level  device and I can see why Panay might hitch his start of this.  So it was do you think it really was supposed to be an Andromeda event.

Start time: 2709.44
End time: 2752.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah we heard we've been anticipating this was going to be the event going back to the  beginning of the year and even a little bit late 2017 that this they have I would describe  them as sort of windows where they try to launch hardware but it all comes down to I  have to be able to make it.  Yeah I was like why even surface studios like why did you guys release this now.  And they simply said because it's ready.  Right. And that's when you release hardware.  It's that simple. It's like when it reaches a threshold and they feel confident about it.  And this device you know there's a lot riding on.  They got really thread a needle on it to get it right.  And so I don't think they're going to release it till they have the entire OS operating  experience solid and they can actually believe in it.

Start time: 2752.88
End time: 2757.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's not Windows 10 as we have it now.  It's a modified version of Windows 10.

Start time: 2758.10
End time: 2807.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's called. Yeah it's called Windows Core OS.  If you think of what you see as the exterior of Windows 10 these days with minus  all the bloat from the last 25 years 30 years of Windows the legacy aspects they're  kind of taking the best aspects of how Chrome OS runs but it looks like Windows 10.  And there's different UI experiences.  So there's one called Polaris for desktop.  There's Aruba which is what the hub to is called.  There's one for a HoloLens and then there's going to be one for mobile called Andromeda.  And so these all have flexible UIs that can adapt to the hardware but they can also they  don't require you know bulky processors and a lot of horsepower.  So it's sort of like how Windows 10 mobile was just but we even Windows 10 mobile is  built off of legacy software.  And we see this.

Start time: 2812.32
End time: 2834.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No.  Yeah don't compare us.  Yeah if you think of it as that we're seeing it in front of us every time they change  they take legacy control panel systems and put into the new settings.  That's part of this.  They're shifting all this core code which has been written for 20 years and have to  go through to shell and decouple it.  It's always right.

Start time: 2835.24
End time: 2844.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because they keep the old control panel and they put in the new control panel.  All that does is confuse users but makes a little bit more sense if this is a direction  they're heading.

Start time: 2845.14
End time: 2865.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah if you look at the fall update which we want to talk about we can.  They've been taking even aspects of drivers and everything and putting it in.  So the US is becoming UWP it's becoming that design.  There will always be Windows 10 Pro for enterprise hospitals and all that.  But where they're going you say UWP are you talking.

Start time: 2866.12
End time: 2869.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 2871.40

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah it will be a form of Windows 10 S.  It will be.

Start time: 2875.08
End time: 2877.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the windows that will only run apps from the store.  No other.

Start time: 2878.14
End time: 2900.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah exactly.  That's that's their future.  There will be solutions to running one thirty two which are called Bail and Rail which  are methods to stream either locally through containerized versions of one thirty two  or through streaming.  So they have solutions for that.  But with this mind you we're talking about where Windows will be in five to 10 years.  That's where they see it going.

Start time: 2925.32
End time: 2957.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love the idea but I just.  OK.  So I carry around and I think you all do a slab of glass your smartphone.  That's not a phone.  Right.  That that's what's interesting about this thing.  This thing the form factor of this thing is based on it being a phone but it hasn't been  a phone in a few years.  So it's time to stop the phone part of this thing because it's art.  That's why we got notches.  That's why I mean this is this slab of glass is not the ideal form factor for a computer.  Let's face it.

Start time: 2958.70
End time: 2968.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK.  Right.  But we draw the line though.  We know that this is not a full fledged laptop or desktop.  We just know that this is an extension.  Well if you.  Laptops and desktops that we have.

Start time: 2968.84

Transcript:  Here's a thought exercise for you.  Aunt.  If you acknowledge.  OK.  People want a portable device they carry in their pocket that does a few things like it  does do phone calls and messaging but it also has maps and GPS and I can run apps on it  and maybe you know even get some productivity done although I think for most people that's  that's not a big deal.  If you could start from scratch what would you make that thing look like.  Right.  Not like that.  Is it too big.  Is that what you don't like about it.  It looks like you'll have no C.E.  Like what were those calls.  Yeah.  That's why I said Panos Panay does not like it when you say Windows mobile because that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  But let's just think about a few different use cases out there.  You have your enterprise people that could potentially use it in sales or something like  that or market and what have you have your creative folks and you have just your regular.  Average people consumers.  All right.  So if you look at those three different verticals what are they using it for.  The sales guys could probably use your smartphone for it.  Right.  You beat me to my point.  What's the point of this when the smartphone is probably going to do the exact same thing  that this larger device can do and take up less real estate in my bag or in my pocket.

Transcript:  We're already seeing people making these phones bigger and bigger.  Apple's new 10s Max the Note 9 and the Note 9 are really in the on the edge of too big  for this form factor.  Right.

Transcript:  Samsung's rumored to be working on it.  I mean they basically flat out admitted they're working on a dual screen device too.  It operates differently.  But if you look at what Samsung's doing with decks the Note 9 plugs right into any type C  monitor becomes a basically computer.  It has a pen.  All computing is going down this road of making these things more powerful.  The problem I would say with Samsung and Android is they have to hack around Android to get  to do what they want where Microsoft is building experience natively.

Transcript:  So now that doesn't just because everybody says that's the next thing doesn't mean that  consumers are going to say it obviously.  But you have to take a little bit of a chance.  And just because it's that I think this is legacy.  I'm holding up a smartphone.  I think that's a legacy design and it's a real holdover to really the phone.  It's based still on looking like a phone.  And so that's why I say it makes sense to maybe think about well what would you what would you  want for a pocket computing device.  But what don't you like about this.  What is wrong with this.

Transcript:  A lot of it is a lot of tech that's doing that.  And it just sort of I don't have a problem with trying to innovate.  But I think there are a lot of times where these companies are just doing just too much.  I'm like really that's not necessary.  I mean even when we look at the VR space from you know two three years ago with wearing the  headsets that you put your phone in and all that and didn't have a controller that worked  worth a dang and they're supposedly iterating on that technology.  But just how far is that going to go from a consumer standpoint.  What are the applications for that.  That's going to look good on the on the at the end of the ledger.

Start time: 3203.76
End time: 3223.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is it too.  I don't I don't I kind of like the idea of that though because it you know they're bringing that  technology to everyone.  They're saying all you need is a phone and a piece of cardboard.  I mean that's what Google's kind of approach was at the beginning and I thought that was cool.  Right. That was really cool.  I don't think that's the end all gave up.  Yeah.  That's Google for you.  Yeah.  I was going to say Google's there.

Everything it's just it ever.  This is what I say with like you know even with like the mesh networking that Google has you know their system  works perfectly fine.  But it's like they do a big launch for it and then Google Wi-Fi you never hear about it again and then ignore it.

Transcript:  Virtual reality will be forever niche and related to gaming and that's totally fine.  It's very good at that.  But the future that everybody else knows is the reality is augmented or mixed as Microsoft.  I agree.  Exactly.  I mean Microsoft has been I mean upfront they're trying to invent and they may already be working on it.  Basically a system of goggles that switches between VR and mixed reality.  The idea they they tend when you want to do virtual and then go clear for augmented reality.  That's where that technology people don't want.

Start time: 3284.68

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Imagine you're wearing these glasses also they tend you can't see what's going on around you.  That's just not a good user interface.  So ultimately people won't be doing that so much.  Maybe if you're sitting in a chair at home and you're safe you'll play a game.

And by the way I want to point out that our guest last was it last week the week before Amy Webb the futurist is the person who wrote the Bible for that show the first on what it would look like in 2030.  She did a great job.  Yeah didn't she.  It's very credible.  It's kind of like now but a little bit.  Yeah just a little bit tweet.  Yeah.  And they're all wearing you notice something in their ear.  Yeah.  So I do think that maybe that's the end game where the screen starts to kind of disappear and become part of your stuff but we're not there yet.  And then it makes sense there might be an interim device that is a little bit of a bigger screen a little bit more capability.  I don't know.  I mean I think your reaction is really interesting because you're probably not alone that a lot of consumers go that.  No thanks.  Like why.

Transcript:  And I think that's common.  I think but we can all go back to smartphones.  I was using a trio back in 2006 and all my I was like this is the coolest thing in the world.  Oh yeah.  It's a small computer.  I showed all my friends.  They could not care less.  Yeah.  They're like and no one want to pay for data.  No one got it.  And now here we are.  Everybody if you don't have a smartphone you're weird.  So I find all technology seems unnecessary until everybody has.  Yeah.  But clearly Microsoft's in position they lost mobile they've lost the phone stuff so they're asking the next question.  All right.  What comes next after the current thing.  What.  And that's a hard question.  I'm not saying this is necessarily the answer.  I'm just saying that's that's they're trying to go ahead of the curve.

Transcript:  You know it's what I like about Microsoft is the attempt that they made for creators like that.  That's surface studio that you have right there in front of you.  I love this.  I think that thing is just awesome for a content creator that can sit down and really immerse themselves into their work and into their content that they're trying to create.  And I personally wish Microsoft would continue along that road and making this stuff more accessible to creators out there that are trying to get started.  Whether it's the surface book you know just continue to make it robust and something that everybody can grab.  Because every time I heard about the surface books in the last couple of years they look great in their ads and all of the specs sound great.  But it seems like every reviewer just poo pooed them after you know a couple of weeks of use the keyboard this or that or the fabric on it felt weird and this was falling apart.

Yeah you know it's because you have the choice.  And Apple it's just you go in there and you look at the phone you say that's what's available and get the next one.  Take it or leave it.

Transcript:  If you read to the end of the Wired article on this laptop it says that HPE considered going synthetic or vegan leather but decided to go with genuine despite the added cost because the cowhide that they're using.  Is a byproduct since they're sourcing it from a manufacturer that also uses cows for meat.  It's left over meat.  And it says the leather can actually be reused when a customer has decided to move on from the laptop.  It's deconstructible.  And I focus out of it.

I'm going to rub it with Neitz foot oil to really give it that.  And maybe I'll wrap it around a baseball at night just to make sure the pocket is just so.  So headphones three new surface laptops well surface studio and then the surface tablet and then the  surface laptop and this.  Do they not a new surface book as well.  No.

Start time: 3839.04

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And this isn't really new.  Dell does this with an app called Dell Connect and it's actually not built by Dell it's by another company.  Dell licenses it and then puts their name on it.  Acer is doing the same too.  And that app is actually very good because what it does is it connects up through a pair by Bluetooth  but then it connects via Wi-Fi direct.  And what's cool about that is it does all the same thing.  You can stream apps from your phone to it.  You can transfer photos you can make phone calls.  It's lightning fast and doesn't rely on an external network or cloud support.  So you can even be on an airplane and use this thing direct.  And so it's also better for security.  Microsoft's not doing that.  What they're doing is a version that connects up through Bluetooth and pairs that way.  The pros of that is you can of course do the same thing.  It also works with all hardware.  If you go through the Wi-Fi direct method the downside is you have to use modern hardware for it.  And you have to start restricting stuff.  You need the right drivers and everything.  So that's the reason why Microsoft's not doing it.  They want to hit all PCs to be able to do this.  So it won't be as good as Dell Connect but at the same time it'll be free.  It'll be part of all windows and work on all PCs out there.

It's available now in the October update where on Android you can do text messaging  and pull in all your photos or at least photos from the last one or something like that.  And you can drag and drop them to your other apps and modify them.

Transcript:  I love that the texting part is really unique because there's some apps that can do this.  But I think that the fact that they're doing this makes it easier.  And the 25 photos is kind of weird because you could just I mean if they're just going to Google photos you can easily pull up your web page that has those.  But I think the texting school and the fact that they're doing this is nice because I don't know about the apps.  I don't necessarily need access to my Android apps on my computer.  Yeah. I'm not really sure what the use case for that is.  But I think that the texting for sure is great.  And were you able to play with that at all?  I mean is it just as smooth as it's not working is it.

Transcript:  Yeah not working code yet.  But oh yeah.  So third I mean but that was the same thing at build they announced your phone and then it's out now with its current feature set.  So they could turn this around in just a couple of months.  I'm sure they'll have this.  What they're doing isn't like rocket science.  Not crazy.  But it'll be an all right solution.  I agree though running Android apps like I use the Dell Connect version which is even better because it's faster with Wi-Fi direct.  It's it's yeah it's OK.  It's not like running BlueStacks and Android direct right.  But you do get notifications direct through the Dell version which is kind of cool.  So someone you know messaged me on Instagram I would actually get like a physical notification on my PC and I can respond to it directly without taking my phone out of my bag.  That's kind of cool.  Well to see if Microsoft does something similar.  The downside for this is iOS.  The Dell Connect works with iOS but the phone has to be unlocked and on for it to work.  OK.  Which is really not practical at all.  Right.  So those are the downsides.

Start time: 4069.26

Transcript:  twit we read the tech news so you don't have to.  Thank you in Thompson in a nutshell somebody's in trouble.  Don't know who but somebody is in trouble speaking of trouble Microsoft also at this event and Daniel announced that they were as of last Tuesday going to make.  1809 the new feature update the fall feature update available.  I presume it was one of those things where you have to be a seeker to get it initially I was a seeker you go out to the windows update and you see if it's there and it is and I installed on my surface studio on my.  Microsoft surface go I installed on my Lenovo no problems though everything went fine and then Microsoft said whoops.  People are reporting data loss installing this update one person on the Microsoft boards mentioned 220 gigabytes in his documents folder gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah and now you know to be fair not I never experienced this problem it was posted in the hub some users did have a problem with that it wasn't up voted and caught.  Now what usually happens is they have a ring in the insider program called release preview and so two weeks before.  The final build goes out to the masses it goes to release preview that's the whole point of it so it goes out to a wider.  Cohort of testers and they're supposed to catch last things they didn't do that this time which was weird and to be fair it was like okay well this update doesn't seem too crazy anyway there's not like a huge.  A lot of under hood stuff they skipped the release preview and now it's starting to look like it's coming back to bite them now I don't think there's no evidence that this was the insider team making this decision I don't think they make that call to be like this is higher this is the engineers this is executives.  We're like all right.  Yeah I don't think like Donna was like oh she doesn't make that call runs the insider program yeah yeah but it's clear that the data missed things and.  Melissa Microsoft and you know trying to do this huge weird thing of building an operating system openly in the public letting people test it and getting feedback.  And it will definitely be bumped in the road because no one's ever done it at this scale having said that I think they clearly made some mistakes here and I'm sure it's going to be some meetings and a lot of yelling to make sure something that doesn't happen most people didn't get it because.

Yeah.  Do you remember when the iPhone had the update that disabled it just totally screw up so I'm the kind of guy when I hear there's an iPhone update I'm pressing that button a million times to get it well I did that and my phone was disabled for 24 hours because I had no cellular connection whatsoever.  And so ever since then yes I'm a seeker but a more of a casual okay I'll go like with Mojave I you know I got it you know a week later you know what I mean wait a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This wasn't a beta release.  And then but then I was going to say even now with running Windows 10.  A lot of the updates I can't say I've noticed much because I spend most of my time in the apps I'm when I'm sitting at this rig I'm sitting here with premier I'm sitting with after effects light room.  You might as well be on a Mac frankly and that's all I'm worried about and every now and then I get some annoying notification popping up about email or something like that but for the most most part I don't even see Windows I just see whatever Adobe has in front of me or whatever the apps that I'm running at the time.

And you can screen cap it it has a cloud clipboard it can save it across devices but you can also open it in a direct editor.  That allows inking directly so you can draw on it and then it has a share feature so you can just send it off to email quickly it's it's snipping tool for the modern world basically or the new experiences that they're building.

That's the only time I think about the actual Windows operating system is as soon as my wake up starts wiggling out I'm wondering did that thing get.  Re-enabled so I have to go and dig for it and take that little box to turn it off.  You know I mean this is a this is a pad I have a touch screen I have a I have a thing but I know you know this Windows Inc workspace what I've never used that what is that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What.  Come on man what do I want that for so you're right it's not the first thing I want to I do like timeline though because that lets me go back.  Through not only the applications I have open but websites I've been to you know things I've things I've looked at and I really like that documents I've worked on that is a very nice feature plus it exposes the desktop feature which is really.  And that works with Android now if you use the Microsoft launcher if you're part of 5.0 beta which is really really nice you can now and if you use like edge on Android.

Start time: 4889.88
End time: 4953.99

Transcript:  And everything it syncs up your Android history timeline as well so you get that cross yeah and so you can view your PC history on your phone which is really neat if you're working on a computer all day running out for dinner.  My show so in that article my favorite feature about timeline is search you just type in a couple keywords and it goes back months and I'll figure out oh this is the article that you read it that to me is really cool there's a lot of stuff in 1809 it's just a lot of smaller things.  Changes to edge of course is a lot of changes that went on in there for some inking support more changes in the way the menus look now they're sensitive so if you use a mouse cursor you can see the menu.  And compact versus if you go to touch screen they automatically are larger so they're touch enabled so it's just more refinements I would say to the system there just isn't like a huge feature.  And so I think that's what everybody's looking for but we're kind of at the stage now where we're just doing refinements plus they're working on the back end of the operating system to make for the next you know Windows core OS basically.  I think I open edge about twice a year.

Start time: 4959.44
End time: 4993.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I you know what I'm using it I use a lot now I even use it on my Android device that is saying some wow yeah I always feel so bad opening up edge and then downloading Chrome.  Well the really annoying thing is every time you use edge to do anything in Google land Google will say would you like to use a safe browser instead I find it so kind of setting and so annoying and I just I wish they'd stop no I'm using edge I'm fine thanks.

Transcript:  So Tuesday we will hear I know I can't think of a single product announcement that has been more leaked.  Ever yes Samsung does a terrible job of keeping this stuff quiet too but we know more about the pixel three.  It's ridiculous now you had an interesting theory you think that Google's leaking this stuff.

Start time: 5029.30
End time: 5071.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah and I can't necessarily say I follow that logic but there's no way a company as large as Google or alphabet or whatever you call them these days has this much.  Of a security problem far as things just that are internal just leaking out on a regular it's almost like a regular basis now I'm waiting for the next notification to pop up on my phone in the hour that says here's another.  Pixel three view I woke up this morning and then gadget had plot one.  You know what is what since is that I don't get it so I'm assuming that PR figured you know what let's try to you know put a little more buzz out there before the show.

Start time: 5072.14
End time: 5135.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But that's a dampen iPhone sales or me what's the I don't think so no they can't help I mean they sold four million of these pixels last year that's not even a blip on the radar for the average person.  So it doesn't all the PR in the world does not matter I mean people they don't even understand what a pixel is and so I don't think that that's that's it I think it really comes down to.  You know there are in the works before launch there's you know they have to make documents they have to make review documents they have to get the product to places they have to give they give briefings to certain reporters on things.  And those are all points of failure that could potentially happen and I think that's what we're seeing here getting the phone a couple weeks early I mean look it was one shop in Hong Kong I mean we've seen best buy sell they sold the chrome cast early.  You know the new one so it's just there's a lot you know in this world that we live in if you're launching products kind of day and date like right after the announcement there's a lot bigger chance for things to happen.  Even with Apple we see this stuff happening and they're they have the best PR in the business.

Start time: 5136.84
End time: 5148.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fair enough things like Apple is really a lot more.  Locked down when it comes to what is being shared to the public and the masses doesn't get leaked out of the pie is the supply chain.

Start time: 5149.84
End time: 5154.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right I don't but they do get a lot of leaks they do get leaks once it was China's actually I think they.

Start time: 5155.62
End time: 5196.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Kind of put more the leaks out there than Google would you know Google it's like really they would I don't know I feel like the pixel is such not an issue for like most people you know it's like.  They're like excited about the new pics although she is because she has one so I've made her get okay okay so she actually is but my point is even as a pixel user she doesn't even really understand like what makes the next one better.  So for the average person like I think they'd be more interested in what's you know the new iPhone obviously iPhone rumors are huge Samsung and so to a lesser extent.  But those are big as well, so I don't I just think there's it's just Google the way I don't know they're the ones that own the search engine and they're getting this stuff leak.

Start time: 5197.88
End time: 5204.68

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a pixel to excel and i'm very happy with it and I haven't noticed a speed drop and one of the reasons I pull it out a lot is the camera.  And many agree that even with the iPhone tennis tennis max say it right now say it right in this even with the iPhone tennis.  That this phone has a better camera, even though it's a year old now so i'm I tell you what i'm going to be paying attention to on Tuesday and i'm going to be here eight in the morning.  With the live start life man it's a hard life eight in the morning I.  Look at and i'm an old man or go to this i've arranged my life so that I don't have to show up till 11 every morning.

Apparently, according to the phone that was sold in Hong Kong.  it's 13 it's the 13.2 pixels or something it's not the 12 megapixel.

Start time: 5300.02

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They added them and they've let's see what is it's a 12.  i'm sorry and gadgets says it's 12.2 megapixel main camera pair of a pair to eight megapixel front facing cameras so has the wide selfie.  yeah pretty excel yeah it's a 6.3 inch screen qual it's qualcomm 845 chipset the one that he bought in Hong Kong this is in gadget or Richard Lai says it only had four gigs of ram.  yep that's a little lightweight but.  There may be other models remember he just got one it does have a notch which is so disappointing.  I don't care about that notch yeah I don't care I mean it i'm fine with the notch well it doesn't bother me on an iPhone I understand why the idea is you don't want any bezels so you have to have something so that you can put cameras there.  it's the chin it's a combo boat that's the problem they still have a chance it's not like they got rid of the chin.

Start time: 5360.34
End time: 5369.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean there's just we don't understand the manufacturing vicissitudes the exigencies.  You know there may be reasons you have to have some you can't have a screen go all the way down there they also took out the headphone jack last year and it bothers the hell out of me.

Start time: 5387.04
End time: 5443.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now see the fact that they're including the usbc headphones now I think is huge because that was a big.  sore point for me, even though I use bluetooth headphones, but I still sometimes just like to have something let's say you're doing a Skype call.  And you want to just plug in to your phone you know it's like or listening to music or your batteries are dead and the fact that you can't find a decent pair of usbc cheap kind of headphones on anywhere.  This is big to me, so the fact they're in the box, I think is very nice otherwise this phone seems so unexciting I mean I love the pixel believe me I think it's my favorite phone out of almost every device out there.  Due to the camera, but I don't see this as being any sort of.  there's nothing they're adding to this as far as I can tell that makes us any better than the iPhone the iPhone is still a better creator device, you know where you can.  You know record videos and stuff like that that you don't edit stuff on it, this is just a great camera it's like a one trick pony once again so.

Start time: 5445.24
End time: 5490.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's also and I always say this is that if you're going to get an android phone get it from Google, at least you know you'll get the updates you'll be secure relatively secure.  I it's that's the big challenge for me with android I love android but it but it's a dangerous it feels like it's dangerous.  To use an android phone compared to an iPhone, but I like the flexibility I like widgets I like I just think you know android is a better operating system if they could just gosh.  The other thing that Google does that apple stops doing is apple stop putting a headphone adapter in the box Google is going to have a USB C to 3.5 millimeter dongle.  You know wireless charging to that's that's a good wireless will be nice because that the current pants who does not have that.

Start time: 5491.96

Transcript:  I still not I have the pixel to it's it's a fine phone, but I find it extremely boring and besides taking good photos.  I just got really bored with it and that's not even a negative in the sense that I feel like this is just like what we're talking about pixel three the industry, the technology has stabilized plateaued.  And so the return for sure yeah so each year it's like you know this year with the iPhone and it's it's not bad it's just that means it's like how I don't get that excited over new TVs or a new refrigerator.  You know 20 years ago my refrigerator have been rocket science makes ice.  So you know.  But now it's like okay it's like this with phones now and I feel kind of bad ripping on like the pixel three because it's it's I'm sure it's a fine phone it's just it's already get blown away by this like wireless charging.  Okay I had in 2012 with my Lumia party.

Like literally I will have this phone in hand on Tuesday and it's like how do I say what's new about this thing I mean you have wireless charging and the camera is just as good except now you can take a wide selfie I mean it's really.

For weeks people were you yeah and it is it's not a great screen no so i'll be interested if Google's fixed that problem because they you know I think was a supply issue that apple.  And samsung had all the OLED screens and Google got what was left over maybe they've solved that problem so i'll be curious to see and you know my my test on the screen.  Is is with scrolling if you scroll on the on the pixel to it just it can't handle it it's the colors get distorted in weird ways and stuff it's just not a great screen so i'm hoping that will be fixed.

Because samsung had that feature for a while right oh yeah oh you had the slider forever yeah right once apple did it was like the same thing with wireless charging it's been on samsung phones is going back I can't even remember how long a while.

Sleep apnea apnea is between 20 and 30 million people.  We automatically check for a fib so you get right I find a Fitbit system better how can it detect sleep apnea.

Transcript:  They would do a good job.  They will.  I have it they will they will they will when they get the battery up they can't.  That's probably people have to charge it overnight exactly and they don't want to bring that problem to the forefront because right now your apple watch is just fine if you're wearing it throughout the day.  But like with the Fitbit one of the things I love about the Versa is that I literally you know it's for every four days you charge it and so you can use it as a sleep that one night a week you don't get the sleep.  You know or you just charge it or you take a shower or whatever right but it's apple doesn't want to bring any of this to the conversation right now until they're ready.  I make sense yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They need it I mean with with what I feel like at this point even though I like Android slightly better the Apple watch is really what is so interesting to me right now and and really almost vital because of the fitness aspects and the tracking and the notifications.  And the fact that I can't really get something very similar on Android at this point that's as good and i'm sure the galaxy watch I mean this you know it has some aspects but it's just not as polished you know.

I prefer Fitbit because I like the hell you're a sleep expert.  This is sleep and I'm a sleep expert right.  I do think the Fitbit Versa is a great watch for everyone else that that's not Apple you know what I mean if you're not exactly because it does a lot of the same things but it doesn't you know.

The feds if it's we now know this happened a while ago I think back in in August forced an iPhone 10 owner to unlock his phone with his face face ID.  The investigation was a child abuse investigation Forbes has the exclusive on it first known case in which law enforcement used face ID to open a suspect's phone.  However the thing I found interesting in this article was this is now kind of status quo in search warrants that they're having the judge or they're writing it up in such a way that they can do this.  It's in the actual search warrant that they will be asked to unlock and they have to unlock their phone.  I think the pen well you can use a pen to actually that's a really good question which is right.  Well that's yeah.  But the courts you know it's unclear.

Did they throw you to the ground?  Or pin you?  Oh it got it got physical pretty quick.  I was impressed at how quick they came over there.  But of course I don't speak a lick of Spanish.

Transcript:  California has enacted a net neutrality law.  US government sues immediately to block it.  So much for states rights.  Well this cracks me up because it's effectively an admission.  So the net neutrality law is pretty bland.  I mean it says something I think we would all agree on.  The new California law prohibits internet service.  See how you feel about this.  Internet service providers may not block or throttle lawful traffic.  They may not require fees from websites or online services or to deliver or prioritize  traffic to consumers.  It bans paid data cap exemptions.  That's zero rating right.  So you get you get free Spotify.  And says that ISPs cannot attempt to evade net neutrality by slowing down  traffic at network interconnection points.  That's all it says.  So this is what this is why I'm I'm blown away because immediately the US government  says no no we can't have that.  And immediately AT&T and Verizon says we're suing.  How dare you.  You don't agree that none of that should happen.  Didn't didn't wait a minute didn't Ajit Pai said none of that would happen that you  don't need this regulation.  Did he say that.  So why are they suing.  What are you worried about.

Transcript:  As someone who lived through that Verizon Netflix issue years ago where Verizon was  supposedly they were blocking the internet.  The interconnect right.  Yeah yeah I mean this is just nonsense and especially especially for if you're a  Republican and conservative this idea that states should be able to regulate their own  kind of commerce and well well I'm no lawyer.

Start time: 7128.46

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it is in the Constitution that that when it comes to interstate commerce that's a  federal thing no state may.  And so they're saying well this is interstate commerce.  The state is saying that this law was very carefully written because of course they knew  that that would be the you know the hook.  It's been very carefully written not to interfere with interstate commerce and they  say but wait a minute there is no federal regulation.  The FCC struck that federal regulation.  So we're not interfering with the feds at all.  We're just saying here in California we want this problem is AT&T doesn't and Verizon  doesn't and they're the ones who bought our federal legislature and the apparently the  FCC.  Here's a law nobody would sue against California law is now banning bots from pretending to  be human.

Transcript:  I like this one.  This gets kind of scary.  When I called a hotel I was at Ignite a couple weeks ago with Microsoft called the Hyatt  and it was a bot picked up but they're getting so realistic now you can kind of tell it was  fake but it was a human talking like human voice.  But then when you would give your answer be like you know are you interested in reservations  and you say like reservations and then you would hear a keyboard clicking like it was  AT&T does that.  See they're trying to trick you.

Transcript:  Well it's the same argument that Google made with the duplex.  That's why they passed this law because of that.  And the um because they said oh that's that makes it more natural but they're using that  time to kind of compute things as well.  So I mean it's weird.

Transcript:  Now so the problem there though is it's not so much if I'm calling the Hyatt right I'm  expecting someone like that it's if I get a call that could be a bot and I don't know  that's the issue like you could do a lot of deception here.  You think about it you can program bots to randomly call people.  This is like the new war dialing of you know in 2021.

Transcript:  Right okay well I mean with this I want you to already so terrible but I mean this is kind of  like another I mean it's just these bots are I mean they're it's weird because on one side they  are kind of useful for certain things like when you're interacting with an airline like I always  kind of avoid all this stuff because I feel like just the human could do it better but you know  now if you see Bank of America is advertising that new thing called like Erika right it's like you  can ask for your credit score hey Erika what's my credit I mean it's really weird the the world  that we're living in because these things can be useful. It's better than a very elaborate tree

Transcript:  right press one to do yeah yeah I mean yeah but I think the real concern here is election  tampering really that's that's really what this is all about. California is which is  apparently California is now on the forefront yeah there's a vacuum in DC so California is now  going to outlaw weak password use wow starting in 2020 manufacturers of connected devices will have  to build in reasonable security features including better password protection now it's it's still a  bill it's not a law yet but that's an interest it's interesting that lawmakers are getting

Transcript:  into this yeah that's that's smart actually because it's again going back to protecting  ourselves from ourselves because I don't know if the first time you got a router from one of these  companies like AT&T or Verizon where it was like a different code at the bottom like it had like a  unique wifi code yeah so this is a this is actually quite smart I it's weird though because when they  manufacture these things over in China I mean do they just have to do the whole batch this way or  is it just the ones dedicated to California I mean it gets complicated but and that's the point I

Start time: 7420.46
End time: 7619.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  take credit I mean because LA was such a pit you couldn't breathe yeah California created emissions  laws by the way the air is is great now right in LA well it's better I wouldn't say great but it's  breathing it's not Beijing bad it's not Beijing now probably would have been if it was and as a  result automakers all over the world started reducing emissions so I think that there is some  case to be made that you know for us to step forward let's take a little break and then a  couple more things but first a word from our sponsor quick and loans the best lender in the  nation number one in volume number one in customer satisfaction and that's not according to me that's  according to JD power they've won the JD power customer satisfaction award number one eight  years in a row that's pretty good eight consecutive years and and I'll tell you the way you get to this  is by thinking about the customer experience and that's exactly what they've done by creating  rocket mortgage this is an entirely online home loan approval process you could do it on your  phone you could do it in an open house and it's quick it's really a three-step process they call  it the power buying process it starts with a few simple questions you don't have to go to the bank  you don't fill out a 20 page application you just do on your phone you go to rocket mortgage.com  twit to answer a few simple questions you pick the term of the loan the rate the down payment  and then they give you pre-qualified approval and that happens within just a few minutes  fast enough to do it in an open house so you now you know yeah good good we could get this loan  then the best part this is awesome within 24 hours you don't have to do anything you don't have to  go get pay stubs or bank statements or anything they'll verify your income assets and credit  and within 24 hours give you verified approval now you've got the letter that says these guys  are good for it they've got the loan that means you go right to the front of the line when you're  buying a house that's awesome but there's still an issue there's still some insecurity because  interest rates are going up right for the first time in a few years there's the potential that  if you take too long looking for a house your your loan could cost you thousands of dollars more  that's why step three once you've got that verified approval you qualify for their all new exclusive  rate shield approval that locks your rate for up to 90 days while you shop you've got up to three  months to look for a house with no fear that the rates will go up because they can't they're locked  if the rates go up yours stays the same if they go down yours is go down so you win either way but  i think that's nice it takes the anxiety out of shopping for home you don't want to be rushed  you don't want the feeling that well we better buy this house you want the right house  again quicken loans the best lender in the country and it's things like this rate shield approval  that makes such a difference to get started go to rocket mortgage.com slash twit two rocket  mortgage.com slash twit and the number two rate shield approval is only valid in certain 30 year  purchase transactions additional conditions or exclusions may apply based on quick and loans  data in comparison to public data records equal housing lender license in all 50 states nms  consumer access dot org number 30 30 get started today rocket mortgage.com slash twit two we thank  rocket mortgage and quick and loans for supporting twit i didn't ask you this did you guys get the
