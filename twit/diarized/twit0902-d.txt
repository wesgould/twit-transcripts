Transcript:  Nothing we'll find something to talk so slow and a dear friend who's been with us for many many years  I remember talking to you when the iPad came out. How many years ago is that Dwight Silverman?  Many years at the Houston Chronicle. He ran a radio show and out of Texas for a long time  He's at authory comm slash D Silverman. That's where all of his work goes and there's quite a bit of it

Transcript:  Wow, I don't even know where to start. We should have had a vote  Holy cow, holy cow  Yeah, let's do a Twitter poll  So let's say you said the word Twitter might as well do it  Donald Trump is back on the on the bluebird  Not that he's said anything. In fact in a way  I don't know if he should be too glad he's back because the tweets are the last tweets he made on January 6th  somewhat incriminating maybe  He has said that he's gonna stay on his own site truth social, but this is the latest thing that Elon  Did that is kind of contradictory to something he said earlier  he said we're gonna have a a panel of experts to approve the return and departure of  People and then  Yeah, forget that let's have a poll as many have pointed out that poll is easily gamed  Somebody said well now we know what the GRU wants although I gotta say it was pretty was surprisingly close  I thought it would be overwhelmingly in favor of bringing back the former president  So so much has happened  Twitter is the gift that keeps on giving  Although I saw Mike Maples jr.  Kind of snappishly maybe you saw this to Phil on Twitter saying  To one of the I think was to Casey Newton of platformer who's been covering this stuff doing a very good job  He's got a lot of sources in Twitter saying why don't you cover something more productive than the demise of Twitter?  I think this is a bigger story. This is not this is a real news story, isn't it? Or is it just a soap opera Phil?

Start time: 373.99
End time: 388.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean it's both  I  Am not expecting the demise of Twitter out of this. There's you know more drama than is probably  Strictly necessary, but yeah, it's been it's been interesting to watch. It's definitely maximizing for my entertainment

Start time: 389.42
End time: 431.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is entertaining. It was very sad on Twitter on Friday night  When the news came that you know, this was Elon's deadline  for engineers to either go hardcore or go home and  He put out a form a Google form of odd oddly enough that somebody should check saying yes  I'm willing to go hardcore with you or no, I'll take my three months severance now  I  Imagine a number of we don't know what the actual response although New York Times is reporting a Casey news reporting about 1,100 engineers  Took advantage of that three months  Severance, I think that's the sensible thing to do but it's not binding  I imagine a large number of people just said I don't have to answer that

Start time: 432.74
End time: 461.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's gonna work is anybody left there who could fire then that's the question  I was reading I think of the New York Times had a one of the anecdotes  They had was a woman roaming around the building for two days because her manager been fired to try to give notice and she  Finally found her new manager gave notice and then that manager was fired the next day or left  So it does have a kind of Keystone cops Marks Brothers  Fellini vibe like there's just a lot of stuff happening all at once and some of its farce and some of its

Start time: 462.18
End time: 512.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know overwhelming and some of this rumor that is probably not provably true for instance there  There was a confirmed story that badge access was turned off on  Friday and then nobody could go in nobody's gonna be able to go in until Monday  But Elon at 120 on Saturday morning  Posted a picture of him going beast mode with the remaining engineers  It's a small group and there's only  One tooth a few women mostly guys  This is what's left  Elon inside this is his so-called code review  He was telling bring bring bring ten screenshots of your code  This is what he posted on his Twitter  It doesn't look like code it looks like they're telling him how Twitter works at this point. Yeah

Transcript:  Also, I wonder when he disabled card key access was he trying to keep people in or keep them out I wasn't

Start time: 519.06
End time: 525.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Supposedly the rumor was that the card key access  Ended because the whole team that managed it was gone

Start time: 527.26
End time: 540.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that was a bad that was a tweet from a prankster by the way  Yes, right, right, right and the prankster said nobody can get out so they had to call me back in but of course  Card keys don't work that way. They keep it out not keep people in you'd have a fire code violation if you couldn't get out

Transcript:  The the the deadline was Thursday  Yeah, and and one of the thing and it supposedly the form that you went to when you clicked on his link was simply  Yes  Yes, and the people and the people who didn't click yes were presumed to have by default that's no resignation right right

Start time: 563.18
End time: 572.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that's how it worked  You've run technical teams Phil  Yeah, still am  How do engineers take to this kind of thing

Start time: 576.03
End time: 627.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Elon's always been an outlier  And Twitter's an outlier and there's not that much that we can learn from really studying, you know outliers like by definition  Most things don't behave like this. Most companies don't run like this. I think it's hard to predict  How it's gonna go other than look at the end of the day like it's a website  They're gonna figure it out. This isn't the hardest thing that that that Elon's like built  I'm pretty sure they're gonna get it right again  There's gonna be a lot more drama than then, you know that I would have liked to see and a lot of people's lives get  Can turned upside down or at least add a lot of uncertainty around who gets, you know who around jobs?  So it's like it's drama. It's theater  But I think people like predicting that this is the end of Twitter  I I don't know. I mean maybe right hard to know the future  But I'm certainly not expecting it to I don't think a lot of people said all it's only a matter of time for the website fails

Start time: 628.10
End time: 656.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't first of all you design it to keep going  Even if everybody walked out of the building it would keep going for some time  I don't I yeah, you're right. I don't see this as the end of Twitter  Maybe the bigger question is the end of content moderation  And for a while you people were posting full-length Hollywood movies on Twitter  They fixed that by the way they the the crew that was taking that stuff down and came either arrived or finally noticed  I

Start time: 657.36
End time: 746.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Got a strongly disagree on the technical side not because I have magic insight into Twitter's code base  But every report that's come out of there from people who've left  Recently and many people in the past is that they have an incredibly fragile infrastructure  An incredibly fragile infrastructure that they've barely been able to keep alive for years and that there's a so much  Accumulated technical debt without working on core  Restructuring and refactoring all the rest of it to keep it more reliable  You know much who was the engineer who left and became a whistleblower  He said that thing about which makes a lot of sense is that there's so many so many services that depend on each other  If there were actually a  Complete temporary collapse of the systems everything had to be shut down  You know basically power cycle everything then they might not be able to bring it back up because some services are dependent on other things  Running and if those aren't running they can't come up. So I don't want to predict  doom but when you  Get 75 or 80 percent of the people at a company are gone  They're running their own data center operations for the most part which is unusual for a company of of that particular scale with those kind  Operations there's so much that could easily go wrong and the person who knows how to fix it is nowhere in  sight so I don't think it's  Necessary that the site just goes down as you know entropy and that they can't fix things but that there may simply be  Too many plates spinning that all crash the ground at once so they can't catch them

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There may be or or maybe okay?

Start time: 749.68
End time: 768.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean I think it's but it's often you know when you if you had if you fired if you fired 80% of your staff  Could you keep everything running on an operation that serves hundreds of millions of people and is got all of these conflicting?  regulatory and  Other I mean they've got regulatory burdens to meet they have technical burdens to meet they run their own infrastructure  I

Start time: 770.26
End time: 868.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Guess that's a good question is which is going to be the first to go is it going to be the content layer or the?  technical layer  The contents going to be tough you've got as you said and I think Elon under estimated  How many different countries he was going to have to appease many of which he does business in with Tesla?  That's going to be a real challenge for him  he also  Seems to have a failing common among some  billionaires that he he seems to be very hands-on and  I little bit worried that you know when he says we're going to turn off 80% of micro services. That's it  Yeah  That there's no one there to say you know Elon. That's a bad idea  And here's why you'll Roth for a long time Jeff Jarvis was saying well  It's not going to be too bad because you all Roth is there head of trust and safety. He's not  In fact wrote a piece on the New York Times. He was very judicious. I think  But he said they don't need a head of trust and safety  Because Elon is making the decisions now in other words. It's not a it's not a  it's it's not a  It's not a democracy. It's not he doesn't have advisors  It's Elon, and he says well. You don't need me anymore because  I got nothing I got nothing to say about anything and they may be and I know probably this was another story was that some  engineers were worried about long-term liability if they stuck around and had no power to  counter Elon's worst impulses

Start time: 870.72
End time: 878.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But okay, so look I  Don't remember a previous time where so many people have like

Start time: 879.40
End time: 885.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actively and gleefully wanted a company to that's a good point and there is a very much and so publicly yeah

Start time: 886.64
End time: 986.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And and even and many of the people who want to fall apart also wanted to stay and not fall apart  You can have both of those ideas in your head at the same time  You know Twitter  Twitter in the long term has been one of the companies that's really  I think forced our society and our discourse to become  Maximalized to become all about like  Exaggerating conflict like Twitter has helped make  Has has helped like professional wrestling eyes most of our conversations. I don't think they've been as guilty of this as Facebook  I think Facebook has been worse  But but Twitter certainly contributed to that and you know a few years ago Jack decided  Hey, this is this is bad  And so they're gonna focus on healthy conversations and they try to figure out our tone down and they were you know successful to some extent  But it's it's it's appropriate like Twitter the company that made  Everything into high drama is now experiencing  Well, yeah, but but this isn't like this isn't ironic it's the opposite it's it's exactly what you would have to happen  But it doesn't mean that like it doesn't like yeah, it's gonna go through a period of high drama I  Think again, it's hard to predict the future. I  Have seen a lot of the stuff that Elon's done  I think we all have I have some sense of the complexity required to run systems that hundreds of millions of people use  I've never I've never operated systems that more than hundreds of millions of people use but I have operated systems that hundreds of glades of people  Use which is not quite the scale of Twitter, but also that was for me many years ago  Things have gotten a little bit easier with infrastructure  So I have some appreciation of that and I've seen other stuff that Elon's done and they're like orders of magnitude harder

Start time: 986.82
End time: 992.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Then then SpaceX is harder what he's done with Tesla is harder. The boring company is harder the boring

Start time: 992.84
End time: 1004.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like look I would have preferred that he buy Twitter and you know rename it the other boring company  Calm and calm everything down and he decided to go in a different direction. That's see you on he's much more complex

Start time: 1004.62
End time: 1063.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want to make sure I didn't I didn't actually insult you earlier because I realized what you're just saying if you built a company  And you laid off 80% of people that worked for you if that inevitability had to happen for business reasons or whatever  I believe your company might actually still run  I also believe Tesla was built, you know, Elon came in a little bit into it. He built the company it is today  He made a lot of decision. He made nearly every decision right same thing with SpaceX. This is not a company  You know, he may not have invented the fundamental technology involved. He's not a space engineer  He made a lot of decisions and it's he's responsible for for good or bad or everything that's come out of that and their ability to perform  Today, he did not build Twitter and he went into Twitter as if he had built it and thus intuitively knew everything that went on  And I I think you I'd like to picture you going to Twitter having spent 45 billion dollars  I'm sure you've got the lying around and have bought it and gone in there and how you would have approached that I cannot imagine  Would be be like him at all because you didn't build it. You didn't build that technology

Start time: 1064.08
End time: 1072.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, look obviously so I I don't think I would lay off 80% of my stuff  I don't know that Elon has either we're not sure what that's where we don't we don't have any idea

Start time: 1072.78
End time: 1073.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We know it's a good deed to set 80%

Start time: 1074.73
End time: 1091.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah  But but if you if you phrase it a different way if you know if I was running something like Twitter and 80% of my  Staff became, you know incapacitated to do  COVID 23 or something  Would I be able to keep it running? Yeah. Yeah, I would be yeah, I believe that if you if you built it, I believe it and well

Start time: 1092.06
End time: 1127.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I mean, I mean I don't think everything is irreducible is non or is reducibly  Incomplex enough that I think I think looking at Twitter from the outside  It feels very fragile and looking at what and watching Musk tear wires out. It makes it feel very fragile  So if it's more resilient than it appears, that's great  And I don't want to dance on Twitter's grave because it's responsible for a lot of professional success and friendships and so forth  But I also don't want it to I think it's climbed out of a deep hole and I don't want it to fall back into it  Which is what it seems like he's leaping broadly into without a bungee cord. Let's say two quick things

Start time: 1128.42
End time: 1206.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kind of structurally about this first of all large, you know in some part thanks to Twitter not entirely but in some part thanks to Twitter  Most things are worse seem worse than they really are  right like most things in life seem worse than they really are because  Engagement based business models ad based, you know micro clicking business models  Incentivize everything to seem worse than they really is and Twitter old Twitter bear some of the responsibility for that  I don't think not as much as you know, not as much as Meta or Facebook, but some  and I think Russia one of the things that he was doing trying to reduce the  the reliance and advertising is like it's a very good thing because like it really can like dial the temperature down because  Otherwise the incentive is to make everything seem worse than it really is  So that's kind of the first thing and again Twitter is now at the eye of the Twitter storm  It's like all of the inflated drama is not being focused on itself. So, of course, it seems terrible  That's exactly what you mean was not saying it's not bad, but it's probably it's probably  Not as bad as it seems. It probably looks worse than it really is. The second thing is like  I  Don't think that Elon I don't know him very well personally  but I  very much don't get the sense  That he is a person that surrounds himself with the estimate really people that see this is very much that's interest Wow, okay

Start time: 1206.86
End time: 1216.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's good news. That's a good thing  Does I know I know besides Jason Calacanis and David Sacks advising his his text messages would not support your statement

Start time: 1216.32
End time: 1217.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's because he's in professional wrestling mode

Start time: 1219.38
End time: 1225.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean his private text so he's doing a whole Kogan at this point. Yeah  privately and publicly makes the same kinds of statements

Start time: 1226.04
End time: 1241.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know I know I know, you know several people that that that are relatively close to him and other companies  I know what he's built. You don't you don't build you don't return rocket boosters  Synchronized it's pretty impressive back to earth. I agree being surrounded by yes, man  You just don't but that's the kind of thing that happens

Start time: 1242.14
End time: 1269.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a conundrum about Elon is there is this amazing track record and I really loved the manifesto  He wrote for Tesla way back in the day and yeah, and and it's very impressive. But then there's this other guy  The guy we see on Twitter  And it's a it's like a different person  It's like a guy who's used too much acid and is confused and seems to believe his own  Story and it's it is possible. Isn't it Phil that that he's changed a little bit since

Start time: 1271.06
End time: 1275.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's possible. I don't I wouldn't know it's yeah, I don't know it's obviously possible, but it's also possible that it's gonna be fine

Start time: 1276.60
End time: 1501.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I would I want it to be fine cuz I'll tell you one thing and I think everybody agrees Twitter is important  Yeah, and and it would be a horrific outcome if somebody buys it and drives it into the ground  There's been some speculation Wesley Faulkner sent me a tweet or I'm sorry a toot saying  He thinks that Elon was forced to buy it  He knew the court was gonna go against him  He was gonna buy it and what he's trying to do is get out of his debt by forcing a bankruptcy and a reorganization  So he doesn't have to pay back the debt  He's got a very large nut to cover a one point three billion dollar interest payment alone every year  So that's it. That's a completely out of nowhere theory  I don't know about finance in the way you do obviously  But is it possible that that's what's going on that Elon just wants to get out of this and this was the only way  He thought he could do it. What's the outcomes razor explanation?  God I don't that's this, you know, that's this  The simplest solution is always the right one, but I don't know what the simple solution is  Here's here's this scenario that sounds like the Occam's razor to me  Elon in a jest almost and maybe in a fit of peak said I want to buy it and  Then for 5420 the very fact that was 5420 is the price to me implies jest  You know the 420 and there's marijuana reference  that then somehow  This is the question mark  How do you get in this he made an agreement with Twitter that he would buy it without due diligence  Which no intelligent business person would ever ever do so. I don't know what happened there  Remember he bought 9% of it in  And then in January and then in April went public with that wanted a board seat Twitter did not want him on the board  He got thrown off within 24 hours, and I think that that was what happened. I don't think he stepped out  He was thrown off at that point he got pissed off  Does that when he made this bad deal in any event ever since within 24 hours?  He was writing to his lawyers saying hey World War three is gonna break out. Can we back down now?  You know, he said I want to hear what Putin has to say before we continue the purchase  Like Putin was gonna create World War three and maybe we better not own Twitter. He was trying to squirm  He was right. He was squirming. He wanted to get out of it for a long time  At which point Brett Taylor  Chairman of the Twitter board says no, we're going to court. We're gonna hold his feet to the fire. He has an agreement  We're gonna make him agree  Elon said no. No, there's bots. He came up with all sorts of things. I think we were getting very close the day before his deposition  we'd already seen this tranche of  Personal DMS that were not embarrassing to Elon by the way, but embarrassing to every single other person was  DMing him including Larry Ellison who says I'll give you a billion he says can you give me two? Yeah, do whatever  He raised the money. He went through all the steps that takes some, you know cloud that takes some ability  He negotiated with the Saudi sovereign fund. He negotiated with Larry Ellison  He got Goldman Sachs and a bunch of banks to give him a 13 billion dollar loan  Or is it 11 billion some huge amount and  Then but he wants to get out of it he I think on the day before he's supposed to give his deposition  Somebody told him maybe Spiro his personal counsel said you're gonna go you're gonna have to buy this  It's gonna go against you. The court is pretty clear the Delaware Court of Chancery is gonna make you buy this 44 billion  Because at that point says all right, I don't want to go to court. I don't want this deposition  I don't want any more DMs revealed. I'll buy it  All of that is that inaccurate Phil that that's that that timeline that seems like that's pretty much what happened. Yeah

Start time: 1501.88
End time: 1625.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, first of all, I own  court of Chancery calm  It's for sale I think on the day I think when when Brett tweeted I'll see you  Best offer accepted  As good as three Pete yeah  Look it sure I mean some version of that probably happened but you can hope but like I  Think there's a different Occam's razor way to look at this right the simplest explanation. What's the simplest explanation like?  Elan's kind of being obnoxious on Twitter because that's what one does on Twitter and  That's what that's what people are rewarded for in Twitter  That's like the point of Twitter and he kind of has that you know, it's part of his personality traits  He I'm sure I'm sure you guys are right  He probably underestimated some of the complexity probably came in there thinking like I build  Rockets that can you know land back on earth like how hard could it be and I'm sure he  Underestimated it and he pissed a bunch of people off and a bunch of people quit and a bunch more people quit  That all makes sense  But at the end of the day  He really did build these rockets that land back on earth and he really did build the car that I drive right now  Which is the best car that I've ever owned and it Twitter like yeah, it's it's it's more complicated than he thought  But it's less complicated than the stuff that he's that he's done before and I think there's a very strong chance  So again with way more drama than I would have wanted to see it's gonna turn out  Okay, and if you can actually do some of the things that he's talked about and of course, there's gonna be outages  There'll be failures will be outages, but we all remember the fail  Well, we can live we can survive. So like yeah. Yeah, it'll be there'll be outages and  I think again, I'm not guaranteeing this. I don't know and you know, I'm not I don't predict the future  I think there's a very strong chance of like in if you know within a few months like it's gonna be better than it was  A few months ago and it'll be fine  And that's kind of what I'm counting for because like I would try master Dom, but I can't deal with another elephant app right now

And I would love to see Twitter. I think you're right Phil  I think he will find a way to make this work. He spent way too much money  And so he'll find a way make this work and there are there have to be good engineers out there  He could bring in there may be a learning curve for them as well as him  Twitter is so important. My problem is  That the hardest thing about Twitter is something by the way that they never really solved  Forget monetization because advertisers are already going. I don't want to do with this CBS came back though, which is weird

Transcript:  Oh, no, we're back but advertisers by the way are not doing that. I have to say advertisers are leaving the tech sector everywhere  So that's I mean we can't we can't sell podcast advertising to save our life in 2023. So that's not  Just Twitter's problem, but that's also not my problem because Elon will figure out how to monetize or not  But he'll figure that out. I worry more about the moderation problem and  And and what the problem?  What is that old saw you probably know this Glen where you let one Nazi into your bar and then pretty soon you own  Oh, yeah, there's somebody

Transcript:  Yeah, there's a bartender who told a good story about that on Twitter about right  It was like the first one comes in and they and they seem they're there by themselves  And they you know, they don't make much of a fuss and if you don't throw that guy out then pretty soon your Nazi bar  It's like an inevitable. I mean, this is this is all the the tolerant  Being overwhelmed by the intolerant right? There's a whole political philosophy about how we should not  Or an argument and I'm gonna say a flaw. It hasn't been decided right?  This is all societal issue is is it better to let people talk and let sunshine in or to moderate suppress do other things outside of  Governmental approaches not government censorship to prevent points of view that crowd out other speech, right?  This is always the battle we have is is free speech when people are free speech  So-called maximalists talk about it  They talk about everyone being able to speak freely and yet some speech crowds out other speech and there's no balance in that power  So I think that's the Nazi bar scenario was like if you let too many Nazis on a Twitter and it's the thing  he's like I think  Unsuspending Kathy Griffin and Donald Trump and Jordan Peterson and a few other people all at once is actually sort of a masterstroke  If he had just done people who are right-wing figures or people in a certain cultural  Matrix, but you let Kathy Griffin back on and she's over master. Don't say no. Thank you. I'm not I'm not even gonna pay attention that  That's a whole different argument about what he's trying to chart

Transcript:  Yeah, I think Kathy Griffin was a throw-in because everybody else cat turd and the bumblebee  cat-turd bumblebee and Donald Trump the big three  Those are all on the right-hand side of the aisle. I think that that is not Elon. Elon's I'm sure not a right-winger  He's probably a libertarian  and  And probably wants the free speech thing. He likes that idea  But as he's quickly learning free speech doesn't sell ads and it and it does and it's a Nazi bar problem

Transcript:  Look, I think how much of the problems of the speech problems on Twitter right now  Would have existed  You know a few weeks ago would have existed pre Elon  If the the people who are making the problems were all incented to right now go and do do the stuff that they're doing  You're kind of having two things happen, right? The first thing that happened is Elon took over and now every  Nazi or anything else like this is the time this is like ah  Like this is my moment now is when I'm gonna do this  Whereas before you know, it's like their activity was spread out over the course of many years now  Like everyone in the same week is gonna be like yeah  I'm gonna make fake corporate accounts and I'm gonna upload the movie speed and I'm gonna be a Nazi because like that's where all the  Attention is because then CNN is breathlessly reporting right about how like Twitter is falling apart  like if you were gonna do on Twitter you would want to do it last week because like  Is on you? Yeah, so even if even if you want to change nothing  And it was like literally the same exact code base, which I think mostly still is there's obviously some changes  You still probably would have had the same, you know the same problems  So your question really kind of decouples into two parts. You said what if it takes him a year?  It decouples into two parts  How long does it take for it to get incrementally better than it used to be and I think you know every couple of weeks  It can get incrementally better and at the same time  How long does the does like the moment for the nancy stick around because they're gonna lose their interest  They're not gonna like keep up this intensity of douchebaggery for the next year.

Transcript:  Phil, you know you you talk about well he has  put rockets in space and and  revolutionized electric car company, but rockets and cars are not media and  media  is a lot harder than it looks and Twitter is media and  Leo's right about the moderation problem. Those trolls do not go away. Look at fortune. Look at a chair  right, right, right and and and so, you know, I think  Elon has two personality failings that that he's always had and  They they come into  they come into this situation and kind of have bloomed one of them is hubris and the other is he  Really believes he huffs his own  Smoke and he really believes that he knows better than anybody around him. And so he tears it up and  Then it's kind of surprised at the mess. He's made and calls them back  He he essentially kind of doesn't know what he's doing  And is now winging it and he may indeed be able to bring it back, you know  Supposedly he's got this plan to create a kind of uber app  x.com  That so it's just like you could you know what he may be thinking as well  Before you can create something you have to destroy it and that's kind of what he's doing  but it didn't have to be that way and he's he's ruined lives and he has  Crippled careers a lot of these people are going out into a market where they're where tech companies are laying off not hiring  And so it's a you know, he didn't have to be done this way  I saw a headline that referred to his brutal management style and I think that that's that's the problem the  You know, the question becomes if you're a Twitter user if you're a Twitter investor if you're a regulator  does the end justify the means and

I think that that would be a very sad end to something that was so  Vital for so many people you one of the things you're seeing on Saturday and Friday was people saying I met my spouse here  You know some of the best interactions I ever had in my life on Twitter and I you know  some of the most hateful interactions ever had my life run Twitter as well, but  Twitter is important and it'd be a shame to lose it  I feel more that way about Twitter than I do about Facebook for instance, which I don't think will be a huge loss

It's it's very easy  I think what we're talking about is an excellent example of that phenomenon you're describing which is Twitter is about drama  It's optimized for drama because it optimized for engagement which improves advertising sell through if it's not too  Horrible, right advertisers don't want to sell against horror  But they want to sell against a certain level of churn  And so I feel drawn into that because I'm watching every day this nonsense people be with the chaos and I'm like  Oh, but I can listen to Phil I can step back and say, you know  This is gonna settle out or it's not and I don't have to I don't have to get all fussed about it

No questions multiple choice even essay questions  They reformat the resume so it's easy to read them. They do all this stuff to make it easy  To hire fast and fast is important when you've wearing many hats, right?  Four out of five employers who post on zip recruiter get a quality candidate within the first day  But I could tell you our experience has always been within a few hours  Which is such a relief because now we know we're gonna find somebody I love Lisa  She'll post a breakfast and by lunchtime.

I think there's a lot of legal things you could say about what she did  But I found myself having a little glee about like oh good  They got her and then I'm thinking this poor woman at some level  It was it she did cause actual or seemingly cause actual harm to people who got misleading  Blood results like she could have put people in danger and there are issues there, but I also think she got  She got disproportionate attention because of her gender and I think it was there was a sort of gendered response to it  She did lead a giant fraud and she should take responsibility  Responsibility for what she did and doesn't seem to be able to but I also I don't feel like I should feel great about  Anybody going to jail especially when you know, it's clear  She has lots of the fact that she can't really see that she did anything wrong that these things she  Is a futurist who was too optimistic I think that is a sad thing not necessarily to be celebrated

Transcript:  I'm I have really complicated feelings about it. I think it's it feels unfair to me  It feels unfair not  Not compared to other people that have been sentenced for fraud  You know made off got 150 years and you know, Jeffrey skilling got 14 years or whatever so that that seems in line  But it feels unfair when you compare to all the people that we know  Have done far worse that never get prosecuted  So I think it depends on the frame of reference if you're if you're if you're comparing her to other people that have been sentenced  For this kind of stuff then yeah, it's about right  but it's hard for me not to compare to all the people that I know do far worse every day and  That don't get prosecuted and don't get anything and I think in general like I don't like these, you know  Send a message sentences. I  Think they're unfair. I think like what we should do is we should prosecute many more people  We should give we should be like much more consistent with prosecuting fraud. We should have much more prosecution on, you know white-collar crime  So that it should be a predictable outcome of defrauding people as it is right now  We prosecute very few people and then the ones that we convict sometimes they get massive sentences  But I don't I don't a that doesn't seem fair to the person getting a sentence and B  That doesn't seem like the right kind of deterrent effect because like I don't think most would-be fraudsters are  Deterred by oh, yeah, this is the one in a million shot that you know  Maybe I'll get caught and go to jail if you were next Elizabeth Holmes isn't looking at this going

This time was a kidney survived. He's actually gonna be fine the person whose organ you rip from his body  But if it had been a heart would you have done anything differently?  And I sometimes think that's the calibration factor is I think about homes that I'm thinking it does seem like too much  It doesn't seem like it has a deterrent effect  I feel bad for her children or family and the harm she committed did she you know was she out there actively killing people?  You know well  There's some arguments that there were so there were adverse health effects that resulted from some people getting a bad test  Test information and the thing is I think if a hundred people had died  From this as opposed to that would be different that would yeah, but I think also  I don't think her behavior would have necessarily been any different is the problem well

I'm sorry finish you said nice.

For her, but there are people who I am worried would break into my house and steal my blood  And I right there's some probably there's some crooks. I don't think Elizabeth Holmes is an ongoing danger to anybody  Yeah, I think that's the issue although you know, then you have well I think Phil  I don't I wouldn't want to put this word into your mouth  But it's like Adam Newman is an example of somebody who raised feeling all right, right?  And then he's he's completely successful in but I mean, I think he's a true believer in what he does  Absolutely religiously so but how was he never I mean, I don't want to make accusations against them.

Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I think there's all sorts of interesting questions here. I mean one. I think just very basic questions. Where'd the money go?  Where'd the money go with Elizabeth Holmes?  Where did the money go with Adam Newman?  Where did the money go with SBF and I think those are very different answers?  Yeah, and and I think I think that answer is kind of important to like determining the level of at least moral  culpability mm-hmm of people  Just as far as we know and I think we know pretty well like Elizabeth Holmes didn't wind up with with a big chunk of that  money right  Adam Newman wound up with some of it significant amount billion or so it's interesting that Marc Andreessen would give him another 350 million  Well, but but but but seriously like if you're evaluating you know fraud potential fraud or actual fraud like where did where did the money go?  right I

Transcript:  That's somewhere out the incentives though you asked a very good question  about like what's what's broken by the sea and and I think like  Look, I know you know obviously a lot of you sees I was a VC myself for  Two years at general catalyst a bunch of people are you know friends of mine, and I think for the most part  A lot of these people are generally good people. They're genuinely smart. They're genuinely good  They generally want to do the right thing not everyone  You know who you are but for the most part they're not though

Start time: 3710.38

Start time: 3717.36
End time: 3745.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're trying to make an investment that will pay off a lot of them are trying to use their money to good really  Absolutely, but but look here's the thing here's like the main thing that I figured out  The vast majority of people myself included will act according to our incentives  So first we act according to our incentives if you look at how the incentives are set up that will predict how we act and  Then most of us myself included will act according to our incentives and then make up a narrative about why that action is morally

Start time: 3745.80
End time: 3749.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's how all decisions are made by the way yeah, that's how mine works

Start time: 3750.74
End time: 3820.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that narrative is true. We believe it we really do yeah  But but but it's not surprising that it just so happens that the morally correct thing that we tell ourselves  Happens to always line up with our financial incentives the vast majority of the time  So if I want to lead a moral life, which I do  The best way to do it since I can't trust myself to not follow my incentives is to make sure that I set up my incentives  First to to to to go in the direction that I want to go and not everyone does that  So when you look at how VCs operate, how does like how do they make money? What's the incentives?  Well, they make money by investing. They don't make money by not investing  They make money by investing. They make money by investing a lot  They make more money by investing a lot. Yeah, they make more money by investing a lot quickly  So they can raise the next round so they so they could raise the next fund so they could you know stack  Management fees and carry and all that stuff  It's a business fundamentally, right a hundred percent almost all of the incentives are set up for  Invest like invest as much as you can now the vast majority of these people  Will do it with due diligence or what they think is the right amount of due diligence  And they'll do it because they genuinely think that it that it does money-making

Start time: 3821.58
End time: 3831.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the question they're asking isn't this is not is this gonna make the world a better place  Maybe that's a secondary question. The question is this gonna make money. Is it real? Is it gonna make money?

Start time: 3832.62
End time: 3917.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you can say well, but you know, they should do a lot more due diligence  Okay, but most of the funds like, you know  Even that invested in like FTX and stuff like those funds are actually doing great  right because like the VC model is predicated upon for the most part believe founders and  Yeah, once in a while that's gonna screw you but the belief founders like tends to in the past of historically generated very good returns  Because you do get the Steve Jobs and the and the everyone else's who like yeah, like to some extent  There's a fake it until you make it but enough of a make it and make it big  That like that it's worthwhile so like this this is the model the way that it's been set up and that's why when crypto comes along  It's like the greatest thing that a lot of these investors have ever seen because the crypto comes along and they're like  we need  420 million dollars and you're like for what well, I don't know because no one knows what crypto is gonna cost  There's no like it's not like a SaaS company. We can kind of say oh you need this many engineers  You're like, I don't know and so the investors sitting there looking at like wow, I can raise and I can write a giant check into this company  Which means I can get my next, you know fund like all of that like again all these incentives take over  So it's like it is a it is an incentive system sort of scamming itself except actually over time for the most part  It works pretty well, but then we pick bits and pieces to be like outraged over

G I mean the problem with crypto, you know, if you're investing in it is  It's it's as purely a speculative investment as it can be right

Because gold has a small industrial value  When you buy gold, you're not buying it for its industrial value  You're buying it because as a speculative investment you think it's gonna be worth more tomorrow because somebody's gonna pay more, right?

Transcript:  Honestly if a stock doesn't pay a dividend  you're buying a stock in a company doesn't really give you ownership of  Anything tangible because you know without the dividend there's no payback if the company does well  Even when you're buying stock you're buying something that you're presuming is going to go up in value based on some you know  the news or whatever  So there's an all in all investments are somewhat speculative

Start time: 4026.60
End time: 4052.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you're somewhat even except in stock you are your your in theory  Your value goes up if the quality of the prop company's product is good enough to warrant it to go up  There are other factors like the news and there is speculation  But you know if if I mean look at Apple  Apple's products were lackluster and dying on the vine

Start time: 4052.46

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and Steve Jobs came in and made but isn't that good products to some degree an illusion unless the company buys back its stock  Takes its profits and buys back its stock increasing your value or gives you a dividend the actual stock value is what investors  make up  Look at GameStop. It wasn't because their business suddenly was great  No, that was a joke, but that's what I'm saying is that kind of  Even stock investments are somewhat in that realm of speculative, but you made an excellent point  Phil the even the smallest attachment to reality is better than zero. It's it's like a seed

It's like it's an actual  It's a thing that there's one of yeah a stock is you know  The value of a company is the you know the current value given you know net present discounts of all future profits  That's the floor of it so most companies are worth something and so there's a floor because it is like the  Present value of future profits, so there's like a floor below which I would buy it right

Start time: 4139.32

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, but but but because there's a floor you can do all sorts of  Financialization on top of it right because like the floor is a real thing right so you look at GameStop  Which was yeah absolutely a meme stunk  And I like a problem, but what probably happened right is like it was before this it was it was actually undervalued because people were like  Oh, it's physical stores  And they're never gonna do anything and then it became a mean a mean stunk and there was like a lot of activities  And it's settled into a range that's way off what its highs were but also significantly higher than it's been trading it for the past  You know five years before  So like there is a I think there's a big difference between like a tenuous connection and absolutely not yeah  And I think we kind of under under appreciate that the difference between there's no floor

HMM app  Definitely worth taking a look at and we're so glad to have its its founder  Phil Libin I do also want to talk about Evernote in just a little bit, but first a word from our sponsor Nareva  Now we just talked about the video in your next conference call. What about the audio and I think everybody  Knows and if they don't you should know you can have great video if the audio is bad  It's over game over man game over you gotta have good audio and nowadays  This is problematic because your hybrid work right so there's people in the office. There's people at home  In order to have a meeting you're gonna have you know a conference call  And that puts your IT professional in a tough spot  It means you know now you have to equip and and support more spaces with audio and video conferencing systems  But you know you also worried about the next you know email exploit next spear phishing attack  You got a lot of issues with network security you maybe you're doing your cloud shift your infrastructure issues  And and maybe you got you know you got problems with the card key system, so who has time  To work on the audio and your meeting rooms  Now you can do it, and you don't have to think about it in intelligent product that requires minimal effort from IT  to deploy and manage at scale with a bonus of requiring zero and  User training and when it comes to conferencing in larger spaces  This is a great solution  You have to bring in some AV company to wire everything up and install it and maintain it and tweak it every single time  No, all you need is Nareva  With Nareva you get true full room full room mic pickup  From just one or two microphone and speaker bars two only if you've got a giant room  Compare that to all the microphones and the wiping down and the putting of the muffs on and the speakers and the amps and the  DSPs and the switchers, and you got a tune in all that's crazy and the cost  Nareva you can install in most spaces in less than 30 minutes ever put up a soundbar  That's what it's like for larger spaces. Okay, you're put up to it's gonna take you an hour  Amazingly simple. No special expertise is required. You can manage and  Deploy it from your seat  Adjust all your Nareva systems from their cloud-based platform. It's called Nareva console  Completely scalable for large organizations and the sound is great their patented microphone miss technology  Puts thousands of microphones in your space people can walk around they can move around they can face any way  They want they can socially distance like they want it's suddenly  It's flexible.

So I you know continue to be a  Shareholder of it, but again, I've you know, I made the decision when I left about eight years ago  So  This was like 2015 I think 2014 2015 decided to replace myself as the CEO and my original plan was  We'll get a CEO and then I'll stay on as like, you know executive chairman. I'll do product stuff  I'll do like strategic I kind of I kind of wanted to do with like  Reid Hoffman did at LinkedIn, right?  when he brought when he brought Jeff on that was kind of my model and and I knew there was like a  50% chance that it would work and a figure sense chance that it wouldn't because like, you know  They bring in a CEO like what's actually gonna happen is gonna depend very much on you know, the new CEO  so we did a search and  It turned out within a few months of  Chris O'Neill was the CEO who replaced me and then Ian Small took over from from that  It turns out within a few months that like yeah, like me hovering around was just like  It was way too difficult for me for the new guy for the company  It's just like it just made no sense  And so I made a decision about eight years ago that like look I'm you know  Okay, I got to be out and I got to be out like completely not like hovering around  Yeah, you know I would have done this right?  You shouldn't really are you sure about that? Like cuz the whole point is like  Of course, he would do things differently than I would have done him  That's why we decided to have him and not me  so I thought the best thing I could do was like hey, I'm around for any kind of help if you ever needed and  I'm a supporter of the company and I'm friend, but I'm not gonna I'm not gonna hang around

Well, they bought it because they love it because they think it's a great app and because they think they can make it  even more successful like this is not a  You know, there's no like magical nefarious reasons why an app company would buy something if they just intended to not do anything with it  So I feel pretty good about it.

Yeah, this was it's I I recommend it  I don't know about its conclusions and I you know without your input  I don't know if he you know, he says ahead of its time behind the curve why Evernote failed to realize its potential he starts  With Stepan Pachakov and you getting together creating Evernote  That's about when I found it  I had been using one note and the thing I loved about Evernote was the ribbon thing that I think you brought to the table  This idea of this continuous note. I just loved it and  Put everything in Evernote  For a long time it was long after you left it was I think when they went to the subscription  Model that I finally said, you know, I'm gonna find another solution and nowadays there are a lot of open source free solutions  This has become a very crowded market with a lot of different segments of the market note-taking by itself is  You know become you know Zettelkasten and all this stuff  But Evernote for years was great were you there when they did the separate apps like the hello app and the food app and all  of that

I just sold my second company in Boston and started working on  What I was calling ribbon  As a way of like a ribbon tie ribbon around your finger to help you remember stuff  I also wanted to build like an infinite memory messed upon and we just sort of really hit it off  And decided to kind of merge the two companies and so we recreated Evernote because it had been a new corporate entity  That was called ever note in 2007. No, no uppercase N one word  And yeah, so so the the thing that the people that most people know with the elephant and all that stuff  That was yeah, that's that's what we started elephant never forgets. Yeah, and  Yeah, remember everything was the slogan that was still it's still the best thing I've ever written. It's kind of sad for me  It's like the best thing I probably ever write in my life is those two words  And yeah, I was there for the first nine years and then I stayed on as I think chairman for for another year after that  But yeah, we did we did a bunch of different apps.

Yeah, it's a big company and  I thought I'm just not like I thought we could afford we could get a better CEO because  And you know and then when you kind of we talked a lot about being a hundred year startup  I think it was on your show  I remember the hundred years the hundred year startup meant like that we want to be around in a hundred years  But we still want to be a startup. We still want to be like innovating  And a big part of the hundred year startup idea was like me getting comfortable the fact that I'm not going to be the CEO  for a hundred years, right  Obviously, so like it has to be my job to get the next person who's better or else, you know, we failed  So once that happened, it was again  It was time to step away when it became obvious to me that having two people hanging around and like making top decisions  Just wasn't going to be good for anyone.

Transcript:  It just didn't I think it just didn't fit into their evolution  So I was like, ah, it's like Joe Joe was the thing that fit my brain best  Mm-hmm. And so when I encountered ever it I'm like, oh and actually figured out how to export your Jimbo to ever note  It was great  And I was like this is I need a junk drawer for my brain that matches my brains internal organization scheme  But the thing that took me over and why I paid the subscription fee and still do is the built-in OCR  Where that was, you know, that was not unheard of at the time  But it was pretty weak in a lot of apps you had to use, you know Acrobat have a paid subscription to Creative Cloud  and now I feel like the pervasiveness of  OCR isn't especially Apple the last couple releases  I mean they added this thing quietly where you could search in iOS 15 before the release of IOS 16  We're only on the search screen. You could search for  Text in your photo library, but you couldn't do it in photos  Then they rolled it all out and this notion that all text everywhere  So in ever note now in my notes app and photos and almost everything I do everywhere all  graphical text is now  barely affectable searchable fairly effectively searchable say that five times fast that is a  That's a massive difference in like the history of humanity  Not just like I mean, you know data is great to store, but we have so much data that's not in  Entered a text entered Unicode whatever format it's  So anyway ever note I felt like that was this big eye-opening thing  We're like I throw a thing in there and at that time it took I think a few minutes sometimes to do the OCR  And now it's essentially as instantaneous and I just have I don't have to worry about anymore  It's just a seamless process across all these apps

Start time: 5253.78

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we did I think we had a couple of innovations that are very much table stakes now  That we kind of we were mainstream with it first, you know one of those OCR  One was just synchronizing automatically  Like it was the first time that I did like put something on my Mac and then pull it up on my iPhone  You're like, I don't I don't have to like enough to like set up an FTP server  Mastodon instance, whatever they're called now  Like it just worked. There was no like we were one of the first things that didn't have like the concept of a server  It wasn't the users didn't really have any like options like that  You want to use USB to move things over FTP? It just it just worked  There's a lot of that kind of stuff then remember we were pre cloud  Like we the the the the ubiquity of the cloud kind of came around  After we were a couple years old already. We had our own data centers  Just like you know Twitter apparently does like we had to build our own data centers out  We were we were on the App Store from day one. We were we were kind of  As every company launched a mobile phone in an app, you know  We had Apple did it and then and then Google and then Blackberry and palm and like all of these, you know app stores  like there was five apps that every device had to have like on it pre installed and it was always like  Facebook Twitter a game a web browser and overnote  We were like we were the default thing and and those are all thing accomplishments that I feel great about  I feel great should part of that team should  And I think but like that's not enough now everyone does that  So it needs a new it needs a new set of innovation  The stuff that bending spoons did is like honestly like I hadn't heard of this company before but I'd heard of their apps  Yes, and to and the apps are cool and they're they're innovative and I feel beautiful  You know, you know like figure out the next the next amount of innovation  I mean again, they wouldn't have bought it if they didn't if they didn't think they can do it

I'm in are you in let's all get in  a lot of celebrities now regretting their association with crypto in general and  Specifically with FTX. There's a big FTX lawsuit that holds the celebrities feet to the fire  Which kind of surprises me?  Steph Curry the Golden State Warriors  quarterback Tom Brady his supermodel wife Giselle Bunshin and  Larry David  All being sued  For the ads they did for FTX now  I guess is it true that if I had money in FTX that I'm out of luck that I'm never gonna see that money again  I think that's the case  Although I heard over the weekend that SPF  Samuel Bankman Fried was going around trying to raise money to pay people back  Like who's gonna give him money?

Transcript:  I thought you know, I'm always quoting Matt Levine at Bloomberg because he writes a great column very good  Yeah, trying to describe the difference between liquidity and solvency  whereas regards crypto exchanges and it's a good read and if I recall it correctly, it's kind of like, you know,  Liquidity has to do with whether you can you know redeem funds and solvency has to do with whether you can survive  You know more or less as a business entity  So if you have I don't know if you have a thousand dollars of assets that are locked up and illiquid  Then you may have a liquidity crisis if you have to redeem a thousand dollars, but you still have the assets  So maybe someone will buy you right solvency is you have a thousand dollars in  Deficits for every dollar and assets you have and there's no way you get out of that and he's saying SPF and FTX and MOUSE  All have  You know solvency issues  So you can't raise money into an environment in which there's no hope of ever  Getting an investor to get a return on putting that money in they might as well let all the the chips fall and if possible  But you know the the Enron  The guy who solved Enron after the fact right got as much money as he could for Enron shareholders is in charge of the FTX  All that's in dispute too. He's in charge of the FTF bankruptcy  There's a competing bankers claim from the regulators in the Bahamas also Lord so anyway, but but  What a mess you remember the made-off thing? I mean made-off is a good example is Bernie made-off, you know  extensively lied to people about the value of their holdings  But he didn't necessarily lose all their money and in the end through clawbacks and an incredibly  Yeah, yeah  I think people got almost almost a hundred percent back on what they initially put in they just didn't get any return on it  They lost out on the biggest expansion in value of their money over that period of time  You know if they put it in the S&P 500 or anything else right before

I feel like one of the things that was different and say 2007 2008 is different now is that companies  made real things and  Had real revenue and so when things went a little awry  They had something to fall back on like actual business and then the crypto market just sort of turned that back  we kind of round wound the clock back much worse to  2001 era where companies were I mean this goes that substantive thing you had companies like pets.com that were  shipping 20 pound bags of  litter

Oh interesting  I thought her voice sounded perfectly normal. She talked like that then or what she she I picked up  No, I usually have a pretty decent I think like bullet filter. I was very impressed with her  Just being honest it easy for me to be like hey, I knew something  No, but that's reasonable because what she was not if she what you didn't know what?

What are my first like very large check and  I thought well, I don't really understand how the technology works. And so I'm not really smart  I don't know. I can't really do it. But but I was gonna do it  So I said can I see you know, can I come over can I see the machine?  We have to be how it works and they were like, yeah, of course, absolutely like come over any time  We'll open it up  Show you and then it just it just never quite got scheduled and then they already wound up taking more money  And so I kind of missed the boat and I felt bad  Honestly, I felt bad. I was like, oh man, I moved too slow. I'm not a good VC  Which turned out to be true for other reasons, but like I kind of thought  Like what like I should have just invested I had this opportunity everyone wanted to be in this deal  She would have given to me I could have just written a check and and I didn't because I was too slow because I had this  Like I wanted to see it. What would that have shown me? Like let's say I showed up  Let's say they scheduled and I show up and they open the machine. There was like a family of raccoons in there

Start time: 6960.84
End time: 6986.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it is as I said the the true value of any of these is zero and  anything that you put into it is on top of zero and  So it at its core it is a scam and eventually  All of these people who are running these big exchanges are going to I think are going to come down  I think this is just the first it's not the first but it's the biggest

Yeah, I mean although it's say  This is the complicated thing is I think that  tether if they actually had  see it I mean this is where you get to the the  Layers upon layers upon layers like what was tether actually what is tether actually still doing what is what is this stable coin?

Transcript:  It's supposed to be like a crypto reserve currency that you actually have or a gold standard style currency  Where you actually have a one-to-one valuation that's of assets or as close to one-to-one that was possible  That's backing a similar amount of ostensible buying power and fiat currency. I mean that's that's the intent and  tether had claimed for a long time and then had to change those statements and is in the midst of a lot of things that  They actually had  Deposits that were actually liquid or close to as liquid as possible, you know cash and cash equivalents  Equal to the amount of tether they'd issued in, you know various currency denominations  I can see a central bank doing it where the central bank was using it as a  But it's not a stable question is it a stable coin when a central bank uses a cryptographically backed method of  Issuing currency or allowing currency to trade they do it now  They just do it as an entry on a ledger that they retain that you know, the Fed or something

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but no, I think I mean my blockchain requires I mentioned this still in private block chains where your participants who all have  Staked against each other where it's not a  arbitrary  anonymized  Participants based thing but I think there's I think there's a valid case to be made for using I mean like so DNS  Which is a very technical thing obviously  But at its root  I think DNS is a very effective distributed mechanism with certain centralized components that a lot of different often  Parties that are in disagreement all agree to let run in a way that's verifiable  So like DNS sec like the some of the encryptographically backed elements of DNS that have been gradually built up over the years are  Really effective centralized decentralized things and so I say we do have models of that or even certificate authorities  Revocation of specific authorities all that kind of thing those systems work the cryptographically based and you have lots of parties whose interests aren't  entirely aligned or the same modes of governance of countries and so forth and it all  Generally works most of the time in a way that we find effective

Transcript:  You know, there's a great use case that was made for in fact kpal was making this case briefly  And I think they backed off for it from it last year  Which was crypto was a way to help worldwide remittances  there's some hundreds of billions of dollars that people who are economic and other immigrants to other countries send back home and the average rate they pay is  Upward sometimes of eight to ten percent and it's a huge middleman  Thing and the UN is set as a goal to reduce that I want to say below five percent. Maybe it's the three percent  They have one their you know vision  2025 or whatever and there's been a lot of work worldwide because every dollar that's taken from an economic  Migrant working in a different country or even the same country sending money back to their family or to others  It's just sort of stolen out of their pocket  There's very low costs involved when they're giving cash to an institution that's then just literally transferring it somewhere else  So that's a wonderful area that's right for development and people are working on it doesn't necessarily need the blockchain was sold as well  Maybe we could use crypto to solve this because the fees are very small and then of course the fees went up  Crazily on transactions the whole you know  Bitcoin and etherium went through the roof in terms of the cost and that whole market disappeared  So I do hope that there's actual attention continuing to be paid to reduce the cost of people sending money home  But crypto doesn't seem to be the answer there

Of course, but why isn't it?  Is it because it costs like, you know Visa MasterCard or Swift too much money to send those electrons  No, it costs that much money because somebody likes it  So if you want to make a non exploitative financial system, the way to do it is to make a non exploitative financial system  You know make transfer wise right like transfer wise or wise. I think they're just renamed, right?  Like yeah  They let you send money to lots of places and they give you the cheapest possible rate  Yeah, and like it's not blockchain because it turns out like all you need to do is be like  I'm gonna make a bank and I'm not gonna screw people  Yeah, and it has nothing to do with like burning down the whole tech stack  No, it has to do with trying to make something non exploitative, right?

Yeah wise charges the least not only it's not that they charge the least they expose all their fees  So sometimes there are better alternatives.

Transcript:  I think like in general my heuristic on this stuff is you when you look at anything that's really screwed up in the world  And you know financial institutions is definitely one of them  And you but you pretty much look at anything that's really screwed up in the world and you kind of ask  Well, why is this screwed up? The answer is almost all the time because somebody likes it that way  And then you have to say why qui bono as they say yeah and and right and the analysis is like well who likes it  right and what do they like about it and  What can we give them to like more and what they're going to like about it, right?  And and very rarely is the answer. Well, why something's re-up in the world  Oh, it's because we need a completely we need to burn things to the ground and have a completely different stack  That's not a good answer. That's not not usually no. Yeah  So, yeah, but look I I'm glad we're having this conversation because us four old guys are totally gonna kill web 3  I assume that everyone that's heard it is like wow, we're done with this

Transcript:  We build stuff before there was hype around it right? We weren't like, oh look at us  We're building web 2.0  We build things and then millions of people use them and got benefit from it  I don't like I mean by we I mean like ever know but also like Dropbox and uber in box and all that stuff  It's like this is a scam. I don't like this is a scam. I'm not telling you  We I mean like ever know but also like Dropbox and uber and box and all that stuff and before that Yahoo and Google and Amazon and  Millions and millions and millions of people used it and loved it and got value out of it  And there wasn't like there wasn't hype it was like, you know  We weren't saying that this is like some new thing  We just build stuff that works in and it was mostly built by engineers and then web 3 the engineers like for the most part  There's actually not a lot of interesting technology in here. It's not a technologist thing  I think the reason Leo that you're kind of skeptical about it is like  Your history is like you were a tech person and cryptos not tech cryptos finance  Yeah, a bunch of the finance bros got involved and they just there's just gibberish like all finance people  And they started like hyping this web 3 thing before there's a single  There's a single use case that's actually being used by millions of people getting value that isn't like self-referential  That isn't about buying more crypto and scamming other people out of like crypto  And so like this is a case where  Like I understand that yes  There should be some if we're gonna call if we're gonna claim what like, you know  The previous generation was web 2 then of course  There's gonna be something called web 3 because 3 is a larger number than 2 and it comes afterwards and like I get it and somebody  Will build something but it's not gonna be based on the blockchain because the blockchain is a pretty idiotic idea technically  Like it's kind of interesting  Intellectually not really but but technically like almost nothing can be built on it  And nothing has been built on it that's real and it's been long enough, where's the real stuff  Where's the stuff built on blockchain again that isn't so for a friend show that isn't about like  Speculating on other blockchain stuff, right? Like the first book like it would be as if when Amazon got started  For a while you can only buy books about how to how to how to sell books on the internet  It's like all the books on Amazon were just like other how-to books about how to sell books  And  They'd be like see it's successful. Look at all these books  We have about how to sell books on the internet make it at home in your spare time  It would be like if YouTube got started and like all of the videos on YouTube was about like how to post videos on the internet  Yeah, yeah, like but that's what web 3 is.

Transcript:  Yeah, all right. Let's take a break. I have some final stories to wrap up. I could go for hours with you guys  This is for me is is like fit. I am my eyes are opened the scales have fallen  I'm gonna throw my Bitcoin wallet into the sea  virtually  He's never gonna get it Glenn Fleischman is here Glenn dot fun two ends but lots of fun. Mr  Dwight Silverman  Author e.com slash D Silverman and the wonderful Phil Libbon. Mm-hmm  Mm. Mm dot app. That's how he makes it snow man. That's how he does it  We are gonna take a little break come back with about 12 very quick stories  Just cuz I want to wrap it up in a couple of obituaries to our show today brought to you by Express  VPN  We talk a lot about VPNs the idea that you protect your privacy online  If you use a VPN that you protect your security if you're an open Wi-Fi access point that you can watch  You know Netflix in Japan if you like manga  Those benefits are real for a VPN in effect  You take your browsing and you encrypt it and then you emerge into the public internet somewhere else  But I got to point out it's really important that you choose the right provider  because everything you're protecting yourself against with your VPN is  Suddenly available to the server the the other end when you emerge the encryption goes away your you know  You've got to choose a VPN provider who cares as much as much about your privacy and security as you do  Who takes the money and by the way never trust a free VPN ever?  Because they have to monetize somehow you how do they do it you so takes the money you pay them a reasonable fair amount  of money and invests it in  Servers all over the world good bandwidth for every one of those servers  rotates their IP addresses so that it's fresh every time you use it and  Somebody who takes the time to make sure that your privacy is a hundred percent protected. That's Express VPN. There was a great article  I recommend it if you're at all interested in bleeping computer about how Express VPN works  They use a custom Debian distribution that wipes the drive on reboot and they reboot every day  So even if they were logging your activity  It'd be gone every morning when they started up fresh  But they're not logging because they also invented something called trusted server  Which is a VPN server that runs in RAM only sandboxed it cannot write to the hard drive  So when you press that big button on your Express VPN app it launches that server in RAM  It disappears when you close it and that's it and we know it works  We know it works because they have independent third-party audits that say yes, they adhere to their privacy policy. Yes  trusted server works as  Stated it's just really good. They're now using something new called lightweight  It's a new VPN protocol that they engineered to make user speeds faster than ever  I know sometimes when I talk about VPNs people say well, I don't want to slow my connection down  Express VPN is so fast. You'll forget you're using it  In fact, I often forget and leave it on which is fine you can stream video and HD quality no buffering  It's thanks to this great lightweight VPN protocol  Really really cool Express VPN runs on everything  You've got your your Android your iOS device your Windows PC your Mac your your Linux your Chromebook  You can even use Express VPN on your router. They sell routers now with Express VPN on the router and  It's not just me saying this business insider the verge  Many other tech journals rate Express VPN the number one in the world for those reasons now you say alright  Well, it's not free. How much it's not much about seven bucks a month and I'm telling you you pay any less than that  That's because they're taking advantage of you  Protect yourself with the VPN. I use and trust go to Express VPN comm slash twit  They've got a 30-day money-back guarantee so you can verify everything I say is true  When you buy a one-year package you'll get three months free that brings the price down to less than seven bucks a month  This is the key  You got to trust the server. You got to trust the server. I trust Express VPN  I think you should too Express VPN comm slash twit  We thank them so much for supporting this week in tech and we thank you when you use that address when you buy Express VPN  We then they say all that those ads work and they buy more of them  Express VPN dot com  Slash we had a great week on to it this week.

I knew you'd want to know that I was we have a new  Thing what do you call these?  Scientific it's an SI unit yes  international system of units  The last time they added new units was 1991 when they added Zeta and yada  You know there's zeta bytes and yada bytes  There's also I mean you didn't know this a yada meter which is 24 zeros one followed by 24 zeros

I did not know yeah, so R and Q are the new ones Rana or  Rano and Keta Q. You eat ETA or Queto  These are the new metric prefixes the world's largest and smallest  measurements when it ends with an a  it's  Large when it ends with it. Oh, it's small  So you have a kilo meter. No, I see other way. I don't know. I don't understand this stuff  the larger prefixes end with a  The smaller and oh, so I see yeah most of them, but not all of them apparently not kilogram. Yeah  There's no kilogram and micro. Yeah, but nanometer and Nana  I don't know  So I just wanted to tell you so you'd have this to use it's the first time in 30 years new prefixes have been added  The 27th General Conference on Weights and Measures which meets every four years at Versailles  Because why not?  Has now proclaimed  the two new  Things the earth  Now we can say weighs six Rana grams that's a six followed by 27 zeros  Jupiter is to Quetta grams. That's a two followed by 30 zeros  So, you know 27 then you add three and there's 30 so the Rana is 27 zeros. The Quetta is 30 zeros  No hella bites or Bronto bites, okay  Nothing more to say about that, but just one let you know you're gonna do next they're out of letters  Yeah, they're out of letters. We can't I'm sorry stop alpha the alphabets. I don't know what they're gonna do  That's a good question emoji. It'll be like  They'll go to hex  That's always the solution whom loud you  Yeah, it's diacrit. I don't know. That's a good question. Yeah, but what do we do?

He said well, I have them and he listed three doomed emissions that his cameras a bit on so across his entire working career of  20-something years at this point the work that he had done it finally and now we're there, you know  NASA's firing in all cylinders they say for the last like 15 plus years and  Commercial firms as well ESA as well has been so many successes  Picturing spending your entire working career having all of your cameras blow up in space or crash on landing and then suddenly it's like  Oh five of the ones of the curiosity are ones that had my hands on  Amazing slick but amazing to be at that time when you can have that many cameras and they can send back data from relay station
