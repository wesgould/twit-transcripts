Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, the Grammys. I mean, it's crazy. But what made it even crazier was obviously Whitney Houston's death suddenly  Yesterday which was I mean it was it was pretty wild that whole occurrence  And the crazier thing was that it happened at the Beverly Hills Hotel, Beverly Hilton  Just where the Clive Davis his famous party that he has every year the night before the Grammys  and Clive Davis is who really discovered Whitney Houston and so to have that full circle where he basically  Uncovered her and revealed her to the public at his big party, right? Obviously, you know, we're talking about decades  Yeah decades ago probably almost  But and the fact that she ended up passing away at that same hotel the night of the party

Start time: 428.68
End time: 489.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, what I found interesting, you know immediately so some I was at home I got home and  Henry was there with some friends and one of his friends said did Whitney Houston die?  And I said, oh i'm sure not but and you know what I did. I said, let me check twitter. Yeah  First thing I did and and in fact, it was all over twitter and I said she did die turn on cnn. What is cnn doing?  reading twitter  They did that's for an hour. They read twitter out loud because that's where all the stars went to report it  Yeah, but twitter actually had this story  Half an hour before mainstream media broke it  This guy named big chorizo  Uh who has 14 followers. I don't know where he got the story, but he had it  uh  literally, uh at 457  uh p.m  No, i'm sorry. He had it at 4 30 p.m. That was 27 minutes before the associated press  Had the publicist statement  So once again, if you want to know what's going on you read it on twitter. Yeah

Start time: 491.06
End time: 494.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This has been quite consistent with almost every news story something though just because it's on twitter

Start time: 494.94
End time: 506.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, that's the thing. It's like until yeah, somebody knows a little bit about that  Yes, here's it. The thing is I mean we all saw it on twitter as well and obviously before we retweet someone

Start time: 507.32
End time: 519.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You've learned that you learned that lesson somebody in you  Somebody in in shira's organization  tweeted, uh that steve jobs had passed away long before he did  And uh, and that actually cost well that cost you a lot. I know you lost your cbs

Start time: 520.42
End time: 573.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean it was a huge deal on it. It showed you google before you tweet  I you know, we had seen it. I saw it online also or on twitter first  And I was telling daemon who's my um, my partner and my executive producer  I go oh my god, whitney houston died. I just saw it and he goes  Oh, well, you should google and at that time we googled again and we didn't see any other sources  And so we weren't going to jump on the story until we saw, you know, someone else picked it up or it was confirmed by a more legitimate  outlet and then finally when the associated press confirmed through her publicist, that's when  You know, obviously you realize that it did happen. I mean the thing about twitter is obviously  Possibly it can break  Stories before a an official outlet because if you have someone who's on the scene a random person at the hotel a friend of a friend  They'll tweet it but you know, once again, you can't base real news on hearsay. Can I ask can I ask a rhetorical question?

Start time: 574.78
End time: 586.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What difference does it make to anybody whether you learned out that whitney houston died at four?  4 35 a half an hour after it happened an hour after it happened to anybody in the world who what difference

Start time: 586.64
End time: 592.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But you know because you've worked in mainstream media that they care a lot even bloggers care about only because the other guy

Start time: 592.90
End time: 597.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. You want to be the first, you know me versus scobel. To be honest. It could be just gossip

Start time: 597.72
End time: 608.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But but some of them could have looked friend of a friend maybe real people don't care  It was yeah, you you need some sort of secondary confirmation of it  That's this is what's interesting though

Start time: 608.28
End time: 680.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then I think this is one of the things that twitter is a little different twitter's unmediated now that you're right means it could be  Completely wrong, but it also means you can hear from the horse's mouth like the guy who heard the osama bin laden raid happening  And tweeted it. Um, in fact mashable found the very first tweet about whitney houston  Uh says oh my god my aunt tiffany who works for whitney just found her dead in the bathtub  That that is you know within a few minutes of that happening now  We know that that's real now if you had read that of course you wouldn't immediately go and say oh this is what happened  You'd want to vet it, but I think that's what's different in some ways and that's one of the reasons  Uh that it was interesting cnn was spending so much time reading twitter  What they were reading was all the major celebrities responding to whitney houston  Where do they respond not through their publicist not through a press release not through a call to cnn. They tweeted it  Now here's the other thing I thought and this is  Even you know kind of more meta they weren't reading facebook  and I think that this is one of the reasons facebook is trying to change the way it works because  You know, you got to figure facebook's looking and saying look at all the press twitter is getting  This is where people are going to make public statements  They can't go to face because how is cnn going to read their face?

Start time: 680.92
End time: 690.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is funny because I was listening to a show on the way up on 9 10  Some guy called the tech guy  And he said the exact same thing. Yes, he did in the same exact voice

Start time: 691.44
End time: 700.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I think that's the story. Don't you think though?  That's kind of an interesting story  And if you want if you want one reason why facebook keeps changing its privacy policy to be more public

Start time: 700.64
End time: 709.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's that they want to be like twitter. They want to be they have this thing called subscribe now where you can subscribe to somebody without  Being a friend so you you but you understand cnn

Start time: 710.52
End time: 743.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is never going to be able to read at least until there's a complete wholesale change in the way facebook works  Because when you read something that's been sent to you  On cnn, it's not been given. It's not been published publicly. It's been sent to you individually. I  I've I breach privacy every time I show my facebook page on camera  Yeah, because every because those people have not given permission. I can show my twitter feed. It's already public. Yep  So facebook can never cnn can never show facebook reaction even though the facebook reaction  Well, it could have was better the reaction on facebook was richer. It was better was longer

Start time: 743.36
End time: 752.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Start time: 752.80
End time: 780.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know that they're in a panic. Well, I I do believe I mean that's why some people I know who work at facebook  I mean they encourage you to be  Sharing your updates more on facebook doing it not through the twitter app doing it directly on facebook  I do believe they want to create more news when people update, you know their status  Because of the privacy setting but  It's not a go-to source, right?  Search real-time news I go to twitter right now

Start time: 781.16
End time: 797.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's jeff pulver and he has an item up there where he's retweeting the san jose mercury news  And it has on on the on the message in facebook where it's shared with and this one is shared with public  So you could share that message.

Start time: 797.80
End time: 808.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  CNN is not going to go there. They're just not going to go there and more importantly if macy gray wants to publish a reaction  About whitney houston dying where's she gonna do it not on facebook?

Start time: 809.04
End time: 815.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She's gonna do on twitter probably both because i'm seeing lots of reactions from celebrities on facebook

Start time: 815.70
End time: 828.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was a much richer reaction because they have more words. They could post video they could post pictures  There was much in fact it was a much riskier stream on facebook  I liked it on facebook, but but you won't ever I think you're not going to see that on cnn for that very reason

Start time: 829.08
End time: 839.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm not i'm not certain why this is even an issue or what why we care what cnn does facebook  Very small market cares because it's free advertising facebook cares. Yeah

For things he tweeted  Hard to believe just death by tweet. Yeah  But first let's talk a little bit about backing your stuff up. You know, if you're facing death by tweet  It's probably a good idea to have a backup of your data  Can I believe I said that?  Go ahead john take a walk. That's right. He just left i'm talking about carbonite.com. It's online automatic continuous backup of your stuff  For 59 a year less than five bucks a month for everything on your internal drive, but it is  Fantastic, you know, you're gonna live on long and long long, but your data is  Frankly on death store all the time those hard drives die  There's malware out there and frankly the biggest threat to data us we throw stuff out by accident  When you've got it on carbonite, you know, it's always there. In fact, what's cool about carbonite is you can check  It's cloud storage. You can check by logging into your carbonite account on any computer mac pc  Smartphones tablets. There's your stuff  You have complete access to it all the time less than five bucks a month unlimited backup of your internal drive  They do have plans for external drives multiple computers, too  So they've got a business versions as well go to carbonite.com  If you use the offer code twit, you can try this. You don't need a credit card  You don't need anything but the name twit you can try this for 15 days. That should be enough for your first backup  And then if you decide to buy  You get 14 months for the price of 12 for 59 bucks, but you got to use the offer code twit  Your data is really your life. Keep it backed up. Keep it safe  Don't come crying to me. If you don't do this we get people on the radio show every week who say  I lost my data and it's like  dude  I've been telling you about carbonite for years carbonite.com  Offer code twit. I actually got an email yesterday from a guy who's mad at me  Because he'd lost his data  And I had done a carbonite ad before that and he for some reason thought I was talking about him  When I did the carbonite ad it was not aimed at you sir  It was not personal everybody, you know forgets to back up. That's why carbonite is so important carbonite.com  I do feel for this guy hazma kashgari  He published  Tweets he he published tweets  In which he was having an imaginary dialogue with the prophet muhammad. Uh-oh  Not good off it's off limits yo  He wrote for instance these tweets have been deleted since he wrote for instance  I have loved the rebel in you, but I do not like the halos of divinity around you  I shall not pray for you. Apparently that's so sacrilegious  It's blasphemy. He also wrote I shall shake your hand as equals do I shall speak to you as a friend no more blasphemy  It is blasphemous. So he started receiving death threats  His address was posted on a social media site  Clerics began calling for him to be executed or tried in saudi arabia. Oh, no february 8  Four days ago.

Transcript:  Now but this this is this ties into that twitter's announcement a couple of weeks ago that they were going to  Follow the rules in each country about censoring tweets  But what I liked what twitter decided to do is to make it because their api makes this public  Yes, if you're in saudi arabia, you can't read these sacrilegious tweets  But twitter makes it available to everyone else in the world which tweets are being censored by which country  So you can actually go read a database of tweets censored in saudi arabia, which is I think exactly the right response. So  I know they got a lot of heat for censorship. I think that's the exact right way to uh to respond to it  And and we you know, we'll just watch with interest of course those tweets get read more than any more

Transcript:  Now path when you say yes path uploaded  Your entire contact list to its servers and it kind of makes sense because it's there on the servers that they compare  It against the database and says oh shira scobel and john are on path  Would you like to have asked them to be friends that makes sense path did a couple of things wrong though?  They didn't tell people they were doing that and secondly they kept the data  And the reason they kept it is so they could continue to match  So if you have new friends they could match it again if somebody got added to path like if sure well john wasn't on path  Isn't on path, but it knows that john's in my contact list  So if you joined it would then ping me say hey john just join and this happens on path john would just join  Would you like to follow him and I think that's a nice feature?  um  Instagram does it facebook does it I would say almost any smartphone app that says would you like me to find friends in your contacts?  if you think about it, they're not going to download the  Contacts from the server and compare it on the phone  They're going to upload from the phone of the server now some have pointed out quite rightly  So there are technical ways they could avoid this for instance. They could hash emails and just upload the hashes  And that would be protecting your privacy. Yeah, but it's computationally intensive on the phone side  And uh, and it isn't as complete on the other side. I guess the question is first of all  Do you not trust path? Are you really worried about them selling your email address?

Uh their company right in the long run. Is this going to change you felt bad for the reception of it?  Yeah, I felt bad  We always feel bad when you have and i'm sure you guys feel the same way  You know this, you know the ceos and founders a lot of these companies and for me personally  It didn't really hugely affect things.

That's why I had this problem with facebook because it when I joined it  It said would you like to stick your google contacts into this and it asked you to upload?  Which is better than the way path did it because path did it sort of sneakily. It didn't it really explain what it was doing  Um, but they already facebook already has all my google data  And i'm sure mark zuckerberg didn't delete anything from his databases that i've uploaded  Facebook so I don't know how they're collecting it today because google turned them off remember that  You know in the early days facebook was actually hooked up to google.

Transcript:  On the internet here you are in public and it's gonna happen here. We're headed straight down that road  But that's a that's a discussion for no agenda show.com  Here's what here's here's nick's point in this school  Here's nick's point the big deal is that privacy and security is not a big miss  I don't disagree with is not a big deal in silicon valley while the tech narate  Tripped over themselves to congratulate. Mr. Moran on finessing the bad publicity. I didn't by the way  A number of concerned engineers emailed me noting that the data collection was not an accident  It would have taken programmers. Of course, it wasn't it was  They were competing with instagram it was no accident it's not an accident nobody's asserting that it's an inadvertent  Uh, we know they did it on purpose. Um, i'm not I think it would be unfair to and  Look, i've i've met dave. I'm not a friend of dave's. I have a lot of respect for him, but I think it would be  Uh going a little far to a cirque that somehow path was taking my email addresses for my contact list and like selling them somewhere  I think that they were using it for exactly the purpose they described and that's all  Um, if you think they're doing otherwise, then you then you would have a right to be upset. Are they selling our email addresses?

It was a teachable movement dave moran  Was the bad guy he learned he said oh my god, you're right. I we weren't thinking about the consequences here  Let me delete the data change your policy. We won't do it again  Others like instagram learned by example and responded  I don't think that people in silicon valley don't care about privacy and security, but I think this stuff's moving very fast  There's pressure from investors, but it's also just moving very fast and there may be  You know missing stuff it always happens. The real question is how you people make mistakes  It's how fast you correct it now how I think how sincerely you're correcting and I think it's sincerely there's an app by the way

That's wrong  And that is wrong dave weiner wrote a whole article about this. So they changed it then  Well, not really. Okay, so that's true. They're not asking with a slope  They've been playing a slippery slope with not telling people what they're doing  Because because it's  If you put up a warning it some people like john won't use it  All right, and some people like john will say no don't don't  Connect connect with me with my friends and you're saying the pressure from investors is to get john  They want everybody look at this highlight app  This highlight app goes way beyond what pat does itch hooks you up to people that just walk by in the street  The investors love this shit because it's so viral  Right went through a party that nobody knew about this app in 20 minutes  It was amazing to see the virality of this app, right?

There's nothing better than an audiobook  Audible.com try it right now. I'll tell you what I can get you two books or two credits  um, so you can get some of the longer books like game of thrones for instance the new uh,  Season on hbo is coming up the clash of kings if you've not yet read  Any of the song of ice and fire books?  This would be a good book for you to read the game of thrones book is just brilliantly performed by a guy named  roy dotrice  And I think there's five of these now in the song of ice and fire  This is the first one hbo did last year. The next one is coming up. I think next month  And uh, you you you better start reading now if you want to be ready for it  So this is two credits you could do this or you could get any of the single credit books by going to audible.com  slash twit two  You'll be signing up for the platinum account. That's two credits a month. That's the one i'm a member of  and  You can pick a book any book cancel at any time  You don't pay a penny in the first month and the book is yours to keep forever  The trick is finding a great book. There's so many of them. It's narrowing it down actually  Go to audible.com and browse around  Wow, I bet john would like this the origins of political order from pre-human times of the french revolution. See there's history  There's biography there's business mysteries and thrillers.

So, you know with obviously the youtube premium channels  That blending blended into the you know google tv  Is that where people are going to be consuming all their content or with the apple tv, you know possibly they might be  Investing in original content as well plus all their partnerships that they're doing so on tech meme right now

These companies  Are talking about distribution they're talking about platforms, but what sits on platforms what sits on distribution? It's content  They still will need us  I hope yeah

Start time: 6223.26
End time: 6272.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What we think about rn is like what types of deals I mean exclusivity obviously at this point because these platforms are so new  It's like you don't know who's going to be the leader. Do you want to be exclusive to one right now?  I mean  That's not something you want necessarily unless possibly they're investing in your content right now. You're seeing a lot of these youtube premium channels  Google or youtube has an 18th month exclusivity. So  That programming that content can't be viewed anywhere else and that's a pretty big deal  So I think we're going to see a lot of those different partnerships come up also possibly with apple  I have to say though changes and then it also in in terms of the way you interact with it  It's like I think the future of content is can I have an app where if i'm watching on the apple tv or the google tv tv  How do you take advantage of all these tools to make the video more social and more interesting and engaging?
