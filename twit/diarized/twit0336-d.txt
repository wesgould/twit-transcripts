Oh man, just back from CES and I've got an  exhausted bunch of people. Actually, you know who's not exhausted? Oh Malik,  because he didn't go. Oh Malik from GigaOM.com. Nevertheless, there was lots of  coverage on GigaOM. But you feel like you can just stay home and watch.  That's right. These days, you don't have to be anywhere to watch news. And staff

Start time: 172.72
End time: 192.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the stairs box, is that you're facing, because we want the cameras to face out  so we can see the floor. So that means you're facing away. So all you ever see is  the back of somebody's head. But hey, that's the price we pay for a great video  shot. Let's see who else is here. Tim Stevens from Engadget, who is probably  exhausted. Engadget was really all over CES this year. Thanks. Yes, I'm first

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  coverage. And then yeah, there was the stage in Central Hall. Tim Stevens, editor  in chief of Engadget.com. And finally, somebody I don't think who's ever been on

Start time: 213.56

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  been for you? If you add up CESs and Comdexes, it's probably close to 30.  Infinite. It goes back to the dawn of technology. It goes back to the 80s. We're

Start time: 238.08
End time: 258.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  going to save our CES coverage for the second half of the show because there's  while we were at CES, huge stuff was happening with Google. Right. And it was  actually a little frustrating. This is not the first time this has happened. I  remember CES in 2007 when Apple announced the iPhone. We did not want to

Start time: 258.56
End time: 262.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  be at CES. Some of our colleagues flew to San Francisco and flew back. Exactly. We

Start time: 263.60
End time: 280.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  wanted to be sitting in that audience. iPad announcements. But this is the first  time Google's stolen the thunder. And I wonder if Google did this on purpose.  They turned on social search in effect. Danny, what happened? Well, Google's had

Start time: 281.38
End time: 297.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  personalized search for going back to say 2006. But in 2009, they turned it on  for everybody and by default, even if you weren't logged in. And practically  nobody noticed this. It just really got no attention at all. So the search, how

Start time: 298.28
End time: 301.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  does it personalize if you're not logged in? So it looks at your previous searches

Start time: 302.08
End time: 314.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that you've done over a period of I think 180 days. By a cookies? By your  cookies. Wow. So unless you kept your cookie out, even if you're not signed in,  it was already personalizing your results. I did not know that. Yeah. Well, nobody

Start time: 314.64
End time: 318.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  really realizes it. What if you were in incognito mode or private browsing mode?

Start time: 318.66
End time: 363.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you were in incognito mode, it wouldn't do anything because it shouldn't be  getting a cookie in that regard. So as far as it's concerned, you're somebody  different. And in fact, if you really didn't want personalized results, you  would have to use incognito mode to make that happen. And so they've had that  before. That was already happening. But they have also ramped it, basically  ramped it up now. And they've taken content that you may have shared through  Google+. And they've taken the personalized stuff that they were already doing.  And they've kind of mixed it all together. And they switched that on last week. I  think it was Tuesday. It's already becoming a blur now. But basically said, okay,  we've got this new thing called Search Plus Your World, which I've heard people  either say as SPYW or I've been calling it Search Plus.

Start time: 364.76
End time: 375.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Spu! Search Plus is more appropriate because, and Twitter screamed about this,  it featured Google Plus social information, but not Facebook and not Twitter.

Start time: 375.60
End time: 388.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. So it does a couple of things. You've got, first of all, the ability where  you do a search and it says, here's some personalized results. And by the way, we  can see that you shared this information just out on Google+.

Start time: 389.74
End time: 403.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me show you right now. I'll do a Britney Spears search, something I never do.  Hit return. And so the results with the person's head next to it, those are  Search Plus My World results.

Start time: 403.58
End time: 422.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And what that's telling you is that you may have shared it or somebody you know  may have shared it, but for whatever reason, it's giving it a little bit more of a  boost than it would have done if you were signed out. Although there's a very good  chance that if you click on that little glow button next to it to turn off the  personal results, she'll probably still be up there.

Start time: 422.56
End time: 435.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, because this is her site. Although it does say that she's in 1.4 million  Google Plus circles. If I click more by Britney Spears, I'm going to get Google Plus.  And the second result is from Google Plus.

Start time: 435.76
End time: 464.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, it says Vintage Picks by Tumblr. I'm pointing at my screen as if I could point  at your screen. You see how it's pointing to a Google Plus post.  Now, go back up a little bit higher. Click on the glow button.  There you go. So this will be in high personal results.  It turned it right off. It's gone. And it wasn't really a Tumblr result.  It was a Google Plus post that had been shared by somebody you know.  And so it caused that to come up a lot higher. And that was the personalization that was

Start time: 465.28
End time: 481.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  happening. Notice also when I turn off personalization, Twitter is the third  result after Britney's site. This is what you want, by the way.  Britney's site, Wikipedia, Twitter. That's about right. If I go now, Britney's site,  Google Plus, Wikipedia, images, then Twitter.

Start time: 482.93
End time: 502.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And how they have names on them. Some of those names are images that people you know  have shared just with you or with a particular group of people.  These are from Google Plus. That's part of the problem. If you had a Flickr account and you  shared information on your Flickr account to just a certain group of people,  the Search Plus world won't find that. So it's nice in the sense that...

Start time: 502.56
End time: 516.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And look at all the YouTube. And this is the other thing that bugs me.  As an Internet broadcaster, hugely favors YouTube. I mean, these are all YouTube results.  If you're not on YouTube, forget it.  Danny, can I ask you a question?

Start time: 516.56
End time: 519.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And similarly, if you're not on Google Plus, as I'll show you in a moment, you forget it too.

Start time: 520.62
End time: 540.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But go ahead. Who is that?  Yeah, this is Larry. So Danny, I have a website called SafeKids.com.  And I'm always wanting to see how I'm doing when I search for Internet safety or online safety.  Now, if I'm logging to Google, I'm always going to be number one, right?  Because it knows me. It knows that I go to that site.  So I want an objective view of how I'm doing. What do I do?  Do I just hit that globe and turn off the personal search?

Start time: 540.56
End time: 572.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You tap the globe button, and that'll give you the closest sense that you can have.  I don't have to log out? Does that matter?  You don't have to log out. The globe button should do it.  The only other things that will happen that... There are no more normal results.  The normal results are always personalized because even if you're logged out...  So you'd have to use incognito...  Even if you use incognito mode, you're still going to get personalized results because of your geography and your language.  So you search for football where you're at, somebody searches for football in the UK, they're still going to see different results, even if they were logged out and all incognito.

Start time: 572.60
End time: 580.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are we losing some of the value of Google's original algorithms, which are showing us the, quote, most important sites based on some reasonably objective criteria?

Start time: 581.93
End time: 583.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Potentially, and potentially is making it better.

Start time: 583.66
End time: 594.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In theory, massaging search results with a social graph gives you more relevant results because people in your social graph picked those results, right?

Start time: 595.14
End time: 624.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. If you remember a year ago, Google was coming under great fire that somehow the results were irrelevant because they were being overrun by content farms.  At some point, you've got to come up with other signals to figure out how to rank these things.  And Google's primary signal has been links, looking at how people link.  Relatively few people link to material. A lot more people share the material socially.  If you can tap into the social signals and have them be trusted, theoretically, you've got some nice signals and you've got the ability to perhaps have better search results that are coming up.

Start time: 624.56
End time: 633.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But what about being self-referential? It's the old joke people used to say back, you know, I don't know how Nixon got elected.  Everybody I know voted for George McGovern, this idea that you live in a world in a bubble.

Start time: 635.02
End time: 647.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It can happen. And yet when you do a search and I see this time and time again when you have people who try to compare search engines, they do ego searches and they search for themselves.  And if they don't find themselves, they declare the search engine.

Start time: 647.56
End time: 654.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you will now because it's massaging it to be when I search for me, I get it. I get all my stuff. It's nice. It's a warm feeling.

Start time: 655.32
End time: 664.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It should be said, by the way, Bing has been personalizing for a year now as well.  You know that you go in and you're getting the personalization and you cannot even turn it off as easily as you can do with what Google sort of changed.

Start time: 664.90
End time: 671.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So personalized results are kind of that's interesting because some of the response to this has been people moving to Bing, but that's not any better.

Start time: 673.00
End time: 677.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they don't realize that Bing is is personalizing as well. It's just personalizing using Facebook.

Start time: 678.52
End time: 681.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, what is this at top where it says 200 personal results?

Start time: 682.94
End time: 693.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that is a way for you to narrow in and just see the stuff that's been shared.  So if you click on that, you'll see just things that have been shared personally. And it will probably be very heavily on Google plus stuff.  It shows my home address. Thank you very much.

Start time: 693.58
End time: 702.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You get to see yourself a lot.  Now, only I see that obviously.  Give me a sample search, Danny, that will that can maybe show up some of these problems.

Start time: 703.08
End time: 704.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's a better thing. Do a search for music.

Start time: 706.15
End time: 706.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.

Start time: 707.20
End time: 717.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. And this will get to the core of what Twitter is all upset about.  Scroll over there to the right. Oh, sorry.  Go back to the beginning. You want to go back to just regular Google because you're still in personalize.  So click on the logo.

Start time: 718.94
End time: 734.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Click on the Google. I'll go to the front page.  I should be set up for you and then do a search for music.  OK, there we go.  Now, over there off to the right, people and pages on Google plus related to music, Snoop Dogg and Britney.

Start time: 734.94
End time: 736.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And note the fun being at showing up there, by the way.

Start time: 737.37
End time: 739.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think Bing was smart. They bought obviously bought that search terms.

Start time: 740.04
End time: 750.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You've done a search for music and Google is saying and they've taken prime real estate where they normally show ads.  They move those down. They're saying, hey, why don't you follow some people and pages on Google plus?

Start time: 751.40
End time: 754.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, these are people I already follow. Would I see people that I don't follow here?

Start time: 755.66
End time: 762.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No. Well, first of all, you will not see anybody suggested as a possible person or page that you should follow unless they're on Google plus.

Start time: 762.72
End time: 770.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So actually, Larry is seeing Larry is seeing Britney and Snoop as well, even though you don't follow them.  Neither one of them. As far as I know, they may follow me. I doubt it.

Start time: 770.90
End time: 778.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I am seeing a different I am seeing different results. You won't use it because my top I get Pandora.  And mine is my Pandora is three down for me. Go ahead.

Start time: 778.88
End time: 785.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the recommendations you will get those recommendations even if you're in incognito mode and have no Google plus account.

Start time: 785.56
End time: 789.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And where does that come from? Is that from the number of circles that no, it's just good.

Start time: 789.80
End time: 794.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the exact way that they decide what to show you isn't isn't specific.

Start time: 794.68
End time: 805.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They haven't said Britney and Snoop's record label didn't pay for this. This was no.  But Britney and Snoop are there because they're on Google plus. Yeah.  And they have a lot of followers. One point four and one point two million.

Start time: 805.58
End time: 841.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Katy Perry is not there because she is not on Google plus.  Wow. Gaga, who I don't think is on Google plus, is not showing up there.  Actually, they as musicians are among the most followed people over on Facebook.  That's interesting. What's happening on that side of the page is Google saying, hey,  here are some people to follow because they're on Google plus, not here are some people to follow socially because we are a search engine designed to show you relevant stuff from across the web.  You're interested in following people socially.  So we have looked at people who are on Facebook and on Twitter and on Google plus to try to show you some people that may be of interest.

Start time: 841.58
End time: 858.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're right. Lady Gaga is not on Google plus. So that really so in other words, Google is using its huge clout in the search market to incentivize everybody.  You're Lady Gaga and you're not on Google plus. You're crazy.  You ought to get on Google plus. And boy, if I were Twitter, I'd be furious about that.

Start time: 858.88
End time: 900.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly. Can I ask Danny a question?  Danny said this reminds me of back in the day when Microsoft launched the Internet Explorer and basically forced all searches and all traffic to go through the Internet Explorer.  Do you see a similarity? And do you really think that there is a case for the for the U.S.  government Department of Justice to go after Google on this issue?  I mean, this your example kind of shows that, you know, you know, technically they're not doing anything wrong.  But, you know, when you look at it, they are doing something doesn't add up when you look at that search and music.

Start time: 900.80
End time: 920.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I mean, so they're you know, they're currently being investigated.  Most people say, you know, the people who are upset with them will say things like you're promoting your own shopping search engine.  And most of those arguments have been kind of laughable because their shopping search engine in turn simply promotes other businesses who aren't charged to be in it.

Start time: 920.56
End time: 928.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and on music. And I don't know if that's because music is so high profile, but I get a Bing ad, I get Pandora and I get Yahoo Music before I get Google Music and YouTube.

Start time: 929.36
End time: 990.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you're seeing tailored results. I mean, that might change up a bit. But they're showing you.  But you're right. In that main column, they're showing you a diversity of results from across the web.  And a really good example is when you do a search on Google and they show you video results, you see lots and lots of YouTube stuff.  But technically they are showing you stuff from Google Video, which concludes things beyond YouTube.  But this is different. This is really the case where Google has said we are going to give one of our products preferential service.  We are not going to try to show search results for people who are on the web socially and give you an inclusive experience.  We're going to just give you the best of Google Plus.  And we are going to integrate it so tightly into Google Search that if you are a person or an artist or anybody who wants to be there, you had better open up a Google Plus account.  And let's show you the last thing what happens after you open up that Google Plus account.  Go go do a search now and just start typing in type in Brittany. Just do it slowly.

Start time: 990.62
End time: 992.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, B R I T N.

Start time: 995.64
End time: 1022.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There. Stop. Look at the bottom. See how Brittany's got her face showing up there.  Holy cow on Google Plus.  And Google is. And if you select it, it's going to take you to her Google Plus profile. Her Google Plus profile is going to fill the entire page.  Wow.  Right. Now, Google could have said, you know what?  We think people should have these kind of search suggestions that are showing up there.  And so you can register your account so that when people type, it goes directly to your like Leo.

Start time: 1023.12
End time: 1029.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Look at that. I just type Leo and the very first result. Now, this is because it's me, though.  What if I go global? It's because of you.

Start time: 1029.82
End time: 1069.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But perhaps you might have preferred that to show up and people get a link that takes you directly to your own site to my blog.  Not to Google Plus. Or perhaps you might have wanted that to come up and you said, you know what?  Most of my activity is over on Facebook. I wanted to go there. You can't do that.  It's only Google Plus is going to be promoted in that kind of way.  So to go back to what you said in the past, most of these arguments, I thought if you take a critical look at them, the anti-Trump argument start to fall apart.  It's kind of like saying, hey, I'm really upset that when I read the Wall Street Journal, I don't get the New York Times sports section.  Right. The coverage is still going to be inclusive.  But that's my problem. Now, in that case, you've got content providers.

Start time: 1069.94
End time: 1081.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And of course, one content provider is not going to promote another. That's the question here.  Is Google a content company or a search company?  And by intermingling the two, I think that is a serious problem.

Start time: 1081.56
End time: 1102.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And this is the most serious intermingling they've had.  There are a few cases where Google is both a destination where you go to and a search company where you depart from.  And YouTube has been one example of that. Google Books has been another. They've had Blogger and a few other things.  But Google Plus is something that they're turning into a major destination.

Start time: 1102.56
End time: 1110.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So somebody in the chat room said, well, I don't see the problem is Facebook does this. But that's the point.  This is Google. Google isn't Facebook.

Start time: 1110.82
End time: 1159.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the problem comes into the fact that if you're a dominant player in an industry, you may have to do more than what the less dominant players do.  But don't. So Google and so good.  And this is what Eric Schmidt said when he was testifying in September that he recognized that they were a dominant player and that they might have to do that and that he agreed that they would.  But as a search company, they may not be able to preference their Google Plus network more than other networks.  Facebook, they're not a search company. So don't have to. However, Facebook might find themselves in another situation down the line.  Somebody could say to Facebook, hey, you are not allowing Google to have access to your data.  And yet you will allow that data or you'll even allow your users to export their email addresses out to Yahoo and Microsoft.  Therefore, that is unfair. You're abusing your dominant position. You've got to do the same. So they may face this down the line.

Start time: 1159.60
End time: 1173.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It seems to me that there wouldn't be the issue if there were no Google Plus, if there were no YouTube, if Google were a pure search company, this wouldn't be a problem.  If they were incorporating Twitter and Facebook. In fact, why don't they incorporate Twitter and Facebook and kind of well.

Start time: 1173.66
End time: 1203.56

Transcript:  And that's where this this would have not been such a big issue if they had rolled out not a people and places on Google Plus area, but instead they just rolled out people and places from across.  It would have been wonderful. Right. You can go right now and say, hey, I want to follow some celebrities.  Where are their accounts? Exactly. And there are small and there are small companies that do that and will tell you, hey, Britney Spears, she's on this, she's on that.  And, you know, you can follow that. And Google could have done the same.  And their Google Plus network could have been as part of this overall whole, which would have been fitting into the search engine model they've all done along.

Transcript:  They did. And they still do. And this is where you get some more confusion comes into play.  I'll probably write up a whole fact about this. But so they wanted to do a deal with Facebook and they couldn't.  And so one of their arguments is, well, we don't have Facebook's data. We couldn't even possibly use this stuff.  You know, we couldn't do it if we wanted to. And then they had to deal with Twitter where they were getting the full fire hose of all the tweets that are being put out there.  And it gave them a good idea. And that's why they built their whole real time search around that.  And that expired about a year ago.  The problem is what they're doing where they're showing you like suggested celebrities to follow.  They know what Britney Spears Facebook account is and her Twitter account is.  And they know it really easily because if you go to Britney's Google Plus page, you click on about, you click on about, she has listed all her other profiles.  As have I. And on top of that, they've even verified it. Right.  So they've got a perfectly good database that they could tap into. But they didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, I think it'll be like, join Google Plus. Oh, my God.  Can you imagine if it was like, learn how to be in Google search results and you clicked on a link and instead of it being like, submit your URL or have a website, it was, you know, open up a Google account.

Start time: 1325.82
End time: 1336.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the only. I mean, you know, maybe maybe they can make an argument that it's, you know, maybe they can say, look, this is it doesn't feel right.  It doesn't pass the smell test.

Start time: 1337.74
End time: 1352.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Can you argue that that's because it's the right side of the page that that's kind of advertising real estate as opposed to the middle column, which is editorial real estate really, really complicated there because the FTC actually has guidelines they did about 10 years ago that said if you have promoted content, that's to say it.

Start time: 1353.91
End time: 1430.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's to support yourself. You're supposed to make it clear. Right. So that's a really gray area.  Are you being shown editorial search results? Are you being shown something promoted? Is that area advertising?  It's not advertising because they haven't labeled it as they're required to do to follow those guidelines.  So, you know, I think Google would argue that it's not really just search results that the searcher wouldn't expect that they're getting some kind of inclusive thing necessarily.  And even if they did, they are saying these are Google plus things.  But I think it goes I think the bigger question just goes back to Google itself.  It just doesn't feel very googly. Right. Google's really all been into.  We always want to include everything. We want to do the best we can.  And we want to have inclusive results. We don't want to have just, you know, one kind of thing happening.  And yet they've rolled out something that really is favoring Google plus in a huge way.  That's prime real estate being handed over.  And if you do a search and you decide that you want to show people recommendations for people to follow socially about music or about cars or about technology,  then you really ought to show the best people from the best social networks wherever those social networks are, not just whoever it is that just happened to use Google plus.  And that's that's the core of it to me that they've really stumbled on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's become do lots of social. And if you're fighting evil, then it's OK.  I mean, I've struggled with this and part of the part of the mindset that I wonder if Google's look.  There's some background to all of this. Right.  Google has been extremely paranoid that important data has been locked up, especially behind Facebook.  And to be fair, Facebook has done some really weird things like they said they cut a deal with Microsoft to share their social information with Microsoft.  They didn't and wouldn't cut one with Google.  We don't know exactly why, but there seemed to be some argument over whether or not you could pull back certain personal information and get it removed or whatever.  But the stated answer from Zuckerberg was, well, you know, we think we work with an underdog.  They'll do a better job. OK, right.  But they never they wouldn't do the deal with Google.  They're saying I think the same thing happening with Twitter and they felt like I guess they couldn't get the same sort of data.  So in the end, it's like, all right, we're paranoid.  Important information that belongs, if you will, to the users themselves is difficult for those users to get out.  Like I said, well, it's an excellent it's an excellent point.  You go to Facebook, you go to Facebook, you cannot export the email addresses of all your friends to Google, although you can do that to Microsoft and Yahoo.  Right. So I think that they may be feeling like, you know what?  Maybe this is a little evil, but we're pushing back against a further evil.  And I think it's an excellent it's an excellent point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I've made this point about both Twitter and Facebook.  They are silos and people are unaware of it.  What they're doing is they're pumping all this information into these silos.  And both Twitter and Facebook are working as hard as they can to capitalize on this information and ultimately keep it to themselves.  And Google obviously saw a threat here because Facebook could do social search and has all this social graph information.  So Google had to respond.  Do you feel like Google? I mean, also, I'm sure Google is aware of the fact that this is going to intensify government scrutiny.  They're already under investigation.  This is just going to intensify it. Do you think that they just said, well, we got to bite the bullet.  We're going to take the chance and see what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that the Google executives probably thought they had a justification for everything that they were doing.  I'm sure I don't think Google did anything that they didn't feel like they couldn't rationalize.  I think they felt like, oh, this is fine. We're not doing anything wrong.  We're we're we're matching up what we should be doing.  And that is all OK. Right. You know, so I like I said, I don't think they do anything that they don't think that they can't rationalize.  So I wouldn't be surprised if they thought, well, maybe this is something we can do that will cause you just do that blog post.  I did it yesterday.

Transcript:  But I'm not so much worried about me and whether what I'm seeing, I'm more worried about the fact that Google's using its immense clout in search to promote Google properties and Google content.  That's the thing that's always worried me. It's what worries me about YouTube as a competitor in effect to YouTube.  Doesn't you? I mean, because we're doing our own content that isn't on YouTube.  I would like that to have a parody if you search for a term like SOPA that twit content as parody with YouTube content.  It clearly does not. And so I think that this is a problem.  And we don't know why it doesn't. Is it because, you know, we don't have active Google plus followers?  Is it because we really truly aren't as good as YouTube?  But but but it muddies the waters would be my one.

Start time: 1686.44
End time: 1696.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, one difficulty with YouTube is that because they have so much content out there, that's one thing where Google often say, well, the reason you see so much of it is because there just is so much content that's happening.

Start time: 1697.48
End time: 1718.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But people are saying, well, you use your clout to promote twit.  But you don't understand. My point is a search engine should be above that.  You need a pure search engine.  You need if a search engine is promoting its own business interests, then it's not a pure search engine.  It's not giving you the best search results.  It's giving you the best search results based on my business interests.  That's not what people want. Exactly.

Start time: 1718.56
End time: 1775.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's what and that's really, you know, I've seen a number of people say this like, well, what's wrong with Google promoting itself?  And and that is where it falls into place.  Google has built his business and built its, you know, if you want morality around the idea that they should point to the best content from across the web, not just to their own content.  There's confusion where people then say, but they point to Google shopping as if, well, that's a long time thing over them favoring themselves.  Google shopping is simply a part of Google search, and it's designed to point to the best content from across the web.  You don't go to Google shopping and then just get stuck on Google.  You get pointed out to merchants.  So but this is different.  This is really a case of Google going through and saying, hmm, maybe there are better things we could do.  But, you know, maybe there's, you know, there are there are stuff that we could gather about Facebook signals or Twitter signals.  But we're just going to use the Google signals that are out there.  Danny, what about the privacy implications?

Start time: 1777.58
End time: 1799.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now, if I post a picture of me, for example, on Google+, I have tremendous control over who can see that.  I could I have privacy tools.  I can make it public just to buy circles.  But now people are seeing it on search and true.  The only people who are seeing it are the ones that I posted to.  But there's a contextual thing.  If I post something on Google+, and it's seen on Google+, does that look and feel a little different if that same information comes up on a search?

Start time: 1802.08
End time: 1889.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Possibly.  I mean, I think the harder thing is that people you this is like the first time for ages.  We used to have desktop search.  They got blended with your regular search.  But it's the first time for ages where we've had this private or limited shared information that's showing up within what looks like regular search results.  Right.  And I don't think it's so much that people did this, the sharing and thought, oh, I would have written that differently if I thought it would show up in search for somebody else.  I think there are different things that happen that people have shared information and then forget about it and don't realize it may turn up again in a way that they they thought it was for good.  Right. Right.  And Facebook timelines like this, right.  If you haven't seen it, it's just great.  The Google search your search plus your world video where Hitler discovers it.  And I love it.  I love it.  And it's fantastic.  I would play it, but there's a lot of profanity.  You did a great job with it.  And there's one scene where, you know, in the hallway, they're all like reacting and Hitler is very upset.  And this woman comes up and taps another woman on the shoulder.  She goes, oh, by the way, you're that picture you at the frat party is up on your Facebook timeline.  But that's what timeline did.  It was like you shared all this information.  You might have thought, oh, yeah, you kind of forgot about it.  And all of a sudden, it was all organized again, put out on your timeline and people might have thought, oh, I didn't even remember it was out there.  I want to get rid of that.  And so it wasn't that it wasn't visible.  It's just it was made revisable, if you will.

Start time: 1889.72
End time: 1904.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think there's something about a contextual place.  When you find something out of context, it could have a different meaning than the context in which it was presented.  And again, they're not violating your privacy.  It's just the way in which they're presenting it may be different than the way you perceived you were posting it.  Well, exactly.

Start time: 1905.98
End time: 1937.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like when you when you posted something about, hey, check out my new car, you didn't perceive necessarily that when somebody did a search for cars, your new car was going to show up in their search results, even though you did the permission to get it.  And then you get into the issue where you probably really didn't think that maybe they thought that was cool.  And then they reshared it without thinking about it being limited privately.  And they share it out to the world.  And suddenly there's your car with your license plate sitting out there.  It's interesting because I'm drunk, you know, right.  You being so I'm so drunk shows.

Start time: 1938.28
End time: 1949.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So to summarize our chat, it's interesting because almost everybody in our chat room is defending Google and says, hey, it's Google.  It's a business.  They could promote their own business.  What's the problem with that?  And you can go somewhere else.  Is there anyone else you could go?  You can go somewhere else.

Start time: 1949.58
End time: 1981.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The problem with it is, first of all, it's not what Google itself says it's supposed to be doing.  So if you've got a problem with with with anything and you love Google, you really ought to ask why Google is not doing what Google says it's supposed to be doing, which is providing the best search results from across the web.  Best best could depend on what you mean by best.  I guess I do a search for Facebook.  Oh, interesting.  Do a search on Google for Facebook and that will, you know, let's see what we get here.  Facebook fanboys out there can can go out as they want.

Transcript:  What are they recommending over there on the right hand side of the page?  Mark Zuckerberg on Google Plus.  Hey, follow Mark Zuckerberg on Google Plus.  Bear in mind, this is some of the most valuable real estate from search results that Google has.  Go ahead and click on Mark Zuckerberg and show me what Google is recommending out of all the possible things about Mark Zuckerberg that it could put up there.  An empty page on Google Plus.  Is it possible that there is any place else that Mark Zuckerberg is active socially where he ships a little bit more than nothing?  And the answer is, of course, Facebook.  That's what's wrong with this.  That is not relevant.  And Google's job as a search engine is to be relevant.  So, you know, I've defended Google time and time again.

Transcript:  The FTC does not say ads show up on the right hand side of the page.  That's not a definition.  No, no, they need to put ad.  They need to be possibly, you know, possibly they need to put out there.  And if they did put an ad out there, this would be less of an argument.  Because that's what it is.  Even without the arguments over what the FTC requires, it's not the right user experience.  It is not a search engine.  You expect Google, the leader in search engines, to have provided.  And it does not matter whether or not Facebook does it or Twitter does it or Bing does it.  It's Google doing it.  And Google should be doing what Google is supposed to be doing best.  Hey, but if the world has changed now and Google has decided maybe that's part of the answer that screw it.  Everybody else is doing it.  We're in too.  Then there we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It probably is some rogue employees,  but that probably doesn't let them off the hook.  Right.  You know, because at some point,  how often or, you know, how...  Remember, the year started out with...  This has not been a good month for Google.  The month started out with Google having to penalize  its official Chrome page,  because it was involved in a link-buying campaign.  Right.  They were going to do a promotion for Chrome.  They went out there.  They had a third-party firm that they worked with,  who in turn engaged another third-party term,  who in turn got a bunch of mummy-woggers  to start linking over to this post,  and they decided that technically that was sponsored posts  that weren't disclosed,  therefore they had to penalize their own Chrome page.  That was rogue employee, rogue situation number one.  Now we're at, like, rogue situation number two.  Do I think...  No, I don't think people at Google Mountain View  ever would have thought, you know what we should do?  This is a great idea.  Let's go on and go through another rival business database,  call them up, tell the customers  that we're from Google, we're working with the other company,  and they should come over to our new system.  I think they would be mortified and horrified  that that happened.  And yet it did.  And it's going to fall right down on them,  and it's going to be used by their critics to say,  aha, see, this is just another sign of Google's  institutional activities to try to wipe out everything  until they own the entire interwebs.

Transcript:  I think the whole company, the way I see Google,  is just growing so fast,  and it's actually losing a grip on what it's all about.  And I think that is a bigger problem  they need to confront with.  These small things which are happening, you know,  first two weeks, and we've had three big issues on Google,  that's a sign of a company which is kind of coming apart,  and it doesn't have full control over where it's going.  I think that whenever I see Google,  I see Google going further and further away  from its own core mission.  And I think when companies do that,  they do unnatural things,  and unnatural things are things like, you know,  scraping somebody's data or, you know,  buying link campaigns.  So basically, this is the processes are not there.  The company just doesn't have the processes  to see and, you know, expand its thought process  and its culture into newcomers and new employees.  I think that's a bigger issue for Google.  You know, we can look at things in, like, one small isolation  and say, okay, this is a problem, this is a problem,  but it has been going on for a very long time.  I don't know. What do you think, Danny?

Transcript:  I agree.  I think that they have been running very, very hard,  and especially over this past year,  where Larry Page has, you know, taken over as CEO,  and we had this declaration that,  hey, you know, everything's got to be social.  And as John Battelle reminded yesterday,  if you start linking everything to social  and that's being tied to your paycheck,  this might be part of the consequence of it.  You know...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and, you know, it's like that type of thing,  plus that they are so big that you want them to have  an operational pause at this point, you know,  which is something they actually did a few years ago.  They had so many products, they said,  we're putting everything on hold until we kind of  get our heads figured out and see where we're going to be going.  And, yeah, I agree with them.  I feel like that they may be in that situation  where there's just too many different moving parts,  too many different things going on,  too many things that perhaps they're chasing  rather than leading on, right?  We've got to get this, we've got to solve that,  and especially the social aspect.  It just feels like it's being shoved at you so much  when you don't necessarily want  or didn't ask for Google Plus to be in your search results  or Google Plus to be in your reader thing  or Google Plus to be over here or there.

We are going to get to, actually, I guess we'll do CES next,  because I want to talk about CES, but then there's also Wednesday is SOPA Day.  And the White House announced that, well, we would never sign a bill like this.  Of course, they've said before we will never sign a bill like this.  It was called the National Defense Authorization Act,  a bill that would essentially eliminate habeas corpus for military prisoners.  And they did sign it.  So we don't know what's going on, but we will talk about that in just a little bit.  Also want to congratulate our friend Tom Merritt and Ayaz Akhtar  and Sarah Lane and Jason Howell on our Tech News Today team.

Actually, we don't have a week ahead.  Never mind.  Pretend I said nothing.  That was your week ahead.  That was the week ahead.  Let's take a break.  We will cover CES.  Everybody here, except for Ohm Malik was there.  And Ohm is glad.  Let me tell you.  Let me tell you.  Ohm didn't miss a thing.  You said it.  I called it one year, the craptastic electronics show.  There is far more junk than there is good stuff.  But we found the good stuff.  And we'll tell you what it was in a bit.  Before we do that, let me tell you about the good stuff in web hosting.  You notice that site that we were on the inside twit.tv site.  That's inside.twit.tv.  That's our company blog.  That's a Squarespace blog.  I defy you right now.  Everybody who's watching this show, all whatever, the four or five thousand of you, go to that site and bring it down.  Go ahead.  Try it.  You can't.  We've tried it before.  And that's because it's a Squarespace site.  I can bring any site in the world down.  I felt really bad.  We had a guy, a startup called War Lies.  It was a 3D chat avatar.  It really looked cool.  We got the guy on our CES coverage and the site went 503 immediately.  It just bombed.  And I felt bad.  In fact, I got an email from him apologizing to all the people who tried to sign up during that.  And we're OK now.  Come back.  But I mean, that was his big chance.  And it bombed.  See if he'd been on Squarespace.  No problem.  Squarespace is the secret behind exceptional websites.  It's web hosting plus the best content management software out there to give your site just a great look, a great feel and make it responsive.  If you go to Squarespace.com, they have the best try it free policy ever.  You click this green button.  You don't need a credit card.  You don't need any information.  You just need the name of your site, a password for your site and an email address for your site.  And you've got that site with all the features, no watermarking.  This is a beta.  Nothing.  You got all the features for two weeks.  This is a great idea for trying it out.  You know what Alex Lindsay does?  I've mentioned this before.  When he goes to a restaurant or a business that they don't have their own website, he get at during the meal, he'll go on in my favorite restaurant dot com and create a site for them.  And then he'll give it to them.  He'll give them the keys.  He said, Look, I set this up.  He'll create it all here.  Have it.  Try it for two weeks.  He's turning people on.  He's making people get websites.  And that's one great use.  By the way, if you already have a site, you can import all of your text, all of your comments, all of your SEO, all of your pictures from movable type WordPress, type pad or blogger, APIs and export.  You are never trapped.  They have fantastic apps for iPhone and Android phones and tablets that let you post, check statistics, moderate comments, templates that look good.  Gorgeous photo galleries, Twitter, Flickr, Facebook integration and more.  Take a look at the examples.  Give it a free try.  And if you decide to buy, we get you 30% off for the first three months.  How about that with the offer code twit zero one twi t zero and one 30% off.  That's only when you buy those.  So don't even worry about that for right now.  Just give it a try.  Squarespace is secret behind exceptional websites.  Let's just try it.  Let me just try.  Let me go.  This is we'll do a live test to see if it worked inside dot twit dot TV.  Were you able to bring it down?  Ladies and gentlemen, let's see.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Did you bring it down?  It's just our Internet.  It's my Internet.  It's really slow.  There we go.  No, it's not down.  It's fine.  Love it.  Love it.  Thank you.  Squarespace.  We love you.  Squarespace dot com.  Use the offer code twit zero one.

I already do.  Let me ask.  Let me start with Tim Stevens.  You know, one of the things that we go when we go to CES now, there's one hundred fifty  thousand people.  There's thirty one hundred booths this year.  There's six hundred six thousand in the press corps.  It's an overwhelming.  I don't know how many football fields, hundreds of football fields worth of stuff.  But one of the show ever is huge.  One of the things we always try to do is create a narrative around that.  Like, what was the story of CES?  Almost impossible.  What was the story of CES?  Tim Stevens of Engadget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think this year the story was the lack of lack of a story.  It wasn't a big one.  It could be one.  Yeah.  It seemed like slow progression in lots of logical areas.  We got LTE smartphones, which of course were expected, but we saw, you know, LTE is now  almost a common feature across all carriers and manufacturers.  So if anything, that's a story that LTE is now effectively what you're going to expect  to see on all carriers.  So that's that's something we said bigger screens, of course, and better processors  and things like that as well.  On the smartphone front, same sort of progress on the tablet front, high resolution displays  on the new Transformer Prime, for example, a 1080p display on the  That's a cool product.

Transcript:  So, yeah, it's got great power.  And we've seen the Tever 3 chipset offering not only great power, but also great battery  life.  Like you mentioned in my test on the current Transformer Prime, I got 16 hours with the  keyboard dock.  So they're saying we might even get a little bit better with this new model, which is which  is pretty interesting.  So that to me is great to see.  We also spoke with Texas Instruments, who showed us their new TILOMAP processor, which  isn't going to be hitting devices until sometime later this year.  But it was the same basic theme that we're going to be seeing much better performance  and also much better battery life out of their new chipset, which is fantastic news, because  in my opinion, I think we're at a point now where gadgets are pretty quick, but battery  life is still atrocious on the majority of Android tablets and Android phones and even  phones on other platforms as well.  So I'm really hoping to see a big battery life improvement.  I think that's something we'll see going into the next CES.  Right now, we're not really seeing any big advancements, but it seems like the foundation  is being put in place to allow that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it was a discussion on me.  Windows 8 was a big story in the Microsoft keynote the night before the show properly kicked off.  And they spent a lot of time demoing Windows 8, but ultimately they didn't really show us anything new or exciting.  Nothing new.  They didn't show me anything that really entailed bringing the platform together, which we talked a bit about at CES.  I didn't really see that much interaction between Windows Phone and Windows 8 or between the Xbox 360 and Windows 8,  which is what I really wanted to see.

They did have the Tweet Choir, however, which I think is really every keynote from now on should have the Tweet Choir.  This was the Las Vegas Mass Choir.

Transcript:  Now, I think there was a big announcement at this, which was the Lumia 900, Nokia's phone designed for the US market.  They have a similar phone in the European market with a smaller screen, no front-facing camera.  This is a sweet phone and this may be the phone that Microsoft needs to get Windows Phone 7.5 off the map, on the map.

Transcript:  And it could be the phone that Nokia needs to make it back to re-emerge here in the United States.  Nobody really knows who Nokia is when you talk to general consumers.  They might have had a Nokia phone back in the late 90s.  But yeah, this is definitely a fantastic phone.  It's the new 900, it's got great performance in theory, it's still single core, but it should be pretty quick and pretty smooth.  It should have a great camera of course, as we expect, and a big beautiful screen.  That is unfortunately though still WVGA.

Start time: 3690.56
End time: 3732.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is an OLED display, so the quality is going to be very good in terms of saturation and brightness.  The resolution though, that's still part of the package when you get Windows Phone right now.  You still get a WVGA display across the board.  I think that's something that Microsoft will be working on through the year, increasing resolution and also moving from single core to dual core processors.  Those are two things that are part of the package of Windows Phone right now.  But at least we are now seeing LTE devices.  This was one of the first of course, we did see a few Windows Phone devices with LTE.  So going forward, at least that platform will now be able to keep up on data speeds.  But now it needs the processors and the resolution to really be able to keep up with the rest of the competition that we saw from HTC, from Samsung, and from everybody else.

Transcript:  We had AT&T LTE dongles and I also had a Verizon LTE dongle.  Before the show began, we were seeing about 20 megabits down on AT&T and about 8 megabits up.  Once things got going of course it slowed down a bit.  It was down to about 8 down and 2 or 3 up, which is pretty fantastic given the number of people and the number of devices there.  But of course, AT&T just really flipped the switch on LTE in Vegas a couple of weeks ago.  So that's not really to be surprised. I don't think it was saturated, which is exactly why we wanted to be on it because we knew that there wouldn't be too many other people on it.  Verizon we saw typically 10 to 15 megabits down and again 2 or 3 up.  So pretty comparable speeds.

Transcript:  I actually did find a theme of the show of sorts, which is remember years ago both Gates and Jobs talked about the PC or the Mac as the hub of your digital life.  Now it's the truck, not the hub.  It struck me that at this show what people were saying is the mobile phone as the hub of our physical life.  And by that I mean Craftsman garage door opener that you open with or you check your mobile phone.  LG and all of their smart appliances, right?  The washing machine sends a message to your mobile phone telling you that it's time to put the clothes in the dryer.  The refrigerator tells you that your yogurt is going bad.  All on the mobile phone.  I saw so many devices slog.  You open the lock with your mobile phone.  And it just seemed to me, and this by the way is the subject of my column in tomorrow's San Jose Mercury News.  It'll be on Larry's World in the morning about how the mobile phone really has become the core of our physical of our real world lives.

Transcript:  Absolutely.  We even saw quite a bit of automotive technology built around the smartphone.  Mercedes Embrace, for example, you can unlock your car from your smartphone.  OnStar has an app as well that you can do that.  We saw applications where instead of having some cars, you can have one key for yourself and maybe one key for your wife.  And based on what key comes to the car, the seat will adjust itself.  Well, now there are systems like that, that tie into your smartphone.  So you don't even need to worry about the key.  It's depending on what smartphone comes to the car.  The car will adjust your radio presets, your seating position and get the car ready for yourself.  And I think with things like Google Wallet as well, more and more of our identity is moving to our devices, which to me is good because I'm kind of sick of carrying around a wallet.  I'm kind of sick of carrying around keys.  Right.  If I could walk up to my front door and put my phone up to the doorbell and have the door open or walk up to my car with my phone in my pocket and have the car unlock and lights turn on,  that to me sounds ideal so long as of course I don't lose my cell phone.

Transcript:  We were at a dinner.  Veronica was there.  Patrick Norton, Molly Wood, Becky Worley, Walt Mossberg and David Pogue.  A bunch of tech journalists were at a dinner with Alan Malawi that night and Mossberg kind of hijacked the whole thing.  What a surprise.  And basically, challenge was really challenging Alan about this issue.  He said, now I want to hear what you guys say.  He said that there is a grassroots movement in every city of the nation to get legislation against distracted driving.  That this has become a huge hot button for people.  And he said, what are you going to do?  What is Ford going to do when it's made illegal to make a phone call on your car, let alone Facebook?  You can't even use Bluetooth phones.

Transcript:  What are you going to do?  Yeah, this is definitely something that's becoming a bigger and bigger issue.  Do you hear this, Gramps?  Well, Tim, I mean, is this, was that true?  Yeah, absolutely.  The NHTSA is also looking at defining.  NTSB said that all use of any phone.  Thank you, NTSB.  Not the NHTSA.  Yes.  So it's definitely becoming a bigger issue.  And a lot of these things that we saw at the show would be very distracting.  That concept Mercedes dash I was talking about would show you if your friend happened to be running by while you're driving, it would pop up their profile information on the windscreen.  It would project on the windscreen, which is pretty cool.  And so I asked Mercedes, of course, what does this mean for distracted driving?  Aren't you going to be looking at that and run over somebody else?  And their answer was, well, this is the dash of five to 10 years of the future.  By then, the cars will be driving themselves anyway, so you can do whatever you want to.  But of course, we're looking at the next two or three years, which is going to be, I don't think we'll be seeing self-driving cars on the road in any number.  No, I asked Alan about that.

And he said, you don't see pilots.  You know, he said these planes can take off and land by themselves.  But you don't see pilots doing that.  He says there needs to be a human at the wheel.  We will give them lots of information.  We will support them.  We will tell them if they're drifting out of the lane.  We'll tell them if they're running too close to the car ahead.  We can do all of that.  In fact, they have now backup sensors.  You know, I have a backup camera, but they have sensors that look left and right to tell you if there's an oncoming car, which is great, because I've actually got hit by backing out of a slot.  So but he says you've got to have a human at the wheel.  And I do wonder somebody else asked him, when we get our flying cars?  And he said, never.  He said, never.  Those are cloud vehicles.

And they claim, of course, that they've got great technology to make it easier.  Voice controls are big on voice controls.  And I have to say, voice controls are nice.  By the way, I got pulled over in Nevada for talking to Siri on my cell phone.  I picked up my phone.  Yes, because you held your phone.  I had my phone.  And I said, Siri.  And I was going to Bluetooth.  I had everything right.  But I was told, never touch your phone.  Same in California.  You may not touch that phone.  So now I have my phone.  You see the Velcro.  I have my phone Velcro to the dash, right?  Right.  So that's legal.  Now it's the dash.  No, I can legally, as long as it's Velcro to the dash, I can legally touch it.  I can stare at it.  But if I take it like this and I say, Siri, find me the brick house.

Transcript:  So the thing, you know, I was watching all the feeds and reading all the news about CES.  And most of this conversation you guys are having and most of the devices I saw, none of them answered this one question.  What problem are they trying to solve?  I mean, it's like, how is it?  Why is Facebook status update from a friend important while I'm driving?  First of all, I don't drive, so I wouldn't even know how they're all hoping.  It's not, Om.

And I think that was a big, big, you know, my takeaway from from this CES was just that.

Start time: 4239.74
End time: 4276.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that a lot of CES is trying to create demand.  It's trying to invent demand.  It's not an answer to a problem or an existing issue.  It's it's trying to create new demand.  And, you know, remember Steve Jobs quoting Henry Ford, who said if I'd asked my customers what they wanted, they would have said, you know, what do you say?  Faster horse.  Faster horses.  You can't necessarily in this industry ask customers what they want.  You kind of have to point them in a direction and create a demand for something.  Did people say we needed Siri before Siri existed?  People say we needed an iPhone before an iPhone existed?  I don't know.  Maybe they did.

Two or three days later, I go to do another load of laundry and find that the first load is still sitting there.  But now it's all musty, of course, because it's been sitting in the washer for a couple of days.  But whether or not this is solving problems, no, it's not.  But all cars now are pretty good.  I mean, it doesn't really matter what kind of car you buy.  It's going to be pretty reliable.  It's going to be reasonably good to drive.  It's going to be reasonably safe.  So auto manufacturers are really looking for ways to stand out.  And technology is a great way for them to do that, whether it's Facebook updates or whether it's the MyFord SmartLink app integration.  Excuse me.  AppLink.  You are tired.

I mean, that's the kind of thing that that to, you know, an 18 to 24 year old buyer is going to make their ears perk up.  And if somebody a Chevy or somebody a Hyundai doesn't have that kind of thing, that might make them buy the Focus instead of a KIA.  Ford did say that.

Start time: 4352.42
End time: 4436.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I agree that I agree with that, because what it is doing is it's replacing existing user behavior of listening to radio.  With a new new kind of listening to music, right, which is not very different than what we've done in a car.  And from just using a new way of doing things.  However, a lot of these things, which these people have been experimenting with, are not even clear.  Like, why?  Like, why do we need this?  And, you know, actually, it's a very vendor centric approach to do introducing features and technology and not like people centric approach to introduce music.  Yes, you know, Steve Jobs, this is not a Steve Jobs like comparison.  I'm thinking more like these guys are introducing incremental things.  We don't really make a lot of sense over, you know, like when it comes to usage.  And I think that's what I was having an issue with, like Pandora or something like Pandora or Spotify on your dashboard connected via whether it's LTE or Wi-Fi or whatever makes perfect sense.  Because that's how we listen to music now on our on our computer.  So it just is a behavior which translates easily to to the web to to the car environment.  And we don't have to deal with, you know, like, you know, fiddling with too many buttons on Pandora, for example.  Now, I agree with you.

Transcript:  And I think that's a lot of what you see at CES is people throwing stuff against the wall to see what sticks.  They're trying to create demand.  And you're right. Fundamentally, that is a flawed way to invent something.  You know, you want to find a problem that needs solving.  But this is a big show. There's 3100 booths.  It's going to be some crap.  In fact, somebody in the chat room is asking us for our worst of CES.  And maybe maybe if you guys could do some thinking, I'll think of some of the worst things that we saw.  At least here is a big story that you guys came up with at Giga Home.  At Giga Home, actually, you're Kevin Fitcher pointed this out.  Verizon told CNET that Verizon will no longer accept any smart device that doesn't support its LTE network.  And Kevin pointed out, hey, that means the iPhone 5 is going to be LTE.  Does that make sense?  Yeah, that would be nice.  It sure would. It sure would.  Especially if it's LTE on AT&T, which I think is, we agree, the fastest out there right now.  Maybe because it's underused.  I tell you what, I couldn't use 3G on my iPhone at all.  Oh, that's terrible.

But the fact is that I can listen to CBS online.  I can listen to you in my car, which means you are now a direct competitor to CBS Radio.  That's right.  Well, I don't know if I like that, Leo.  But the bottom line is that content providers have got to think of themselves as content providers and stop thinking themselves as broadcasters.  That's right.  And that's true.

But I think the point is that they're able now to make these displays in quantity,  which I think they've never been able to do.  We asked them about display life,  because one of the issues of OLED displays has been in the past,  that the blue dye had a very short lifespan.  They claim to have fixed it and have 30,000 hours,  which is about half what plasma does,  but it's still 10 years of eight hours a day viewing.  It's plenty of life.

Definitely, I would say an LCD.  I mean, there's a selection of plasmas that are still available,  and they do give kind of the look of an OLED  with very deep, rich blacks and good contrast,  but they're heavier, they use a lot more power,  they give off a lot more heat.  If these OLEDs come out, I think plasmas are dead.  Yeah, plasmas are absolutely dead,  because OLEDs will do everything that a plasma does better  with lower power consumption,  and hopefully they won't have the lifespan  or burn-in problems down the road a little bit too.  Of course, the cost is going to be huge.  So I would say right now go with an EdgeLED LED display.  It will give you close to the thinness of an OLED display.  Oh, yeah, they're gorgeous.  It's considerably cheaper.

You know, the thickness issue,  it's very cool to have a thin TV,  but the reality is it's up against the wall.  Unless you live in a really tiny, tiny apartment,  that extra inch or two is not going to make a difference in your life.  Exactly. That's what Morris is saying in the chat room.

Transcript:  Who cares how thin they are, you know?  But it's like anything else.  The thinner and richer, the better.  I have to say, the top-of-the-line TVs right now are those sharp, elite TV sets,  but they're the same price as the OLED will be in the fall.  They're $6,000 to $8,000.  I think that we are going to see a revolution.  If you could hold off, I would hold off.  Now, the other thing that's revolutionary is these in-TV apps,  the speech interfaces.  Samsung has a built-in camera that you can do connect-style gesturing to or talk to.  This is early days, and I bet you these things suck for the first one or two years,  but we're clearly moving into that world of new TV interfaces.  TV has a computer. These are dual-core processors.

Lenovo announced a TV with ice cream sandwich, not Google TV, but just ice cream sandwich.  In China only.  China only? Okay.  Yes, for Edward in April.  But I do think that... there's the facial recognition, by the way.  I do think that this is a revolution in television, and it's very good.  I like it because it's very good for people like me who are internet-only broadcasters.  Every TV that comes out from now on will have an internet connection,  and will have apps, and will have the ability to put shows like Twitter on a parody with everything else.

The people like the television networks, cable companies like Comcast.  Comcast, all of a sudden, is going to be selling bits at wholesale.  Instead of these premium-priced retail bits where they sell a whole channel, I think we're going to see a big shift.  And it's going to... we've been saying this for how many years?

Transcript:  And you know, Leo, when you were doing tech TV, I mean, that was like a hundred million dollar project, right?  Right here.  Yeah.  And that was dying because the distribution was controlled by essentially what was Hollywood.  That's right.  And look at you now.  And like, you know, you probably have, you know, five times the audience and a hundred times the engagement compared to that time.  You know, I was there with you at that time.  Right.  So, you know, this thing is, you know, I probably was one of the few people who actually paid for it.  Thank you.  Thank you.  So it is very different now.  And I think there is going to be more smaller success stories like yourself as this distribution gets more democratic.  I think that's the big shift.  We saw the production and distribution get democratized in music and we've seen a huge jump in creation of music and new artists and people just coming out of nowhere.  And I think we're going to see similar shift in video as well.  And it's taken a lot longer because it's just more expensive kind of, you know, operation.  I mean, yours is not an easy operation to bootstrap.

Transcript:  And this is why I'm a little touchy about Google and YouTube, because it's almost as if the, you know, the company that owns the guide on your cable channel,  if they produced all the content and they made sure that all their content were, you know, somehow highlighted on their cable guide, that would be a huge advantage.  And in my opinion, that's exactly what's happening.  Google is the cable guide to the Internet.  It's the guide to the Internet.  But they're producing content and they're highlighting it.  That puts me at a disadvantage, even though in theory we should be equals, you know, on the search anyway.  So I wish Google, in fact, my goal for 2012 is to have Google spin off YouTube.  It's obviously profitable.  Spin it off into a separate standalone company and avoid all of this entanglement that it's getting into.  I think that that's a pipe dream, however, obviously Google loves the entanglement it's getting into.

And when you do a search, it does search through my stuff as well as their stuff, etc., etc., etc.  We'll take a break.  Come back with more.  Microsoft pulled out a CES.  It's this last year, Steve Ballmer's last keynote.  The space, I was told by the CEA, the floor space for Microsoft's booth sold in 45 minutes.  We don't know who to, but the rumor was Dish Network.  This is kind of near where Microsoft is, but not as not as prime a real estate.  I just hope they keep that really soft carpet.  Doesn't Microsoft? I love the soft carpet.

But first, how do you like that for a tease?  But first, let's talk about backing your stuff up with carbonite.com.  Their slogan, this is a new slogan.  I used to say you got to back it up to get it back.  Their new slogan is backup, move forward.  I think that sounds a little confusing.  That should be Ford's slogan. Backup, move forward.

Five bucks a month. Carbonite.com.  We thank them so much for their support of the TWIT program.  Apple, the iPhone 4S. So this is what happened in China.  There are five stores in Apple stores in China.  They sell some absurd percentage of all Apple gears.  Something like 16% of all Apple gears sold by five stores in China.  They had the iPhone 4S.  And what's amazing is this thing must cost a significant amount of money compared to the average income in China.  I don't know what it is, but I can only imagine.  But I guess the plutocrats in China, of which there is a growing middle and upper class,  were hiring workers from the country to come and get in line at the Apple store to get them their iPhone.  They'd pay these guys like a day's wage, which is peanuts, to get in line.  But 15, I think it was 15 RMB.  And when the Apple stores didn't open on time, the crowds got rowdy.  Police ordered the stores not be opened.  So this is the mistake.  The Apple guy comes out and says, we're going to cancel the launch of the 4S.  At this point, the people who have been waiting all night, they're not going to get paid their 15 RMB.  They started, I guess they brought eggs with them.  You have to eat.

It's very interesting.  There must be...  Do you have any insight on this as our token representative of the third world?  Did you really say that?  I did.  I thought about it and the censor just...

I was in Paris with you, do you remember, for Le Vep, and I went into a store trying to buy something, and they had two representatives who spoke perfect Mandarin and perfect Hindi to sell to these people.  So that kind of tells you there is a lot of money in those places.  Absolutely.  I think China is going to be the largest economy in a few years.  And so we cannot really say they are the third world.  Yes, they have a huge income disparity, but so do we in the United States.  Oh, yeah.  I think so there is...  It says a lot about Apple though, a product made in China and sold in China at a massive premium.  That says everything about a company and a brand.  You know, I think a lot of people don't quite give them credit for that.  But I do think this is going...  You know, iPhone 4S or iPhone or Apple products, they have an aspirational quality both in China and India, in Brazil and Russia.  And just like, you know, the Gucci's of the world have and Mercedes and BMWs have an aspirational value.  So I think that's why you're seeing a lot of people line up and, you know, pay.  And I think the average salaries in China are going up.  I mean, if you go to Shanghai, you know, it does definitely feel like a very expensive city.  Oh, Beijing too.

Start time: 5714.97
End time: 5742.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, at least from where I come from, you know, status symbols matter a whole lot.  At least in India, there is a huge pull of these famous global brands.  I think China is essentially the same.  There is a huge amount of value accorded to these brands.  But, you know, it is.  The official color there is red, so that should explain it.

And I don't know if you guys saw this.  It's from TNL.net.  And this is a little bit telling.  What they did is they did a survey of what of the top 100 movies in 2011,  which of them are on Netflix, which of the streaming,  which of them are on Netflix streaming, by the way,  which of them are on Amazon, which are on iTunes,  and which of them are on Voodoo, and which are available on DVD.  And they broke it all down.  And when you get to the stats, it's actually a little chilling.  If I were on Netflix, I'd worry.  Of the top 10 movies, 0 are on Netflix, 7 on Amazon, iTunes, Voodoo, and DVD.  Of the top 25, 0 are on Netflix, 16 Amazon, iTunes, Voodoo, 19 DVD.  Of the top 54 on Netflix, of the top 100, only 5 are available on Netflix streaming,  almost half available on iTunes, Amazon, and Voodoo, and 74 out of the top 100 on DVD.  Now, I don't think that's Netflix's fault.  I don't think Netflix is failing to make the deals.  I think the movie industry is trying to squeeze them to death.

It's where you go to see the backlist, to see the movies that were great 10 years ago  or 50 years ago in some cases.  I watch old classics on Netflix, and if you were to ask Reed Hastings, the CEO of Netflix,  he would be the first to admit that it is just a choice.  But Netflix is where it's late at night, I'm tired, I don't feel like thinking.  I go in there and I pick a movie, much like I used to do on HBO and Showtime.

Transcript:  I'm surprised that Netflix hasn't launched some sort of a premium streaming tier  where you can do a pay-on-demand streaming for these newer movies  that would then be additional to the standard all-you-can-eat streaming package that they already have.  Because that's what we're really looking at here.  Even though those seven top tens on Amazon, you can't pay a flat fee and view them,  you have to rent them. The same thing with iTunes, that kind of thing.  So it's a different pricing structure and a different sort of service  that I'm very surprised Netflix hasn't jumped into yet,  and maybe that's something that we'll see in the year ahead.

I saw some of these say, and I think this is interesting, that Netflix streaming has really given people,  you know, behavior is very interesting.  TiVo never gained ground, but it totally transformed how we watch TV from being appointment television.  We all had to watch Ed Sullivan on Sunday night.  The VCR began that shift, but it wasn't until DVRs that we really accepted the idea that we did not have to watch a show when it was on.  We watch it whenever we want. On-demand has furthered that.  And so our habits get changed by these technologies.  Somebody was saying that Netflix streaming is really turning us into channel surfers with movies.  You know, if you buy a DVD or lease or rent a DVD and you put it in, you're going to watch it.  Because you don't have another one, for one thing.  Even if it's crappy, you spend a lot of money for it.  You pay for it.  But Netflix, I don't mind watching five minutes of movie going, this is crap.  Going to the next one, this is crap.

Transcript:  Actually, Ohm wrote an interesting article, which I want to talk about the surprise of the week.  And then we'll get your worst of CES picks as we continue.  But first, a word from FreshBooks dot com.  I start you know, if you're in business for yourself, there's one thing that you hate.  Invoicing.  I hated it so much that I didn't do it.  The problem with not invoicing is then you don't get paid.  So it's a vicious cycle.  You don't you want to break this.  I would sometimes I would invoice six months late and say, what is this?  We're not going to.  You want what?  So this is the thing.  Then 2004 Amber MacArthur told me about this company because they're based in Toronto.  FreshBooks and it changed everything with FreshBooks.  I uploaded my my logo.  I was able to create invoices online.  They are emailed to your clients in the PDF form.  There's a button on the email that says pay now.  And because of that, you know, it turns out your clients don't it's not that they don't want to pay you.  It's that they're just like you.  It's a pain in the butt.  So if you make it easy for them, they pay.  You can even set up automatic invoicing and paying that just happens.  If you do if you keep track of your time sheets, it'll actually take the money.  It'll actually take they have apps for that on the phone or on your desktop and it'll import those hours automatically, which makes it much easier to invoice.  They will send out paper invoices for an additional fee.  That's cool.  It's free, though, for your first three clients.  Three and a half million people now since I found FreshBooks in 2004.  Since then, three and a half million users at FreshBooks.com.  I want you to go there.  There's no offer code because it's free for the first three no matter what.  But do say you heard it on Twitter.  If they ask, I don't know if they're going to ask, but if they do, it's just fantastic.  If you're a small business, if you're in business for yourself, the last thing you want to do is invoicing.  Even if you have a bookkeeper, I know many bookkeepers who use this is so much easier.  FreshBooks.com.  FreshBooks.com.  And yes, they will be glad to get you signed up.  And if you look at the pricing, it's such a good deal.  Free for the first three.  And then it's very affordable for additional clients.  Try it.  Setup only takes a minute.  You don't need a credit card, just a company name and email.  And you get your FreshBooks page started and you're going.  FreshBooks.com.  Oh, Malik wrote a surprising post this week.  You know what's bigger than Google Plus?  MySpace.  It's not dead yet.  But it is dead, isn't it? Isn't it home?  Oh, yeah. It's completely dead.

Transcript:  Now that we moved on to bigger things.  But.  Apparently people still care about my space.  I think what I, I do think there is a lot of music.  Acts, which have.  MySpace pages and people who follow.  MySpace.  And I'm sure that's something that's going to be a lot of people.  I think that's what is keeping the site going.  Now, the interesting part is that the average time spent is just negligible.  Compared to Facebook and.  And Tumblr and some of the others, even, even Twitter.  And so it's not really doing that well from that perspective.  So it is people using it as like, you know,  Geo cities didn't go away for a very long time.  I think that's what we're seeing in this one.  Yeah.  And I hope you know.  You know, as a surprise on this picture on this chart is Pinterest.

Start time: 6501.56

And then you have to do it on Facebook and Twitter.  And then you have to do it on Facebook and Twitter.  It's a new, new thing.  It's not even public yet.

Start time: 6548.90
End time: 6579.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, you know, the way to think about Pinterest is this is like, you know, how people go window shopping in the real world.  This is window shopping in the online world.  That's how I see it.  Like a lot of it is aspirational.  People want to buy these things.  But it's also a very interesting tool to kind of create, you know, pins or, you know, create collections of things you like.  You know, a lot of people I know who are using it are just completely addicted to it.  Really?  Oh, that's interesting.  It just didn't grab me at all.  It's very addictive.  Yeah.

Start time: 6580.56

Start time: 6583.97
End time: 6591.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Start time: 6592.64
End time: 6638.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is very Martha Stewarty.  Pretty photographs.  Yeah.  Well, it's very photo focused.  One thing I don't like is they call people who use Pinterest pinners.  You know that that is slang for a very, very thin joint, right?  Really?  Marijuana cigarette, right?  Now you tell me.  But I could see the finance.  I could see the the business model here because you can do things like search for gifts from 50 to 100 dollars.  And people apparently have pinned these things.  And now I'm seeing all these are all gifts in that price range.  So if I guess if I'm a husband who has been thrown out of the house, I could just buy this spotlight bracelet for ninety five dollars and my life would change.

Start time: 6639.92

Start time: 6654.08
End time: 6671.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's stunning to see that those numbers on that com score chart because it's not even public.  And it's an invite.  You have to request an invite.  And it's already like one, two, three, four, five, seven, right after Google Plus with eighty eight average minutes per visitor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I wrote about them a little while ago, maybe earlier this week or last week.  I can't remember.  But it was essentially talking about what's going on.  And, you know, as I said earlier that we are beginning to mimic a lot of offline behavior online and Pinterest is just that.  I my argument about Pinterest was that, you know, when when I was younger, all my friends were lady friends and they would create like collages.  And, you know, from from the things they would rip out of work and cosmopolitan all those kind of.  So it's a lady thing.  Well, it's very popular with the ladies, even the guys use it, but it's really popular with the ladies.  Interesting.  And it's like driving commerce now.  It's like it's, you know, and it's only going to get bigger.  Just wait and see.

End time: 6847.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's totally integrated in when I play a Spotify track.  All my friends know now they can listen at the same time.  I mean, it's just it's and then you look at Apple's Ping, which is.  Which is like, it's like, how could you go so wrong?  And you see why Facebook, in fact, disconnected from paying Giants one.  All right.  Do you like that? Yeah, I do like that because what I'm going for is a Super Bowl where brother meets brother like the Civil War.  Right. And the and so that's what we're what are you laughing at?  That's what we're going for.  You know, it also means it also means the Niners.  Hey, Lisa, congratulations.  The Niners play at home next week.
