A grand party here going on in studio with us, Alex Lindsay from the Pixelcore.  Hello, hello.  He's always in studio.  He kind of lives under the desk.  It's a great thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, it's actually pretty comfortable after you get used to the squishiness.  You know, you just have to be in the fetal position all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Also here, and he was just telling me he hasn't been on in like eight months.  I feel I'm so sorry, David, David Prager.  It's great to have you.  I'm very thrilled to be back.  Revision three executive.  Executive.  It's what it said in the paper.  I had to laugh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Also here, Buana McCall from Buana.org.  Hey, Buana.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hey, Leo.  How you doing, man?  Coming from his beautiful studio.  You stream on Ustream, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Ustream.TV.  Although I am looking at other alternatives.  I am looking around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  I was looking at Stickam.  I was trying Justin.TV the other day.  They had some new high def stuff.  So I'm just exploring all avenues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know what we decided to do, and I'm kind of excited about this.  We decided not to be exclusive anymore.  We were exclusive with Stickam.  And the problem with that is a single point of failure, right?  Stickam goes.  So we talked to them.  We said, hey, do you mind if we so we're going to be on Ustream, we're going to be on Stickam  and we're going to be on Bit Gravity.  So there'll be three ways to watch.  And you get to pick which one you like best.  There'll be chat rooms with each.  There's David.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We lost Mr. Prager.  We're going to talk to him in a second because he got a home invasion.  He was the home invasion.  He was home invaded.  And I got to talk to him about that.  Also with us, John C. Dvorak from his mountain lair, Skullcrusher Mountain up in Port Angeles,  Washington.  Hello, John.  Hello.  And a newbie.  We're really glad to have Peter Rojas with us.  The legendary Peter Rojas.  Thanks for having me.  That's so nice to have you.  Founder of Engadget and now co-host of the GDGT podcast with Ryan Block and soon to launch  a GDGT community.  Can I call it Gadget or GDGT?  GDGT.  You can call it Gadget if you want.  It's actually probably better to say GDGT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a little more distinctive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  And that phone call in the background, that's David L. Prager.  Maybe he got a home invasion.  Maybe somebody broke in.  That was going to be our top story, but we'll get to some other stories.  I think one story very interesting this week, and I'm not sure if I put it in the rundown,  George Stephanopoulos is going to interview former presidential candidate John McCain,  now senator from Arizona, on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now the question is, is it a Twitter view or is it a Twinter view?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Both of them sound terrible.  Yeah, they do.  How can you interview somebody in 140?  Well, I can see the questions could be 140 characters.  How could John McCain answer in 140 characters?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's the point is the bigger question when they're both living in the same town and he  could just walk over to his studio.  He's got a studio.  I'm sure that Stephanopoulos should set in Washington, DC.  I'm not getting it.  It's a gimmick.  This is an out and out publicity stunt gimmick.  And it's going to work.  I agree.  I'm not going to follow it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This Twitter stuff's gone too far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, you know, John McCain is now far more active on Twitter than Barack Obama.  He is John McCain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I think it's not a staffer.  What do you think, Bono?  You think it's really him or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  I can't tell really.  His tweets are kind of weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're policy tweets.  Sounds like a staffer to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's the story?  I mean, this Twitter thing is getting big.  Someday I think they're going to have a future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Leo, by the way, you were mentioning this recently and I didn't notice this before where  all of a sudden Twitter itself is recommending people.  And they recommend them and their numbers go flying.  It's like, who are they recommending?  Why are they recommending anybody?  And why are they recommending these people?  Do you have to pay them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jason Calacanis did an interesting thing this week.  He Twittered, I hereby offer Twitter a quarter of a million dollars if they will put me on  their suggested list for a guaranteed two years.  His thinking is that that's a guaranteed million followers, right?  At least when people who are on the suggested list are adding right now about 10,000 followers  a day.  So it's millions.  It's basic.  I mean, it's huge.  And he says, this is worth money.  So I asked him, I said, Jason, are you serious?  Is this a joke?  He said, I'm serious, but really, I'm just trying to help Ev out by establishing the  price because this is going to happen.  That's what this is all about.  Yeah, I figured he was just throwing that number up.  You're suggesting that the system is corrupt.  Well, it's a little corrupt right now because neither you nor I are on that recommended  list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It'll be up on the up and up once we've all been recommended.  As soon as they say, no, I don't want to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The more we complain, the less likely that's about to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's interesting who they put on, but even more interesting who they didn't put on.  And we've talked about it before.  I just think that it's setting up for the way that they're planning to monetize.  I'm not sure it's such a good idea when the number three person right after, OK, number  one, CNN, number two, Barack Obama, number three, Britney Spears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And she wasn't getting any traction before she was recommended.  I mean, it's all about the recommendation.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But what I'm saying is, is this what Twitter wants to be seen as, as the Barack Obama and  Britney Spears channel?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But I don't know if I think there was a lot of people that added it, but I think that  a huge number of Twitter, Twitterers who don't even follow those two or many of the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In fact, I'm happy to have I just crossed 100,000.  I'm happy to have that number without the inflationary suggested list, because I know  those are people who actively sought me out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right.  I think that those numbers, those 240,000 are newbies who just kind of add, oh, well,  I'll just put some people on.  And because there's a lot of people that are coming into the Twitter market because of  things like this interview with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ellen DeGeneres this week, P Diddy talks her into creating the Ellen Show tweet.  She's now in the top 10 or top 20.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's ridiculous.  You know, the funny thing is I got a bunch of male bitching about the fact that we even  talk about Twitter at all.  And the fact that they've gone off in this, in this direction, which is just basically  corrupt.  I think we should just stop talking about it and get to real news and we just let this  slide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Good deal with me.  I mess I messed up last week.  I didn't mention the fact.  I ran out of time and I forgot to mention the fact that President Obama named a federal  CIO, the guy in charge of technology for the federal government.  Probably good that I didn't.  He wasn't there for very long.  Probably a good thing.  Vivek Kundra, who was the Washington, D.C. chief technology officer, had to step down  at least temporarily.  It seems that the day President Obama announced his appointment or shortly thereafter, the  FBI raided his office, arrested two as part of a bribery sting, including his number two,  Youssef Akkar and Sushil Bansai.  They say no, Kundra is not implicated in any way.  Nevertheless, I think quite wisely, he said, maybe I better take a little leave of absence  till the sauce sort it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The timing was a little bit suspect, wasn't it?  Soon as he becomes CIO.  OK, let's go in now.  Let's go in right now and get him.  It just seemed a little bit convenient for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's the what's the what do you think?  I mean, why would they were they trying to take?  I have no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have no idea.  I can't think of any kind of motive.  There's something that we don't know that will explain everything.  That's the way I'm looking at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, let me throw something in when you say the timing was bad.  I mean, it's possible that the FBI was going to put this off forever with these guys.  And now they got they got access to the deeper, deeper part of the of the White House or whatever.  They have to move in.  I don't think it was a timing thing necessarily.  There could be some big deal.  Then again, the whole thing could be just a scam.  But I suspect that they had to do it because now these guys are moving in deeper.  And if there was something they were doing that was corrupt, they have to move immediately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, also, they haven't they've stated that that he is not under investigation.  They're not they're not pretty clear about that.  Yeah, so they've been really clear.  It's not about him.  Can I say something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It tarnishes the whole office.  If his number two is being arrested for bribery, it's like saying, yeah, Madoff's wife didn't know a thing about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a little suspicious.  You're either you're either corrupt or inept.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Either way, it's not so good.  Right. Yeah.  Well, anyway, I'm glad I didn't bring it up last week because the story the story got enriched.  Speaking of enriched, we've got David back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry about that. I don't know what happened.  If you're in someone else's house, I guess you reset their modem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's OK. Move your iPhone away from the microphone.  And can you hear that?  Yeah, I got to talk to David because David this week, we're going to take a break and I'm going to ask you about this.  David this week did the most amazing thing.  And and and and and it's very typical Web 2.0 behavior.  Guy breaks into your house, passes out in your bed.  What do you do? Oh, I know what you do.  You start a Ustream feed, send video out and Twitter it.  We got to find out what the hell you were thinking, David, in just a second.  So that's called a tease, David.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a good tease.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What the hell was David thinking?  We'll find out in just a moment.  But first, this word from Squarespace dot com.  Sarah Lane, I know, is sitting right next to you, David.  She her blog is now on Squarespace.  I noticed Kevin, Kevin Rose is on Squarespace.  I start talking to these guys. I was really impressed with the technology.  Squarespace is I want to say a blog engine, but it's really more because they have  incredible templates for photographers, for instance, that you get automatic  light, light table and all that stuff.  It's just beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We're moving some some.  Are you? Yeah, we're going to be moving a bunch of stuff to square.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're going to move our company blog over there inside Twitter.  And I'm talking to them about maybe even more because I'm just it's so cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's so fluid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's also the web building tools that they provide.  Yeah, which makes it absolutely incredible.  And I had no idea they're sponsoring.  I'm thrilled.  I because we've had people that sponsor some of the things that we do.  And sometimes, you know, you're not you're a little bit less excited.  And what they have to offer, I'm really excited to talk about  and really excited about what they can do.  And then, you know, the Twitter is the perfect show for them to go after as well.  It's kind of a neat story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I'd never heard about them before.  And, you know, everybody pays attention to WordPress dot com  and type pad dot com and Vox and Tumblr.  And I hadn't really heard about them.  So I talked to the guy  that I can't stand.  Well, Dane and then

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and then that guy who built the entire guy who did it, who's a young guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's like in his mid 20s.  Oh, now I'm going to mad at myself.  I can't remember his name.  I'll find it.  But I think I was so impressed  at, you know, his thinking in this.  And what's kind of neat is  he has designed something that is really easy for anybody to set up a blog.  And this is what blew me away.  OK, easy import from WordPress and type pad and the blogger,  but also export back out into it.  So it's not a one way. It's not a roach motel.  A lot of, you know, a lot of sites, I'm not going to name names,  make it really easy for you to get your blog in there and make it impossible

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  to get out. Well, and I think that one of the things that we're looking at  is for a handful of support sites for some of our shows.  We're looking at using Squarespace because we don't want to have  a single developer that we have to, you know,  it has to be their time if they're not available or something isn't there.  There's going to be a group of us that can make adjustments,  change things, administer the entire thing and change the entire structure  if we need to, without anybody with very much technical experience at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let me read you an email and then we're going to get to David's story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's Anthony Casalina. That's it, Anthony.  And he he custom built the entire thing and he did such a such a darn good job of it.  They didn't even have to take a dime of funding.  He just built the whole thing. Yeah, that's right.  Got Dane on board and and it's a phenomenal platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's you know, it's cool. It scales very well.  They have this virtual machine technology that you never run out of bandwidth.  They just add more and it's and everybody benefits when they add one more machine.  Everybody benefits. Very clever.  So let me read you. Phil Gray just sent me an email.  He said, just a quick note to say, well done on picking up  the sponsorship deal from Squarespace.  I was listening to the podcast Monday night, Sydney time, whilst looking  at some options to build a website for a new business venture.  I'm about to launch. I heard you talk about Squarespace.  I've been playing with it for three days now.  My site will be ready to go live early next week.  The plugins are great.  The whole experience feels very slick, but most importantly,  their tech support is first class.  I'm so impressed. I've upgraded to a pair paid tier one account.  That's the top account.  Just three days into my trial period.  And by the way, you got that 10 percent discount, too.  So Phil Gray, PC coaching dot com.  I'm going to give you a plug, Phil,  and invite everybody to go to Squarespace dot com slash twit  Squarespace dot com slash twit.  You could try it free for two weeks.  If you sign up 10 percent off when you use our names,  Squarespace dot com slash twit, we thank them.  I'm really glad to have them on board.  It's really interesting how sometimes something like this could just grab  everybody's attention and the the whole community goes, yeah, yeah.  You know, it's kind of like the right thing at the right time.  So, David, you left your door open.  Do you live in Portrero? Where do you live?  I live in Petrero Hill. Yeah. OK.  Not a not a great neighborhood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, it's weird.  It's one of the most it's one of the greatest neighborhoods in the city,  except the what they call the North Slope has some of the best views in the city.  And once you get in, it's warmer.  You get down there. Yeah, it's banana.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's you know, it's really banana belt. It's beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. But once you get in the South Slope, I mean, you really almost get into  the quote unquote projects even within a few blocks.  Well, we were there.  Tech TV was there. All the alley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Tech TV was a few blocks away.  We would have armed robberies once in a while in front of Tech TV.  Remember, David, you know, the guy puts the revolver up his nose and says,  give me is give me your laptop, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But we had the neighbors next door that hated us,  the neighbors next door to the studio that hated us. Remember them?  Yeah, they hated us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. They had that big dog.  Oh, man. They had like a Doberman with the come out.  It scared our guests. Who was scared?  We had a guest come out. I yelled at the guy.  I said, dude, we're trying to do a television network here.  Our guests come out the door and your Doberman attacks him.  There's a leash law in this town. Oh, he was awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And he would always park like a Ferrari or some other designer car  kind of sideways across the front of the door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Always a little suspicious about his business.  He was a construction guy.  But it's something else going on in there.  I don't know what was going on. Anyway.  You leave your door unlocked again.  I don't know why, but you're a trusting guy, right, David? That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, if you've really seen my where I live, it's it's up.  It's up an alley and there's a small little patio.  And it's private enough that I'll just leave things.  I'll leave things on the patio that I know could get stolen,  but it's not a big deal to me.  And in the three years I've lived there, nothing has ever been taken from there.  So I'd say darn near 20 percent of every night.  I probably just kind of don't lock the door.  I do now. So what happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Was this Thursday night?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was I don't know what night it was.  Maybe Wednesday of last week or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm reading about it the next day.  There's a lot of tweets.  But some guy wanders in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. So what I guess what no one's done, I'm surprised.  There's a lot of feedback.  And you think about journalism a little bit and you realize that if people  are going to be writing things and they're having a platform as a blogger  or even as, you know, a more  a journalistic entity that's been around a lot longer,  you'd think as a newsgatherer, you would go and seek the source before you report.  So I'm kind of surprised about how many people would say things  and their sources were the commenters rather than like,  why don't you try to even email the person who was involved?  I kind of don't care that much, you know, if people want to say things about it or not.  But I'm surprised how many people say things  as a journalistic entity without actually looking for sources,  which is like, I'm right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you mean a lot of a lot of these newspaper stories, they never even contacted you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, no, no. I was contacted by ABC.  I was contacted by, I think that's it.  This is a good test.  Two places, two places contacted me and everyone else, including the, you know,  the register, a newspaper in Sydney and a couple other places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You were in the UK. You were in the English papers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was surprised. I was surprised with the reaction.  However, if I think back at it, the novelty of what I was doing  seems like it's newsworthy. So, you know, it does make sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK, so the guy wanders in, passes out in your bed.  You do. You know, he didn't he didn't do that.  First, he went to the bathroom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what I was getting at by saying no one contacted me is no one actually knows  the full story. Oh, good. Let's hear it.  Because no one asked. Yeah.  I came home at about one in the morning.  I'd been with some friends who I hadn't seen in a while.  So I came home at one.  I hadn't slept a lot since since the time change.  I'd been getting about five hours of sleep and sometimes four.  So I was pretty tired.  And so I come home, walk in the door at one in the morning.  I sit on my couch and the lights are on.  And I live in a studio apartment.  I still live in a tiny studio apartment, which is funny, but I still do.  And so I sit on the couch and I fall asleep while sitting on the couch.  So I've got all my clothes on. The lights are on.  I'm sitting on the couch. I fall asleep.  And so, you know, I didn't even lock the door.  And yes, I sometimes leave it unlocked because I don't think to do it.  But so I guess I was asleep for two hours, two hours pass.  And I wake up because I hear a rustling of my door opening.  And so I see a person walk in.  And as I see this person walk in, I'm trying to get my senses of  I'm waking up. What's going on?  Is this someone I know? What's the what's what's what's going on?  And then by the time I am fully awake and cognizant, I see a guy very much.  I don't know if he was inebriated or drunk or what, but completely out of control  and stumble past me and into the bathroom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My diagnosis from watching the video was Quaaludes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know. Maybe he didn't even he didn't even smell of alcohol.  But by the time he had Biel, though, I know you Twittered that.  Yeah, I did. So by the time I was cognizant, I saw a completely out of it,  completely out of control and not with himself.  Individual stumble, barely able to walk into my bathroom.  And so I sat there dumbfounded and I thought, really, did that really just happen?  But immediately, because of the fact that he was so out of it,  I didn't feel threatened.  And so I totally agree with a lot of the people that said,  I you should have called the cops.  Well, now, when I went out, you whipped out your iPhone and you Twittered.  Yeah. So I thought, yeah, yes, maybe I should have called the cops.  But the reason that I didn't and the reason I didn't say shouldn't have,  but I kind of I'm OK with not having done it.  The reason that I didn't is because I did not feel at all that my safety was in danger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I could say I felt the first tweet is, OK, maybe I should lock my door.  I swear a random dude just walked into my bathroom  and I can't believe I haven't freaked out.  That was 314 a.m.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Bob, what was going through my head when that happened is I thought, OK,  there's a guy in my bathroom.  I don't feel threatened.  I kind of want to go to bed.  And now I'm annoyed that there's a guy here.  And then the next thing I thought is I've got a phone in my hand.  And just like you and just like most of the people listening to the show  have a Twitter account.  And so once I had my phone in my hand and I knew I had a Twitter account.  And luckily, I have a decent number of followers.  You have a lot more than I do.  I thought this is very ironic and strange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And so your first impulse was not to call the cops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, my first impulse is I think your first impulse is, am I OK?  Am I worried for my safety?  What the hell is going on?  If I was worried for my safety, I guarantee I would have either  punch the guy in the head or call the cops or run.  And I wasn't concerned for myself.  And again, granted, maybe I should have been, but I wasn't.  So I thought I'm not worried about myself.  And as soon as that is alleviated,  then I'm going to start telling people about what's going on.  He was he was I think it's strange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He was relatively well dressed, right?  He didn't seem like he was a street.  So I don't I don't think he was homeless.  I think he was out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He was just he was he was out of it.  He had been on drugs.  He had been partying or all of whatever kind of the above you want to add in there.  And so so I Twittered the first one and I hit refresh from my phone.  And I automatically even at three in the morning, I had five or six or seven responses.  And so then I started leaving my stream of consciousness on there.  I'm like, well, maybe I'll go in there.  And then I thought he was still in there.  And so I even said something funny.  I said, well, there's no toilet paper in there.  Maybe that's why he's still in there.  And then once I realized that I was I was giving a blow by blow on the phone  and I really wanted to do something, because quite frankly, I wanted to get him out  so I could go to bed.  And obviously, I wasn't calling the cops by that point.  And part of the reason I didn't is because I felt safe and I didn't want to have to deal  with the cops coming over, writing a report and doing all that.  So so finally, as I'm doing the blow by blow on Twitter, I realize, well,  I've got a computer with with a camera and a microphone.  I can set up a Ustream live feed in about 10 seconds.  You're so you're so good.  Two point.  So so I did it.  So I did it.  And if anything, I mean, if something happens, you better believe they're going to see it.  So something bad happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So that's why I never worry, because if somebody is going to off me,  at least they're going to do it on camera.  Yeah. Right. So I feel safe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So now that I mean, the people that were actually a lot of people  read it the next day, the most of the people did and saw the video,  which I should have captured, but I didn't.  But someone was screen recording.  Yeah. Yeah. But, you know, if I was seeing this as it happened,  I can I can tell that it would have been quite riveting. And.  And I'm surprised about how many people thought David that it might be a fake

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  because it was so compelling.  It was like, well, maybe this is just some sort of staged event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I that makes sense that you would think that you know me.  No, I don't think you've staged it. Yeah.  Kevin knows me and Sarah knows me.  The people that know me like, oh, that's just Prager.  That's just Prager. Exactly.  Sarah's over there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Prager dreams and Prager dreams and Web 2.0.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the best. I love it that he had that instinct.  Brian, why would you have done that?  Would you turn on a camera?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Say I think I would have I would have  I would have realized I just hit somebody and they're on the floor.  I need to call the call the ambulance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I would have told the guy to get out.  Hey, can I can I make a long story longer and ask Prager,  what was the resolution?  Did you ever find out who this guy was?  You said you didn't know if he was homeless or a bum  or a guy who stepped in the wrong house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The video showed I guess he got in your bed  and the video shows you dragging him out of the bed and talking to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I yanked him out of the bathroom.  He was on his feet.  And as I yanked him out of the bathroom, the bed was nearby  and he fell over on the bed.  And then I probably said a couple of dumb things.  I said, dude, I think I was using the word dude too much.  There's a lot of dude.  I think I used the I used the F word a couple of times too many.  But, you know, he fell over on the bed and I, I don't know,  I said a few things and I was kind of dumbfounded that I've got now  that I've got this guy lying on my bed.  And for some reason, you know, all you can see is his boxer shorts.  And yeah, he took his pants off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know.  So you never called the cops, you just got him out of there.  And you tried he didn't speak English.  You tried to talk to him. He wasn't speaking English.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. And I think maybe he did speak English, but he was so messed up.  Yeah. He was on Oxycontin or something.  I mean, he was. And what was funny is, I mean, he came back to try to get in.  And first, I left my pants in your house and I didn't feel threatened.  I almost thought it was, you know, I knew I had the Ustream going.  And so I looked at the camera and I said, this guy's trying to get back in.  This is ridiculous.  And I could I mean, I could tell.  I mean, either he was a fantastic actor, but if he if he was and he had ulterior  motives, he certainly would have accomplished them and he didn't try.  So I think you were a punk by Kevin Rose.  So I was I was I was pretty blown away by the response.  But again, it does seem like the novelty.  And I never really considered myself quite the child of the Webto movement.  But I guess I guess I'm I guess I did what people in our positions  might sometimes do, I don't know more than you thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe it's one of the Rev three layoffs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. I'm after you.  There's people commenting that said that, you know, I was the Darwin award.  And then there's also people commenting saying some people said,  I can't believe you're so nice.  And at the same time, some people were saying,  have you no compassion for human beings?  You kicked him out and he might have been dying and you didn't call an ambulance.  So some people want me to beat him up and send him to the hospital.  And other people said, I had no compassion for human beings  because I didn't do anything to help him.  And then other people like, oh, you're so nice. So, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you're going to end up sued by the guy for invasion of privacy, his privacy.  You watch that.  He's going to get you in court and he's going to take you for everything you're worth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That was what my reaction is.  Funny, John, you and I, I must have been hanging out with you too much  because my reaction was  that if anything happened to this guy after you threw him out, he could sue you.  You know, if he walked to the street and got hit by a car,  your biggest risk was not from this guy, clearly.  It was from his lawyer, his lawyers, lawyers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe. Well, to this day, I have no idea.  And I was never coming with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You'll hear from a lawyer shortly. Don't worry about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm surprised that no one has recognized this guy from the video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know. He seemed like I mean, you know, the video is a little blurry,  but he seemed like a good looking, well-dressed guy.  He was a partier. He was a Portrero Hill partier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was telling Andrew Bancroft, who hosts one of our shows,  that he really looks a lot like Andrew Bancroft, but it's not him.  Oh, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is that well, hmm. Hmm.  Hmm. Well, anyway, congratulations on surviving.  Thanks. The case of the mysterious intruder.  I had I had a mysterious intruder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You did? Yeah, my backyard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Really? Yeah. But you live like on a big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I have a big. Yeah, it turned out to be a raccoon.  But I walked out, I think I think I was like,  I was like, my wife says there's something in the backyard.  I have to go get it if I don't come back.  If I don't Twitter in 10 minutes, call the police.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's clearly a Twitter issue going on here.  People got sure it wasn't seismic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Could have been a seismic wreck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I went out at night and I walked out with a flashlight and a knife  thinking, you know, this is the beginning of some horror film  where you're going, why is he doing this?  And then it turned out to be a wreck.  I thought that my backyard was his yard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's someone in the house.  Yeah, exactly. Get out now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, Leo, I got to ask you, I listen to the show  a good amount of time, not every week.  And how much of the show is talking about Twitter now?  What percent? Oh, we're going to stop. Stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Stop. I want to stop. We all want to stop.  We can't. That's the problem.  Twitter's like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, you keep on trying to use other services, but they're just.  There's nothing else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, the chat room says 99.9 percent, 27 percent.  Fifty dollars. I don't know what the fifty dollars is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think in general, I think in general, everybody's just tired of hearing about it.  And when they do hear about it, it skews the conversation.  And we can be talking about it for 10 percent of the show.  And it sounds like 80 percent because it's everywhere.  I mean, it's on Martha Stewart, for goodness sake.  It's on every every five years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When everyone got sick of us talking about blogging, it's exactly the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would say, yeah.  I mean, Peter, you were there for the emergence of the blogs.  I mean, and Gadget was, I would say, arguably still the winner of that.  I like to think so. Yeah.  I mean, is this so it does remind you of that.  It reminds me a little bit of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It reminds it's exactly the same.  And everyone five years ago, everyone was, you know, complaining about blogs  and people need to shut up talking about blogs and people writing columns  about how they're sick of reading about blogs, et cetera, et cetera.  And Twitter is like kind of the same thing.  And it's a it's a publishing platform that everyone's really excited about.  And everyone's getting sick of because we're all over saturated with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think the thing about Twitter is it's kind of counterintuitive.  At first sight, it seems much, much less than it is.  And then you get hooked and then it seems like much more than it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I want to make an announcement to all the listeners out there that I tried.  You tried what? To get the conversation off of Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right. Ed Bott, let's get the conversation on the Ed Bott.  John, what do you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The reason everyone uses it and talks about it so much is that if you're like  or like Leo or like me and you have a lot of people following on Twitter,  you want to talk about you want to be able to use it as a broadcast mechanism.  And because of the fact because of that, then you continue using it and talking about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, I realized this week I had a kind of a come up and I mentioned  I just tweeted a little tweet.  Oh, I'm about to hit 100000.  You know, it seems prize worthy.  And I got all this heat on friend feed people saying shut up.  Who cares how many people?  And I realized talking about your followers is like talking about how much money you make.  It's just gauche. It's like don't don't.  But Twitter encourages, you know, they put it front and center.  You're back on track being gauche.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, we're talking about Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right. So what did you do?  Now, Ed Bott was a friend of ours.  We had Ed Bott on the radio show a lot.  He's a nice guy.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But like, I don't know what they pay him at Microsoft,  but he's a hit man, apparently.  And I was looking at this.  He did a story, he says.  I'll tell you, it's about me.  Dvorak gets Windows 7 horribly wrong.  I wrote a little column in MarketWatch saying that if this thing doesn't  isn't a big success, Microsoft's got some issues in the future.  And investors should be aware of that.  That's basically the theme of the column.  Which, by the way, I agree with.  Of course. And but anyway, I mentioned a couple of things.  I said, I don't think this is the finished code.  I think that everybody's all jacked up about some, you know, something that's pretty streamlined.  And it's going to probably the likelihood of it being as fast and nifty as it  when it gets released, and especially after a few patch Tuesdays, is probably pretty low.  Since Microsoft has a bad reputation.  He basically goes crazy and says that is in fact, I'll say the last  he goes into some quoting me, he says it's he says that is to put it as kindly as possible.  Pure crap.  The security features you see in beta release seven are those you will see in the final product.  The idea that there's a pile of code being held back is ridiculous,  which which begs the question, why don't you release the product now?  Yeah, here's what really got me at the end.  He has an update. If you want to go back to his blog, you'll see it.  He says, I went back and read the column again.  Another page view, by the way,  was especially struck by how crude and juvenile the writing is.  It's similar to what I see in comment threads from anti Microsoft's zealots.  I wonder if JCD is having this column ghost written.  Well, so I decided to do a little research on Ed's  charming writing.  And and by the way, he did the exact same thing against  a Chris Perillo commentary when Vista came out and Ed was,  you know, doing the same pro Microsoft crap.  And the reason, of course, is Ed's real income comes from writing books about  Vista, and he obviously has books ready to come out on Windows seven.  And he thinks that anyone who says anything negative will, you know,  probably hurt sales by two or three books.  And he's just very upset about it.  And I also think he gets his he gets, you know, a memo from Microsoft saying,  did go, you know, hey, look at this, you should do something.  And he does. And then he doesn't do enough.  So they send him another note. So he does an update.  I mean, it's basically he's just a Microsoft stooge.  So there end of story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How I noticed that the same now we do a Windows  show with Paul Thuron, who I love and I think is great.  And I think his integrity is 100 percent or I wouldn't be doing a show with him.  But I do notice that he and Ed are similar in one respect that  they come and they blow hot and cold on Microsoft.  And sometimes it's like you're attacking mom and Apple pie.  If you say anything about Microsoft, it's negative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, Mac users would never be that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I guess we're the same way, aren't we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's it's just Mac users the same way.  And both of these camps, by the way, accuse me of being all your Microsoft  go, oh, you're anti Microsoft. I mean, I don't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I never saw more hate than when John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John, I get exactly the same thing. Do you?  Ryan and I. Yeah, Ryan and I get it constantly.  Whenever we say anything about about Apple, all the Microsoft.  It's like people go nuts.  It's everything you know, it is biases in the eye of the beholder.  It's always that way.  Yeah. And I think whenever you know, people try to accuse someone of being biased  or having a secret agenda or something like that, you really have to kind of  like look at it from, you know, where your own preferences lie.  I see this all the time.  I mean, someone got on my case last week on GDGT Weekly.  I suggested that if someone balks at the price of the new iPod Shuffle,  they might want to look at something like, you know, some of the devices from Sandisk.  And some guy just like slam went ballistic on me for it.  That's like some sort of nice, by the way.  Yeah, exactly. I mean, they're good alternative.  They're very affordable.  And, you know, you don't have to give up a screen or anything like that.  You know, you do with the shuffle in the sky was just like it was like,  like I, you know, blasphemed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How dare you? Don't you know the iPod's the best thing in the world?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the thing is, and it follows, you know, the Ed Bott column,  he follows with his followers who are a bunch of Microsoft stooges to,  you know, with the typical anti-Devorak stuff, which is interesting.  I really think the guy needs to change careers.  This guy Robert says, and another guy says, well, I believe it's time for Mr.  Devorek to be put out to pasture.  Moo. And then another one, of course.  And then Mark Justice Hinton says, I was surprised to learn Devorek  still has a column, which is like always ho ho ho.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  These guys are so funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, you know, it never ends.  But the fact of the matter is Microsoft, I am not buying into all the propaganda  that Windows 7 is the greatest thing since slice of bread.  They still haven't fixed a lot of things that were broken and  inviscid that they promised years ago and they have never implemented.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Who was it said that the lower the stakes, the higher the, you know, the battle?  I mean, there's really let's face it, there's not a whole lot of difference  between I mean, they're all computers.  The DNA is 99 percent the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And another thing I am.  We're 99. We're almost 99 percent the same as monkeys.  By the way, I'm targeting Ubuntu now as something to really seriously look at.  Good. I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Dude, I love Ubuntu. I use it all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a but anybody does anybody here on this very esteemed, established panel  use it full time as their desktop OS?  I could do it. You could use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, I you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here's what I want. I want to work.  I think you should use it for a month straight.  Nothing else. The Lindsey.  I could do it. It's not a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Except for one thing I had, there's one missing piece of the puzzle,  which is going to be solved. Here's the rub.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Adobe. Oh, you use Photoshop a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I use Photoshop. You got to learn the GIMP.  You can use GIMP. Yeah, GIMP does not do the job that Photoshop does.  It's not as cool. Can you use the online version?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, Photoshop.com. You could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Or Aviary.  Peter, you use it full time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what? I actually one of the few people who uses  Windows Ubuntu and Mac on a regular basis.  You know, I live in the browser, so at this point, it's just what's really matter now,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  does it? Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, the thing about it is the first thing you do when I first thing I did  when I installed Windows 7, I just I installed Firefox and, you know, 99.  Like we're talking about 99 percent.  I mean, 99 percent of the stuff I do is in the browser now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, Twitter works the same on all of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I switched.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I switched. I switched over from from being a PC user to using a Mac about three years ago.  And Windows 7 is the reason that I went and bought a PC about two weeks ago  because I wanted to go back and start using it again.  And I think it's great. I like it a bit.  Now, again, I'm not using it for quite the extensive reasons that a lot of people do,  but but I think it's a pretty solid operating system.  And I think that also that, you know, I mean, it doesn't have the bugs and it doesn't have a lot of the issues.  But what about what John was saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you think it's going to get buggy as soon as they put everything in that they've left out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or have they? I don't know.  There's so many.  What I realized when switching back to a PC and I still use a Mac is that there are so many more  applications available to PC users that I forgot about games because I was only using the the Mac stuff.  Granted, like in the past three years, the number of Mac applications has skyrocketed.  But the PC. You just want to play live. I know. I know why.  In becoming a Mac user, I forgot about the benefits of using, quite frankly,  the benefits of using a platform that 90 percent of computer users use.  I'm with you on that. I actually like Windows 7 a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think Mac users are the most likely to be happy with Windows 7.  It feels clean and simple and almost, I hate to say it, Mac-ish.  And I'm not sure I agree with you, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I'm not. Wait, wait, wait, before you not agree with me, let's back up a few.  Like a year or so when Vista first came out and you said the exact same thing about Vista.  And Kevin Rose was on the show going on and on about how great Vista is.  But not me. Well, everybody was going on about it.  So just like a Mac, it's got Mac characteristics and, you know, they never used it.  Of course, they played with it. And you're.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think Vista on the surface was appealing.  And then as soon as you did really start to use it.  Well, this is the same thing.  No, I have Windows 7 on all my systems now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've been using Windows 7 since.  Until they start updating.  It went to get a few of these patches and then give me six months and we'll see what happens.  All right. I think that's reasonable.  And I want you to use it.  I'm sorry, six months after it actually is released.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So a year from now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. But the thing is, I mean, if you go back to Vista, if you tried out the Vista beta,  I mean, the Vista beta wasn't as good as the Windows 7 beta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, not nearly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I mean.  This is the point I made in the column, by the way, said Microsoft's changed its style.  They put less in to make you happy.  They put less in.  To make you happy.  You agree, Juana?  It's streamlined.  It's like it looks it feels great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I've been using.  I mean, I went I went a good five years using Linux exclusively from like 99 to like 2000.  Yeah, I was using Linux exclusively until I switched to I switched to a Mac because I had been  customizing Linux for so long, doing so much to try to get it to where I wanted it.  Then when I switched to a Mac, I was like, OK, that's how Unix is supposed to be.  Supposed to be pretty with all the underlining.  Yeah, without the underlying power.  That's kind of why I use a Mac.  But going back to the Windows, where every time I go, I got Windows 7 on my on my netbook.  I got an HP Mini 1000.  Every time I go back and I try to do something on Windows, I find what Prager said,  I think it was Prager that said that, is that there's a lot of software out there to do just about everything.  And I find that that's a problem for me because in the Mac world, everything is so specialized.  I can find one or two good tools that does it very well.  Where on Windows, I can find 40 or 50 tools, maybe only three that do it very well.  And they're all ugly.  Yeah, it's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Every time I open up an app, I'm like, why can't they just look at the interface just for a couple of minutes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I do recognize that they're all tools.  I got Windows. I got I got Linux and virtual machines now.  I used to have a Linux laptop.  VMs are great.  VMs mean you can do anything you want, really.  If anybody wants to try Linux, I mean, I say go for it because you'll find that some of the compromises don't apply to everybody.  I mean, some of the things that don't work may not bother you.  I mean, everything is in the browser now, like everybody's been saying.  So I don't think it's going to be that big of an issue for John.  Honestly, I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And we're actually considering developing some turnkey systems where Linux is really the only solution for us.  You know, so we're going to be we develop a lot of our software is actually written in Objective-C.  So it's written straight to OS 10.  Wait, the Pixelcore?  DV Garage, my other company.  So and so we make Keen software and a lot of other things.  But one of the things we've been playing with is some turnkey boxes that do a lot of the stuff that we do.  And, you know, our solution is as we look at it, there's not a lot of ways to avoid just writing in Linux because we just need to have complete control over the box, be able to build it from scratch with a lot of extras.  And that is one of the big advantages of either Windows or Linux is being able to customize the hardware a lot more than what you're going to be able to do on OS 10.  That said, I'm not, you know, my laptop I'm quite happy with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I think they're all about the same and there's minor differences.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's one major difference we have to always take into consideration.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, yeah.  Windows is outrageously expensive, but nobody buys Windows.  They just buy a new machine and it comes with Windows.  Same for the Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, you buy it. You can go to a lot of computer stores and just buy an OEM version of the Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I'm just saying people don't really do it.  Mac users do it because they want to run it in VM.  But most Windows users get it when they buy a computer.  They never buy another edition until they buy the next computer.  I mean, that's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah, but I'm talking...  It's not the end users necessarily that have to eat it.  It's these big corporations that have 10,000 seats.  Yeah.  And they have to buy 10...  Which is why they're still using Windows XP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But at some point they get, you know...  Yeah, they have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's really the game.  Microsoft has to come up with a way to force you to upgrade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, but the big thing is that always every time someone's forced to upgrade, then they get into...  There are smaller companies, maybe not the large ones that have huge infrastructure,  but especially as a bunch of these...  A lot of these companies are moving more and more towards software as a service.  And a lot of their infrastructure is going online.  They can make a decision of, you know, we can go to, for instance, OS X.  We're going to move over.  And it's not... or Linux.  But especially we can change it because a lot of our executives like iPhones and then the iPhones...  Watch this. Watch this.  Watch this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's cloud computing, right, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sounds like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, no, I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, I was waiting for like the Führer, the storm.  Well, no, and I'm speaking...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I'm not pro cloud computing now.  You are?  No.  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, my world is rocked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Eh.  No, I'll say I'm not a big fan of it personally.  Mostly because...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that it has its place.  That's the compromise I've made.  I want to... you know, let me...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm going to talk about something that is totally exciting to me that I think is going to change everything.  And it has to do with cloud computing.  It has to do with Google.  Oh, yeah.  Voice.  Yeah.  Let me talk about voice in a second.  I am so excited about this.  I also want to ask you, David Prager, why Kevin Rose hates me.  Because...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why does he hate you?  What are the symptoms?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I'll tell you the symptoms.  I know he hates me now.  He's got...  Wait, wait, wait, wait, why?  I'll tell you in a second.  He's got a new website and I could tell I'm not getting the love from Mr. Rose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does it have to do with application development?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We'll talk about it in a second.  But first I want to mention...  See, I'm getting so good at these teases.  I'm really getting good at these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're teasing me here too.  I have no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I want to talk about GoToMeeting.  From the folks at Citrix, GoToMeeting is an amazing program that means you can travel less.  You can meet more conveniently.  We use GoToMeeting now for one of our shows.  Ray Maxwell is up in Vancouver and he wants to show us screenshots when he does his Maxwell's House show.  GoToMeeting. It's amazing.  He just sends an email out to me.  I click the link and suddenly I'm seeing his computer on my desktop.  He can show us the drawings that...  If you're in sales, imagine this.  Instead of having to travel cross-country, sitting in the middle seat...  I know you don't do that.  But for those of us who have to go through security, take off our shoes, all that...  You don't have to do that anymore.  You just say, hey, get them on the phone.  It's got free voice conferencing built in, both VoIP and teleconference.  Get them on the phone, say, go to GoToMeeting.com.  Here's the meeting ID.  They enter it in.  Suddenly they're seeing your computer.  They see the PowerPoint, the presentation.  You'll increase your productivity.  You'll close more sales.  You'll do more.  You'll travel less.  I just love it.  Set it up in a couple of minutes.  In fact, if you do it right now, you'll have it set up before the show's over.  GoToMeeting.com slash twit.  GoToMeeting.com slash twit.  You'll try it free for 30 days, by the way.  A month of meetings, unlimited online meetings, absolutely free.  And if you decide to sign up, you'll find this is the most affordable solution out there.  Easy to install, easy to configure, easy to use, easy to pay for.  GoToMeeting.com slash twit.  I use it, encourage you to, too.  There's software as a service.  Well, you know, that's cloud computing, isn't it?  Come to think of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, because what I was going to say is that I haven't been a big fan of it, but as I see  more and more of what some of these guys are doing, I start going, oh, I mean, when you  look at whether between what they're doing, what Google's doing, what Salesforce is doing,  you know, you start going, well, maybe I should do more of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think Google just did the tipping point.  I think this Google voice, I'm going to go way out on a limb here.  And John, I'm ready for you to shoot me down.  Peter, you can shoot me down.  But I had a Grand Central account.  I was just collecting dust.  I wasn't using it.  Mine, too.  Converted it to Google Voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Unbelievable.  They haven't given me my conversion code yet.  Me either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just saying unbelievable is not selling me on anything.  OK, let me tell you what you get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So first of all, you're now you have one phone number that you're going to use forever.  This is your single phone.  You can an unlimited number of other phones forward it to.  If it uses your Google contacts, which they kind of rolled out secretly,  kind of covertly in Gmail a little while ago, I have groups.  So I have a family group.  I have a twits group.  I have a work group.  I have unknown people.  You can have different messages for each group.  You can have different responses for each group.  So when my family calls, they get a custom answering machine message.  They can ring custom phones.  They can get screened or not screened.  If somebody I don't know, it's not on my contact list calls, they get screened.  They have to say their name.  I can listen to them leave a message if I want.  Then this is the best part or one of the best parts.  The messages are transcribed, machine transcription.  It's not perfect.  And SMS to me or email to me.  So I have it set up so that when you call me, if I don't know you,  I don't even hear the ring, it SMS is me your message.  I can call you back from the SMS message with one click on my cell phone.  Now, I can also call my Google phone number and get free calls anywhere in the U.S.  This is the thing that I think is change is going to change telephony free calls  anywhere in the U.S. through Google.  They're undercutting the price on Skype on international calls is actually cheaper  than Skype. SMS is free.  Text messaging is free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How does this connect to Android is what I want to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's that's going to be the next, you know, the other shoe.  And maybe Peter will have a thought on this.  But right now, it works with any phone the way anything else would.  But if they put an Android application or an iPhone application out with this thing,  see, I don't think they will, because I think AT&T would quash it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a huge threat.  I wouldn't hold your breath for a bunch of reasons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you think, Peter, this is a threat to the phone companies?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It would be if Google would follow through on anything these days.  You might be right.  I think that they have a attention deficit disorder right now when it comes to stuff.  And I mean, look at Android.  I mean, the fact that they've really been very slow on iterating with Android and there's  a lot of I mean, it came out a little prematurely.  I think that it was a little underdeveloped when it when it I still know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And also the G1 is such a crappy piece of hardware that it doesn't do Android justice.  It's just too slow, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I use one and it's definitely very sluggish.  But I mean, Android just as an operating system, it needs a lot of polish.  And I think that you can sort of see that Google I mean, it's hard for them to keep  their focus on so many different things at once.  And so the idea that they're going to integrate Google Voice, I'm not saying they won't do  it. But but I think that's going to happen a lot more slowly than any of us would like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was so I have a question about what Google does.  Why is Gmail still in beta?  Yet the Chrome browser came out of beta within two months.  Why is Chrome not in beta still?  Because they don't even have a frickin OS 10 version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, the better question is, what does it mean that they're in beta?  It's meaningless. Does it have any meaning?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hey, leave us alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's an excuse. It's like if this thing screws up, it's not our fault.  It's in beta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I just think that isn't that what that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't that what that means?  I don't think it means anything.  Chrome can screw up.  Something in beta means that, like, hey, we're all that's what it used to mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think the new meaning is empty, meaningless.  Thanks to Google.  I also think thanks to Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, everyone uses the term beta because of Google.  I mean, like it existed, but people always know it's Google puts things out in beta.  And so everyone calls their applications in beta and even their products.  Like some of them really, I wouldn't be surprised if Ford made a car  and called it beta because they didn't know if the gas economy worked well or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, in some ways, though, I think it'd be someone who develops software.  Calling something beta for us works out really well because we get some less pressure  and we get a much higher sample rate so we can we can handle a bunch of stuff.  And people will get now.  What does it mean?  We move out of beta in a month or two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but this is a web service, for one thing.  It's not soft. It's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But it's still it's still there's a bunch of things to roll.  You know, there's a bunch of things to eat.  Now, I think that the Gmail thing is a little silly.  But at this point, it's not beta. Come on.  Exactly. But I think that there is something that is has been very useful for us  of being able to release something that we that we call beta.  Now, we could probably call it gamma,  you know, which is like, you know, we've already beta tested because usually when  we've done it, we've already it's already been tested by 50 people.  But this is this is Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just want you to know. Yeah.  I don't know. I think that's not they've made the term.  They've effectively made the term meaningless by being in beta for so long with Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And in England, it's called beta.  Beta. Do they say beta?  Yeah, they say beta. Oh, yeah.  Beta. That's weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Don't they know Greek?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't we know Greek?  And that's what they said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I say, don't you know Greek?  So what do you think about this?  Have you has anybody else played with Google Voicers or just me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They haven't upgraded me yet.  When I got into Grand Central, I had big view.  I had a big. Yeah, Grand Central was a disappointment.  Well, I just I just couldn't quite get my head around it completely.  Is it easier to get with Google Voicers?  Oh, yeah. Get into it, because I've been looking at totally.  I've been wanting to do this with our office number.  I mean, they completely redesigned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I should show you. But I will after the show because it's got my phone number all over it.  But I should show you, although I have to say the machine transcription is  it's machine transcription. It leaves a little bit to be desired.  I I tested.  I left myself a message in which I said, hi, this is Leo.  And I'd like to know if when you're coming home for dinner  and it translated to high ass, ideally.  And then that was fine.  I knew I mean, obviously, look at that.  That's a mistake.  But then it says, when are you coming out for dinner instead of coming home for dinner?  That makes a big difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think I'm going to leave a message that says that says hi.  This is going to be transcripted by a by a machine.  So speak slowly and clearly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I spoke pretty clearly. I don't even think it.  It said high ass, ideally, oh.  Instead of high, it's Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it looks better when you show it on the screen.  Yeah. That's what you see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You see how bad that is.  And then now what's interesting is you can see there's different  like some of the words are dark and some are light.  There there's obviously some information here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The darker ones are the ones that it's sure of, and the lighter ones  are the ones that it's less.  I hope so. It's sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And sure of high ass.  No, that's still great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then I wonder if you're coming and then out for.  So they actually looks like they have three shades of gray.  Dark if they know for sure.  Light gray if they're not sure.  And then very light gray if they're if they're pretty sure they got it wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why don't we just why don't we just conclude it sucks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, can you teach it? No.  Can you teach it the terms? I don't know.  I don't know. I don't think so.  It's just out now. It's good enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, it's look. It's good enough because what it happens,  I get a text message.  It says who it's from.  It says roughly what they said.  I know what the message is about.  I can play it back on the on the Web interface.  The other thing they did is Grand Central's Web interface was opaque.  This is a Google.  Believe it or not, I don't think Google is the best UI company,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  but they did a pretty good job of making this.  Well, and I definitely think as a as some kind of app,  we're going to be able to check our messages and so on and so forth  through some kind of iPhone app.  So it's going to be this nice little interface that will be interesting.  It's visual voicemail, but better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, I think so.  I think if I'm a phone company right now  and I've heard from some people that the phone companies are a little nervous  about that, what do you think, Peter?  I mean, this is your this is really your area.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think that this is the one thing that the carriers are always  worried about is being disintermediated and having  people figure out ways to completely route around them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's all now, you know, and you can't sell services.  It's all bits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but though I think that there's still some issues with doing VoIP  over a data connection, like over a wireless data connection.  I mean, you're not going to you're going to have some latency issues  that you're not going to have when you're using the voice channels.  So it's not quite there yet, but it's getting better.  And you actually see some of the carriers overseas being a lot more open  to this stuff than they are here in the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because I think the carriers overseas have resigned themselves to they are  that you're paying for the pipe.  And that's what they're that's what they're selling you.  It is not as overseas characters.  Carriers don't seem to be as connected to trying to get your minutes  or or even the content that you get over it.  They just you literally are simply  paying for a pipe to your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I know that's the thing.  And the carriers here, they really don't want to become just a dumb pipes  because they kind of realize that that then they'll all be commodified.  And then it's just a race to the bottom in terms of pricing.  Exactly. I think we're actually going to see that anyway.  You see that T-Mobile being a lot more aggressive.  It's it's all in one price.  So, yeah, I mean, I think this is going to be a big deal.  I will say with respect to Google Voice is that I've had Vonage for since 2002  and I've had the ability to have one number forward to like five or six  different lines and have the voicemail transcription and stuff like that for a while.  So a lot of a lot of those big features are something that's been available

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  from other servers for 30 bucks a month or 25 bucks a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I paid the 15 because I don't I try not to talk on the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I use something called Got V-mail that gives us boxes and all sorts of cool stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. But I think the price zero is a big deal.  Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Plus low cost international calling.  It's interesting that you say that the US carriers are more worried about this  than the international carriers, because it's my understanding that Google  has no intentions of offering this anywhere but the US.  So they've said no US only.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think it might have to do with the pricing for doing all the  the termination and the the regular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just think this is very exciting.  I think Google is is this is I agree with you.  I mean, look what they did with Dodgeball.  I mean, they completely killed it.  Then the guys go out and say, well, we're going to say, OK,  thanks for the money, Google.  Thanks for letting us sit in the beach for two years.  Now we're going to start Foursquare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're going to run out of children's games, but maybe not maybe not that quickly.  And the same with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what everyone's using here at South by Southwest is everyone's  like using for installing Foursquare.  Are there the next? Oh, yeah.  It's the new Twitter.  And it's also because I got there on Twitter.  Twitter used to be great at a conference because you could talk about  where you are with your with your friends.  And now because they don't have enough features on Twitter yet,  you can't talk about things you're doing for a specific group of people  who are in an area because you've got a bunch of followers that don't care  that you're in Austin at South by Southwest.  So then therefore you can't use it anymore to tell people where you are.  Back to Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That never ends.  It never ends.  Why don't we just change the name of the show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Have you seen the the really cool Pepsi  Twitter visualizer for South by Southwest?  Yeah, I think that's pretty sweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like the map the best.  Right now, it says that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  because I guess it's looking for the South by Southwest tags at South by  Southwest, 991 people are traveling, 1141 people are drinking,  6372 people are attending, 2500 people are eating.  Four hundred seventy six people are connecting.  Isn't it funny? I just love it.  Oh, look, then you get a graph.  Why is Pepsi doing this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why is this interesting to anyone?  I don't know.  Mainly you, Leo or anybody that looks at this.  So we know there's 2200 people drinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the colors. It's the colors, man.  Is it the colors?  It's the colors.  Wait a minute. There's 2300 and four people partying and 1142 drink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What a bunch of tea totalers partying.  I don't get I'm not getting these numbers as accurate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, of course, this information is worthless,  but it's nicely presented.  I guess you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Leo, once you hover on the bottom and you get the menu.  Yeah. And then there's one called, I believe it's called Where People Are.  I think that's really useful because it shows a Google map and it

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  party watch, probably, right?  I think it's over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's it.  No, one of them is a map.  So either swarm David, you're actually there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  David, how many people are pooping?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Doesn't sound like a lot.  Oh, yeah. You know, I got here, I tweeted out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I said, I am so sick of people Twittering about SXSW so that, you know,  you know, it's actually ruined Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can't use Twitter because everybody's chalk a block with that.  And if you're not there, it's like, who cares?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This one right here seems useful because I've seen a lot of tweets of people  asking, where is everybody?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is the swarm feature and it shows you a map of Austin.  X is where people are tweeting.  And then the you know, like at Stubbs bar at Driscoll bar,  there's nine tweets and eight people.  So you could find out where everybody's hanging.  Yeah. And go shoot them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, hey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo, you got to come out here.  It is a lot of fun.  And it's absolutely your your community.  Well, I know it's everybody I know or want to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would love to. Hey, wait a minute.  Hold on a second.  I thought we were going to come back from the break with the with the teaser  and why Kevin Rose hates Leo. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So ask Kevin, David. I saw some people behind you.  Is Kevin there with you? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, no, he's not.  He we just finished.  There's some shameless plugging going on on my screen here at Sarah Lane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  S.A.R.A.H.L.A.N.E.  Where would where would I find at Sarah Lane?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What what's on a certain web app that we don't want to talk about anymore, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So Kevin's got Kevin is I have to say, Kevin is very creative,  one of the most creative people.  He's just he must just ideas must spill off of him.  He's got a new site, which I guess they launched  for South by Southwest called We Follow.  This is kind of a response to that, you know,  messed up system that Twitter is using for recommendations.  You can tag, you know, tech celebrity news and figure out who to follow on here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have I been tricked?  Is this another Twitter story?  Yes, you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And we got you to ask for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, wait, no, but it's Kevin's site. OK.  And I did the thing, you know, you're supposed to press a bone.  I broke I broke it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, it doesn't work.  I was trying to open to myself.  Everybody just broke it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What we follow dot com used to be there now five oh three five oh three service  unavailable anyway, I'm not on the list anywhere.  And I did the thing where you go to, you know, to do this.  Oh, this is what your gripe is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because I don't think Kevin likes you.  I was going to say, what's this have to do with him disliking you?  Because he won't let me be on the list.  I think I honestly, honestly, honestly think the reason that you're not  on the list is because he is so ADD he didn't think about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, but I know him.  I know. But then but then OK, so I understand.  I'm not I'm fine with not being on the, you know, seated list.  That's OK. I understand that.  That doesn't matter to me.  But then I do the thing where you Twitter, because everything's about like  publicizing the site.  So you press a button and you do at we follow and you do your three hashtags.  Tech, I did tech. I did news. I did radio.  I did that last night at 24 hours ago.  Still not on the list. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that you should have a conversation with him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I love Kevin. He is. It's a very public conversation.  He's my girlfriend. He's my secret.  He's my secret crush.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now we're getting into something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No. Anyway, enough, enough.  I'm not going to talk about that anymore.  I just. Oh, but when you just tease it a lot and we only talk about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you tease it. The tea.  No, that's it. That's the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What else is there to say?  We follow dot com. It's a good idea.  Replaces that broken system Twitter's using.  Of course, Ev is going to take Kevin off the suggested list now  because Kevin is undermining Evan.  This is like high school. Twitter is high school.  If Kevin is undermining Evan's way of making money on Twitter  by having a open public suggested follow thing  instead of the paying for it to be on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I want to leave a little piece, a small piece of advice.  You're talking about how there's so many good ideas in his head  and all this stuff spills forth.  And one of the things that I think has led him to the success that he has.  And like there's so many people watching the show right now  who are already good programmers and good web designers.  But there's also so many more people than that that have fantastic ideas.  And it's really cool to be able to take your ideas  and find people who are able to build things on it.  I mean, Dig was built because he had an idea  and he found someone to help him make it a reality.  We follow dot com is the same thing.  It's an idea that he had.  And he, you know, thankfully, he has, obviously, because of his previous success,  so many more friends who are interested in being able to develop things with him.  And so all of these ideas become realities because you find ways to make it a reality.  If you don't have the technical chops to do it, you find someone who can.  Or so many ways to do it like that.  And I think it's a big deal to follow through on your ideas and make it happen.  If you can't make it happen, find someone who can help you make it happen.  And then otherwise, you'll never know if it was a good idea or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, my good idea is I have one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, what? Let's go to the news list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here's my good idea.  And then we'll go to the news list. So.  Go ahead, David, you want to take that?  No, that's it's one.  Except one.  So my idea is we were doing security now and  whenever anybody buys a copy of spin right from Steve Gibson,  he has a little thing that goes, yeah, but that would do.  And he forgot to turn it off one time during security now.  And he sold like 20 copies like the thing keeps going off because people  bought it just to make the thing go off.  And a light bulb went off in my head.  So what I'm going to do is every time we get a donation for twit,  we're going to have different things happen in here.  So like for a five dollar donation, we'll have a nerf pistol aimed at my forehead.  I'll bounce on for ten dollars.  You know, a little duck will come down from the ceiling or confetti.  And I figure for a thousand dollars, I'm going to have a little pin here  that'll burst the ball I'm sitting on.  If you pay a thousand dollars now, this is an anti burst ball, so it won't go pop.  It'll slowly slowly sink out of sight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You'll just be sinking down. What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think I could make millions.  I probably could. But do you want to? Yes.  Just because you can. And for five thousand a bucket of slime.  Yeah. What do you think?  I think people would do that.  I think it depends on what's in the slime.  Because of the interactivity.  You know, they people don't want to know people go crazy.  Like to get Chris Perillo to put a keyboard on his head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Those kids go rabid.  I mean, they literally they literally start swarming like bees.  Yeah. When Chris does something that they say, Chris, he goes, yeah.  And they go, oh, my God.  And then all of a sudden, he gets a thousand viewers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know why? Because television is so there's such a glass wall between you and TV.  You can't interact with Peter Jennings while he's dead.  But even if he were alive, you couldn't interact with him. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can't. But I think that that's that is the that's the killer app.  I mean, that's the thing that we haven't really started to take advantage of.  What we're just starting to take advantage of within the Internet  is being able to have that interactivity, being able to break that wall down  is the thing that makes this a better, much more interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. So I'm going to have what do you think, Peter?  I'm going to get an Arduino kit and I'm going to have my ball.  I think I love Arduino.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a little bit like a monkey in a box. You know, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's you know, it's a carnival.  We have a dunk tank, whatever jump monkey jump dunk tank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, they used to have here in Chinatown, in New York,  a few blocks from where I live.  You could play tic tac toe against a chicken. Yeah.  That was very popular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'll play I'll pick out a piece of corn for how much?  Ten dollars. Ten dollars. Yeah.  I'm cheap. Chicken was cheaper.  Really? Yeah. But the chicken, you could feed chicken feed.  They'll work for chicken feed, literally.  So this is actually a momentous week on March 13th, 1989.  Twenty years ago, a man named Tim Berners-Lee, now Sir Tim Berners-Lee,  wrote the paper proposing the World Wide Web.  It is now 20 years old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And it looks pretty much the same. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it doesn't. No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sarah Lane has started. David, you should ask Sarah about.  She has a new tumble blog that is bad websites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have a new tumble blog that's about bad websites.  Is that what Veronica does? Veronica?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I could fuse the two.  Oh, but she had the answer.  She knew. Yeah, Veronica is so cool.  It's like bad 80s websites.  And there really is a difference in the 80s.  I don't think there were websites in the 80s.  Bad 90s websites.  Actually, they're websites from two years ago, most of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, whenever I saw a site with the marquee tag,  instantly put it in that category. Oh, yeah.  That's the one where BG Sound and oh my goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  BG Sound, used all of those. Love those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, sometimes you wonder if people just forgot to change it.  You know, they put it up years ago and then just never got back to it.  Yeah. We change ours about once every five years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know why she started doing this. I guess it's  she calls it the vintage web.  It's the vintage web dot com.  And I don't know how she started, you know, got into it.  But maybe she just noticed there were a lot of really awful websites out there.  But it's really been kind of fun to watch these just god awful sites.  You know, exactly with the marquee tag, plumbing supply dot com.  I mean, how could this? This is today.  These sites are active now.  I guess so. You go to a plumbing supply site.  You don't you don't expect a blink tag. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, why don't you just get a Craigslist every single day  and it looks even more vintage.  Oh, my gosh. My space, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But do we want more from Craigslist and what they're giving us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, apparently not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's perfect.  The reason it's still around is because they just they do a good service  aside from whatever their legal troubles are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  According to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Apple  has even more DRM in its new iPod shuffle.  There is a chip, an authentication chip in there  that prevents you from reverse engineering the headphone interface,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  which is very important with this iPod, given that there's no other buttons.  Are you even interested in this one? I have to admit, OK,  I will say I own almost or at some point in time have owned before I lost them.  At some point, I've owned every iPod sold.  And this is the first one that Apple released.  I want and I looked at it and I went, I don't know.  I'm not going to I'm not going to get that one.  It's got no buttons. It's got no animal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This thing looks like a stick of dentine.  They should put on the box not to be taken internally.  You're not kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Although it would be pretty cool if it stayed there and you could just,  you know, have a Bluetooth connection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I really think that the day that they were picking out the design,  somebody came in drunk and they said,  that one and they picked the one on the right instead of one.  Because it's just so many things that don't seem like the guy in Prager's house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Seriously, I got no really.  OK, come on. I think it's pretty.  It's it's just like it's pretty.  It's got silver smooth metal.  There's no buttons.  So you have to use these headphones.  And that headphone has the slider and the next and the left.  What do you think, Peter? You review these things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, this is Apple's game.  They've been doing this with the iPod and iPhone docks for years where they try to make  it really difficult for people to reverse engineer accessories for them.  And they had that whole made-for-iPod system where you could basically pay a tithe to get  your accessory to be officially supported for the iPod or iPhone.  So this is something they've been doing forever.  And my response is, if it bothers you, just don't buy it and don't buy Apple products.  Because you're basically agreeing to lock into their whole system in the first place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, a product like this, which is a relatively inexpensive product,  it's a major thing for a company to say, we're going to put a chip in it just to keep people  from creating their own unauthorized headphones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But people are going to. And what will happen is that people will pay the authorization  and then they will make the headphones.  So it paid for itself, I guess.  It will pay for it as consumers.  Yeah, because they're going to touch it.  The five dollars they're paying Apple is just going to go into the price of the product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And I've had companies already semi press releases saying they're announcing  headphones that are compatible with the new iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Clipsch is already announced headphones.  Yeah. And you have to have them.  I mean, you can't otherwise you can't play it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Or you can use Apple's crappy headphones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  With the original iPhone, was it an accident that you had to have the head?  Most headphone jacks wouldn't work.  Was that a design accident?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It was a design accident because they took it away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, because it didn't make any sense because they're not.  Apple's not selling headphones for a pile of money.  So why do they care? I don't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The license fees.  Well, they're going to make a lot of money.  What they're realizing is there's huge markets that sit around around the iPhone.  Why not? They're a hardware company making a little bit more money on every piece of hardware.  Makes a lot of business sense.  That's exactly what they're asking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's their strategy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's interesting to me is that they're still selling the old model.  And that's rare for Apple when they come out with a new model of an iPod.  They usually scrap the old model.  But the old model of the iPod shuffle is still for sale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I think that's something to do with their lack of confidence in the new product.  Can you not hook this this new product to a car with the car jacks?  You know, you know, you get a BMW nowadays.  No, you know what? That's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that sucks because you would have no control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, now the question is, is whether there'll be something in the future  that allows you to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You raised the point on MacBreak Weekly earlier this week that why the heck  didn't they put a dongle in there that you could plug any headphones into?  And the dongle has the controls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, you know, it sure does that essentially.  Yeah. You know, sure.  In the bottom half of the of the headphones, they'll make a you can just  buy the extra whatever that controls it all.  And you can put any set of headphones on the top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, if there was any question that Apple is much more interested  in money than its customers, this is pretty good proof positive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, it's just it continues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they can get away with it, right?  I mean, I think a lot of companies would do this if they could get away with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I think that most customers aren't going to care and most manufacturers  aren't going to care. I think that's the issue.  I think they're making I mean, we'll grumble on the show and we'll you know,  it makes good good radio.  But the issue is, is that I'll still buy whatever's out there.  And if it's five dollars more, I'll still buy it.  And the manufacturers, you know, will just pay the five dollars and not,  you know, call it a day. It's not going to.  I just don't think that it's going to be one of those things that a lot of people  are going to spend a lot of time thinking about.  Apparently, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can tell you now that people in my family, if they look at it,  they'll see all the button clicks that they'll have to memorize  to go to the next track, to rewind, to fast forward, since it's just one button.  And they're not going to want to remember that.  They're not going to want to remember all these different combinations.  There's way too they simplify the design, but they complicated  the user experience to me, which is a huge mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I will say that  I don't like this this this iPod.  I'm not going to get one.  But I will say that I use the little clicker all the time on my headphones,  on the and I have the ultimate ear ones.  And I use that little clicker all the time.  But just to pause or to go and to rewind and go back forward.  Really? You do all the buttons?  Yeah, I use I've you know, and it took me about a day to figure it out.  And then after that, it's really nice not to have to pull my iPhone out to do it.  And I just sit there and go click, click, click, click, click, click,  and I'll go back and find stuff.  And so it's it's something that I don't find that uncomfortable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what's the next story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're not going to like it.  I'm just warning you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Iphone 3.0 software coming out Tuesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You asked what the next story was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  John, you have another story you'd like to talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm open. No, no, you're rocking there.  I just you just belabor some of these stories.  I mean, to me, this shuttle thing story from the get go is too much publicity.  Who cares? It's a little device.  It's not as though general

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  stove that's the thing is that it's going to be it's going to be every iPod  that comes out after this.  You know, this is just this is the tip of the iceberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And stop talking about iPods as well as Twitter.  You want to talk about Jaiku?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We could talk about Twitter iPods.  Jaiku doesn't work.  Jaiku is interesting because it's another Google product that they bought, killed.  And then and then now it's on the App Engine and open source.  And you can use it for free on App Engine.  They just brought it back this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think I saw a story.  I'm not sure where, but I think WordPress is going to use this Jaiku engine  in their the next revision of their.  You remember they came out with this this Twitter version?  This Twitter version of  WordPress, I think the next version is going to come out with it on the Jaiku engine.  And we looked at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I saw it. So what would it be?  It'd be a micro blog kind of a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, I think it's using the Jaiku engine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to say they're going to have like an IRC chat channel on the blog.  You can have like your little channel going while people are looking at your blog.  Is that what it is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, let's get the link.  So I'm making sure I'm accurate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That sounds like an interesting idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, if you think about it, if you're WordPress,  if you're in the blogging business, Twitter kind of is a threat to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  In some ways, but I think that I'm pretty excited about the idea with Jaiku  because we want to do stuff like this for you within our membership,  within the pixel core. And  you know, obviously, we looked at Yammer,  but it is too restrictive.  We looked at Twitter just doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We use Lekonica on the army.twit.tv.  And I like it, but it's such a slavish clone of Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. I'm not as happy about it.  What I like is the idea that we could go in and kind of dig into it and.  You can. It's open source.  Right. But I mean, Jaiku, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you know Python, Jaiku and Django, if you know Python and Django,  you go with go with Jaiku for sure. Right.  Moving on in just a bit, we're going to talk about.  I got to talk about the iPhone 3.0.  For crying out loud, it's a big story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll find something else. Did you get invited?  No, that's OK. But what is it?  Is it released? Do you have a big announcement?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Tuesday. And there's some speculation about what it'll be.  And I'm just going to do it. What time?  It's you know what? We're moving back break weekly just because they're  doing it to us again.  So we're going to switch Mac break weekly and security now.  We'll do back break. We're going on Wednesday.  So we'll have something to talk about then.  John, let me think you like talking about the Kindle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess I don't like talking about anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what I'm thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, but I mean, I think we need to get better news stories.  I think that news is what is the news.  I mean, is it getting that pathetic that the news is so boring?  I mean, Kindle, by the way, I got to play with the Kindle finally.  It's pretty nice little product.  But I still would like to see a little more contrast ratio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. If they could if they could get a paper white screen with black  black text, it'd be a killer product.  It's not good for reading newspapers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Say The Economist on it. I think I could be I could be sold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's better for linear books, page, page, page, page, page,  because the the functions to move around are not very easy to use.  It's just not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. The interface is very sluggish. Yeah.  And, you know, a few people have asked me about what it's like to do,  like Google Reader and stuff like that on it.  And it looks OK, but it's just the interface is so slow  and the browsing so sluggish that you wouldn't want to do it.  It's really just about the books. That's about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's a new Android app that lets you scan DVD  barcodes and then automatically auto torrents them.  And that's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you go into a store, you go into it like one of the last of the record stores  and you barcode something and then bingo, it comes across.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. You know, I just want to say that's genius.  There's part of me that the Virgin is right across.  The Virgin Megastore is right across the street from us and going out of business.  Well, but here's the deal is that going out of business sale.  Here's what they did.  They hire these companies now to manage their orderly demise.  You know, and so the company comes in and takes over.  They did this for CompUSA.  They do it for Circuit City.  Try to get the business, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would like to be in the orderly demise business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So these companies come in and do this.  But what they did. OK, so they of course, everything's 40 percent off.  But they took all the ten dollar racks and put it all back up to retail.  What? Yeah. So they they doubled the price and then they made it 40 percent off.  And even almost all the prices in there on the, you know, the fire sale  is still more expensive than Amazon.  You know, and these people are more and, you know, there's just not that many people  in there buying stuff. It's very surprised.  But it's an amazing thing to see a big record store  that's trying to sell everything off at 40 percent and still empty.  You realize how far it's over, you know, how far it's gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's it's it's pretty much over. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But the building's really nice. We should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, who's going to go in there? Who goes in there?  I mean, is there any retail left?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was about to rent part of the third floor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is a beautiful building. I used to love going there.  I would never I've never bought a record in there once, but I loved going in there.  Exactly. Loved going in there.  I think they're closing them everywhere. Right.  I mean, he's going. I think that Richard Branson says the worst thing I ever did  was not get out of retail sooner.  Big mistake being a retail.  You know, it seemed you know, he seemed like a genius a few years ago.  Then he got into two very hot businesses, retail and airplanes, airlines.  I love Virgin. Yeah. Yeah.  I'm flying. I'm flying right now.  Next week. Yeah.  Excellent. Smart guy.  Let's take a break. We come back.  We're going to talk about iPhone three point.  I have to say we have to talk a little bit about it.  Before we do, I want to mention I'm going to do this really quickly.  Audible dot com. I love Audible.  Everybody knows about Audible. I don't have to belabor the point.  It's a great bookstore for online, for for downloading audio books.  Fifty thousand plus titles, the best books in the world.  I'm listening to a really good book right now called Electric Universe  that is about it's the history of electricity.  And I am learning so much.  Actually, he calls it the shocking true story of electricity.  But I'm by David Bodanis, and I just I'm learning so much about the history.  It's fascinating.  And, you know, it really is kind of timely in a way, because,  well, for instance, Edison.  Made his chops was famous for being basically a patent thief. Yeah.  He one of his big gigs was finding out,  you know, looking at patents, looked at Alexander Graham Bell's patent  for the telephone, figuring out how they could steal ideas from it  and make something a little bit better and make millions.  He was a very wealthy man based on this and then goes after the light bulb,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  then goes after the record player.  And then and then shocks elephants to get.  Yeah, that wasn't so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Tesla's AC. Static.  I'm sorry. Electric Universe, the true story of electricity.  It is narrated by Del Roy.  David Bodanis reads it. It could be yours.  Absolutely free. In fact, you get two books free if you get the platinum account.  That's what I have. Two books a month.  How much is the platinum account? I don't know.  I just you know, it's an automatic charge.  I think it's it's it's a it's cheaper than getting the books a la carte.  I mean, it's a really good idea to subscribe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's what I'm getting my parents.  So my my parents, I'm moving my parents to audible because they buy tapes.  They still buy all these tapes.  And I finally. Oh, that's crazy.  Well, I know. But I kept on saying, you know, you could do this.  And so I'm just buying each one of them an iPod.  They're both their birthdays in April.  I find each one of them a little a little iPod and I'm getting them  a platinum subscription and I'm just going to convert them for one year.  And then I know that they'll be done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, please do this.  Go to audible dot com slash twit to sign up for the platinum account.  You get two books and those are yours to keep whether you decide to stick around  or not audible dot com slash twit to.  And I would definitely look at this electric universe.  It is fascinating.  The story, I mean, Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone  because he fell in love with a deaf girl and was trying to impress her parents.  And this story is just amazing.  Faraday, the story of laying the first transatlantic cable,  the story of the telegraph, just fascinating stuff.  Audible dot com slash twit to thank him so much for their support of this week in tech.  So forget the iPhone 3, we'll talk about it next week.  It's exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Leo, I posted that link in the chat.  Oh, good.  What I don't see is it's called Prologue 2 or P2.  Remember, WordPress came out with the theme, a Twitter theme called Prologue.  And this one's called Prologue 2.  It's an improvement.  It basically turns WordPress into Twitter.  But I didn't see anything about Jaiku  specifically on that blog post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I thought it was.  Turns WordPress into Twitter.  I mean, I've seen plugins for WordPress.  Sorry, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just want everyone to know that I tried and tried and tried.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You get all this nice mail from people saying, we love you, John.  You should be on the show every week and stop them from doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, apparently, what's the point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you're not succeeding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I'm waiting for the iPhone 3 story, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, Kevin's got a big rumor.  David, do you think Kevin's source on this is pretty good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was I was off for a second.  But if you're talking about what he said about Apple, he's the iPhone 3

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  rumor that cut and paste.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, very solid source.  Oh, stop the presses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hold on a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But why am I doing hearsay from someone else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you know, if you think about it, look, it's not that Kevin has great  sources inside Apple, but because he runs Dig, who is the first?  If you're going to be a tipster, who's the first person you go to?  You go to Kevin.  He's probably got excellent sources who just come to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, here's what I think is weird is a lot of times when a company leaks  something, they do it strategically or there's someone who has ulterior motives.  And for some reason, I think a lot of the times with Kevin,  it's people that are excited about being able to talk to him  and give him something that he thinks is fun and cool.  And like you're giving something, you have something of value  and you like you're a fan of somebody and being able to give something of value  to your fan and therefore get attention from that person is the reason they do it.  That's what I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is ironic, isn't it, that cut and paste would be like a big story.  Hold on a second.  Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's some fundamental things.  You know what I'm praying for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Flash, if they put every other phone is going to have flash  with this new initiative from Adobe, except the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's because they have a love affair with H264.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, no, no. Flash, Flash supports H264.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's this I think it's they just don't they don't have a  they have an anti love affair with Adobe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think they have an anti love affair with somebody else  having a proprietary platform that they have to depend on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, good news. You're in the cell phone business. Get real.  I mean, this is you're working with AT&T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that that there I think that that's the issue that they want it to be.  They want to be something that they don't feel like suddenly  it could be held over their head at some point in time down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Peter, what are your you're still connected to this world.  What are your tipsters say about I find three anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think, you know, the big question is  what they're going to do about the app experience.  And so there's some rumors that there's going to be a premium app store,  something to, you know, better highlight stuff,  because there's I mean, there's so many applications now.  Yeah, you can't keep.  And I think that what's happening is that a lot of the bigger developers  feel like they're being swamped by a lot of crappy free and 99 cent apps.  And so something that lets them highlight their stuff.  They can charge more and put a little more invest a little more in the development process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Who would they charge more with?  They charge would Apple get a bigger cut or would I think the cut would be the same?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I mean, if you're going to put a lot of work and try to create something  where you charge like nineteen ninety nine or whatever for a game or for an application,  you don't want that to be flooded with or surrounded by a bunch of free  and 99 cent apps that it makes it it's harder to stand out.  And it makes people feel like by comparison, your price is too high. Right.  I think it's going to be I think they're going to make a big push into gaming  with the iPhone this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's a great gaming platform. I love my games. It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And I think the question is whether the next iPhone is going to have  a little more heft with the processor so I can do right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Better gaming. Or if it'll be bigger.  Why not go ahead?  I was going to say, I think Apple has to use this event to e-crow  about their background notification system.  Yes, they really have to let us know why they scrapped it  and what they're doing to replace it.  They did. They've been ignoring it for months.  They have to come out and say something.  Either they're not going to do it or they're going to do it a different way.  Or what's the story behind that?  So I think that's going to come out as well. Something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I yeah.  And now is this going to be a hard Peter?  Or do you think this is the hardware platform for June that the three  always represents a new phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, it might look about the same and like I said,  have a little more power under the hood.  But I do have to I do wonder whether they're starting to worry  a little bit about Palm.  I don't think that they thought that the pre would have quite as much buzz  surrounding it as it would.  I think they had written them off.  People are pretty pretty excited about Palm,  about the pre and looking forward to it coming out.  And the thing is, the pre is going to do a lot of things that Apple is refusing  to do with the iPhone, like have an actual keyboard.  Right. And that's a really big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And Flash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it won't have Flash at launch, though.  That's something that'll probably happen around the end of the year,  because the thing about Flash is that it is very resource intensive  and that's very difficult to do on a mobile device.  And Flashlight never went anywhere.  No, it wasn't enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One of the things I'm hoping for is a stabler browser.  I hope they fix a lot of those bugs,  because I'm still getting too many crashes on mobile so far,  and more than I want to.  I get one almost every session.  Really? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, it's not a bad crash.  It just disappears.  You know, I mean, it's like, you know, you continue on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But somebody said something really funny to me.  It's like it said the iPhone tells you that you want to see the launch screen now.  It's like, OK, you don't want to see that.  But let's go back to the launch screen.  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  This is better for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
