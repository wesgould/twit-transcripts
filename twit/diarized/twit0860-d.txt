For the last three years, I've been working at ZDNet and driving a lot of change, transformation  and didn't always have as much time to write as I would like more editing and guiding coverage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good.  I love that.  There's nobody, you know, no better observer of this because you, you like me, we've been,  we've been there.  It's not seen it.  It's not history for us.  But it is for most everybody else.  So I think, I think we probably should kick off with Spotify, Joe Rogan and what's going  on there.  So Spotify under a little bit of heat last week, 270 physicians, epidemiologists, scientists  wrote an open letter saying you gotta, you gotta do something about Joe Rogan.  Joe of course hosts the Joe Rogan Experience, probably the most likely the most listened  to podcast in the world.  He claims 11 million listeners a week.  I don't know if it's that many.  It's easy to claim big numbers like that.  That's a lot of people, a lot of young people, especially young men listen to Joe.  On the December 31st, Rogan had a guest on who claims to have invented the mRNA vaccine  in the face of all evidence to the contrary and furthermore said it doesn't work and you're  being hypnotized into using it.  That's stimulated the letter from the physicians and the scientists.  Spotify declined to respond.  They didn't do anything about Joe Rogan.  They've taken others of his episodes down, but they said that did not meet their threshold.  For a takedown.  So the response from other artists has been strong.  Neil Young at first said take my music down if you're not going to take Joe down.  Joni Mitchell followed, Nils Lofgren, others.  When Neil Young said take my music down, I think Spotify thought was yeah fine old man,  go ahead, who cares?  But the stock market did.  The company lost four billion dollars in market value and stock price tumbled 12 percent.  We'll see what happens on Monday.  That might not hold for very long.  But the real question I have for all the three of you is what, I start with you because you're  an editor in chief at ZiniNet.  What is Spotify's responsibility?  They hired Rogan.  They spent reportedly 100 million dollars to get exclusive access to his podcast.  So they're his employer, I guess.  I mean, if we're just a show, if we're a show like ours, Spotify wouldn't have any more  responsibility over it than anybody else would.  Although I have to say Spotify, Apple and others have pulled down other podcasts.  I think Alex Jones famously is hard to find a platform for him.  What is Spotify's responsibility, Jason?

Start time: 415.30
End time: 560.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, there's really two fundamental issues.  And we'll start with maybe the sort of the first one, you know, getting back to the sort  of the base principles of this is like, what's your responsibility as a platform to have  a certain level of freedom of expression?  Right.  So that, you know, you are, are you the arbiter of taste of what of truth?  Because truth is somewhat malleable.  Or because when you do that, then you open yourself up to, you know, claims of bias.  This goes back to the beginning of Twitter.  Twitter sort of originally stated, we're just the platform.  Whatever people put on here is up to them.  And, you know, the merits of it or the, you know, the ability to publish things that not  everybody likes is OK, because you have to put up with that in order to allow everyone  to have a platform.  Well, we see how that worked out for them.  Right.  Eventually, they came under a lot of pressure in a number of different ways because of things  that were done on their platform that then became even dangerous or destructive in some  way to society.  It's the same with Spotify.  So they are going to be under continuing pressure.  And I think there was a certain sense that if this was just Neil Young, who is a bit  can be a bit iconoclastic, right?  He is a person who likes to take stands.  And that's very vocal.  Yeah, exactly.  Very vocal.  If it was just Neil, Simon, I think Spotify might have said, you know, we're still going to  stick to our guns on the platform angle.  But once it once it elevated from there to others and spread and the idea of this,  well, now it's sort of a bigger problem where there's more societal backlash against this  and there's a lot more pressure.  So that's the first piece is that this platform issue.  The second is the fact that their strategy, their podcast strategy has not really worked  out as well as they thought.  Yeah.  Just let's see.  Well, that's clear, right?  It's a huge bet.

Transcript:  A hundred million dollars for Joe Rogan is a lot of money.  They bought Call Her Daddy for 60 million reportedly.  They spent half a billion dollars on acquisitions of Gimlet Media and Anchor FM.  Yeah.

Start time: 575.34
End time: 591.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They have a lot invested.  And from what I can't remember exactly how much of this they have announced publicly,  but the understanding is in the industry that Joe Rogan is by far their most popular podcast.  I think he ranks number one on their list.

Start time: 592.20

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Start time: 594.00
End time: 636.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And so this is where it starts to get tricky from a business standpoint.  It's a business that's already struggling.  He's the only probably the biggest hit and maybe the only real hit that they've got.  And so now they have also a very difficult question that's going to hit them in the  pocketbook where a strategy that's already struggling and that they're looking at,  maybe do we have to reboot this or pivot it?  And now their biggest moneymaker is under a lot of heat.  And so it's a two-fold question for them and they're in a difficult spot.  And we hope that they figure out a way to find a good path forward.

Transcript:  Broadcaster Brene Brown has said, I don't want my shows on Spotify.  Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, who were reportedly working on a show for Spotify  and paid a lot of money to do it, now are expressing concerns.  I should mention, I did not know this, but part of the story is that Neil Young himself had polio  when he was five years old, contracted polio two years before there was a polio vaccine,  spent a lot of time in the hospital relearning how to walk.  People forget what a scourge polio was in the 50s.  When the Salk vaccine came out, I'm sure there were some people who refused to get it,  but I don't think there were many. It was a terrifying disease.  I think it was almost universally supportive of the vaccination at that time.  He is a vaccine supporter because of that. He also has epilepsy and type 1 diabetes.  So he's very kind of aware of this.  Is there a First Amendment story, Denise? Internet's attorney?

Start time: 702.63
End time: 716.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hi, quick answer, no. There's no First Amendment story here.  This is not the government.  This is not the government. This is a private entity making decisions,  and it has to confront a couple of factors here as it makes those decisions.

Start time: 716.78
End time: 729.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sometimes people use the words First Amendment as a way of saying free speech.  Two different things. We do have free speech, but he works for a company,  and any company has the right to say they're employees. You can't say that.

Start time: 730.40
End time: 757.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's right. So it is a Spotify question of what sort of information or disinformation  it's going to support on its platform. We've been through this on other platforms.  Spotify is no different than decisions that Facebook has had to make. Twitter has had to  make, as Jason has pointed out, except for the relationship that you pointed out, Leo, where  as you say, there's more of a partnership here between Spotify and Jim.

Start time: 757.16
End time: 764.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're not just publishing his podcast. They own his podcast,  which gives them a higher responsibility, I would think, right?

Start time: 765.40
End time: 855.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not from a legal standpoint. From a legal standpoint, they just have to decide if they  can weather this storm of the adverse public opinion, other artists pulling out. I see also  Joni Mitchell and Nils Lofgren have jumped in and said, yeah, we're going to pull our content.  So it's kind of like the whole close your account movement with Facebook. How much of that are they  willing to, sorry, meta, how much of that are they willing to put up with? And how much do they  think they can weather of that kind of adverse, both financial impact directly from what they're  able to offer on their platform and also the adverse public opinion? Do people really want  to support the platform, the adverse stock price impact? So there's a lot there they're going to  have to make some business decisions about. I hope they have a good crisis PR firm, good crisis  management team on board to help them make these decisions. And I think Jason's dead on that they're  going to have to act responsibly, not just to manage public opinion and their bottom line,  but lingering out there in the background, even though there's no legal requirement that I can  think of right now. Certainly there have been rumblings among congresspeople. The Surgeon General  of the United States has made several statements about misinformation and their lack of patience

Start time: 855.62
End time: 884.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  for it. So I think we can- This is somewhat work complicated because while some of us might say,  saying the vaccine doesn't work and don't do it is misinformation. Others say it's just an opinion  and so it's a little different public health because an opinion, yes, it's just an opinion,  but if it's an opinion that is wrong from the terms of public health,  then it's more than just an opinion, right? I think the Surgeon General of the United States

Start time: 885.98
End time: 901.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  would say so. Yeah. And that's what they have to get out in front of and not be the poster child  for some sort of regulatory action or congressional action that is meant to curb this kind of thing.

Start time: 901.98
End time: 905.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, how could Congress weigh in? I mean, doesn't the first amendment protect Spotify just as much

Start time: 906.20
End time: 948.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  as it does Joe Rogan? So yes, you raise a good point that you can't, Congress is not going to be  able to do content- That gets thrown out in court immediately. Yes. I think that Congress is less of  a threat, but you're right, there are limits to the first amendment and if it is a public health  consideration that is decided, yes, it would face a first amendment challenge, but I think it would  be if you could demonstrably say that this is adverse to public health, that a court could  very much uphold whatever was put in place. If I were Spotify, I would certainly want to get out

Start time: 948.56
End time: 1015.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  in front of this. Well, Daniel Eck did publish a long piece today, probably written by Crisis PR,  a Crisis PR firm, in which he said any Crisis PR firm he should say, we haven't been transparent  around the policies that guide our content more broadly, but we have had rules in years for place  kind of, sorry, we haven't been more clear. Today we're publishing our longstanding platform rules,  which apparently they had never published before. We're working, and this is, I guess,  the response, and I think this is probably the right response, we're working to add a content  advisory to any podcast episode that includes a discussion about COVID-19 directing listeners  to our dedicated COVID-19 hub, which provides access to, he says, data-driven facts.  I've always thought maybe the thing to do is just to say right at the beginning of the Joe Rogan  show, hey, Joe Rogan's a comedian, and his opinions and the opinions of his guests are his own,  please consult your physician before believing them or something.

Start time: 1016.72
End time: 1071.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. I mean, there was a time back last fall when people were kind of feeling this way about  Fox News as well, that there were some commentators who had gone on that network and said something  that I think prompted the Surgeon General to come out and say, hey, we need some more responsibility  around the information that's being put out there. But I think you raise a really good point too,  Leo, is that here we are, this is a different format. Podcasting is not a largely scripted  medium, although there's a lot of scripted podcasting out there. But when you're talking  about discussion and people sitting around a table or a virtual table, as in our case here,  trying to wrap their head around the issues of the day and doing their best with that,  even if they're sort of fumbling and stumbling along and they don't get everything right,

Start time: 1072.32
End time: 1098.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  there's value to that too. There's also, and I probably should have said this, in the contract  language that says Spotify has exclusive distribution rights, but does not own the show,  which gives them a little bit of a distance from the show. Harry, what should Spotify have done?  Should they put a disclaimer on there? Should they take it down? Should they ignore it and just say,

Start time: 1098.42
End time: 1173.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  hey, it's a podcast, anything goes? I mean, my guess is that the stuff that Daniel is saying today  won't make anybody terribly happy. And what it reminds me of is what the YouTubes of the world  were doing a year to a year and a half ago. They started out initially saying that we will  put labels on stuff and direct people to health information pages. And when they did that,  it really didn't make anybody terribly happy. And they ended up tightening the screws  a lot more on misinformation. I think it's possible that Spotify will have to do that too.  I know some people thought that Neil Young expected that Spotify might choose him over  Joe Rogan, which was not going to happen. They call this bluff right away on that one.  Right. Well, he really raised the visibility. We're having this discussion now because he did that  and because people like Joni Mitchell, who also had polio, being of the same age group as Neil Young  reacted to what he did. And it really feels a little bit like Spotify, who has this heritage  in music, which is usually a bit less controversial than spoken word content is still sort of catching  up with where the rest of the internet was a lot earlier in the pandemic.

Start time: 1177.56
End time: 1249.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And I think the response of the artist is interesting because it's not like Twitter or  YouTube, it's a little bit like YouTube, but really the artists are what makes Spotify money.  And so Spotify's reluctance to censor Joe Rogan because he makes them a lot of money,  they spend a lot of money for the podcast, is offset by other artists saying, well,  you can't make money on my stuff in that case. And that actually is hitting Spotify where they live.  I wonder, I think Neil Young probably knew his voice alone was insufficient,  but probably hoped that others would follow his lead and that all that would be left on Spotify  is Kid Rock, Ted Nugent and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. I don't know. It's an interesting  situation. It's just another case like Twitter, like YouTube, where these platforms are challenged.  And then of course it always becomes so politicized.  I think that's interesting too. It's become about politics, not about public health, not about  what's right or wrong, but just what's politically expedient.

Start time: 1250.28
End time: 1270.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess as more shoes will drop, I mean, it seems pretty unthinkable that this  could involve any kind of breakup with Joe Rogan, but more stuff could happen. We have no idea  about the conversations going on behind the scenes at Spotify and we might never know those.  Will Joe Rogan double down on this stuff? Will he pull back?

Start time: 1271.04
End time: 1302.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's an interesting question. I wonder if Daniel Ek called Joe and said, hey,  it would be nice if next episode you might say something like, hey, I'm just a comedian.  You should probably consult a variety of sources before you decide what to do. There are people,  I know people who aren't getting vaccines because of Joe Rogan.  Wow. He's really influential.  He's very influential. He also sells vitamins. He also sells products that claim to boost your  immune system. He's kind of promoting his own commercial interests in this a little bit as well,  which I think is reprehensible.

Start time: 1304.26
End time: 1314.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have a question I'd like to ask you all about this. Why isn't Apple having this problem? Well,  obviously they don't have Joe Rogan on board, but they also host-  Well, that's the difference, isn't it? So Spotify is just a directory of podcasts.

Start time: 1316.40
End time: 1328.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apple is just a directory of podcasts. So Apple, I think, I don't know, rightly or wrongly says,  well, he's not our boy. But they did pull Alex Jones down. It took a long time and a lot of pressure.

Start time: 1331.20
End time: 1334.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Apple was tweeting about the fact that they still have all the Neil Young you can listen to.

Start time: 1335.20
End time: 1339.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that's right. They jumped on that one. They said, oh yeah, we're the home of Neil Young.

Start time: 1341.34
End time: 1366.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, a lot of people have pointed out that you can listen to Steve Bannon.  By going to Apple podcasts, which is, I mean, you might be able to make the case that you  shouldn't be able to do that. But it's quite different given that Steve Bannon is not  a content partner of Apple or their signature podcast. And they're just really pointing to it  in the way that Google points to reprehensible websites. It's part of the new world because

Start time: 1368.12
End time: 1428.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  when media was controlled by big companies, you could say, well,  if the New York Times publishes an article, that's bad. We can go after them.  But podcasts, most for the most part are not owned by anybody. These companies would like to  say, well, we're just a directory. But at the minute Apple pulls down, Alex Jones, suddenly,  it's not just a directory anymore. They're making editorial decisions. So they kind of opened up  this Pandora's box. I, for one, don't want to see any company like Apple or Spotify or Microsoft or  any company have the power to say to an independent podcast, you may not exist. Google has that power  for websites. You may not exist. Nobody can find you. By the way, I should also point out Neil Young  hated, at least for a long time, hated Apple because of the quality of the music. He said,  never listen to iTunes. My songs sound terrible on iTunes. Maybe that's changed now that Apple

Start time: 1428.42
End time: 1435.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  does lossless as well. Pono? Pono. Yeah, I have a Pono player. Neil Young. It's a wonderful idea.

Start time: 1440.32
End time: 1469.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, the company has placed a playlist of Neil Young's music I hear right under the browse  section right under We Love Neil. So that's just blatant commercialism. That's just blatant. Like,  that's not saying we love vaccines. That's I swear. I mean, there's plenty of crazy stuff on  Apple's podcast directory. Don't you think there should be? I don't want Apple to decide what you

Start time: 1469.50
End time: 1485.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  can hear. Somebody else. Right. Exactly. So I think where there's a couple of factors here.  One is that it is the fact that Spotify owns it, as you said, Leo. And they don't again,

Start time: 1485.80
End time: 1502.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  they don't own it. They only own exclusive rights to distribute. Sorry, thank you. That's a big  distinction. It's not their show. They just have exclusive distribution. They signed a deal with  Joe saying, oh, no one else can carry it. It's a little closer relationship than them just listing

Start time: 1502.22
End time: 1573.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  it in their directory. So there is that piece. And then there's the fundamental issue of freedom,  right? Like, we all have a certain amount of freedom until that freedom infringes on somebody  else's freedom or affects somebody else in a negative way. And so that's written into all of  these principles, going back to some of the sort of foundations of the idea of democracy and  representative democracy and republics and freedoms and all of these things. And so this,  there was no problem with this until it started having a lot of negative effects on a lot of  people. And people are literally getting sick and dying because of some of the things that  Rogan is saying. And it would be one thing if what he was saying was true, but because there's also  an aspect of there's some creative facts in what he's doing, then he has a certain, from just a  societal standpoint, he has a certain responsibility that is sort of being misapplied and is hurting

Start time: 1581.98
End time: 1594.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it falls on Rogan's shoulders. Right? Well, I'm sure they're having some conversations along  those lines. Yeah, I mean, Spotify and Joe. Yeah. I mean, that's an interesting point to make.

Start time: 1595.24
End time: 1607.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I kind of want to defend Rogan's right to say whatever the hell stupid thing he wants to say.  I would hate to see the show pulled down for that reason. That's why I like a disclaimer.

Start time: 1608.95
End time: 1648.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  By the way, let's say, let's be clear. Even if it is pulled down, the freedom of speech part comes  in of like, it's not his right to be on Spotify. He can't shout fire in a crowded theater.  Yeah, he it's his right. So he can go and I'm sure if Spotify were to stop it, I'm sure he'd just  spin up his own site and potentially, you know, put it, offer it directly or offered it on another  platform, or he has a big enough audience that people would probably just go to joerogan.com  and watch the show every day or whatever. Let's not forget, Joe Rogan is a UFC commentator,

John Gruber pointed out that if Spotify were to kill their deal with Joe  Rogan, he'd be available on every podcast player and he'd in all likelihood, he'd have a larger  audience. He does now and therefore if you are not crazy about him spreading this message,  him being on Spotify exclusive is probably a good thing in terms of tamping it down at  least a tiny bit. That's a good point. Right. He wasn't hurting before the Spotify deal.

Transcript:  Well, here is a data point from the Verges hot pod, which covers this  medium. They talked to an ad buyer who also requested anonymity to speak freely about rates  that says Spotify upped prices for all of its acquired and licensed shows. A host read ad  on Joe Rogan's show used to cost the kind of ads we do tens of thousands of dollars prior to him  going exclusive to Spotify. Next year to get an ad on the, this year, I guess it would be now,  the Joe Rogan experience, the minimum spend $1 million CPMs of upward of $60. That's actually  not a super high CPM, but if he has 11 million listeners, that's why it's a million dollars.  Even if they paid him a hundred million, all it's going to take is a hundred ads  and they're back, baby. Less than a year's worth of advertising. He's worth a lot of money to  Spotify. And the other reason Spotify has been spending this kind of money is because the music  industry has kind of had a choke hold on them. They music industry is what is, who decides what  Spotify is going to pay artists, whether they're going to get the artists at all. Spotify was  looking for something they could own that would be out of the hands of the music industry and podcasts  were their next great hope. And apparently if they're charging a million dollars for an ad  on Rogan, that was a good thing to do. That's an amazing number.

And then Rogan gives them the strength, the power, and maybe some information to, to do that. You  know, well, you're, you know, if you're young, he says, if you're young, your immune system's good.  You shouldn't get the vaccine. You don't need to get the vaccine. And somebody who's leaning  that way anyway, that's just all they need to say. Yeah, that's, that's good. I don't want to,  I didn't want it anyway. I don't think he's convincing people. Yeah. Confirmation of existing  biases. That's, that's exactly right. Yes. Yeah. I just don't want to see, I don't want to see  censorship. And because I just put myself in that, what if all of a sudden all of these companies  said, we don't like people advocating masks and vaccines. We're going to keep you off the air,  Leo.

And, you know, it was some,  some of the young people we have on the show told me about the sweater. I think it was Christina  Warren. I can't remember the story, but anyway, it's good to have you and your sweater. Thank you.  We're a package.  Thank you for being here. Always great to see you. And of course, to the new editor, chief of CDNet,  big shot, Jason Hiner. Great, great to have all three of you. Our show today brought to you by,  I love this. I don't know if you've tried this. It's so cool. Imperfect Foods. This was a company  that was started on, I think a premise that I really like, which is that a lot of the US food  supply just gets thrown out or fed to animals because it doesn't fit our conception of a perfect  food. You know, an apple that's perfect in bread or a pomegranate the size of your head or,  you know, a carrot that doesn't look like Richard Nixon, but that's good food. Imperfect Foods was  started to eliminate all that food waste that's going on. I didn't know this 35%. More than a  third of the food supply in the US goes unsold or uneaten because grocers won't carry it because  it just doesn't look perfect. Well, you can help with Imperfect Foods. You'll reduce food waste.  You'll save your own time on grocery shopping and you'll eat more fresh and delicious food.  And it really, you know, they call it imperfect. Some of it, you know, I admit those little apples,  they're like the ones I used to get that fell off the apple tree. They're sweeter than the giant  apples. They have more flavor. Grocers don't want to carry them because they don't, you know,  they're not shelf perfect for 100 days or whatever. Imperfect Foods sources foods that would otherwise  fall through the cracks and brings it to you. It's a great way for you to do something, save money,  save driving. It's a grocery delivery service that offers not just fruits and vegetables,  but an entire line of sustainable groceries that taste delicious and reduce waste.  Stuff that the grocers couldn't sell, extras, that kind of thing. We get heritage chickens  from Imperfect Foods and I guess they're too small for the grocer wants giant breasts,  but they're the most flavorful. It's all we'll eat now. It's incredible. They're heritage delicious  chickens. I love Imperfect Foods. First thing to do is go and see if they deliver in your area  because I'm sad to say, even though I'm a big fan and they deliver here, they don't deliver everywhere.  So go to Imperfect Foods.com. Once you sign up, you can personalize. It's a weekly grocery order,  fresh seasonal produce, pantry staples, yummy snacks, saves us a lot of grocery shopping time.  You get your order on the same day every week, which is nice, makes it easy to plan ours is  Thursday. But one of the reasons they do that is to they deliver weekly by neighborhood to reduce  emissions. So their trucks produce 25 to 75% fewer emissions than individual trips. If you had to go  to the grocery store and Imperfect Foods customers on average save six to eight pounds of food  that would just be thrown out with every order. Plus say goodbye to packaging guilt. That's always  something I worry about with food delivery services. We used to get it from a grocery store,  everything had come in big plastic bags. No Imperfect Foods is the only national grocery  delivery company that makes it easy to return your package after every order. It's cardboard for the  most part, very, very little plastic. I really love Imperfect Foods. If you want to try it,  if I've convinced you and I'll look at the website, it'll probably give you some even more ideas.  Go to Imperfect Foods.com. We're going to get you 20% off your first four orders if you use  the promo code twit. Imperfect Foods.com promo code twit, 20% off your first four orders. That's  up to an $80 value at Imperfect Foods.com. Trust me, I think you're going to love it.  I'm so happy with it. Promo code twit, join the movement. Really love these guys.  Let's see. Let's move on to another topic. No more flock.  Google, I don't get Google. Anyway, they said, they announced publicly, no more third party  cookies. Then advertisers said, yeah, well, how are we supposed to target ads? So Google announced  the Federated Learning of Cohorts, which is the worst retronym ever. They have now announced that  no, that didn't work. So they've scrapped flock and now they're back with something called Topics.  Topics. The EFF, when flock was announced, flock was never released. I mean, it was in beta.  The idea of it was your browser would observe your habits and put you in a cohort. They never said  how big the cohorts were, how many cohorts there were, but essentially a cohort of types that when  you went to somebody's webpage, they could request your flock ID, which would, by the way,  change every few weeks based on your browser usage, and then they would know what kind of  ads to show you. So the idea was it's a more impersonal way of targeting ads. The EFF and  others said, well, we know how de-anonymizing works. It's probably not anonymous. They've found all  sorts of problems. Eventually Google just said, all right, fine. We're going to do Topics instead.  Again, you have to be using Chrome, although Chrome is about 63% of the world browser market.  I think it's even more in the United States. Chrome will watch what you do and group you into  a topic. One of the things about Topics Google likes is there aren't topics for sensitive topics  like mental health or drugs or whatever. Google can eliminate topics that it doesn't want advertising  based on guns, things like that. They think maybe it'll be more anonymous because it changes,  it rotates. I think the problem Google has is on the one hand, they hear people like us say,  privacy, privacy, privacy. On the other hand, they hear advertisers saying, but we want to know more  about people. Is Topics a good replacement for Flock, Denise? I like where they're going. It

Start time: 2348.42
End time: 2397.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  depends how much you trust Google when they say things like, I'm paraphrasing now, we're doing this  out in the open. Flock was a trial. We learned a lot from it. Here's a direct quote from Google's  privacy sandbox lead, Ben Galbraith. He says, Topics replaces our Flock proposal and I want  to emphasize that this whole process of sharing a proposal, doing a trial, gathering feedback,  and then iterating on the designs, this is the whole open development process that we wanted for  the sandbox and really shows the process working as intended. We meant to do this. We meant to do  this. Right. You can take that with a grain of salt, but if they're sincere, then  you know, that is how things should work. In their defense, they have been doing it in the open and

Start time: 2403.46
End time: 2447.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  that they have that you haven't mentioned yet that has advertisers up in arms is they're still  concerned about Google having all this data itself and that it being the gatekeeper for all things  targeted advertising. That's not making third parties happy who also want to be able to do  effective targeted advertising. But, you know, I mean, I do think that they're innovating in this  area and that I'd rather actually get an ad that was based on some sort of topical basis rather than,  you know, all the creepy other ways that ads are targeted at you.

Transcript:  And, you know, I've always said, Top, you want target, people should want targeted ads. It's  a waste of your time to see ads for things you don't care about. I don't need to see barbed  wire ads because I'm not a barbed wire buyer. Google is, I have to say, probably partly aware  of the fact that their dominance in advertising is slipping. Not only is Facebook a challenge,  but so is Amazon, so is Apple. All of a sudden, they're not the only place you can go to get  targeted ads. So I think they're very reluctant to stop doing some sort of targeting because  Facebook's sitting there going, we'll target all you want. Whatever, what do you want to know?

In fact, the bill that Amy Klobuchar and  Marsha Blackburn's bill to get companies to stop self-dealing, Google, Amazon, has now gotten out  of the Judiciary Committee and could be brought to the floor of the Senate anytime now. So, yeah,  Google's right to be a little bit worried about this. Harry, where do you fall on the privacy  spectrum here? Should targeted advertising exist at all? Yeah, I mean, like you say,

Start time: 2529.90
End time: 2612.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  there is some value in seeing ads that there's at least some chance they might be useful to you.  What's worrisome is just the degree to which at Google and advertisers and other companies  have gotten so unbelievably sophisticated at crawling through what you're doing online  and assembling a really detailed profile of you that you don't really know that, you know,  what it consists of, how long they're going to keep it. Flock seemed to be at least a little bit  of a move in the right direction and topics seem a little bit better just in terms of making it  possible to target you without doing such a deep dive into stuff about you in such a secretive way.  I do think a lot of this is completely outside of Google's control, though. It may be that one of  the reasons why Flock did not take off is because Google was so completely unsuccessful in getting  other browser companies to want to be involved with it. Not hugely surprising given that they  don't have quite as much invested in ad targeting as Google does and whether or not anybody else  will sign on for topics. I don't know. I haven't seen any news about whether the other browser  companies are enthusiastic about it, but if it's a Chrome-only thing, it seems like it's nowhere  near as powerful as if it does become a little bit of an industry standard.

Transcript:  don't sell ads and probably your office is way down the hall from the guy in charge of that,  but you know, a lot of the publications you've worked at forever are ad-supported, certainly  mine are. I am somewhat sympathetic to... I don't think we need to target quite as much as we have  been, but I understand why advertisers don't want to waste ad spend either. And ads are important

Start time: 2638.92
End time: 2672.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  to your business as they are mine. For sure. And I mean, for two decades, I've been working in  ad-supported media. So I wouldn't do that if I didn't think that there was some value that  users get from well-targeted ads. As you said, much better than sort of general things that many of  which they don't need. And so because of that, when you're seeing a lot of ads you don't need,  that typically means like a publisher is going to then show you a lot more ads to try to find one

Start time: 2673.42
End time: 2677.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that you like, right? Good point. One targeted ad as opposed to a hundred

Start time: 2678.32
End time: 2819.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  untargeted ads. That's a very good point. Yeah. That's right. So that's a good thing.  But I do fundamentally believe that the solution to this is not finding these like little ways  behind the scenes to try to, you know, engineer better systems. I know this is a traditional view,  but I feel like the best way to do it for a publisher is to create a relationship,  a deeper relationship with your audience, to give them something that makes the relationship  so that they want to log in, they want to be a subscriber. And when they're a subscriber,  they get a better experience and then they get more targeted ads because they are tacitly or  not tacitly, they're directly giving you information to say, I understand that you and  trust that you will give me a better targeted ad and a better experience by being logged in and  giving you my subscriber data. I think that's the core. Now, what happens instead is those  folks that are the most loyal, that are the most logged in, that are the most,  the ones that turn the most traffic and are the most engaged, we tend to take them for granted.  And so because of that, we don't give them that experience. And instead we say, oh, well,  we're going to try to find a way to monetize every user by, you know, doing cookies and that  kind of thing. So I believe that as an industry, you know, we dropped the ball on this a long time  ago, and that's why there was a user revolt against cookies and rightly so. So that and the  comeuppance has come on that. And now I do believe that the answer is not to find other sneaky ways  around this like digital fingerprinting and that kind of thing. But instead it's to actually  reengage with users and to give them an engaged experience where they'll want to give you more  data and grow trust. I think that's the only way forward. Things like this, like Flock and Topics  are helpful, but they're mostly helpful for the large group of users who are not logged in, who  you don't have a deeper relationship with, and who, you know, you're still trying to make a little

So in a way it's targeted,  all of everything we do is targeted. And so our advertisers kind of know what they're getting.

Start time: 2837.78
End time: 2899.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I'd love to push back on what Jason just said that that's got to be the way forward.  And I'm wondering if there's a way forward that could involve less data collection  from any of the users. And maybe this is just, you know, because I'm deeply  impacted by the fact that I've been involved with the Twitter network since, you know,  almost its inception. And this is the way you've always done ads, Leo. But I think it's so effective  to instead of having targeted ads, have curated ads that the ad you just read that imperfect foods,  I'm writing down the code. Oh, that's just a great idea. I'm totally going to sign up for that.  And I think there are a lot of people out there that, you know, would love for there to be a way  for them to receive ads, not just on podcasts, but in their browsing experience, that someone had  selected because they think this is a good product, good service, valuable, it's been vetted somehow,  you know, and it's not necessarily the thing that you're out there searching for. But it's the thing

Transcript:  you might need anyway. It's not going to work for everybody, though. I mean, if you're Coca-Cola  or Budweiser, you're not targeted. Right? You're brand advertising. So then you just buy,  you know, football games because you want the biggest numbers. So I guess that's okay. I mean,  we'll never get those advertisers. People hate I think part of this is people just hate ads.  That's part of the problem. And there's nothing we can do about that. If we're ad supported.  What we did is we started Club Twit so that people who really hate ads, you just buy  a membership and then never hear an ad again. That's one way to do it. I don't know. I've  Corey Doctorow calls ad blockers the largest consumer boycott of all time,  because so many people use them now and don't ever see ads or hear ads. And that's kind of

Start time: 2951.72
End time: 2976.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  part that makes it hard. Part of the reason for that is that not only are you receiving ads that  infringe on your privacy so that they can serve you a certain ad, but the whole experience is so  awful when you get six pop ups in a video and it's slowing down your browsing and, you know,  there's no incentive to allow them to keep invading your life.

And I actually haven't activated because when I listen to your shows, especially  like this show, maybe most of all, this version of your many shows, I want to hear the ad.  Because you actually have some good stuff on here. And I can't tell you how many times I've bought  whatever dang thing it is. You know, it's funny. You're not alone. There's actually people in club

So that's why I was, I was, you know,  I was grok in the feedback. You're going to like actually all four advertisers today. This is

Start time: 3105.90
End time: 3172.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  unusual. And this is by the way, one of the things has changed. It are what we call a B to C,  their consumer products. One of the things that's really changed, maybe it's because of COVID in our  business. I think it's also because publications like e-week and PC week are gone. And so it's hard  for enterprise businesses to reach other enterprises. Like if you're a security company,  selling security software, where you go, you write people, they're buying ads on CNN. Like that's the  audience you want. So we're doing more and more of that kind of B to B business to business  advertising, which I don't have the same affinity for. Because I'm not the business,  I'm not somebody buying it. But that's because we're targeted in the same way PC week and e-week  were targeted. That's how PC week and e-week were free. Because they knew they were reaching the  audience that those advertisers wanted. That seems to me a good model. I know it doesn't work for  everybody, but it seems to me a good model. Yeah, but you're not targeted in a creepy way,  which is nice. We're targeted because we know you like tech because you're listening to the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  away from that. And I'm not, here I am, I'm an old timer in podcasting, you know, the way it used  to be. But what's happening in podcasting now, partly because of Spotify, big part because of  Spotify, is no more host read ads. They're injected. It's direct ad insertion where it's  programmatically injected. And that's by the way, partly because podcasts can't track you.  But at least if you're downloading, when you, your ads are literally injected in when you download  the podcast, because then they know your IP address, they at least can geotarget you. And  if they have other information, they might know who you are. And so then those ads are much more  targeted than the ads when you buy a twit ad, you're buying, you know, anybody who listens to the  show. And that's the trend, which means, and this is why I hate ad targeting. It brings the whole  thing down. It makes advertising worse, not better. How so? Because instead of these human crafted ads  aimed at an audience that would be interested in the show, the ads that you say work, you're just  going to get an injected ad that was recorded by somebody else based on your IP address.  And I don't, well, maybe they are more effective. That's what everybody's buying now. But I think  it's not that they're more effective. It's that that's what happens when you start going down the  road of ad targeting. Advertisers think that's what they want. It's certainly easier for agencies to  sell. So that's how the advertising goes. And it's a vicious circle because then those ads are less  appealing. They're there. And so people block them or they don't like them as much.

The original Google advertising  approach was fantastic back when it was pretty much purely about you go to Google, you search  for something and you see text ads next to your search results relating to the terms you searched  for. That was in some ways the most perfect form of advertising ever invented. But what Google is  doing today is so much more complex and complicated and invasive than that ever was. And they're losing,

If you would have looked at the iPhone, if you searched iPhone,  and you went to the page on Google after that, you would have seen that to Harry's point,  almost two thirds of those units were one way or another different paid. Because it was the  carriers, it was accessory makers, it was everybody. And they had, essentially you saw what  Google looks like when every ad unit is bought. And the experience for the user was really  terrible. Also Apple had to buy ads on there essentially to get their stuff front and center.  Defensively.  Exactly. Defensively. And so in the past, like CNET, where I've worked for the last three years,  we've had a wonderful way to optimize and get the most useful information out to our readers  through Google. This year, it was very difficult, near impossible, because almost all of that  real estate, the usable real estate was purchased.

And now you have this  contentious environment where people hate ads, and they have to spy on you to do the ads,  and people hate that. And it's just gone down a very bad road. And I think Google made a mistake.  Maybe they didn't have any choice, but they made a mistake. This was not the right way to go.  And I, for one, no, I'm not going to say that. I pledge to you that we will continue to do host  red ads for down home products nobody ever heard of. So there.

Transcript:  There's a distinction that I'd like to toss into the discussion between the ads,  the advertising that we're talking about where people are buying ad placement by Google on a  webpage, and then the ads that platforms serve you, as Jason was saying, that Facebook has all  this data, that there is a distinctly different experience, or at least from my anecdotal use of  platforms. I am pretty ruthless about, you know, if they're going to serve me ads, I am going to  block advertisers that I don't want to hear from, and I'm going to use their tools to tell them,  okay, that's not relevant, not relevant, not relevant. And now I actually on both Twitter  and Instagram, I don't use Facebook proper, but on Twitter and Instagram,  I will say that my ad experience is not bad.

Transcript:  So it was a fabulous trip. Yeah. This morning I shaved with a razor blade. I bought an Instagram.  I'm wearing Instagram underwear right now. That might be TMI. By the way, if you, this is the,  this is another example. If you buy a razor on Instagram, you will then get razor blade ads from  every other rate. Cause there's a hundred razor blade companies for some reason. They're all trying  to sell you now. Well, if you like that, you'll love ours. No, thank you. I'm happy. I got the way  I got what I want. I'm not against advertising. I'm really not. It's what supports us is what  keeps us afloat. We did offer club Twitter, the people who hate advertising don't have to listen.  And that's worked out quite well, but not nearly to the degree that we could drop advertising.  And I'm what people who don't want to spend seven bucks a month to be able to hear our shows.  I don't want to pay wall. So, you know, I think it's worked out for us. I don't, I,  I worry about podcasting going forward in the long run. Hey, anyway, let's do an ad.  Can't wait. You know what? Get your pen out, Denise. You may already know about this,  but you're, if you don't, you're going to want to get it. It's called blue land. You know about  blue land? So there's a thread in, in, uh, what Lisa and I do these days. We're really trying to  cut down waste, single use plastic. We're trying to be kind to the earth. Blue land is so cool.  So it's a couple of facts that will set this up. Did you know that an estimated five billion  plastic hand soap and cleaning bottles are thrown away every year? Five billion.  And, and by the way, every bottle, you know, that you buy in the store, that's 90% water.  So you're paying to ship water plus a little bit of active ingredient and all that plastic.  Then you throw out the plastic. This does, this is not a tenable, uh, situation. It's a lose lose  for you and for the planet. That's why we started using blue land. Blue land's revolutionary refill  cleaning system. Instead you, you, when you set up blue land, I've done it now for myself,  but also my daughter, which she got a new apartment. I got, it's got her a whole blue land  thing. They'll send you the squirt bottles, the hand bottle, you know, the hand soap bottles,  the detergent, all the stuff, little tin cans. You could put your soap in for your dishwasher  and your clothes washer. And then when you need more, they send you the powdered form of it.  You add the water, you buy the bottle once you refill it forever. No more plastic waste and no  more shipping water. And it's great stuff. You just fill these beautiful Instagram. Well, yes,  bottles with warm water. You pop in. So for the hands up, we love the hand soap. In fact,  I just got a whole set of, uh, in December, a Christmas smell. There's a gingerbread,  there's peppermint. I love how you use this gingerbread hand soap. It smells like somebody's  making gingerbread men. You just, so you get it, you fill it with water to the line, you pop in the  tablet, it dissolves. And now it's hand soap, foamy hand soap or, or spray cleaner or bathroom  cleaner. Actually, you know what people love and it sold out a lot. I think there's some right now,  so you should get it. Blue lands, toilet, tablet cleaner. They sell out really fast. Uh, you put  one in the toilet, it fizzes, it cleans it, you brush it and you're done. It's incredible.  The sense amazing. Iris agave, parrine lemon, lavender eucalyptus. Uh, that you, I just want  you to go to blue land.com slash twit, uh, and check this out. There's, uh, I got my daughter,  the clean essentials kit to get her all started. There's a hand soap duo. We actually have in every  bathroom now. Uh, we have blue land, hand soap, different, different sense. It's wonderful. Uh,  plastic free laundry and dishwasher tablets that are great. They work. That's the other thing. I  think maybe you thought, oh, you've tried other, you know, recyclable or earth friendly products.  They don't work. So these work great. These are just like the commercial products you'd buy,  but without all the waste and without all the cost blue lands, stunning, high quality forever bottles  started just $10. When you buy a kit, they will be reused forever. The refill tablets,  which is what you're going to continue to buy two bucks, two bucks. So you save a huge amount of  money. You save plant the planet by not using all this plastic waste. Uh, I use it. The dish soap is  great blue land. Try it. You will love it. The planet will thank you. I had heard about this  for years. We finally got it and now I'm thrilled. It's way past time to make cleaning fun, beautiful  and plastic free. Right now you get 20% off your first order. Go to blue land.com slash twit,  B L U E the color blue blue land.com slash twit 20% off your first order of any blue land products.  And it is a great house warming gift. I gave Abby the whole set and she loves it. Everything smells  great. It's easy to clean and you don't waste those bottles. Yeah. Blue land.com slash twit.  Don't forget to, I can't come on this show anymore. You're going to, you know what? You will thank me.  This is not expensive. You will thank me because this is going to, this is the future. I'm telling  you, this is I, I no more guilt over. We, you know, we used to go through plastic bottles of dish soap,  you know, every week there'd be a new, not anymore. Not anymore. It's great. Nice. Um,  Nvidia is going to abandon their $40, 40 million, 40 billion. Let's get the number right. Dollar  arm bid. I don't know if I'm sad or happy arm is currently owned by soft bank.  I feel like Nvidia might've been a good partner. On the other hand, there were a lot of people  worried that Nvidia might, you know, kind of take over arm and make it hard for others to license arm  stuff. I doubt that would have happened, but I understand anyway, regulators are going to  put the kibosh on that both here and in Europe. Soft bank at this point says we don't want it.

Transcript:  Jason, any opinion? You know, I don't think that this changes much. I think that Nvidia still has  a great future. They're, they are going to be at the heart of what is this massive wave of  artificial intelligence and machine learning that, that really over the next decade is going to  revolutionize so many things. They're, they're going to do just fine without this arm is also,  they're going to be great. Like they, they have, they have a great future as well, doing what they  do, designing chips, their chips are taking over the world. And you know, the wild thing is with  what Intel's doing, becoming a chip maker for other, for other people, it's very possible that  Intel is going to probably be making arm chips, right? Manufacturing arm design, you know, designs  that are, that are from arm for other, for other companies. And so it's a future that I could see  them as an independent company still doing really well. And they have a great future. I think  probably both companies, I think arm has a better future potentially independently because the future,  you know, they have so much runway to their, their chips are going to be in everything over  the next decade, more things. And under arm, it was going to be a little bit limited to, or sorry,  under Nvidia arm would have been a little bit, a little bit limited, but I don't think it really  changes much. Both these companies have a great future. Yeah, I'm very bullish on Nvidia. Here's

Nvidia is worth $582 billion.  Second only to TSMC, which is easily the biggest chip maker by market cap. Intel's not that big.

Transcript:  It's smaller than Broadcom, smaller than Samsung. They missed the whole mobile wave. They blew it.  Yeah. Look at all four of these. The bigger ones are all mobile chips. Yeah. It was funny. I found  some notes from an old Intel used to always have in San Francisco and Moscone West. They used to  always have this event Intel IDF, the Intel Developer Forum. And I found these old notes from  2007 where Intel had all these charts about the next great wave is in mobile. And we're changing  the whole company to take advantage of where all of this is going and we're going to be ready for  it. And here's our roadmap. I mean, they knew it was coming and they just couldn't execute against  it. They just weren't, you know, their mindset wasn't quite what it needed to be to take  advantage of it. And boy, did it hurt. Ben Thompson's done a great series on his

Start time: 4246.80
End time: 4306.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dritekary website and newsletter about Intel. I think his take is pretty astute. All along,  he said Intel's mistake was doubling down on the idea of an integrated company where they both  designed and manufactured chips and they got beat by the companies that did one or the other,  that by Nvidia or ARM, which were design firms or TSMC, which is a build firm and both TSMC,  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Nvidia have gotten bigger than Intel  by picking one. And Intel, because their fabs couldn't keep up with their designs,  was held back and really didn't make competitive designs and did, as you say, they missed out  entirely on mobile. Their scale architecture was a flop. And so what is interesting is that  Pat Gelsinger, the new CEO of Intel, who is a chip designer, he was instrumental in the 486.

Start time: 4313.38
End time: 4347.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  lead architect on that. Yeah. And so now he's running the company and he's done something,  I think, that is a big gamble. But I think at this point, maybe that's what you need to do.  He's decided to, in effect, do both, but not integrated. To build fabs, they're  build big fabs in, what, they're building a big one in Arizona, I think.  In Ohio. Ohio. He's did a deal in Ohio. That's right. And then also-  $20 billion. Yeah, 20 bill. But also then to double down on the design business. Harry,

Start time: 4347.08
End time: 4435.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  is this a good strategy? I think it seems like he's doing smart things with the cards that were  dealt him when he signed up as CEO, along with being willing to make chips based on other  architectures. They're also opening up the x86 architecture. So instead of a chip that Intel,  based on Intel technology, being what Intel thinks it should be, someone else could build on top of  Intel's designs and tweak it, which is a lot closer to what ARM has always done, where other  companies license the rights to ARM's cores and build on top of them. It sounds, I mean, this is,  assuming this Nvidia ARM deal doesn't happen, it's really good news for Intel. It sounds like in  general, the tech industry would just as much be relieved if the deal doesn't happen. I think it's  probably overall Nvidia will be fine. I think Nvidia is such a smart company. There's a decent  chance they would have not have screwed up ARM. But I think there has been value to the fact that  ARM has always essentially been Switzerland, this third party that designs stuff that any technology  company can license and use. And that would have fundamentally changed if Nvidia, which has always  been an ARM customer up until now for its designs, had also owned ARM. I'd say on balance,  I'm glad if it doesn't happen, although it might have been okay if it had.

Transcript:  Of course, at this point, the best known ARM licensee is Apple with its M1 architecture.  And I have to think Intel is somewhat stung by the performance and the power curve of Apple's M1s,  especially since they keep saying, oh, we've got chips that are faster.  No, no, they want them back. Sorry, go ahead.  Yeah, they want to make them. They want to make chips in the fabs for Apple. But, you know,  right now, TSMC is doing a three nanometer process. Good luck Intel.

Start time: 4466.30
End time: 4508.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there's been this really healthy competition among all these companies that license ARM's  designs and you have Apple taking some of the same IP and running away from Qualcomm, which  ultimately is a good thing for Qualcomm because they have to keep up. Competition is good for us  all. That's right. Yeah, that's right. And they're building things they might not have been able to.  Otherwise, sorry, go ahead, Denise. Oh, no, you finish.  I'd say that all these companies are doing things they might not have been able to if they were  100% responsible for designing processors from scratch. So it's worked out really surprisingly  well. ARM always had this vision back to when they were founded decades ago, and it really came  into its own just in this century. Go ahead, Denise.

Transcript:  I had a couple of just government related observations on this story. Number one, it's  just, you know, another sign that antitrust is on regulators minds. The FTC sued to stop this merger.  China wants to stop it too. So and I'm sure, you know, if EU regulators had any say in the  matter, they would want to stop it too. It just seems like there's a lot of...

Start time: 4534.56

Start time: 4538.34
End time: 4638.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  being bought by Nvidia. Yeah. Yeah. So there's just, you know,  antitrust is a bigger force in the world than it has been in the last several years.  Is that good, do you think?  Yes. Qualified yes. Like, I do feel like the flood of antitrust proposed legislation that came out  earlier this year, some was good, some was bad, some was ugly. So I do think that we have to be  aware of antitrust overreach. But at the same time, there's a reason why it's much more on  lawmakers minds. So I think this is just, you know, another symptom of that.  The other government observation I would make is, you know, I'm not worried about ARM or Nvidia,  if this doesn't go through as both Harry and Jason have said, ARM is poised. I'm not quite  sure how all this is shaking out. But it seems like as a chip manufacturer, they're going to  get a shot in the arm from the government, if they haven't already to bring some chip production,  more chip production to the US and deal with these supply chain issues that we're having.  So I think they're probably excited about that. And then on the personal front, one of my good  family friends, the smartest AI guy I know is the worldwide AI initiatives VP at Nvidia and the  chair of their AI compute task force. And he's his name is Keith Stryer. And, you know, he's going

Start time: 4639.10

Transcript:  to take them to good places. When we watched we streamed the Nvidia's most recent keynote,  I was just blown away, you know, because of the Xamable salmon in our car segments,  I'm very aware of what a video is doing in automotive. It's obvious they're killing it  in gaming, in in crypto mining, they're just firing in all cylinders, they have they are in the AI.  They're huge. In fact, this new meta supercomputer they just built is built with  Nvidia and Nvidia chips. They are firing in all cylinders. I think they're a really interesting  company. And so I guess, yeah, for that reason, I don't they don't need arm and arm will if it  does an IPO, which I think is likely arm will then be a standalone company as it should be.  And I think that's probably the best for everybody all around. But this competition is really good.  I love seeing a strong Nvidia. You know what we didn't haven't mentioned in all this is AMD,  which has been making great. Yeah, they've been making a run for it. Yeah,

Start time: 4702.52
End time: 4828.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  yeah, they're doing great. And you know, Intel as well, if we circle back to Intel, we all we all  are going to be better from a renewed Intel. Absolutely. Gelsinger is, is a chip makers,  you know, chip maker. He knows the industry. He's an excellent leader and CEO,  includes lots of people knows how to put the right people in the right positions.  He'll do great in Intel. But the best thing that he has going from the one thing you can never  control in business is timing. And he has timing on his side right now, because one thing that  we've learned over the last two years, the last 24 months, especially, is that having all of the  chip making in East Asia, and having all of those things, there is not a good, is not a good thing.  And so the world is is going to kind of want to put that chip making in lots more places in closer  to where the product design development final manufacturing is. And that is going to benefit  a lot of people, but it's definitely going to benefit in cell, especially if the chips acts  passed in the US, where then building chips in the US becomes as advantageous in terms of taxes  and business investment as it is in Asia, then you're not going to only see Intel building here,  you're going to see as TSMC is already there, they're planning to plant here. Samsung is  planning a plant in Texas, you're going to see this movement to decentralize the making of these  chips. Intel has a great, they have a level playing field potentially, and some opportunities  to really go into this in a way where they can design where they're behind on, as we know from  the nanometer side of things perspective, but also in terms of chip making, they can start building,  they know how to build and manufacture things. And so that's going to be an opportunity for them to

I worry a little bit because of course everybody talks when they talk about chip shortage  about Intel, AMD, Nvidia, the real chip shortage is not those chips, it's all these little legacy  cheapo chips that are almost commodities. But if you can't, if who was it, General Motors had to sell  a bunch of cars without seat warmers because the chip that controls the seat warmers is unavailable.  If you can't sell cars because that's missing, that's just as big a deal. And I doubt very much  people are investing $30 billion to build the chips for seat warmers. I don't know who's doing  that, but let's bring that home too. That could be the $10 million fact. Let's bring that home too.

Although they did just lose one of the guys who designed the M1 chip  went back to Intel, they'd hired him away from Intel, Jeff Wilcox is going back to Intel  to design systems on a chip. So it's a quite a revolving door in that business, I think.  Let's take a little break. We actually this was the week Apple had its quarterly results,  Microsoft too, we can talk a little bit about. I don't think financial results have that much  to do with technology as they do, at least not as much as they do with the market. But still,  this you get some insights into how these companies are doing and what they're doing from their  financial reports. Our show today brought to you by audible. And here's another one,  where it's an easy recommend. I have literally been an audible member 22 years. It all started  for me when I was commuting to San Francisco at a two to four hour commute every day. I was going  crazy discovered audio books from audible. And my life was changed. I've listened to so I've more  than 500 audio books I've listened to on audible. I just love them. audible app makes it easy to  listen anytime, anywhere you'll discover exclusive audible originals from big name celebrities.  Steve Martin reading born standing up was just awesome. Keith Richards reading his biography,  actually, they have Johnny Depp reading it for the first three quarters as if he's Keith Richards.  And then three quarters the way through the biography, he suddenly says, and now ladies and  gentlemen, Keith Richards, Keith reads the last quarter of it, which I loved. You can listen to  audible while you're traveling commuting like me while you're working out washing the dishes,  walking the dog. By the way, audible also includes thousands of podcasts, some of the most popular  favorites exclusive new series. And as a member at audible, you get full access to a growing  selection of included audio books. Just part of your subscription you can download or stream all  you want. I was watching that new HBO show, the Gilded Age. And it's okay, but it made me crave  some Edith Wharton. You know, I wanted to real the real deal, the author of the age of innocence.  So I thought I'm going to get the house of mirth. And I looked in audible had I am not kidding,  a dozen different versions of the house of mirth, but it turned out the best one I got for free is  because it's an audible plus title. Yeah, I'm glad I checked. So that is a really nice thing.  I cannot wait to listen to the house of mirth. They've got a great actress reading that you'll  get a full selection of audio books as a member audible gives members a chance to listen to  and discover new favorites and explore different formats. And that's one of the things that makes  your membership so much more valuable. For instance, if you are like me a fan of music,  the words plus music series is fantastic how albums were made, what happened, you know,  the story behind the album or maybe a podcast you never heard of or considered before. They  even have theatrical performances. I love those Neil Gaiman's Sandman series part two just came  out fully dramatized. It's the best radio theater you've ever heard. It's incredible.  And as an audible member, you can choose one title a month to keep from their entire catalog.  That's how I got 500 in my library. And they're in your library forever, by the way,  I often go back and listen. When the movie Dune came out, I said I want to listen to Dune again.  It was great. That one's dramatized as a matter of fact, best sellers, new releases, classics,  audible love science fiction. I know you and we all love science fiction. Audible is a great  place for sci fi because so much of the early sci fi things like foundation and Dune weren't  recorded originally audible actually set up studios to create the audible frontier series,  which is finally audio book versions of some of the most iconic science fiction novels.

Transcript:  problem is I have so many audio books. I don't have as much time as I used to cause I don't have  that four hour commute anymore. I wish I could listen more often, but what I've discovered is  there's the house of mirth. I'm now starting at the expanse series. They've got all of them,  really nice production of that. Lots of great stuff. One of the things I've done is,  is I started listening when I'm playing video games because I always feel guilty that I'm  playing a game and not doing anything important. And so I figured, well, at least I'm reading and  playing a video game. So that's, that's how I feel better about myself. Last one Lisa and I listened  to together was Hawaii. Boy, is that a long novel? I think that was, what is it? 40 hours.  Mishner. 51 hours and 56 minutes. Make it 52 hours. Yeah. That's a lot of Hawaii.  Anyway, audible. We love them. We love you audible. Thank you for being with us all these years.  audible.com slash Twitter, go text, tweet to 500 500.

And we want them to  know that y'all listen and subscribe because of us. Thank you. It's almost a cliche. Apple had the  best quarter it's ever had again. Over and all revenue up 11%. Earnings per share up 25% year over  year. iPhone revenue up 9% year over year. It's kind of amazing. You could make more, you could  sell more iPhones, but I guess they found somebody who hasn't bought one yet. Big victory on services.  You may remember when Apple said, we're going to be a services company. We're not going to give you  numbers of sales anymore. We're going to talk talk about revenue per user and the best way to  up revenue per user is to sell them stuff services after the sale. 19.52 billion.  That's 24% up year over year. Mac revenue up 25%. iPad revenue up 14%. Gross margin.  This is the number that always makes me go, oh my God, 43.8%. That's a lot of margin.

Transcript:  And nobody knows how to sandbag expectations like Apple. And then that's why you said Leo,  it's like, again, they exceed expectations. Somehow they always find a way to hold expectations in  line. That said, no one, I remember a bunch of the analysts saying who they always take this  into account, right? They're like, there's the Apple number and then there's the number one.

Start time: 5601.44
End time: 5613.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But nobody expected it to go. It was just, I think it was just last year that they started  breaking a hundred billion and now, you know, 123, you know, everybody was just like, where did this

Transcript:  And this was despite the supply chain issues and the fact that a lot of the hardware you couldn't  really get. There was long lead times to get things like an iPhone. I think they might have  done if they could have fulfilled every iPhone order immediately. So forgive me because I don't

Transcript:  want to be the cheese in your gruel or the, I don't know what the phrase is. Can we make that  the show? But they aren't exactly, I mean, are they that much better than everybody else? The  greatest company of all three trillion dollars. Are they that much better or are they that much

Start time: 5662.96
End time: 5685.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  better at marketing? I guess you actually, you touched on it in the beginning. I think Leo. So  look at, if you look at the U S and China, they're two biggest, most important markets and the iPhone  being their most important phone in China for the first time in six years, they, they shot to number  one again, the number one phone, which nobody expected them to know. Remember that Huawei

Start time: 5686.04
End time: 5703.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  suddenly shot to the top last year or the year before when we blocked them, when we banned them,  when we forbid U S companies for dealing with Huawei out of, it was assumed patriotism. The  Chinese people said we're buying Huawei. That didn't last that long. It didn't. And then in the

Start time: 5703.14
End time: 5789.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  U S they're up to, I want to say it's 47 or 49% of the, of the U S they are growing margin,  smartphone margin in the U S they're growing it in China. They're two biggest markets.  So why, why is that? Cause just to your point, are they making a device that's that much better?  I think we all think the answer is no, the devices are good. They're, they're, they're excellent.  But Samsung's excellent. You know, OnePlus is excellent. A lot of these are making really good  devices. What appears to be their, their fa the factor that's driving them forward is this  integration, both with services and the other devices as people are buying more Apple devices,  you know, that the, the, you mentioned the Mac is up the iPad and the iPad was the one that got hit  by the most by the supply chain. And, and Tim Cook called it out, but iPads have had a big resurgence  during the pandemic, more people at home and people on different screens, not wanting to watch the  same things or do all kinds of other things. And then the services that people have really  responded, especially to Apple one and the bundle, not just their bundle, but a lot of other bundles  too. So services and the other devices seem to be what's carrying Apple and giving them a leg up.  Cause it's not just the hardware itself. It's not the whole ecosystem.

Start time: 5791.06
End time: 5844.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and it's, it's the ecosystem in a kind of under duress. So for instance,  Apple just released a beta of a Mac OS 11 Monterey that features this new universal control.  And of course, what is universal control required that you own a lot of Apple stuff.  You can now move your mouse and your keyboard from a Mac to an iPad and back and forth. So  it's got a multi-screen experience. It's not even a new idea. There've been products that do this  for a long time. But Apple now has built into the operating system, or if you have an iPhone  and you don't want to use face ID, cause you're wearing a mask. Well, it so happens if you have  an Apple watch, it'll unlock your iPhone. They're very good at the ecosystem play.  I don't.

Start time: 5846.40
End time: 5888.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're very good too. And this goes back to Steve Jobs. And we've all been around a long time and  remember, you know, the early days and how important it was to his company to deliver  the killer, absolutely insanely great user experience. And I feel like the company has  really kept that as a value. Because when you, I'll just use my own personal experience.  I had an iMac that lasted me 12 years that I just replaced. It's quality. It lasted 12 years. My new  one, I couldn't be more thrilled with it. It is just a beautiful, fast, screaming, wonderful.

Transcript:  You just reviewed the Dell XPS and I think they're very nice,  but they don't have that same feel of quality. You know what I'm saying?

Start time: 5897.56
End time: 5916.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The XPS, I have to say is pretty hard. Nice. It's very nice.  But Dell is a computer company. They don't make phones. They have way less control over the  software. You're not going to fill your entire life with all kinds of Dell products. They're  dependent on Microsoft for their operating system. And there is just something about,

Start time: 5916.88
End time: 5926.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and by the way, part of the reason Dell's XPS is so nice is because they're copying Apple in a  number of ways. There's something about a MacBook. You're exactly right, Denise.

Start time: 5927.38
End time: 5954.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It feels like a quality product. And on the services end, they don't drop the ball at all.  In fact, they deliver in ways other companies need to look at and take notes. They don't Google it?  No. First of all, to me, of course, and I think to a lot of people,  the fact that they've taken a good stand on privacy and data is important.  And it matters to people even in the background as they're using their devices.

Start time: 5954.26
End time: 5955.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I think it is important. I agree.

Start time: 5956.22
End time: 5967.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Secondly, though, just as far as like your day-to-day use of the device, someone,  three weeks after I bought my new iMac, someone knocked it over. They're kind of, you know,  they're not super solid, right?

Start time: 5967.22
End time: 5969.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, they're basically iPads on a stick, but go ahead.

Start time: 5969.96
End time: 6034.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. They're iPads on a stick. So someone knocked over my three-week-old iPad on a stick  and broke the screen just like you would break the screen on your phone.  But it works to replace it just like it would work to replace the screen on your phone.  I have AppleCare. It costs $99 and I have a new screen and I'm back in business.  And it took a week. So that was just, you know, another just incredible experience.  And the other really great way I think they responded under fire was during the pandemic  when they had to shut down all their stores. They managed to just up their phone service  and ability to respond by phone and mail in a way that was just amazing.  Need to buy a new phone? Great. Don't go into the store, call them up.  We'll deliver it right to you. Problem with your existing phone? No worries.  We'll ship you a box, ship it back to us. We'll fix it or replace it. You're good to go.  That, you know, lots of companies need to be taking notes about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've been there, you know. I've been there with other companies too.  And Ben, just, you know, you roll your eyes and you go,  okay, it's just poor customer service. We just have to get used to that.  And I've never had that with Apple.

Start time: 6052.56
End time: 6080.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you're saying, you know, things like Apple is doing universal control and  Microsoft and Google are working together to integrate Windows with Android,  which is actually pretty cool if you have a Windows laptop and an Android phone,  but they're never going to be able to make anything as seamless as what Apple can do  because they are two separate operating systems controlled by different companies.  Apple really... It's like the universal copy and paste feature.

Start time: 6080.30
End time: 6097.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was just going to say like that. It really blows my mind how you can just copy something  on your computer or your iPad and send it to your phone.  Oh, when I want to embed an attachment on my Mac in email,

Start time: 6098.12
End time: 6109.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it says, you want to take a picture with your phone, we'll just put it in.  And it's like, that's hard for Dell to do. That's hard for anybody else to do.  Dell put a touch bar on that XPS though, right?  They did.

Start time: 6110.84
End time: 6115.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kind of. Kind of sort of. I mean, the buttons don't jump around.  They're fixed in one place.

Start time: 6115.20
End time: 6122.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like Dell is two years behind Apple. Apple has finally said,  oh God, let's get rid of that touch bar. And Dell hasn't got the memo yet.

Start time: 6124.22
End time: 6178.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, in all fairness, I think it is really radically different from what Apple did.  I mean, it's way less ambitious. Whether it's better or not, I'm not sure.  They also, when I talked to them, they talked about the fact that doing that also helped them  make the system cooler, the internals cooler, removing that row of buttons.  That's interesting.  They've also done some things that Apple, for better or worse,  they're doing things that Apple hasn't done, like the trackpad on the new XPS.  There's no border around it at all. It's just the middle section of the wrist area.  So it is quite different. And also, Dell kind of came up with the idea several years ago  with the XPS of shrinking the borders of the screen down as much as possible.  And Apple only got around to doing that last year.  And that might be a case where Dell actually influenced Apple  rather than the other way around.

Start time: 6178.98
End time: 6184.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, Dell's taken a while to get rid of the bezel.  Apple, rather, has taken a while to get rid of the bezel.

Start time: 6185.43

Start time: 6195.33
End time: 6200.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 6202.74
End time: 6255.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I do wonder if we shouldn't. And I think Denise mentioned this,  we shouldn't underestimate the privacy and security part either, because it is getting  worse and more challenging and more difficult, especially on privacy.  And Apple, this was somewhat, again, this is timing and maybe a little bit of luck,  that Apple wanted to get into advertising. They wanted to do that.  And they tried it. And they realized pretty quickly, we're just terrible at this.  This is not a strength and we don't want to invest to do it.  So instead, let's go in the opposite direction and say, we're going to be the company that's  not going to take your data and use it and try to advertise against you.  We're going to be the ones that say, we're going to push it back against all of that.  And we're going to make that a feature of our product and try to turn a weakness into a strength.

Start time: 6277.78
End time: 6354.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But they don't. But they also, it's Safari shutting and Apple shutting down a lot of  this data stuff that's moved this stuff forward more quickly. Because once it breaks on Apple  devices, then a bunch of companies, lots of companies, and with how more and more of the  web is mobile, they knew that the gig was up and that was critical.  And then with the things like they're doing with video doorbells and other video cameras  where the stuff is not sent to the cloud, but is used in or is used in these secure enclave-like  ways, is also another thing that is an example of them. They wouldn't do this  if they weren't focused on this idea that we're going to turn security and privacy into a feature.  Now there's certainly some marketing in it, as you're pointing out, Leo. I don't think they're  not hiring a lot of PhDs in cryptography to try to make sure that all of their stuff is perfect.  But they aren't doing the opposite of signing deals with Facebook and everybody else and trying

Start time: 6354.90
End time: 6371.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to sell their users' data. It's interesting, and Harry, I think you've  written a little bit about this, that Google is trying to get back into Android tablets  after essentially ceding the tablet market to Samsung and to some degree to Apple.  Google has for some reason decided that they want to do tablets again.

Start time: 6373.40
End time: 6431.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Harry Jaffee, who writes for Fast Company, but he also writes for Computer World. He had a great  story on the history, the long and sad history of Android tablets, which involves essentially  Google not investing enough to make it into a true competitor to the iPad, and therefore they're  never being terribly satisfying. Even when they acquired an interesting company called Bumptop,  they didn't do much with it. It does feel a little bit like Samsung in the last few years has done  way more of the heavy lifting than Google has to try to make decent Android tablets.  But even though Samsung actually has done some of the software layers on their own tablets,  there's a limit to what they can do since it's not their operating system.  JR did break the news that Google has hired somebody to be in charge of Android tablets,  and maybe that's a hopeful sign. Yeah, he found a job listing and everything.

As a matter of  fact, the best Zoom device in our household is a 13-inch 2020 iPad Pro because it has like five  microphones and it has this great noise cancellation and it has really loud sound. So you can be  in a room and put that almost anywhere and have a really good Zoom call.

Transcript:  It seems like they spent the last few years way more interested in Chromebooks and they've made  Chromebooks that are essentially convertible tablets and which run Android apps and that seems  like it's where their heart is. But there are all these developers out there who have never invested  huge amount of attention in developing great Android tablet apps because there weren't great  tablets for the most part to run them. And so it's not just Google, they would have to do a lot of  catch-up. The hardware manufacturers would have to do it too and developers would have to be  interested in a way that they have logically enough not been interested for a long time.

Transcript:  It's Google committee, an extremely frustrating company. I really want them to do well and  they seem to be very short attention span. Because I mean there should be competition for the iPad.  Apple shouldn't dominate that space. I mean Samsung's making some nice tablets.  You know what the problem is? They are and that's what JR's point is that Samsung's done all the  heavy lifting so far. But you can't fully blame Google because it's also the lack of tablet apps.  When Google put out tablets, the app makers didn't respond by making apps. Maybe it was  too hard to do with Android, I don't know, but didn't respond by making apps that adapted well

Transcript:  quite a while. In fact, I think you get it whether you want it or not. That's the joke of it all.  Yeah. We've talked about that last week. The big acquisition of Activision, Microsoft's biggest  acquisition to date. New York Times, Sunday Times Today article about the FBI and Pegasus.  So it turns out, we've been talking a lot about NSO Group's Pegasus, which was a zero click  software that allowed a lot of authoritarian regimes to hack activists and journalists,  friends of Jamal Khashoggi hacked by the Saudi Arabians before he was murdered.  Well, first time ever, we've heard this story. The FBI secretly bought Israeli spyware and explored  hacking US phones with Pegasus. This was back in 2017. Interestingly, it was right after they  first got it that we started to see all the news stories about Khashoggi and Pegasus being used  for less positive things against dissidents in the United Arab Emirates and against women's  right activists in Saudi Arabia. CIA bought Pegasus, we've known this, to help in Djibouti,  an American ally. They were fighting terrorism in the UAE. Pegasus was used to hack the phone of a  critic of the government. The FBI decided, maybe we got to back off a little bit on this and  fortunately decided not to buy it. But it's been interesting because remember, the president decided  to sanction the NSO group just a few months ago. So now we know that the FBI bought and tested NSO  software for years. Their plans were to use it for domestic surveillance. They bought a bunch of  burner phones. By the way, the Pegasus equipment is still in a New Jersey building used by the FBI.  So, I don't know.

From the article, it's an independent solution that requires no cooperation from AT&T,  Verizon, Apple or Google. The system, it says, this is from a brochure that was  presented to the FBI.  It turns on, you can use it to, it's zero click. That's what you're talking about, which means you

And among other things, you can turn on the microphone, the camera, you can see all the  emails, you can see all the text messages, you can see everything that's going on. It turns the  phone into this most amazing spy device. NSO Group says that actually they have a switch in  Pegasus that means it can't be used on U.S. phone numbers. But the company also gave the agency a  demonstration of Phantom, another product which can hack American phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And by the way, unlike the twit stuff, like half of the stuff I've got on Instagram, I was disappointed with.  That's actually one of the reasons I stopped one buying stuff.  Okay, can I tell you one thing not to buy on Instagram?  Yeah.

Start time: 7192.04
End time: 7285.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can't believe I bought this.  Underwear? No.  The underwear has been fine.  The underwear has been fine.  Although when I got it, it said do not wash in the washing machine.  Which made me think that's not really useful when it comes to underwear.  So I have been anyway and it hasn't fallen apart.  So I don't know how people with shoulders sleep.  Because unless you sleep on your back, which I cannot do, the shoulder seems to impinge on your sleeping.  And it's not comfortable.  So there's an ad, which I don't know if you've seen it.  I saw it for a long time.  You must know I got a problem.  For this pillow that you put your arm in.  It's called MedCline.  It holds you up and your arms in.  And then your shoulder will be comfortable.  I don't know why I bought this thing.  It must have been in the middle of the night.  Does it work?  Well, I guess, yeah.  You've been sleeping on a wedge.  With your arm in a hole.  It doesn't sound good.  The problem is now, and it comes with this giant worm of a body pillow.  And it was expensive.  I don't know what I was thinking.  I swear to God it was the middle of the night.  That's the problem with Instagram.  It's 4 a.m. you're scrolling, doom scrolling.  And then you buy whatever it is.  Because you're completely at their mercy.  Anyway, if anybody wants this thing.  It's occupying a lot of space in my bedroom.

Which was one of the smartest things I did.  But the but is that one of the things that gets underestimated about Facebook.  Is their technical prowess.  They, from a technical standpoint.  Absolutely.  Are genius.  And the interesting thing is they figured out a lot.  They were the ones that figured out how to scale the database to web scale.  It blows me away.

Research super cluster phase one.  If you're worried about Skynet, forget Google.  This is the net.  This is Skynet.  Yeah.  175 petabytes of bulk storage.  46 petabytes of cache, of cache storage.  10 petabytes NFS storage.  It's got 6080 Nvidia A100 GPUs.  6000 of them.

Start time: 7511.94
End time: 7544.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No.  Agreed.  I do worry about them because I think they're probably the most amoral company in the tech  industry.  They really only care about winning, you know, from the top down.  And they've shown that through their actions over and over again.  Not that there's a, there is a lack, there is an ethics problem in Silicon Valley in  general, but they are the ones that care the least.  They will, they will do whatever it takes to win and then pay the fines that they have  to, to the government afterwards when they get sued, you know, because of Don.

I have to think it's a little bit more than that we're talking about here.  A little bit more than that.  Yeah, I wouldn't be, I mean, if you're Mark, you've got basically infinite resources.

So if you're going to get drunk at the Winter Olympics, this robot will be happy to serve  you.  A minute and a half for a drink is way too long.  Way too long.  I think we can say we've covered the waterfront.  Is there anything I missed?  The big stories that you guys, you are all covering this all the time.  Anything I missed?

So the 14 transformative technologies to watch this year.  That's the version from Vala Afshar on ZDNet writing about it.  They released all of their research for free.  Unlike some of the agencies out there, they essentially kind of open source their research,  which is pretty cool.  But this is a great read on where a lot of these things are from Web3 to autonomous vehicles  to AI to genomics and blockchain.  They do some really different kind of research on these things and have a very great perspective  on a lot of it.  And so I think that for this audience, there's a lot of people that will appreciate.

Blockchain today is 1.4 trillion.  In 2030, it's 50 trillion.  So a lot of these you'd expect battery technology is 1.5 trillion.  They see that as 32 trillion.  Today, can we talk about fusion at all?  About the fusion reactor on the Fluss Compact Center?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

No, I'm talking about fusion energy because I feel like if there's anything that's going to save society,  it's coming up with cold fusion.  And I know a lot of investors are throwing money into this.  And I wonder, is it scientifically even feasible or is this money thrown away?  This did not come up in here.

End time: 7852.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But you're right, though, that the energy for this century, you know, energy is the big one, right?  Because more and more of what we do is going to require energy.  We know the fossil fuel story.  So energy is going to be a huge story for, you know, that's more of like a 25th between now and 2050 story than 2030.  But I think you're on the right track.

But, you know, put all that aside, that's not related to this research so much, right?  This research is really just basic research on where the world, where the technology industry is going.  And they do some of the most compelling stuff and they do it out in the public and they release it for everybody for free to look at.

Start time: 7928.14
End time: 7937.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yes. No, that's absolutely the case.  Okay.  This is, I think, a big deal.  The California courts.  Well, go ahead, you tell us the story.

Start time: 7938.36
End time: 8056.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I would just recommend for anybody who wants to sort of catch up and see how we got here, there's a really good Wikipedia page called Net Neutrality in the United States that takes you through the whole weird back and forth history of net neutrality in Title I and Title II.  And I'm not going to try and go through that.  I'll just refer you to that page.  But the latest salvo over the table tennis net in this ongoing struggle is, well, here I'll tee it up by saying that the FCC under the Trump administration did away with what was called the open Internet order, which was a national net neutrality regulation.  That went away under Trump.  And California responded by saying, okay, well, we're going to basically duplicate the open Internet order here in California with a few tweaks.  And they did.  And of course, that was challenged in court.  And what happened just this last week is the Ninth Circuit, which is our circuit court of appeals in this part of the world, decided that that California law could actually stand.  The other side had argued that it was preempted by federal law.  There are certain things that the states aren't supposed to touch because it's the province of federal law.  And interstate commerce tends to be one of those sort of hallmark things.  But the Ninth Circuit decided no, because there was this reclassification of net neutrality from Title II to Title I.  So we're going from common carriers to information services that this actually takes it out of federal preemption and leaves it to the states.  So that's what the Ninth Circuit decided.  I'm sure at some point, another circuit will decide something else for that part of the country, which means this will wind up in front of the Supreme Court.

Start time: 8057.69
End time: 8102.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the question for you.  Yes, because remember, you know, let's call a spade a spade.  Adjit freaking Pai, who managed to get the net neutrality order out, then said, and by the way, you states, you don't you don't you do it.  And then California said, oh, yes, stop me.  And and Adjit sued.  But the Ninth Circuit Court, which is very liberal, said the FCC has given up their authority to preempt this by saying this is kind of interesting that Internet Access is an information service.  That was the whole debate.  Now, this is for the Ninth Circuit.  It's federal, right?

Start time: 8103.94
End time: 8128.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, that's the federal court of appeals for our part of the world.  And I really, you know, I mean, different people will say, yes, there are political overtones to net neutrality.  But but I have a hard time thinking of it as a political issue where I agree to conservative.  Everything's you know, I mean, right.  Exactly.  So, but but, you know, I mean, small businesses definitely benefit from net neutrality.

End time: 8175.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  And and so we're going to cable either see this go to the Supreme Court or the next move on the chessboard or on the table tennis table.  Mixing my metaphors will you know what there is?  There has been a hope that perhaps Congress would act on this and take this off the table tennis table, at least as far as we're going back and forth in the courts.  And then it goes to the Federal Circuit and then back to the states.  And, you know, Congress could circumvent all that by just enacting a net neutrality law.  So we'll see if that would be nice.

Transcript:  But at least the Ninth Circuit has upheld it.  Yes.  And maybe that will be enough.  Although I think the National Cable Television Association will probably pursue this farther.  And of course, in other states will bring up this and so forth and so on.  Right.

Transcript:  And then the other sort of coda to that is, of course, if this does wind up in front of the Supreme Court and lots of other tech policy issues are, you know, coming down the pipe to the Supreme Court, I guess it's worth mentioning that Justice Breyer announced his retirement and a replacement for him is being sought.  And there's a really nice piece at I really love the Washington Post's Cybersecurity 202.  If folks are not reading that, it is a great publication.  And Joseph Marks and Aaron Schaffer there did a nice summary of what Breyer's retirement and the impact on the court might be, what sort of issues the court can be expected to take on in the next several years.  And as they point out, Justice Breyer was never really involved in a lot of tech policy decisions.  So it's not exactly leaving a void there, but that it also appears none of the judges being considered to replace him have a lengthy track record in cyber and privacy cases.  But as they point out, they're all in their 40s or 50s, which may suggest a closer familiarity with technology and its pitfalls than some of the older justices.  So we can just keep our fingers crossed that whoever replaces Breyer has a little bit more sort of real world experience with the kinds of technologies that they're going to be making important decisions about.

Transcript:  You know, I'm thinking for Abby because she breaks her phone very regularly, maybe.  Although if you're not skiing and you're wearing this, you might look a little strange.  But it's a rubber clip that holds the phone and keeps you from dropping it.  And when you get a koala, you help a koala because they give 20 percent for koala habitat.  They must be from Australia, right?

Transcript:  In terms of things that intrigued me, there was a lot of scuttlebutt about a potential Apple spring event,  maybe with a genuinely new MacBook Air, which makes sense because they've barely touched it since the second generation one from years ago.  So potentially very exciting.  I mean, they did an all new MacBook Pro last year and an all new iMac.  So the time is kind of right.

Transcript:  I'm loving it. I have the 14 inch MacBook Pro with the M1 Pro and it's just a beautiful laptop.  But you've tempted me with that XPS, the Dell XPS, I must say.  I'm tempted. It's really nice.  I wasn't going to get it because I thought, well, they put a trackpad on it.  I don't like the trackpad, but it sounds like it's better than just a trackpad.  It's not quite a trackpad.  No, they kind of went their own way.  And I think, Jason, you sound like you liked it as well.
