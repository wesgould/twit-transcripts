Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it could be worse. You're right. Sort of.  There are real stories. In fact, Jenny, you've been covering  the nuclear disaster in Japan.  And one of the things I've noted before is how hard it is to get real  information about this.  The Japanese government's not being very helpful here,  but everybody seems to have an axe to grind.  What's the latest from Fukushima?

Start time: 282.22
End time: 375.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, one of the things that we've been doing,  Maggie Kurth Baker, Boing Boing science editor, and I've been teaming up on this.  And, you know, when when stories this big and this science focused happen,  we feel like Boing Boing is a special venue where we're able to explore  those things without having to apologize for being technically specific  and taking time to talk to scientists, to talk to experts.  Maggie's done an amazing job with sorting through that data  and being skeptical of sources and helping our readers, our viewers  sort through what's true, what's been and frankly, doing the job  that cable news networks ought to be doing a better job of.  Just over the weekend, there was this report that came out from TEPCO saying,  well, radioactivity levels are 10 million times  what's normal in this one reactor building.  And then the following morning, Los Angeles time, they they redacted that.  They retracted that statement and said, well, actually, we meant 100000 times.  It's really interesting.  The the level of the lack of transparency  in any story involving  large power companies, large energy companies.  That that's something that we've grown to expect.  The BP disaster taught us that.  But between the government of Japan and TEPCO and all the sort of fear  mongering that's happening, this is a really, really tough story  to get your head around.

Transcript:  Another meme that's been going around is that giant cube of how many people  have died from coal and then the little teeny weeny cube of how many people  have died from nuclear power.

Start time: 394.82
End time: 429.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think the third lesson is don't necessarily trust science  because science, too, is not necessarily objective.  An engineer with an axe to grind, maybe somebody  university somewhere has received lots of funding from the nuclear industry,  may really have strong motivation, financial motivation  to downplay the risk of radioactivity, to downplay  the potential disaster that is still unfolding here.  But on the other hand, you have people  freaking out and buying iodine tablets on the other side of the world  and perhaps even impacting the supply for people in Japan who will need them first.

Start time: 430.12
End time: 444.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's also the issue, and I've read some blog posts on this of  aid groups raising considerable amount of money to aid Japan,  when in fact, Japan doesn't really want any help or need any help.  What do you do to learn about that?

Start time: 445.82
End time: 496.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We've been doing a series of webcasts with people inside Japan,  bloggers and journalists who we know and pay a lot of attention to just generally.  And what we're hearing is that, yes, absolutely, there is help  acutely needed in the northern part of the country.  The numbers of dead missing are growing by the day.  This is a disaster of unprecedented proportions.  And remember here, we're just talking about people so far  who were who were harmed by the quake and the tsunami.  We we don't know what could unfold yet with the nuclear crisis.  But what we're hearing is that,  you know, you have to remember that just sort of throwing money at really large  global aid organizations doesn't necessarily get help on the ground  right there where it's needed right now.  And it's it's it's a little bit more complicated than one might imagine.

Start time: 496.70

Transcript:  One of the I've got some friends who live in Tokyo, actually,  when I was there a year and a half ago for the Discovery Science Future Show,  spent a good amount of time with them.  I've been watching her Facebook status updates and what they are.  They're doing a lot of local organizations.  It's not about raising money, but they're building hygiene kits  is one thing that I just wouldn't have thought of.  Has never been in such a drastic situation.  So they're asking people in the region, send Ziploc bags.  They're putting together, you know, towels, toothbrush, toothpaste,  because there's so many people who've been displaced.  And that's a very meaningful contribution.  The other thought that I have,  I've not been following this as closely as it's possible  because there's so much stuff blowing up around the world.  But I saw this in the chat room and kind of as a joke.  But Japan does love its robots.  And if there were ever a time for robots to like,  you know, do what they've been designed to do, like this is it.  Like, come on, robots, do your thing.

Start time: 551.12
End time: 557.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They've been doing some robotic stuff, I know, both in the nuclear plants,  but also in search and rescue as well.

Start time: 558.44
End time: 659.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. You know, I would just add to one of the things that we've observed  as Maggie and I have been comparing notes and sort of trading links back and forth  and trying to sort through what's really happening  and what to report to our readers.  A lot of what the story has taught us is that the really large news organizations,  the large news organizations here in the U.S.  do wildly varying jobs of telling it like it is.  And I just have to be born here watching CNN domestic CNN.  U.S. has just been utterly pathetic.  When there was major news breaking, they were they were running stories  that had been debunked nine hours after they debunked and ran on Twitter.  Ran on Japanese news.  I spent a lot of time monitoring TEPCO and  press conferences from TEPCO, from the Japan Nuclear Safety Administration,  from other entities in Japan.  There were these links that were being traded around where on Ustream  you could you could watch sort of an array of six different television channels  from the BBC to NHK to Kyoto News,  monitoring that with English translations,  monitoring the print Japanese language news, monitoring Twitter feeds.  That turned out for me and for Maggie, I think, to be  some of the best sources of news and then just reaching out to people  who are there or reaching out to nuclear scientists  who could help us parse what was happening.  This is such a science story and science in media in America is just pathetic.  It's been abandoned in favor of Charlie Sheen.

Start time: 659.60
End time: 681.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it really is a shame.  But good that there are outlets like Boing Boing who are willing to focus on that.  I feel like that was kind of our mission, too.  We have a technologically literate audience.  I don't think we did as good a job as we would like to.  And it's something that we're going to really focus on is building a better news  division so we can cover this kind of stuff from a technically literate point of view  and assume an audience that is intelligent.

Transcript:  I wanted to know if you guys had seen this.  Seen this other story out of Japan on Badass of the Week.  It's a website that celebrates  badass human beings doing badass things.  And it's about this guy who, you know, got separated from his wife  right after the tsunami, got a bunch of scuba gear.  And, you know, waterproof lighting and went back in underwater,  searching through his flooded town, found his wife, like in their apartment,  just barely breathing, brought her back to safety, then went back and got his mother  doing the same thing.  And now he just keeps going back day in and day out.  It's amazing.  Japanese MacGyver, you know, a hero character.  It kind of there's that.  And then there's one comment from a nuclear  someone who worked at one of the facilities saying, you know,  I'm willing to die to prevent a meltdown.  And it just makes it one of those comments like if you hate your job right now,  you really need to keep that to yourself.  Yeah, because you do.

Transcript:  You guys know Joey Ito, I'm sure his sister, Mizuko Ito, Mimi Ito.  She's a cultural anthropologist based here in L.A.  She does a lot of work on youth and mobile devices.  Fascinating woman.  She and I were trading emails about the series of reports  coming out of Japan in in Manichi and Asahi in Kyoto News,  where over the weekend, just this weekend, you're starting to see this  this sort of swell of criticism and anger for the lack of security measures,  the lack of safety measures and monitoring for the so-called Fukushima 50 or 100  for the workers who are inside the plant doing the heroic and horrifying job  of trying to keep this from turning into an exponentially  worse disaster.  They're literally putting their lives on the line.  And there's great criticism that TEPCO has a long history of lying  about safety measures and faulty safety measures for their workers.  This is I think the most poignant example of this.  There's one report where a doctor who in a previous nuclear disaster  in Japan had treated a lot of radiation victims.  He came out very, very critical of TEPCO, critical of the government,  but specifically of TEPCO for not monitoring these guys constantly  and not providing better safety.  Hours later, after that criticism was published in a big report,  it was taken out. Mimi found that she pointed us to it.  She helped us translate it.  Small steps like that in in outlets like Boing Boing  that reach a wide audience here in the States, I think, are very helpful in,  helping to provide context and seeing sort of what the sentiment  on the ground is like over there.

Start time: 847.88
End time: 880.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I think that it really may.  You know, we say this every time, but every time you get more and more  of a sense that the mainstream traditional news sources are not very useful  and that there is a really but but there is something to replace it,  which which is really kind of exciting.  And then if people do have the interest, they can get all this information  and you can watch NHK on Ustream and you can watch Al Jazeera and you can,  you know, you can you can go to Twitter.  You can find out people like A.  His coverage of not just Japan, but of of what's going on in the Arab.  Andy Carvin's amazing.

Transcript:  You just wrote Marshall Kirkpatrick was at the CTIA this week.  He wrote an article for Read Write Web.  Well, I lost your picture. There we go, Marshall.  Here's here's the article for Read Write Web.  Wright's watchdog says mobile web would have changed the Nazi Germany.  And it's interesting to kind of reimagine what history would have been like  and what and how it how it may never again.  You may may be able to get away with that kind of thing  because of the harsh light of of the Internet.  Can you tell us what he said?

Start time: 917.20
End time: 956.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it was the the director of Human Rights Watch.  Yeah, Kenneth Roth.  And he was discussing the the way that so many atrocities  have been hidden from the world throughout history.  And yet now today, thanks to wireless and mobile technologies,  he's able to have people on his staff and stringers from the general public  communicating live from some of the most repressive situations in the world.  Despite government efforts to shut down those communication channels,  they're just unable to.  And that really, really changes things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Chris, is the flip side of it, which is that there is so much going on  that our attention is now moving very, very quickly.

Transcript:  That's right.  It's a tool, as Kanye says.  But if Kanye were here right now, I'm sure he'd be saying,  whenever I send invoices, I send them from freshbooks.com.  It's easy.  Online invoices.  Actually, we're big fans of FreshBooks.  If you are invoicing people, you know that it's actually one of the most painful things  in the world is to do invoices.  FreshBooks will turn you around.  You will love invoicing.  You upload your logo.  FreshBooks lets you do it on the web.  There's an iPhone app that will actually track your hours if you do hourly billing  and will port it right into an invoice there.  You got to love that.  It's free for the first three clients.  You have to love that.  And if you have clients, and I know there are a few out there who say,  I appreciate the email invoice, but can you please mail me a paper invoice?  They'll even do that for you.  Not free.  You have to pay for the postage.  It's a small fee.  But they literally will print the invoice, stamp it, and mail it for you.  Now, here's the part I like the best.  They put a button on that email that says, pay right now.  Or you can even have your clients schedule regular payments.  Believe it or not, a lot of clients like the idea of just saying,  oh, yeah, as soon as I get an invoice from this guy, pay him.  And it'll happen automatically.  They can use a credit card.  They can use up to 11 online payment services like PayPal, Authorize.net,  Tuco, and on and on and on.  If they don't pay, late payment reminders are automatic as well.  You couldn't get easier than this.  If you're a freelancer, if you've got to invoice,  please do yourself a favor and check out FreshBooks.  It's free.  FreshBooks.com.  Over two million folks have started using FreshBooks since I started in 2004.  It's really grown.  And it is just fantastic.  Every day, by the way, FreshBooks is giving away a birthday cake to one of our audience members.  Doesn't even have to be your birthday.  Just sign up for FreshBooks and a cake could be on its way.  Let me see if I can get Baratunde back here.  You think he's had time to reboot?  One never knows.  Depends on the boot.  Depends on the processor.  Have a little matcha on me.  Let's see.

Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  It was great.  Jim Kramer got on stage and interviewed the CEOs of Verizon Sprint and AT&T  and talked about the T-Mobile acquisition and the Sprint CEO just came out swinging.  Oh, boy.  Which was great.  Then Kramer said, so why does the video stream always stop working on my iPad?  I've got all three of you here.  Who's going to fix it?  I thought that was refreshingly frank.  Yeah.  It was quite enjoyable.  One of my primary areas of interest in that world is about web-connected devices,  about sensors being put all over the place in what's called the Internet of Things.  That just kept coming up over and over again.

The CEO of Ericsson said there are, oh, what did he say?  I believe there are 4 billion mobile subscribers around the world today,  and they expect there to be 50 billion mobile devices above and beyond human subscribers.  Multiple phones per person and sensors all over the place.  And if they can pull that off, it's going to require...

Transcript:  Hopefully we'll find a way.  We hit these new levels of supply and demand and how they work out,  and we discover whole new ways to get things done.  Not until all of your friends have mobile phones does your social use of mobile technology  take this exponential leap.  And so when all of our devices are also connected, we'll hit a new way of generating bandwidth.  Hopefully on the networking side, the network planners at these companies  and within the policy of the government will also hit some new level of supply  that can match the demand that's being created by this unanticipated network effect on top of a network.  It's a fun and hard challenge.  The other day I wanted my oven to be connected just because...  No, it was a very legitimate thing.  We had the daylight savings or whatever the thing, and I have to set the clock twice a year.  That's a machine should do that.  It is a pain.  We're so spoiled now.

I worked on a project back when I had my corporate consulting days trying to think about some of  these applications.  If you could imagine before you leave your home, getting the most informed, you know,  commuting traffic report possible, not based on a helicopter or traffic lights or some sort of  AM, FM, you know, signal radio system, but rather from every human being, not just every car,  every cell phone, every cyclist, you know, whatever path they know that information because

If there were some of these connected tools.  But if you are a horrific, occasionally quirky, mostly badass, bad dictator person or regime,  and you want to know where people are gathering and, you know, before they even know where  they're gathering, you pull all that data, you see where all the mobile phones are headed as  nodes in your little network and you preempt their ability to gather and you section them off from  one another.  You pretend you prevent that ability to come together as a mass group and feed off of their  own energy and perhaps prevent your own overthrow.

I held a rally across the street in support of my campaign and the beliefs that, you know,  my team brought to the table.  We had inauguration when she ousted me.  It was a beautiful affair.

Every one of those is moderated.  I share my location occasionally with certain audiences, certain times,  and to a certain level of specificity.  So that level of control is something that's part of my personal data management,  which I think we're all going to have to start dealing with,  just like you do with your financial management,  your food and clothing and housing,  which your data management is going to be a part of your life.  It should be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's an opt-in, but it's more than an opt-in.  It's an opt-in with sort of your ability to shape, you know,  what amount and through what outlets and at what frequency this information,  though not content legally, but should be considered content about you,  is able to be released.  I think that's got to be a part of this connected network of things  and people interacting with things.  Otherwise, there's going to be a lot more horrific and embarrassing incidents to come.  We might not get over it.

Transcript:  So it sounds like there's a few things that any privacy manifesto would demand.  One is that you have choice of how your data is used.  The other is you can demand it be either withheld or anonymized,  effectively anonymized.  Although we've learned that anonymization isn't very effective  because whenever search engine results are handed out,  people are meeting.  What was it?  AOL gave the data set.  No, it was ask.com gave a data set to researchers  and a reporter in Florida took the data set and said,  oh yeah, that's that lady.  They found her and the completely anonymized data set.  So I don't know.  I feel like most people will have given up by the time your cereal box has an interaction.  It will just be, what are we going to do?

Start time: 2098.80
End time: 2169.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I might predict that there will be a backlash,  that there will be sort of another round of growing concern about what all of that means  and what that means for identity, what that means for culture.  I'm hearing more and more, like here in LA,  I met a filmmaker a couple of weeks ago who was involved in a big,  important award-winning documentary.  And she said that the next project that the same team was working on was about privacy,  digital privacy.  I mean, obviously at Boing Boing with Cory on board  and with all of the reporting that we do about civil liberties  and what these issues mean for human rights workers,  for activists in other countries.  It's something that we care a lot about.  Right.  I mean, I remember seeing some tweets just last night with  people like Jake Applebaum,  one of the volunteers with the Tor project and WikiLeaks who was saying,  if you're in Syria, you have to know that if you're connecting to the internet with Firefox,  if you're doing this, if you're doing that,  your government is monitoring all of this traffic.  And some of the tools that are put out there to help people,  you know, it's more complicated than just downloading a tool.

Start time: 2170.24

Start time: 2175.10
End time: 2247.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The flip side of this is that hopefully,  when more and more of this data is made quantifiable and accessible,  it can be made accessible in a way that can also be leveraged for social justice  and to illuminate things that are unfair and more rationally plan,  allocation of resources, stuff like that.  The example that I had used historically is about real estate redlining,  where when the US Census data and the bank home loan application data  were both first available for computational analysis,  people were able to cross-reference those data sets and prove,  demonstrate that there was a pattern of discrimination  against African-American families in home loan applications  across major cities all around the United States.  So I think that there's probably going to be really big opportunities of comparable  importance when we have this living census of our devices and our social network data  and what have you able to be cross-referenced with other data sets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I not only like Google Voice, I love Google Voice.  It has enhanced the quality of my life.  I do not work for Google Voice, but I'll tell you, first of all, the head of Google Voice is  a guy named Vincent Paquette, which I like to pronounce Paquette, which I think is cool.  You should have a telecom service and your last name is Paquette, so I'm already supportive.  I was using Google Voice from the days it was Grand Central and back in, I think, 2006.  And the idea of having more control, again, we're getting back to this issue of micro-controlling  your digital existence, to be able to give out a number, to have some redundancy to your numeric  identity in the world.  So if I give out a cell phone number that's tied to a network and a device, I lose that device,  it's very hard for me to pick up messaging attached to that device without getting  a new device from that same carrier.  Hopefully they're open, maybe it happens at four in the morning, I'm out of luck.  Especially with text messaging, those don't forward.  Text messaging goes into a black hole.  You hope it gets through, essentially, but unlike a voicemail or a call, you can't reroute that.  So the benefits for me of Google Voice, routing the phone to other phones is great.  Being able to make calls from my computer has saved a lot of minutes because I'm usually  on a fast internet connection.  I'd rather use the IP connection than a telephony connection.  But the text messaging, being able to search my text messages over time, being able to  send messages from a computer, and if I'm traveling, which I do increasingly, being  able to log in, read and respond to text without necessarily activating my phone, or if my  phone is not available, hugely, hugely valuable in a way that I never anticipated.  I thought the phone routing was going to be the thing.  Turns out for me, it's the online multi-platform access to my SMS log and my contacts that's  been such a savior.

And so it's like, I'm very happy that I think about a third of the book was massively applicable.  A third was just for him and a third was kind of insane in a fun way,  but not necessarily a practical way.  One downside I found to Google Voice as a note,  you cannot send text messages right now to international numbers.  And that I found out when I was in Australia,  I was trying to respond to people through SMS and they just don't have the gateways in place.  So in our increasingly global world, Google Voice is still very US centric  and they've got to fix that to make it a real product.

Just that.  Hey, I want to talk real quickly about audible.com.  Then we'll move on to topic number three.  This has been fun.  This is great.  I tell you, I love getting intelligent people on.  So I could just, you know, shut up, stay out of the way.  But I do want to mention audible.com.  Audible is how I read and I love it.  I just, you know, I just saw there's a great movie  came out a couple of years ago about Tolstoy's last year of life  called The Last Station.  It's really great.  And it made me say, you know, I can, I'm going to read War and Peace finally.  And then I chickened out and I said, no, I'm going to listen to it.  I'm going to go to audible.com and I'm going to get War and Peace.  And it's, it's like, I don't know how many hours, but I got it and I'm listening to it.  And you know what?  It's actually really great.  See audible is about the rediscovering reading in your life.  80,000 books on audible.com now.  In fact, there's two different versions of War and Peace on a bridge.  So you can decide which one you want to read.  I'm sure there's some abridged versions as well.  If you don't have the time, A U D I B L E audible.com.  Now you can get two books right now.  Absolutely free.  If you go to audible.com slash twit two, you'll be signing up for the platinum account.  That's a subscription to two books a month.  And, uh, you know, the only real challenge on this is,  is which two books with 80,000 books to choose from.  It's tough.  There's so many great books.  One of the things audible folks do when they get together is they say, well, what's good?  What are you listening to?  I love listening to a book.  It's like somebody reading to you and it just brings the book, uh, to life.  Whether it's war and peace.  I'm reading, uh, Peter F. Hamilton's, a great sci-fi epic, the dreaming void.  I just finished a great book that Andy and Aka recommended about the history of the smothers.  Brothers is called the dangerously funny by David Bianculli.  There are so many good books on here.  Look, here's what I would suggest.  Go to audible.com browse around when you're ready to pick two,  then go to audible.com slash twit two and sign up for that gold account.  Two books a month.  The first two are free.  The first month is free and you can cancel it anytime.  Those books are yours to keep forever plays on any, uh, any of the apple devices, the zoom.  Uh, they've got a great Android app now that I just love that lets you see all of your books  and download whatever you want to listen to audible.com slash.  Twit to check out their sci-fi section.  They've been recording a lot of great books.  We thank them for their support of this week in tech.  Let me go back and check our rundown of stories and some Android stories out there.  Um, playbook is due out soon and the folks at rim say the playbook, which is based on QNX.  It is not, uh, is neither iOS nor Android or even web OS will play or will, uh, run Android apps.  They're going to offer tools to play with.  Will play or will, uh, run Android apps.  They're going to offer tools for Android app developers to easily port their tools to the  playbook, but they say there'll even be a little emulation layer because it's all in Java that will  support apps written for Android 2.3.  They'll support apps for Blackberry Java.  So this is one way to handle that issue of what apps do you run?  I, I ordered a, a, a playbook.  They come out April 19th.  Any of you have zooms or playbooks or any of those Samsung Galaxy tabs?

Transcript:  I, uh, I ended up kind of winning a Galaxy tab at South by, and I haven't activated the AT&T  thing in it because I just, I have too many telecom billing relationships.  They are very good at taking your money and I don't need more cash.

Transcript:  You know, there are essentially, um, banks that, that process your payments and exchange for  occasional telecom services, uh, which is, you know, works out well for them.  But the, the tab, what, one of the very positive things I noticed that size is great.  I'm a, I have the first generation iPad.  I love the iPad, but the tab fits inside my coat pocket.  And if I'm just going to run out the door and have no bag whatsoever, no one to hold anything  that makes a big difference.  It's a very readable size.  It's more Kindle size, which again, you know, kind of slips inside of a pocket and can run and go.  So I think there's a market for something that size and clearly Apple's not exploiting it.  So I hope he's, you know, everyone making things that size is a bit more successful  on that space.

You know, I, I'm with you, Barrett Tunday.  I think the real problem is, is this connection is this connectivity.  Now my old iPad, I have a 30 buck a month account.

You have a shared identity key among your items and you've got a similar connection.  Cause you have a primary like, uh, fixed connection to your home, whether it's wireless or,  or terrestrial doesn't matter, but it's your home pipe and that's shared within your home  as it is now.  And then you have a mobile, you know, primary connection and everything attached to you  or around you that you want to opt in, you know, a friend's phone or a device you're  playing with at some kind of new video gaming facility or at a movie theater.

So there, I think there are some, and of course there are, you know, off brands,  Arcos and others, Arcos isn't really an off brand, but Arcos is selling very  inexpensive Android tablets.

What if you were to create a buzzword compliant iPhone app that was social photography,  instant quick, easy, how much money could you raise?  Don't answer that question.  We will.  We will answer it with an unbelievable number.  Actually, we've got two unbelievable numbers coming up.  The also the unbelievable number the record industry is asking for, for damages from lime  wire.  I don't know which is more unbelievable.  Oh, lime.  Okay.  Yeah.  Get ready.  I don't know if it's on our rundown.  It's not, but believe me, you're going to love this one.  We'll talk about it in a moment.  But first, I just really quickly want to tell you about backing up with carbonite.  It's how I back up and how I recommend you all back up.  When my daughter went to college this year, she brought a laptop with her.  I know the stats on laptops.  Hundreds of thousands of laptops are left in airports every year alone.  They get lost all the time.  And of course, hard drives die.  Disaster happens.  Catastrophe happens.  I know Abby.  She is not going to be backing up her laptop.  She's going to be throwing it in her backpack, throwing it around.  I know that I'm going to get that call at some point.  Dad, my thesis, it's gone.  And can you help?  And I said, I'm going to be able to say, yeah, no problem.  Log into your carbonite account.  It's sitting right there.  Carbonite is online backup done right.  It's automatic.  Anytime you're online, it automatically trickles your data up to the internet.  It's encrypted 128-bit SSL.  You can even add your own triple-desk or blowfish encryption  to make sure it's completely private data.  It also is available to you even before disaster strikes.  You just log into your carbonite account on any computer, Mac or PC.  Or they have an Android app, a BlackBerry app, an iPhone app.  There's your stuff.  It's cloud storage plus backup.  And all that for $55 a year.  That's 15 cents a day.  Unlimited backup.  All the data on your internal drive.  I have to say, it's internal.  You can't just plug in a bunch of external drives,  have it back them up and plug in a bunch more.  This is reasonable.  Unlimited data on your internal drive.  So if it's a laptop, your whole laptop is backed up.  Easy to use.  Very straightforward.  I do want you to try it free for two weeks  because it is dependent on your internet connection.  Make sure you've got enough bandwidth to do this.  It doesn't slow you down or the connection down.  It's trickling it up.  Go to carbonite.com, use the offer code TWIT.  You get two weeks free.  If you decide this is for me, and I know you will,  use TWIT again when you check out to purchase a year's worth of carbonite.  12 months and you'll get 14 months.  Two extra months for free.  You got to back it up to get it back.  So do it right.  Automatically offsite with carbonite.  carbonite.com offer code TWIT.  So the guy who created La La.  Oh yeah.

And of course, now he's a star because you create a startup and you sell it to Apple  for I don't know, hundreds of millions of dollars.  When you next go to venture capitalists, they sit up and take notice.  So Bill Noen...  Well, interestingly enough, a few months ago, he purchased color.com for $350,000.  color.com for $350,000.  And he bought, by the way, colour.com.  He bought both spellings.  So people thought, ah, Bill's up to something.  Well, apparently he was.  There's a new application that he has put out, came out this week called Color.  It is a little weird.  I don't know.  It's a little strange.  When you first sign in, it doesn't really tell you anything about what's going on.  It just says, here, give me your name and a picture.  I will just broadcast that to the world somehow.  And then when you take pictures now with color, see, there it is.  When you take pictures, doesn't this look a little creepy?  It's like IKEA or something.  I mean, take photos.

I don't know whose pictures these are.  I don't know what any of this is.  It's just there.  And then there's a clock, but I don't know what that is.  And then these are other pictures I took.  And then if I take another picture now, I'll take...  Here, I'll be very meta.  I'll take a picture of the color icon.  So that's really meta.  So now that is become...  That's a picture on color.  Now, as I understand this, and I'm not really clear at all about how this is,  but everybody within 150 feet of me who's running color will now see the pictures that I took.

There was no one around me, so I was alone.  That was boring.  And then when I was at a table with other people just testing out the app,  we were just taking pictures of each other, taking pictures of each other,  to then look at the screen of the pictures we had just taken of each other.  But it would have just been cheaper to just look at each other's faces.  It is.  That's what's weird because you're there.

The geography is already there.  The photos were put in an ad hoc group right away.  There might be something interesting about that.  I think the UI is totally not intuitive.

That's a big number to put a big bet on something that is obviously foolish.  Clearly it's not obviously foolish to the people who are putting the money up.  You've seen this deck, color.xxx.

If it is a bubble, it's a very weird definition of one where a handful of people, you know,  with billions of their own dollars are putting a bit of money into a handful of other people  who need money.

South by Southwest is probably one of the more connected conferences as far as the multiple  people they're sharing their own perspectives about what panels they're in, what parties  they're at that you are not in and what the real time availability of choice that you  didn't make and highlighting the position you're not in is a relatively new phenomenon in world.  You might hear later, like a week later, you might read somebody's report about this event  that you also were like, I didn't even know big boy was there.  Now, you know, he's there and you're not free champagne and you're not with them backstage  hanging out.  And so it does heighten.  You know, part of our economy is a big chunk of it.  Probably all of it's built on desire rather than need.  And so this ups the the gap, you know, your knowledge of the gap between you and the Jones's  next door.  The Jones's are all up in your face showing you real time how good they have it.  That's true.  Differently they have.  It doesn't necessarily have to be good, but with a different perspective.

So the next edition, you won't...  Oh, this will make it better.  Get this.  You won't be able to use the app if nobody's nearby.  Well, okay.  And color will be changing the distance required for somebody to be considered nearby.  I don't know if that...  Currently, it's 150 feet.  They're going to start...

You're not getting, at least most people I know, I should say,  and I doubt most of their users are daily session timers.  They got some discussion boards in there that if you're in a particular industry,  that might be quite useful.  If you're looking to recruit people, it can be very helpful to try to find talent  or identify someone at a company that you're trying to reach out to.  But I guess good for them.  100 million people occasionally log in.  That's great.

Transcript:  You don't need them on LinkedIn again.  It's funny because when I first, I can't remember, was using some social network  that linked in to LinkedIn, and all of a sudden I saw this traffic and I thought,  wow, people are using LinkedIn, but really mostly they're doing what Baratunde does,  which is they're pumping their Twitter into it.  Bad news for MySpace, man.  In January of 2011, according to Comscore, 73 million uniques.  February, 63 million uniques.  Loss of 14%, 10 million users in one month.  So they all went to MySpace and went to LinkedIn, right?  Yeah.  MySpace is- Yes, isn't that an insightful- MySpace is losing users.

I've talked to enough people that have told me, despite Google's vehement denials,  that there is social networking based on personas, on contextual integrity of communication.

And they were at the time, and they were doing this in the, I guess it was the 30s,  they were cutting up, you know, they'd take a book and they'd cut it up and they had slips.

So they multiply.  So it enables distribution, electricity, why aren't they suing the power companies?  Sue the power companies, baby.  Right. Food, which powers people, so they should sue farmers, was left of them.  What do you call it? Metal, right?  Because you need that to create the computers and the devices that downloaded this.  And what's the other thing?  Souls, because it took people to actually do this.  This is ridiculous.  How do you-

Start time: 5516.06
End time: 5528.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For what it's worth, I don't know that the people behind LEMWIRE were,  were necessarily the most down to earth responsible, reasonable people in the world either.  It doesn't even matter.  Maybe we can all, you know, chuckle a little bit.  That's $75 trillion.

Transcript:  You know, I should point out that Corey actually had an interesting item on Boing Boing the other  day on our blog, pointing to Alex Wexelblad at Copy Fight, who sort of picked apart this story  that P2P sharing dropped 30% after LEMWIRE shut down.  But in fact, the drop began a couple of years ago.  LEMWIRE only shut down three months ago.  So there's this sort of spin doctoring going on about how,  much of a positive effect this had.

Start time: 5558.86
End time: 5575.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, the other thing is that the money comes from pure math,  because there were 11,000 recordings and you get a certain amount per recording.  So you really have to blame-  Per download.  Yeah. You have to blame legislators who provided for such ridiculous penalties for this stuff.

Start time: 5576.40

It wasn't so much the legality of it because I give them an allowance to buy music on iTunes  and I said, please just buy the music because we want to support the artists and they would.

That has to be licensed to give us money or buy music, but you cannot just turn the radio on  in a workplace, right? Because you're using free music to make music in your workplace.  So apparently this, I think it was the Belgian music industry was going around  and they went to truck drivers. They said, well, you're working. You can't,  you have to pay a license fee for the music you listen to on the radio in your cab, your truck cab.

Many people confuse the Flemish accent with Ariana's accent, which is just  undefinable Euro trash accent. I shouldn't say the word Euro trash. That's not nice.  Anyway, I don't know.
