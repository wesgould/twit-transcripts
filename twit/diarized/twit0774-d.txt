Transcript:  Hey I would love to be able to say I'm in my New York home this week.  We of course  come to you as always it seems this year  in a difficult week and  just you know it's hard  to know what to say. I really liked what Tim Cook  wrote.  Tim's been really pretty good about  the crisis this nation's been going through  starting with the pandemic.  Then of course the horrific death of George Floyd  and he most recently put a note  and actually put it on Apple's webpage.  The last thing we saw from him was in house  and it leaked out but I thought it was beautifully written.  This one is posted at apple.com  slash speaking up on racism  I don't know if you guys have read it  but I think it speaks from the heart  and it speaks beautifully about the situation  we're in today. It's a tough thing for a CEO  because I think some people would say  hey Tim worry about your business  don't worry about the nation.  I think Apple is a big company  employing a lot of people including many black people  and I think it's important for him to step up  he's always done that. It's really remarkable.  I can't imagine Steve Jobs writing a note like this.  Steve Jobs was glad to do open letters against  flash but not against racism.  As difficult as it may be to admit  this is a moment when many people  may want nothing more than a return to normalcy  or to a status quo that is only comfortable if we avert our gaze  as he writes.  As difficult as it may be to admit that desire  is itself a sign of privilege.  George Floyd's death is shocking and tragic proof  we must aim far higher than a normal future  and build one that lives up to the highest ideals  of equality and justice.  With every breath we take we must commit to being  that change and to create a better more just world  if you were at all hopeful or optimistic

Start time: 423.48
End time: 540.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and you said not really.  Yeah and the letter is nice and I think that points to it  I think the A plus letter though  goes for Satya Nadella from Microsoft  I think that one is the best  because it's not  put on the individual saying we must do better  saying like you do better. It's specifically  Microsoft needs to do better and we will do better internally  and then shine as an example externally  and I think that is more of a powerful statement  than I've heard from anybody because if you feel  that your organization  that racism is not a problem where you work  then I think you're like not really focused  and if you say I need to do better  without actually putting forth efforts to change  as a company that is another thing  and if you're saying I'm going to give $10 million to this organization  what you should do is just set aside that money in your budget  and just saying we are going to go through some pain  we're going to go through some anguish and we're going to have to restructure  and that's going to cost money and so we're going to do that.  I think some of it is like well we could  hire from this place or that place  but you know they don't get up the speed  soon enough or something like that  so put some more money in the training  put some more money into your internal efforts  to make sure that if you don't see  that racism is in your organization  find it by putting money in your organization to find it  listen to complaints, let people speak  let people say what's wrong and so having a listen session  is great but turning that around just saying  these are the recommendations and this is the plan for implementing them  that's kind of what you need to do  if you're really interested in standing  with people who are oppressed by the system.

Start time: 540.78
End time: 650.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would argue there's one more thing to do  and that is to hire people of color  and women. Five years ago  I think in October or so  Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft  and Google had a lot of university reports  and they made promises  that things would change  and basically since the numbers were public  and people started tracking  there's been less than a percentage point bump  for black and Latinx engineers  and workers at a lot of these companies  so while I appreciate the letters that have gone out this week  there has been no substantive change  whatsoever in five years  at any of these companies and their hiring practices  so it's  in addition to the fact that  we know that there is bias  and there are problems endemic within all of these organizations  but if you don't change the fabric  then it's really hard to change  outcomes and if you're not  being the change that you want to see within your organization  I think it's a little challenging  to read these letters and to  assume that they are  that they really do mean something beyond PR  I look at Microsoft's letter  so I look at the letter from Tim and Sakia  and I contrast that with what I saw out of Ben and Jerry's  Ben and Jerry's is now owned by Unilever  what they wrote that had specific  actions and  ways to hold Ben and Jerry's accountable  is a different ball game, it's quite different

Start time: 652.50
End time: 677.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and they made an ice cream  and yeah, I mean  that's commitment  actually there's more than just hiring though  a number of companies have taken some hits  because they talk, well Amazon is a good example  where they stand in solidarity against police racism  but then they're selling face recognition technology  to the police that is blatantly racist

Start time: 679.99
End time: 716.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  sorry, let me interrupt  so that's because they're not listening to the people  like the people who are focused on  equity in that company do not have enough teeth  to actually affect change  so a lot of people say they value diversity of opinion and thought  but when it comes to well that's going to cost us a lot of money  like I said, that kind of wins out  and prevents companies from taking that action  to say no to that money, say no to that contract  to divest in the places  even though it might be more lucrative  as a whole for society, it could be very detrimental

Start time: 718.28
End time: 726.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  yeah, and it's easy to use Amazon for this  because they constantly pay lip service to the right thing  while doing the wrong thing it seems to be

Start time: 727.22
End time: 735.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  they fire people for trying to organize or make these things  so of course they don't have anybody who has a voice  in their company because they forced them all out

Start time: 736.30
End time: 738.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and they just took away the $2 hazard pay

Start time: 739.56
End time: 749.95

Transcript:  for their warehouse  but they made t-shirts  and they have to deliver tchotchkes to Americans  so there's that

Start time: 751.30
End time: 753.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I bet they have to turn those t-shirts in afterwards

Start time: 754.88
End time: 797.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it's challenging because  it started with COVID-19  and then is accelerated by George Floyd's murder  there have been fractures in the American society  very deep fractures  and racism  just systemic bias  and runaway capitalism for decades  but it seems to have all come to a head  the pandemic started  the racist murder really put a cap on it  and now Americans are taking to the street  and it feels like we're at an inflection point  that we have a choice now

Start time: 800.04
End time: 812.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it feels like we're at that moment  in Civ or SimCity  and you're like I made so many bad decisions  there's no way to untangle all of this  it's time to find the cheat codes

Start time: 815.00
End time: 815.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  or I just need to reboot

Start time: 817.46
End time: 824.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hope that's not the case because there is no reset button  the calls for defunding cops and police organizations  it's kind of like a reset

Start time: 827.63
End time: 837.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  please explain that to me  this isn't a technical subject so we'll do it quickly  don't we need some policing?  I think it's extremely confusing

Start time: 838.90
End time: 861.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll just say that  my take on it is that  there should be one department  that says I need someone here with a gun that can kill someone  if there's a police accident you don't need to call that group  you don't need to call another civil group  if there's a report that needs to be made  you don't call the people with the guns that can kill people

Start time: 862.62
End time: 868.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  there should be a call it something else  there's a lot of police work that can be done without

Start time: 869.32
End time: 889.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  life threatening force  we call it police work now because the police is the default  just make new organizations and new groups  that can tackle those other things  and that's what's needed  just make it up and so you don't say call the police  you say call and then fill in the blank of whatever that's called

Start time: 889.70
End time: 906.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that is kind of hitting the reset button  because it's a whole different way of thinking about  government interaction with problems  it's a different idea but you're right lethal force is not a necessity  in probably 99%  maybe 99.9% of what law enforcement does

Start time: 907.78
End time: 931.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you hear these cops who retire  who have never discharged their weapons  so even those who are trained  don't necessarily need to use that  because of that if you look at police departments  look how they are trained  how they are indoctrinated  they are only really trained the most

Start time: 931.82
End time: 937.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  on the situations that is the rarest  so you do want somebody who can handle those

Start time: 938.32
End time: 945.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but do you want someone who is trained  to fear for their life to act first  there for all situations and I don't think so

Start time: 947.65
End time: 972.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have a friend who is in code enforcement  but he carries a weapon  and I guess it's good you can shoot a hoarder if you run into him  but probably doesn't need it most of the time  I don't know I'll have to ask JT  I'm not sure if that's a good subject  but since you mentioned it I was just curious  that is one of the calls to defund the police  but it's not necessarily eliminate all policing

Start time: 974.10
End time: 1133.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  but just to rethink what policing is and what it needs to be  that actually is a technical  I just want to say  I want to say a couple of things  I'm on the IRC channel  I think it's important to point out  that all of the people on the show  are not super left leaning liberals  that is not me  so I'm politically independent  if anything I feel disenfranchised  but this is important because  I think that the problems that we're in today  are because sometimes when we plan for the future  we're not going to be able to do anything  except with only the signals that we have from the present  and so it's the year 2020  I wonder why our police departments  don't have better technology  the weapons that they use  are in a lot of ways very primitive  very...  brute force  I know that we have better access  to smarter, better tools  they're just not being deployed  you can't defund all of the police departments  because there are negative next order consequences  to that just as there are negative  next order consequences to the situation that we're in right now  it seems to me like  if we're not going to reboot  it's a good time to stop and think through  what are all of the alternative futures  the challenge that we're in is that the conversations  become really binary  and it could become technical  we could have far ranging conversations  about all types of alternative futures  in which we are using and deploying technologies  that are still respectful of privacy  and human rights  while also deterring theft and crime  in a more reasonable way  but now is a good time to have that conversation  the challenge is that  as with every other industry  there's a ton of embedded cultural norms  and cherished beliefs  that people are not willing to confront  if we had two of protests  we would have seen some immediate actions  we would have seen changes versus promises

Start time: 1139.42
End time: 1163.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  why is it so hard for us to think out of the box  we always when we try to fix this stuff  do it in incremental ways  that are clearly insufficient  let's not use face recognition  why is it so hard for us to be innovative  is it government moves too slowly  you've obviously studied this

Start time: 1163.78
End time: 1235.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  yeah, this is what I do  there's a biological reason  and then there's an organizational reason  the biological reason is that our brains are wired against change  it takes a tremendous amount of energy to recognize a new pattern  and there's a fear associated with that  therefore we do not confront uncertainty  unless absolutely forced to  and once that happens it's usually under duress  so the better thing to do is to be willing  to always consider alternate futures  that may or may not align with what you believe  and what you're observing in the present  but that takes everybody being willing to do that  you are going to have to probably give up something  in the short term if you want to affect change  so that's part of it  but the other part of it is structural and organizational  we have the guy that knelt on George Floyd's neck  had been how many times disciplined?  19 disciplinary actions  so we have an organizational problem  where change is not

Start time: 1237.04
End time: 1266.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  yeah, but in the news  the reaction you get to that as well  the problem is the union, the police unions  we have to do something about that  and that seems to me to be that kind of incremental change  instead of rethinking what you were just talking about, Wesley  the idea of maybe policing isn't the right answer  for most of these situations  are there these kids that are more flexible in this way?  is it possible to teach people to be more flexible?

Start time: 1270.38

Transcript:  I want to know where we have these

Start time: 1272.88
End time: 1323.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think there's a technological solution to some of this  but you have a structural problem  and you have a tactical problem  the tactical problem is solved with better technology than guns  but there's an emotional attachment  I mean, there's like a thousand different ways  there's a thousand different alternative futures  in which we're able to deter people in a meaningful way  without hurting them  we've just chosen not to do that  and if you pitch that idea to any law enforcement agency  it's going to be a no  they'll come up with a thousand different reasons  but it's always going to be no  that's what we're doing at any time  the other issue is structural  and that's a much longer, bigger conversation

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  well, let's talk about Twitter and Facebook  because that's also a big part of the news this week  particularly Facebook  I apologize, I know a lot of people tune in  to our shows on the network  to escape from reality  but sometimes reality is so vicious  so present, so important  we can't really hide our heads  so there are times on this show when we're going to just have to talk about difficult things in life  that are all around us  and I apologize if you've been looking for escape  there is no escape, sorry  you're in it now  but fortunately we have really great voices  to help us through this  including Wesley Faulkner  and also the developer relations  if a company like Microsoft wants to really stand up  and say yeah, okay, fine  Wesley's really good at what he does

Transcript:  we need to see that every year  for race relations, for gender  for sexism, I think that's something  every company can stand up for  what have we done this year  that's really good  Dillon Tweeney is also here  Valomail is a great solution  for a broken system called email  to actually say that the mail came from  who you said it's coming from  the future today institute  we'll talk about Facebook when we come back  there's a lot to say  talk about intractable problems  our show today brought to you by Mint Mobile  I love my Mint Mobile phone  they sent me an iPhone SE  and I put the Mint Mobile sim in it  it's a perfect combination  it costs $100 a month  I'm going back to Mint Mobile  Mint Mobile will cut your cell phone bill  significantly  by a huge amount  with the same great service  I got my first cell phone  with one of the big wireless providers  back when I was 20 years ago  $80 a month  $90 a month, $100 a month  Mint Mobile has cut my wireless bill down  I have a plan  it's for $25 a month  $15 a month  save hundreds of dollars every year  they do it without sacrificing service  they're using T-Mobile  they're using text  nationwide calling  $15 plan  is there a 3 month introductory plan  unlimited nationwide talk and text  I started with that  I went for the $25 plan  12GB of data  I never use it up  for my T-Mobile service  you can bring your own phone  port your number over  they have phones too  premium wireless  Mint Mobile has you covered  with their 7 day money back guarantee  $15 a month  have them send you the sim  $15 a month  $3GB of data  Mint Mobile.com  I went for the $25 a month  I paid $300 a year  I won't get a bill from them  Mint Mobile.com  you gotta love the fox  and don't you love Ryan Reynolds ads  they're hysterical  Mint Mobile.com slash twit  we thank them for their support of this week  in tech  Facebook  I tell you what we talk about this a lot  it's kind of coming to a head  Twitter decided that enough is enough  they labeled a couple of the presidents tweets  another tweet is glorifying violence  the tweet about when the looting starts  the shooting starts yick  Mark Zuckerberg decided no not going to do it  and boy did that cause a lot of problems  Facebook employees  staged a virtual walkout  what about a real walkout  virtual walkout  but for last Monday  hundreds of Facebook employees refused to work  we're not going to do it  and it did get Mark Zuckerberg's attention  he did say ok ok we're going to do something about this  for a long time he's defended  free speech on the platform  I have to say I was very intrigued  by Ben Thompson's post on Stratechery  because he said  I believe Facebook is doing the right thing  by leaving Trump's post ups  and Twitter is doing the wrong thing  by attaching fact checked labels  or obscuring them behind a warning label  both of which Twitter has done  he says interfering with the public utterances  of the president is bad for the tech industry broadly  and that does not resonate with me  but the second point does  deciding what should or should not be fact checked  is a logistical nightmare  and I would say also philosophically very challenging  he quoted Jack Dorsey's tweet  this does not make us an arbiter of truth  our intention is to connect the dots  of conflicting statements and show the information  he does not buy that  he says that's the problem in general  you put these companies in the position  of being arbiters of truth  so I'm going to guess that nobody on this panel  likes the idea that Facebook should just do  best speech is more speech  just not block anything  but Ben does say I believe in the more speech approach

Transcript:  I feel like he's confusing a couple of things here  by calling it a free speech issue  he's making it sound like Facebook is making a decision  about what content gets to stand  and what content doesn't get to stand  he even admits or says that it's not just  they're not removing the tweet  or Twitter didn't remove the tweet  they just put a warning on top of it  and when the New York Times covers  the president's tweet  they reproduce the entire tweet  which seems entirely comparable  you can write about something or attach a statement  saying this is inflammatory  and doesn't accord with the facts  or this doesn't fit our terms of service  and we're removing it because it's the president  of the United States saying it  just adding a warning flag like that  does not seem to me to be in any way  a suppression of speech  it's just Facebook or Twitter  which actually did it saying this is our platform  and we have a responsibility  to our audience and to the people of the world  and when it comes from a figure like the president  it's not like opening the floodgates  to fact checking every single post on the platform  it's like saying this is actually a significant concern  and we're in a position to do something about it

Transcript:  so Facebook's official line now for years  Facebook does it as a platform  not making editorial judgments  journalism schools and newsrooms across the country  for the past decade have been arguing and debating  whether or not Facebook should as a platform  have some type of editorial function  or whether or not they already serve an editorial function  and the thing is that Facebook is making editorial decisions  all the time and it has been doing this for years  it's algorithmic  they can argue all they want that they are just a platform  but a weighted algorithm makes determinations  otherwise you would have so much content  that is either nonsensical  or not interesting to you in your feed  you just wouldn't be using Facebook as much

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  you choose who to follow  again, Facebook, if you look at this from a  not human but rather algorithmic point of view  Twitter has done  no editorial content direction  whatsoever until very recently  it just started practically  Facebook has been doing it all along  Facebook absolutely suppresses content  if they were not suppressing content  you would literally see every single person that you are connected to post

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  so again, I dropped out of law school  right before I started  so I do not have a degree that qualifies me to say this  but if I was a person arguing this  I would try to make the case  that Facebook has been suppressing speech for years  they are algorithmically suppressing it  they are algorithmically making determinations  it is not in the editorial operation  it is not in the way that we think of a news organization  because so much more is done  without a human in the loop  it is nonsense to say that they are not doing that  as such, I am not suggesting that we  clamp down on speech  free speech is really important  but we have to force the tech platforms  to have a conversation where we are all  talking about the same thing  we are talking about apples to apples  not apples to baseball bats or something else

Start time: 2116.56
End time: 2149.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that makes no sense  that point about the algorithm is really true  and it is clear that the algorithm favors certain kind of speech  so speech that tends to be emotionally engaging  or inflammatory  will get shared more and therefore amplified  and I think that the Facebook platform  for sure is designed to amplify those kinds of  strong emotional reactions  and strong emotional content because that is what keeps people engaged  and that is an editorial decision, I think you are right about that Amy

Start time: 2149.20
End time: 2175.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would pile on this too to Amy's point  if these messages from the president  contained a nipple  and if it had pornography  it would have been taken down  and both are free speech  and so if they are for free speech but they take that stuff down  then it sounds like that is a choice that they are making  and it is a choice that they are choosing not to make with the same content

Transcript:  I mean  this is the problem, they put themselves in the position of a publisher  and then they say well we don't want to be a publisher  but there is value  we wouldn't have seen  here is the argument Jeff Jarvis gives, I will repeat it  we wouldn't have seen the horrific footage of George Floyd's murder  except that it was posted on Facebook  and it went viral there  there is value to what Facebook prints

Transcript:  by the way  even though I read out loud  Ben's post and I think Ben is a smart guy  I don't know what the answer is to this  this seems to be a very difficult and tractable problem  and I am not on Facebook  for the reason that I just don't like to see  the stuff that goes through that feed  it was bringing me down  I rejoined Facebook during the pandemic  because I thought it would be good to be able to stay in touch with people  this is a useful tool for that  and then  it got me so depressed I immediately killed it  I haven't killed my Twitter feed

Transcript:  I think it was  I don't remember who posted this  but the top 10 stories on Facebook  in the last week or so  were all Fox News and conservative outlets  so it seems clear which way the algorithm skews

End time: 2387.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  he seems to have been somewhat influenced  you never know with Mark  but someone influenced by  the walkout and the protests from his engineers  on Friday he said  we are going to review our Facebook  policies on posts  that promote or threaten state use of force  or voter suppression techniques  they are going to look into options for flagging or labeling posts  that are a violation but shouldn't necessarily be removed entirely  on Facebook  and he also said we are going to study Facebook's review structure  to make sure the right groups and voices are at the table  Wesley does that feel like lip service or do you think he is genuinely  planning to do something about it?

Start time: 2390.67
End time: 2469.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I am going to say this  and this is just from friends who work at Facebook  that I know  that Mark is as genuine  as he thinks he is  I am not sure what that means  that means we are hearing a lot of people  like the walkout and people talking about how they disagree  because he doesn't stifle his employees  so that is a really good thing  so when he says he is going to try to do this  I think he is trying  in his own words  it is like when you are trying to work out a solution to a problem  but you are only thinking about it in your head  without consulting other people  I feel he rules that way  so he makes things and judgments that make sense to him  but he is using his own thought process  and if he comes to what he thinks is a solution  that is the right solution  and I don't think he allows other people  to do what he would disagree with  and maybe 9 times out of 10 he is right  but that means 1 in 10  is someone else has a better solution  that doesn't get enacted

Start time: 2471.34
End time: 2496.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  he controls Facebook with an iron grip  he has 60% of the voting shares  no one can say no to him  and that is a very Silicon Valley approach  it is a very rich approach  every coder knows this approach  I am going to think my way to the correct solution  and that will be that  it is a logic problem

Start time: 2499.65
End time: 2604.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  here is the baseline of the issue  whatever he decides  if it is negative  he himself and probably the people around him  will not be negatively affected  so if it is voter suppression  none of that affects him  it won't affect his family or friends  it is the ultimate privilege  these decisions  I don't feel he understands the weightiness of it  and the impact of it  from an actual well-rounded perspective  it is not a knock on his understanding  it is just a fact  he will not feel the impact of this  he has been rich for how long?  ever  the people around him have been shielded  saying my friend, cousin  my buddy is Mark Zuckerberg  and they get some of that privilege  if he was genuinely friends and connected with him  and connected to people  who he respected  that have a totally different perspective  in the way of looking at the world  I think he would have a little more influence  from that direction  sometimes I feel he says I won't do this  but instead I will hand this over  because it is that important  I am not willing to say I am letting this go  I am greenlining every last thing you are doing  that is the only thing he gives me pause  but I think he thinks he is doing it

End time: 2621.47

Transcript:  I will add  as a communicator  when I see lines like we will review the policies and procedures  that feels like lip service to me  that feels like something somebody in the communications department put together  no specific

Transcript:  that is like Congress announcing we will form a committee

Start time: 2627.81
End time: 2666.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it does sound like lip service  I am adding  I have a little bit of bias from my friends who do work there  and like I said  he is trying to be genuine about the change  but like I said  he is going to keep himself in the decision matrix  he puts the committee together  and has really good recommendations  those recommendations will be put against his thought process  and then if there is a tie he wins  so the barrier of those changes  they have to be so much better than what he wants  or thinks of

Start time: 2668.78
End time: 2734.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  for them to actually come to fruition  so let's talk about the problem as he sees it  the problem is philosophically  I think  he and many of us think  speech is a good thing and more speech is a better thing  and even if you find speech horrific and reprehensible  the free flow of speech  is the only viable solution  on the other hand  Facebook has and will I am sure continue to  have a variety of kinds of speech  free speech doesn't mean anything goes  so he must have some rules  for what kind of speech goes and what kind of speech doesn't go  and then of course  and I don't know if he considers this  he certainly made enough money, doesn't need to  but he has a responsibility to the stakeholders  and Facebook to do something that is  good for them financially as well  are there any other parameters that he is juggling

Start time: 2735.08
End time: 2757.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  he should be juggling impact  and that seems like that's what he is  yeah he doesn't seem to put that in the factor  because he feels that  ok let's say someone gets radicalized on Facebook  and then kills someone  I think the onus is on that person that he would put it on  to kill someone

Start time: 2759.02
End time: 2763.49

Transcript:  and I don't know if you saw it right before we hit the air  James Bennett resigned  he did, holy cow  so let's recap that story  because that's a fascinating story  it's separate from the news section  and they were attempting to  show both sides I guess  so they ran an editorial  by an Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton  that said  no, no, we've got to use military force against the protesters  because Antifa basically  there were factual mistakes in the editorial  there was a lot of criticism  that they ran that editorial  and Bennett  took some of the heat  and then said well, I didn't read it  before we published it

Transcript:  that's a bizarre defense  now he's out  he resigned  but I imagine he resigned under intense pressure  from the Salzburgers and the rest of the Times organization  because it was a real black mark on the New York Times

Start time: 2936.50
End time: 2998.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  the Times over the past  three years has made some significantly  different changes  it's opinion section  and obviously  I think there's been a rush to capitalize on clicks  in the digital economy  attention is currency  and if you've got salacious columns  there is a desire to get them out  I will say by the time that piece was posted  that argument was already two, three days old  so  I think that  like a lot of organizations right now  the Times has made some poor choices  in what it's publishing and for what reasons  they've also had a really good year  in terms of attention and clicks and money  can I just quickly say some things  I think it's important

Start time: 2999.76
End time: 3007.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 3008.76
End time: 3058.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it is wrong  that at the moment as we're talking about the future of content  and who's saying what, where  whether it's a newspaper  whether it's the editorial page of a newspaper or Twitter  and therefore we're talking about Jack or Facebook  I think it's left out of this conversation  there's the initial launch  of the inflammatory content that gets put out  in some way  the important thing that happens though  because this is an ecosystem  is all of the downstream content that then gets produced  and all of that is happening elsewhere  a lot of that's happening on YouTube  but they are nowhere close to being as powerful  and as strong as YouTube

Start time: 3059.90
End time: 3069.60

End time: 3098.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  okay, fair point  I think there are two sides of the same problem obviously  the nice thing about Facebook is you can point to one person  Zuckerberg because he controls it  you can't point to Susan Wojcicki, CEO of YouTube  but maybe you can

Start time: 3099.10

Start time: 3111.38
End time: 3148.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it is because of YouTube that we have  YouTube is sort of like the kindling  Facebook may be the giant logs that everybody sort of sees  but there is no fire without that foundation  and I think a lot of the foundation is the interplay  between the stuff people hear about on Twitter and Facebook  and then get sucked into  because the algos are so good  they are so good on YouTube  that even if you are logged in with a singular account  you've got multiple people watching  it still knows the difference as it starts delivering you down  content to go down the rabbit hole

Start time: 3150.14
End time: 3167.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and there's something different about YouTube too  because you can just sit back and have it autoplay  you could start out watching videos about Magic the Gathering  and like two hours later while you're vegging out on the couch  and you can watch it on your own  and then you can go back to the training videos or something

Start time: 3168.24
End time: 3198.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it has been demonstrated to radicalize people because of that  that's right, and it is a truly passive network  so simply by continuing to watch  YouTube is a part of Google  so there's just a tremendous pipeline of data  that are there to guide and understand what the system is doing  I think in so many ways  it's significantly different than Facebook  so I totally agree  that something more substantive should at least be discussed  if not done

Start time: 3201.32
End time: 3230.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but YouTube always gets left out of this conversation  by all means belongs in it  so let's include it  YouTube is much more important than Twitter  but let's talk about Facebook and YouTube  clearly the worst and most influential  what seems to me very difficult  is what to do  so I'd love to hear from all three of you  why don't you start Amy, what should YouTube do?

Transcript:  the brain responds more to threat than opportunity  and our limbic system loves YouTube  so the challenge has always been  the business model  the business model requires our attention  even the paid version  and part of what is incentivizing the algos  to get as good as they've gotten

Start time: 3264.46
End time: 3283.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  is to have us sit and watch for hours  why is it so hard for us in this country to say  Facebook, turn off the algorithmic feed  on the newsfeed  YouTube, turn off recommendation engine  yes, you'll make less money, you'll still do fine  why is it hard for us to say

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  turn off the recommendation engine  Leo, we are in a free market economy  these are publicly traded companies  the other thing I would say is  there was a talk that looked finally pretty serious  about antitrust and all of these companies  Google, Apple, Amazon  they were all facing some form of antitrust enforcement  from attorneys general  to the various different federal departments  and COVID has really played into the hands  of the tech companies in this case  and I would say  even going through  not just the United States is going through  but there are protests everywhere

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  so the fact that there are tens of thousands  of people in Japan protesting  tells you something  everybody is under intense pressure  to get the economy reopened  and to continue to do something about this pandemic  any calls to have these companies  make less money, any calls to  that antitrust enforcement  anybody who is trying to do this  is going to find themselves under pressure  not to undertake any actions  that would cause the further loss of jobs  good point  I always think that  the way forward has to be  an economic way forward  my academic background is economics  so maybe that's part of where this comes from

Transcript:  the issue was moot  I think that punitive economic measures work  I think that coming up with economic incentives  which sounds crazy  because what I'm suggesting is that we figure out  a better way for them to win  but I think that given the situation that we're in  that's the most probable way forward  we have to figure out a way for Zuckerberg, for Dorsey  for everybody at YouTube  we have to figure out a way for Zuckerberg  to be a hero to their public  what's in the public interest  while also being a hero to their shareholders  that is a tricky thing to do  and you have to be absolutely willing  to make short-term sacrifices  so that you can be a hero to both  and treat the villain as these systematic problems  that requires a totally different way of thinking  and courageous leadership under extraordinary circumstances  but until somebody is willing  so fine, Jack, if you're listening  after you've meditated and had your liquid  crazy drinks all day long  this is your call to action  figure out a way to be a hero to your shareholders  while you are creating a Twitter  the actual public interest  it just requires creativity  Zuck, if you're listening to this  this is your call to arms  do the same thing  but you people who made our future  who we all look up to also have cherished beliefs  that you must confront  and if you are not willing to confront your cherished beliefs  the people that built the future  what a devastating  what a horrible legacy to leave behind  you have an opportunity now to take these platforms  and to do something great  to lead us into a better place  but you have to choose to do that through creativity  and new kinds of risk taking  and being willing to make short-term sacrifices

Transcript:  I think it's incredibly restrictive  to think that there's one answer  for instance, when I hear about self-driving cars  they talk about the trolley car problem  do you kill one person or five people  but something I haven't heard yet  is what if you turn on the car for the first time  saying, hey, do you want to kill the one person or five people  and then have the person who drives choose  the same with Facebook and algorithms  have, make it so you do all of them  do every single algorithm  and then when you come into Facebook  it says, hey, do you want to see racist?  do you want to see misinformation from a politician?  do you want to see all this stuff  and then you can go to the questionnaire  and know what they're going to get

Transcript:  That's right and so this is the other sort of thorny piece of this  which is that  if I was a developer  the question that I'm sure I would be asking myself is  what's the taxonomy that's getting used? What's the machine learning model?  How do I sort out?  Different cultures  different people use words differently  and in some cases they're acceptable  and in other cases they mean horrible things  Sarcasm within communities  doesn't always play well online  so the question becomes  this is not about thought police or anything else  which I don't have an answer to and that is  how do you build that taxonomy? How do you build the machine learning model  and then how do you deploy it to account for  the unknowable number  of unique ways in which everybody uses language  and I suspect that  when Facebook says publicly  we haven't been able to do X  that some of what they're talking about is this  isn't there another  very creative way to approach the problem  and I think again because these are  companies in a free market economy that are publicly traded  that require that they have fiduciary responsibilities  that we have to figure out  a way to incent them to build things  that are potentially going to be loss leaders  and to give them some ability to build out  risks so again here's another way to think about this  we've got OAuth as a single sign in  is there some OAuth  something that would cut across all of our different  communications channels that would  at least verify this is where I come back to self-sabotant identity  is there a way to at least verify  that the person is a real person versus  a bot just meant to stir up trouble  so that would be one layer  and maybe the next layer is well if it's a real person  then you know  because you wind up with problems  like if you're posting photos of people  on Facebook  posting photos of people at the Louvre or something  where they're standing in front of modern art that happens to show a nipple  how do you train a machine learning model to recognize  that nipple is ok but a more salacious  pose from a person who's or whatever  revenge porn is bad this is where it gets challenging  it's not something that we can't address but the market doesn't  reward that type of work and my point is we have to figure out  a way to reward financially or otherwise  somebody doing the research within these organizations  and producing some kind of result that's actionable  because otherwise we're just spinning our wheels

Transcript:  I have to say that this what's going on  and what's going on over the last two weeks is  society's way of saying  you got to make a change  that's one way to accomplish this  it is if I mean if you want an economic consequence  if people are marching in the street saying Facebook has to change  or the world has to change or society has to change  that's a very strong signal coming to you  that you should be thinking about making a change  and I think that's one of the reasons you're seeing people like Tim Cook  and Satya Nadella post big public  apologies and statements about what's going to happen  so I mean in a way that's what's happening right now  is people are saying they're standing up they're taking the streets saying  no more this must end  isn't this the most healthy way for that to happen?
