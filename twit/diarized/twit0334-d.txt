And with Macs  everything is either very simple or it's utterly impossible so  you don't have to fight with it. You don't figure out how to do it. It either just  works or you give up. I like that.

Our first video episode wasn't till 23. We did that at the Apple Store.  And I'm all sweaty in it because it was just me running around wiring the whole thing up.  And I just worked up a hell of a sweat. I forgot it was video, I guess. That was challenging.  And Roger McGuin was with us on that. You were there for that, right?  I remember doing it. I was definitely one at the Apple Store.  And then we started doing it in a bar for a while. Remember that? That didn't work out so well.  Oh, it was up here. Yeah. That was kind of fun, though.  You brought all those Canon XL2? That's what you got all around you.  I bought those because I wasn't doing video. So I bought these cameras.  $14,000 worth of cameras thinking we were going to do video and then we abandoned it  because it was such a bad idea. It was so hard to do it in bars and coffee shops.  Came back here, continued to do it for audio, just started video about three years ago.  And now we're streaming 40 hours a week. We had 55 million downloads in the last 12 months,  5 million a month now. That is awesome.  And we're building a 10,000 square foot studio, which we can barely afford.  But you need it. But you can see we're jammed in this room. I can't do any more shows.  We'll be right back with a great panel.

Transcript:  I'm not going to be beaten at this game.  I think for one thing, Elop is very much, he's got the same cadence and style of Bill Gates  when he speaks. There's a certain cadence that comes out of Microsoft.  It's just Microsofty. I've run into a bunch of these guys and they come out of Microsoft as  executives and they go to other companies and they do the same thing. They have all these ideas and  they think they're going to be successful with them. But I'm always thinking they never seem to  get it that when they were at Microsoft, they were part of an monopoly company that really didn't  have to do a lot of original thinking. They didn't have to make the right decision. The right decision  at Microsoft was, let's don't kill Office and let's don't kill Windows. That's the only decision you  have to make. Anything else you do is just gravy. Do you think this is not a good idea?  I think it's not a good idea. I think they should have at least, although nobody asked the question,  I was very disappointed in the media because they didn't ask the question of Elop whether or not they  kept the option for Android open. He did mention that they're keeping...

We're going to give them Navtech mapping and it's going to be a tight partnership.  We'll be able to actually change the interface, which nobody else has been able to do. Symbian  becomes what they call a franchise platform, which I guess is finished for we're phasing it out.  And then MeeGo becomes a research and development platform. They're going to put out one MeeGo device  this year. And he kept saying today in his announcement, and it's going to be the disruptive  platform of the future. We're saving it for disruptive stuff. I don't know what that means at all.

Transcript:  Well, the other thing, anyway, there's a couple of things going on in Finland. There's a walkout  at a couple of the factories. The employees are irked about this guy and the whole process.  And there's a term going around Finland called GOOF, G-O-O-F, and it refers to get out of Finland,  because everybody believes that Microsoft is either going to do a deal and either buy most  Nokia and outsource it to China and pretty much close down, killing 150,000 jobs in Finland.  This is what they believe in Finland. And so this is problematic because if you've been to Finland  or if you study how the Finns think, it's not very compatible with Microsoft the way they think  in Redmond, Washington. It's culturally different. I think this guy should have taken a little more  cultural anthropology. I think there's a lot of issues here. I think this is going to be fun  to watch what happens. I hope they're successful, but I doubt if they will be.

Transcript:  I'm just so surprised because I think if Nokia doesn't evolve in this way, there's no way they're  going to stay alive. Microsoft excels at getting their software out on devices, whether it's  Windows or Windows Phone 7 or whatever platform they're trying to spread across the world.  That's what they do best. Nokia has been making hardware forever and they make more hardware for  phones than I think anyone else in the world at this point. So the idea of getting Windows  Phone 7 on Nokia devices across the world, I think it makes perfect sense for both brands.  It may not be good for the people in Finland, but the brand is smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  store. It's weak. Anyway, your argument, how would that not apply exactly the same way to Android?  Here's what the problem is as far as I'm concerned, is that the Windows 7 phone straight up,  in straight competition with Android and the iPhone, shows no traction.  I disagree.  Well, I'm just reading the monthly numbers. Apparently, they sold a whole bunch of phones  right off the bat and then the thing went dead flat after they filled the channel up.  There are some research companies that have said, I have to dig this up now apparently to back up

Start time: 1502.38
End time: 1553.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  my own story. When Microsoft has a hit, they release numbers and they trumpet them and they  have not released any numbers here. I think that they are not selling these at all. When you use  one of these phones, when you use a Windows phone, it's a great phone to use it. But the problem is,  is that no one's going to try it in the era of Android and in the era of the iPhone. I don't know  necessarily that the race is over, but you've got two people who basically, two companies that in  terms of mobile have become clueless and they're drowning and they're trying to cling to each other  in order to survive. There's no indication that they'll do better together than they would have  separately. They won't be any faster. They won't be any more agile and they're not going to have  the same kind of mind share that Android and Apple do at the moment.

Start time: 1555.10
End time: 1598.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I disagree on that because I think, like I said earlier, Nokia makes really good hardware and  they've got the reach worldwide and Windows makes good mobile software. I think so anyway.  I think the combination is actually a really good fit. I think it makes the most sense for  both of them to go into a partnership together and their powers combined, their Captain Cellphone,  I don't know. Nokia didn't do a great job of making smartphones these days that people really fell in  love with. Maybe with the combination of Windows Phone 7, it'll be something that they can do  going forward because there aren't going to be feature phones or the way the past. It's smartphones  and even lower priced smartphones going forward and Windows, Microsoft can make that happen for

However, I do fear when I see these bandwidth caps put on,  I'll tell you, I've been heard outside the US in countries like Canada and Australia where they  have much lower bandwidth caps. Many of our viewers in Australia can't watch the video because it would  use up their bandwidth cap. I fear that that time is rapidly coming to the United States.  And by the way, it's not an interest of protecting their constrained resources because,  and John and I, you've had this fight many times with me over the cost of bits. I don't think it's  that. I think it's to protect their entrenched businesses, their cable premium cable channels.

Transcript:  But let's take another look at this. What has the government done about all these antitrust deals?  Every time an opportunity comes for them to say no to something like this AT&T upcoming buyout,  they don't say no, they just encourage it. So what is the government going to do if you put the FCC  in charge? They're going to encourage more of this and then who's going to get the thing is there? I  don't see that they're doing anybody any good. Now the net neutralities are red herring and it's  all boiling down to the point where you're going to have to buy a license to do the show you're  doing right now. That's the only way it's where it's headed. They haven't done anything any good  for anybody. They're not stopping this AT&T merger, which is a disaster with T-Mobile.

Transcript:  Why don't you like it, John? Well, I think for one thing, I don't think that the model... I think  it's a done deal what a desktop computer should be like, how it should be used. Those... that  interface that we're talking about that they're trying to replace it with is for small screens.  The reason it's designed... there's a reason it was designed the way it was designed. The reason  that Steve Jobs brought it into play because it was the thing you could use with your finger and  a touch screen and a small touch screen and you needed to... you know, you need these icons to move  around. There's a rationale for it. There's no rationale for this stupid interface to be on a

Start time: 2010.02
End time: 2038.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  large 21 inch, 27 inch screen. It's crazy. So we're talking about just for people who haven't seen  it or are listening, we're talking about the Metro UI that's on the Windows Phone 7. It has the large  tiles that each represent sort of a concept or a, you know, like social or contacts or phone or...  but this would have specific... it's almost like they're trying to create almost like an expose  interface, but for Windows and using it, marrying it with the Metro UI that we've gotten to know on

Start time: 2038.40
End time: 2085.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  the phone. It's a touch interface. Exactly. Now here's what my theory is. My theory is that  Microsoft has had nothing but difficulty adapting its operating system to the phone and what they've  always tried to do since the very beginning with Windows... before Windows Phone when they had their  first smartphones is they took the big Windows interface from a desktop and put it on the phone.  So now instead of separating these two as separate items and separate things, they keep wanting to  have them all the same because I think they figure that all their users are complete idiots  and they can't go from one model to another. So they're going to take the phone model that  they know works on small screens and move it to the desktop. Now I think they can save themselves  by having a little button you can push that would throw you back to the real. They do. That's what's

Time will only tell,  but I have a feeling he might not be far wrong. John C. DeVorek has been a big reason why Twit's  been so successful over the years. Twit's in its, what, sixth year. This will be year seven  coming up. And we decided in 2011 to get more John on the show. And I think you'll agree.  A Twit without John C. DeVorek is like a fish without a bicycle.  We're going to take a break, come back with more, but first a word from audible.com,  our sponsor since almost the very beginning on Twit. And for good reason. I've been an  Audible subscriber since 2000. It'll be 12 years this January, 12 years of listening to great books  on Audible. You know, when I first started listening to Audible books, they only had a few  thousand titles. Now over a hundred thousand and more new titles all the time. In fact,  it's pretty much become the case that when a big new book comes out, the same day the hardcover  comes out in the bookstores, the audio book comes out on audible.com. It's why most of the time now  I'm listening to the new books. And there's good reason. I don't have time to read. I'm sure you  don't either, but we always have time when we're stuck in the car, working out at the gym, doing  housework, working in the garden. There are plenty of times when you can't hold a book, but you would  like to read a book. I probably wouldn't get much reading done all week long if it weren't for Audible.  And yet there are hours and hours each day that I cannot read, but I can listen to Audible. That's  why I recommend Audible and I encourage you to give it a try. We've got a special deal for  twit listeners. Two books free. Go to audible.com, browse their hundred thousand title collection.  I'm sure you'll find some books you want to listen to. Really the problem is that you only get two.  Probably you'll find hundreds of books you want to listen to. This was a good one. I listened to  this this year. This was a perfect example. I got it on the hardcover. I got it on the Kindle  and I got it on audible.com. And absolutely the only way I could get through this 600 page book  is because I was able to listen to it on Audible. I read it in a whole, in one week,  one week. I know many of you are probably still trying to slog through it. If you haven't read the  Steve Jobs biography by Walter Isaacson yet, very good choice on audible.com. Another great one is  that new Stephen King novel, November 22nd, 1963. Just started that. Unbelievably good. But that's  just two. Here's the deal. Go to audible.com slash twit two and sign up for the platinum account.  That's going to give you credit for two books. You don't actually have to pick the books right  away. You could, you can now, now that you've signed up browse, you have a whole month to pick  your first two books. You can cancel it anytime. There'll be no charge in that first month, but  those books will be yours forever. So take your time, enjoy, browse the audible stacks, find some  books you want to listen to and then sign up at audible.com slash twit two. Place on your iPad,  your iPod, all the Apple devices, even the Zooms on the Kindles. Yes. And of course on your computer.  They've got a great iPhone and an Android app too, by the way. The Android app is great. You just,  you have your whole library there. You download any app, any book you want to listen to. In fact,  for our trip for the holidays, I fired up the Android app and downloaded a ton of books,  including that Stephen King book. And now I'm going to be ready to listen. See there it is.  11 22 63. That's the book audible.com slash twit two. Now we continue on with our trip down  memory lane, the year 2011 twit style. This was a big story. Google in a shock to everyone  buys Motorola, one of the biggest Android phone manufacturers. Here's how we covered the story.  This was a, you know, August, I usually think of August as a slow week for news,  a slow month for news, but this was not a slow week. Absolutely not. A couple of things. Let's  start with the Monday. Yeah, practically a big shock wreck. Really before even the market opened  on Monday, Larry Page announced that Google had spent 12 and a half billion dollars and purchased  Motorola mobility. That's correct. A shock for anybody here. A shock for me. Did you expect that,

Transcript:  Peter? Yeah, I mean, I was surprised. It's a big deal because they're buying a hardware company,  even if they bought it for the patents or whatever reason. I mean, the fact that Google,  which has always been about software and services would get so directly into the hardware business  is a really big move. It's a big change for how Google thinks about itself as a company.

Transcript:  Some people positive that perhaps there's a message Microsoft partnering with Nokia,  Apple owns their hardware business that maybe if you want to make it in smartphones, you need to  have a hardware partner or be in the hardware business. That doesn't seem, do you think that's  true? And not for Android. Android's advantage is so many manufacturers. Well, I mean, there's an

Speaker: SPEAKER_25
Transcript:  argument to be made, right? Though the counter argument is that it didn't work very well for  Palm and then HP. We'll get to that in a moment. But I think, you know, remember that was Thursday.  Yeah, I mean, it is, you know, it's about a battle of ecosystems, right? And it's about a battle of  who can create, you know, the best experience and creating a great experience really means you have  to not just create good hardware or great software. You have to really integrate those two things  together in a way that consumers are going to have an amazing problem-free experience most of the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_26
Transcript:  pissed off. I mean, what Apple does is hardware, software, but at the end of the day, they're a  hardware company. And they'll say that. And at the end of the day, Google is an advertising company.  Not even a software company. And you can see that from Android. I mean,  although it is the number one mobile service right now, it's a mess. You know, they're doing  what Windows did a decade ago. And I think that it's going to be really, really difficult for them  to take over Motorola and integrate it and create great products in the next few years  without, you know, shooting themselves in the foot at the same time.  It was about patents, wasn't it, Paul? Really, ultimately?

Start time: 2662.22
End time: 2668.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_15

In terms of the patent thing, I mean, I joked earlier this week, like, I didn't,  how many tech writers got into this business to write about patent law?  Right. And suddenly we are.  And it's just, it's really, like, I'm not even a full-fledged tech writer. I'm an enthusiast,  and I love to talk about this stuff. But patents know, like, these guys should just fight.  They should go out in the middle of a desert with, like, a sword,  some kind of broadsword or scythe or something, and just have it out.  And Larry Page and Steve Ballmer go at each other's throats, and whoever wins  gets the thing that they're fighting over.  If it is about patents.

And Apple's going after Samsung saying,  you can't sell products in the US because it's running,  because you're copying our phones.  And I think that's preliminary to suing Google.  Or maybe they'll just sue everybody around Google.  They're going to sue everyone around.

We don't, we're only playing this game because we have to.  And we're going to start putting our efforts into lobbying  Congress to change and reform the patent system.

Like software and, you know, I mean, the patents for the ones that exist,  if I slide my finger across my phone to unlock it, like, that should be really  given a patent.  I mean, come on.  It's, there are thousands of these things that exist for just the most  esoteric little things on a mobile device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Or did you have a prototype?  Built a prototype.  See, that's what it used to be.  You'd have to build something and show the process at work.  And that is a much better way, I think, of making patents work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_26
Transcript:  Yeah, we did it with the New York Times.  So we built it.  As an experiment?  Well, I used to work in the research labs.  We prototyped all this stuff.  And so we had this idea of content following you around.  So like, let's say you're reading an article on your laptop and you don't finish it and  you pick up your phone and walk away.  The RFID chip would say, hey, you left.  Send him the rest of the article on his phone.

Transcript:  By the way, that is one thing that Motorola did have not only patents in, but also some  products is NFC, near field communication.  So and that's something Google's very interested in promoting.  So that might be some value.  Set top boxes also.  They're one of two big set top box companies.  Paul and I talked about this on Windows.  We love Motorola.  Love them.  Terrible.  This stuff is crap.  Only made worse by Scientific Atlanta, right?  Yeah.  I mean, these bars are very low.  The bar is low.  There doesn't seem like any way that they could put Google TV into these boxes.  What's Google TV?  $300 later, he explained.

Start time: 2982.06
End time: 2994.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_25
Transcript:  I think the problem is that when it comes to set top boxes,  it's not a consumer device.  The people that are buying these are the cable companies.  And so if you're doing something the cable companies don't like,  if you put some software on that they're not happy about,  they're just going to not buy them.

But don't you, I mean, chat handles, for instance, are kind of, you know, considered unique.  You need it's kind of bad form to copy somebody's channel.  Don't you think ultimately just as we have a unique phone number,  we'll want some sort of unique identity on the net?  I think that was the fear is that Facebook was going to steal this or Twitter was going  to steal this and Google.  That's why they created Google profiles.  They kind of, but they don't have a competitor.  They don't have a competitive product.  That hasn't gone anywhere.  No, no, I thought it might.

There was a good article on the ultimate, I'm sorry, the unofficial Apple weblog.  I can't remember the guy's name, but he says purely a numbers game  because Apple has now gotten to the point where about 17% market share of all computers,  because so many windows users have become so security conscious,  it's about 80% of windows users are protected by anti-viruses.  So the 20% of windows users that are unprotected, 17% Mac users unaffected.  It's about the same number.  In other words, the Macintosh platform represents a good opportunity now.

The minute you can figure out a way to get on somebody's iPhone, you've made it.  Golden.  Everything's on it.  Was it you, John, who was telling me that there's a market in New York City for  taxi cabs for lost phones?  The taxi drivers know exactly where to go to sell.  You drive up, the guy in the corner give you 100 bucks,  and they give you more money if you've popped the battery.  And so what they're not looking for the phone, they're looking for the data on the phone.  So if you've popped the battery, the person who lost the phone can't erase it or deactivate it.  So now the bad guy has the phone and it's loaded with personal information, contact lists,  all sorts of stuff, credit card numbers.  So there is already a market for the hardware.  I can just a matter of time before people start hacking the cell phones.

Start time: 3696.16
End time: 3704.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_16

Start time: 3704.44
End time: 3763.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_26
Transcript:  And they're overbuilding the factories and everything.  They're not planning.  There's no planning.  You look at Bangkok and it's just scary.  Yeah.  Well, one of the things that's happening is that there's been this flooding.  And as a result, thousands of factories have been shut down.  Mostly hard drives, right?  Well, a lot of hard drives.  But it's not necessarily just the hard drives.  It's little springs and things like that from hard drives that are built around the world.  Parts, yeah.  Parts that are being built in China cannot be put together.  It's affecting tons of stuff.  Yeah.  I mean, there's people, of course, people that are dying.  There's people that don't have jobs.  There's people that can't support their families.  There's all of these different things that are happening.  And environmental devastation.  And as Nick wrote, it's also about the cloud.  So one of the things I didn't realize when I started reporting the story was  I was looking at it from the consumer standpoint.  So the next two quarters, they're going to be making about 30% to 35% less of hard drives,  which is about $50 million less per quarter, which is going to have huge effects on consumers.  So you go to buy a hard drive, your computer is going to be more expensive, so on and so forth.  We're already seeing price gouging.

Transcript:  But the bigger problem is the massive drives for Oracle, Facebook, Google,  Apple, all of these companies that would require cloud computing.  So Apple, for example, which is now expanding iCloud and has Siri and all these things,  is going to need to continue to expand its drives as the internet grows.  So they use the same consumer hard drives?  No, they use different drives, but they're all made there.  And in China, where the other drives are made, they're at 98% capacity.  So there's literally nothing that anyone can do.  And so there's two problems that are going to happen.  One, they're not going to have enough drives to expand the internet.  But the other problem is that the drives that exist,  they're going to have to take engineering resources.  Facebook, for example, will have to do this.  And figure out ways to get the most out of the drives that are there,  so they won't be innovating as quickly and as much.

There is no connection here between, and really anywhere in developed countries,  where the things that you buy, there's a connection of understanding where those things come from  and how they're made and what the cost is, what the human cost is, what the monetary cost is.  And I think that as we start to, as technology culture becomes regular culture,  we're going to start to see things that we don't like to see.  And I feel like we need to address them at some point.  We're already starting to see them and start to address them a little bit, but on mass,  we're not really doing it.  And I think eventually we're going to have to take a look at how these factories are run,  where they're run, why they're run the way that they're run.  You want to get really depressed.

There's evolution of technology and innovation, then there's just,  you're just pushing it out because you need a new product on the shelves.  And I think that at some point in the near future, and look, I mean, this is our business,  we report on this stuff.  So it's kind of, there's a give and a take for me to think about and to talk about it.  But the truth is, we're confronted with it all the time.  This is a great example and we see it more and more now  as we get exposed to how this stuff is really made and who's making it.  At some point, we're going to have to start to think about the global impact of this,  or I think we're going to be in trouble.

And this is where you reach the limits of our version of capitalism,  because real capitalism would take into account all the costs.  And so the market would assume all that information, absorb it,  and reflect it in the price.  And the fact is, we don't.  Our light, our water is too cheap relative to how much it actually costs to get this stuff done.

Well, I mean, maybe I can say this because I'm in a different position than a lot of people,  but I don't expect things that are nice and work well to be necessarily cheap.  Right.

I mean, right now there's a race going, there's a huge race for who is going to control this  mobile space, right?  And I don't think it's been completely decided yet.  And at some point it's going to level out.  It's going to get decided.  I mean, it's like PCs.  At some point, I don't know, remember the Amiga?

Transcript:  Well, I think we reward things in a system based on the cost we acknowledge.  Once, if you look at this hard drive store, which is where this started in Thailand,  we will reward efficiency again because the cost will demand it.  We'll have to.  So society-wide, you look at the cars that are selling now.  I mean, look at the price of rental cars over the past decade.  SUVs are ridiculous, really cheap because no one wants them.  The Prius is hard to rent.  The little smart car is hard to rent because the consumer mindset has shifted because the  cost is more acknowledged.  So there are those who say-

The fact of the matter is, with this government and the kind of rules they've gotten play when  it comes to-  It's a lot easier if you're totalitarian.  Yeah, but at the same time, let's put it this way, they put out the word- and by the way,  there's a lot of black boxes on a lot of these major ISPs nowadays, especially like AT&T's got  one over in San Francisco at that CIA headquarters and that crazy building on 2nd Street.  Anyway, say you're a CEO of one of the big companies and you have like a, you know,  somebody calls you from Homeland Security and says shut down the-  What are you going to do?

This has been going on since the beginning of time.  And as much as I am concerned about terrorism, I would rather we put our energy into shoring  up the Hoover Dam.  So it's extremely difficult to make it happen.  Yeah, there you go.  Then shutting down the entire net.  And, you know, better to be safe than sorry, Larry.  Better to be safe than sorry.

Whereas in the United States, it's, you know, all the different wires coming in from overseas,  that they have a bunch of different hubs that would have to basically do this all to at  once.  And it would take a lot more.

Really good article in the Law and Disorder column of Ars Technica, speaking about how  they do this.  I don't think it's quite as easy here.  However, it doesn't mean people aren't going to debate the need for a kill switch.  It just seems like a terrible idea.  Larry, you said that people are finding ways to get online.

But if people are tweeting them from the ground, there's one blogger.  Let me see if I can get his name.  Abbas.  He's W-A-E-L-A-B-B-A-S.  And he's blogging from the ground, sending pictures.  And he was dark for a while, but he's back up.  So there are people doing it.  And even during the time when it was supposedly banned completely, people were doing it.

Transcript:  I was told this would be the Price is Right.  Where's Bob Barker?  I still don't know what chameleon with the lyrics of that song are probably just as well.  Let's take a break when we come back.  The biggest event of the year for me at Twit was our our move and we have some video from that.  But before we do that, I'd like to tell you about one of my favorite sponsors on the show,  a great company that we love dearly Squarespace dot com Squarespace,  Squarespace dot com Squarespace, the secret behind exceptional websites.  We've had great fun all year long creating Squarespace sites on the fly.  You know, if you go to Squarespace dot com right now, you just click that button and for two weeks,  you have full access to all the Squarespace tools.  All you need is a name of the site, a password and an email address, no credit card,  no payment or anything, and you can set up a site.  So every week we'd set up sites on Twit and we had so much fun doing it.  Some of those sites are still around.  I wish I could remember the names, but some of the sites people have actually started paying for  and have kept them around, which I think is hysterical.  We've also tried to bring Squarespace sites down.  You know, the Twit army is amazing and Twit, our biggest show, has the largest live audience  and we have yet to bring a Squarespace site down.  We can bring almost any site down just by saying everybody now, right now, go to it.  I'll give you an example.  Do it right now.  Go to inside dot Twit dot tv.  That's our Squarespace site, our our inside Twit blog.  Even if you all go there right now, you will not be able to bring that site down.  I have absolute confidence because Squarespace uses a very sophisticated virtual networking system.  Most of the time when you wait, Squarespace is, I should explain, it's hosting plus software.  So it's really good hosting and most of the time when you go to a website,  it's coming off of one computer or in best case scenario as when you go to our site.  We've got, I think, four servers and their load balance across all four servers.  It's still not so hard to overload it because it's not typical that somebody's going to pay  enough money to be able to handle the maximum amount of traffic that site's going to see.  Squarespace doesn't do it that way.  They use virtual server technology.  It's very sophisticated and they can throw anywhere from one to a thousand servers  or more on any given site as needed.  So as traffic ramps up on your site, you're guaranteed you'll always have enough bandwidth.  Your site will never go down.  It's just one of the many reasons to go with Squarespace.  It's the best possible hosting and then you're getting this great content management system on  top of it.  A system that allows even a rank amateur to design a unique, great looking, polished site  that has full functionality.  Social media integration, e-commerce if you want, great looks and feel and speedy responsiveness.  It's just an amazing service and very affordable.  So here's the deal.  Try it.  Just go to squarespace.com and use the system.  See how you like it.  If you decide you want to buy, do use our offer code.  That's TWIT01 for the first month of the year.  TWIT01.  It'll be good all month and you'll get, I think is it 30% off a month for the first three months?  Wow, that's a good deal.  Squarespace.com.  Try it free.  If you sign up and you have a variety of different plans you can sign up for, but this code applies  to all of them, use the offer code TWIT01 for 30% off for the first three months.  It's our way of saying thank you to Squarespace and Squarespace's way of saying please try us.  Squarespace.com, the secret behind exceptional websites.  Let's continue on.  For me, I mean it was a big year.  There was so much great stuff that happened this year.  Lots of fascinating tech news to talk about, wonderful hosts joining us.  We had so much fun, but really the big part of 2011, I know you agree with me, probably,  I hope, was the opening of our great new space, the TWIT Brickhouse.  We had a parade.  We had our first episode of the new studio was a TWIT episode with some of our favorite  TWIT co-hosts.  Well, I'll tell you what, we've got the best of the brand new grand opening right here for you.  Enjoy.  This is the last show for TWIT, for the TWIT show from the cottage.  At this time next week we'll be broadcasting live from the Brickhouse down the street,  the brand new TWIT Brickhouse studios.  I'm very excited about that.  There is still time to get a brick on the wall of honor.  We are selling bricks to help raise money for this incredibly expensive product.  I will see you next week from the new TWIT Brickhouse.  This is the last time I will say it in the cottage.  Another TWIT is in the can.  We got the camera in here.  We're getting ready to stream that live, Brent By on the camera.  In just a moment, we're going to take a hike down the walk,  say goodbye to the old TWIT cottage.  I've been here since 2004.  Seven years in the TWIT cottage.  It's been a great, really a great place to work, to do this show, and to build a company.  Unfortunately, the company got a little too big for this little old cottage.  1800 square feet, 18 employees.  Do the math.  Each of them has a 10 by 10 foot square for everything, including the bathroom.  So it was time.  We had to expand just a little bit.  We're going to move down the road, just a couple of blocks, to a beautiful spot.  It's called the brick.  We built it ourselves from scratch, the Brickhouse Studios.  I think you'll see it's just, well, it's a cathedral to tech broadcasting.  I'm very glad I get to hold to high services there.  So if you are listening at home, I thank you for joining me for the radio show.  I invite you to visit the website, techguylabs.com, and I will come back next week.  We'll talk some more.  And if you'd like to watch our continued coverage of the move down the street, we have our live  cameras in position and we will have our little mini parade and our first show in about an hour.  You can watch it all at live.twit.tv.  For the last time, signing off from the TWIT cottage, I am Leo Laporte, the Tech Guy.

And I think for the last time I should turn out the lights, don't you?  And say goodbye to this lovely studio.  So what we're going to do is we have this thing we do.  Maybe some of you remember this at the end of the broadcast day.  I like to play this little song from our friend, Jeff Smith.

No, but seriously, I mean, I do a lot of video editing for VentureBeat.  Oh, you do?  Some of it I do.  Well, you need that.  Then you do need a heavy duty machine.  I need a, well, I would feel not to denigrate what you do, sir,  but I would feel a little bit silly running around with it.  See, that's what you could have said.  I'm so used to like bad machines.

So the Asus 11 inches that is the same as this.  These are both roughly 11 inch screens.  The 13 is, as you say, 1600 by 900.

We should we should bring him back on the show as well.  We're going to take a break when we come back.  A little bit of a sad note.  We'll take a look at the passing of Steve Jobs and how we covered it on the Twitter network.  It was while we were on the air that it happened.  So we'll see that.  But before we do, let's talk a little bit about one of our favorite sponsors,  Ford Motor Company.  Ford is a 21st century car company, but not just the cars, the cabin, the inside.  That's where they're really getting state of the art.  We were able to drive new Fords a couple of weeks ago, the 2012 Fiesta, Focus and Mustang.  And one of the things I wanted to show you was Ford SYNC as as seen,  the entertainment portion, as seen in the new Focus.  And we were we were kind of having some fun with it.  So take a look.  Hey, everybody, Leo Laporte.  I thought we'd take a little ride.  We've been talking about the Ford SYNC and my Ford Touch for so long.  And I've never actually shown you how it works.  You know, Ford sent down this new 2012 Ford Focus, not mine to keep alas.  But I would like to show you as long as I've got it,  a little bit about the nav and the services and the app like and all the cool things.  Let's get inside and I'll give you a tour of the 2012 Ford Focus.  We're going to I just could go for a little ride.  Look, see this button?  Watch, I got my foot on the brake.  You press the button.  It's a fob keyless car starts up.  Here we go.  I like this too.  When the screen comes on, it says, hello, good morning.  You arriving.  You're driving a Ford.  All right, let's go here.  Yeah, this is nice.  This is sweet.  Hands on the wheel, eyes on the road.  That's the whole idea behind SYNC and my Ford Touch.  But you hit this paddle right here and you can do anything.  So one of the nice things, of course, about SYNC and my Ford Touch is  I can connect to a cell phone.  I've got my iPhone hooked up here, but not just as a phone.  I can make calls with it, of course, but I can also use it as a media device.  So watch, I'll play a song here.

So if you've got a Nano, the kids Nano, if you've got a phone via USB or Bluetooth,  you just talk to it and tell it what you want to hear.  Let's give it a try here.  This is while I'm driving.

Transcript:  It's little things like that just make it a pleasure to drive a Ford.  I love that Ford Focus and I love Ford SYNC.  You know, I got it in my 2010 Mustang.  It's just a lifesaver.  Drive a Ford near you and we thank them so much for their support all year long  of the Twitter network.  We're glad to say they'll be back for 2011.  In fact, I'm going to have a dinner with Alan Mullally,  the CEO of Ford in a couple of weeks at CES.  I will pass along your greetings.  If you have any questions for Alan, things you'd like me to bring up,  you can email me, leo at twit.tv and I'll be glad to pass them along during that dinner.  He's actually, it's a small intimate gathering for just a few tech journalists  because he wants to find out what we think of Ford, what we think of the Ford SYNC,  and I'd love to pass along your opinions too.  So leo at twit.tv and I'll collate those thoughts and pass them along to Alan.  Let's move on.  Of course, this may be, I think arguably, there were so many big stories this year,  but the passing of Steve Jobs was certainly the most emotional story  and for many of us, the most personal story of the year.  We found out about it while Tom Merritt and I were live on the air  we were doing our show Triangulation, Kevin Marks was our guest,  and as always, it was the chat room that first told me.  Let's take a look.  We're going to interrupt briefly because we're starting to see some activity on Twitter  about Steve Jobs and I just want to check on this because we don't want to fall for  a phony story, but I believe AP is reporting that Steve Jobs has passed away.  So we're going to check this real quickly before we go any farther and of course,  you know, there was a rumor, remember a couple of weeks ago that he had,  and we will check that and get as quick as we can.  It is across, it's one of those things that's all over Twitter.  AP is saying that Steve Jobs has passed away.

Start time: 7110.48
End time: 7112.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_31

Start time: 7112.28
End time: 7131.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Yeah, so we will absolutely check on this, but it is absolutely all over Twitter right now.  And that would explain of course why Steve Jobs did not make an appearance yesterday.  Did you work with Steve or was it after Steve's era when you went to Apple?

Start time: 7132.10
End time: 7186.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_31
Transcript:  I actually went there just as he came back.  So as I said, we've been doing these CD-ROM things and then the internet did for CD-ROMs  and so the company I was working for didn't manage to jump in time, to pivot in time if you like.  And we were, the engineering side had been saying let's work on the web, let's do more  web-based stuff and the business side was like no, no, these CD-ROM things are enormously profitable.  We make a million dollars for doing one of these, we should keep doing those.  And that was true up until Christmas 96 and suddenly that wasn't true anymore.  And then we were trying to do, the web development will be the same kind of production model that  we had for the CD stuff which didn't really have a great fit. And one of the things that I wanted  to do was to build the 3D Atlas of the web, which was, and we had a prototype that was  downloading tiles over the internet.  Apple is now confirming this by the way.

Start time: 7186.74
End time: 7205.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Apple is confirming this?  Yeah, Steve Jobs. Yeah, please do a breaking news right now.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, actually I'm glad you're here Kevin. I can't imagine anybody better to have here to  do a talk about.  That's pretty sad.  It's very sad. He's very young. And of course Market Watch has the story right now.

End time: 7289.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_31
Transcript:  Only indirectly. I didn't work with him directly. I saw him in the early 90s when he was at Next.  We went and pitched the media editing stuff to him there. That was when I got the sort of  full force of the Steve demo in a small room.  Tell me about that. What is that like?  That was, we were visiting the developer guy there talking about video editing, what was  possible on the next step. And then Steve walked in with a lawyer he was pitching the next machine  to and then sat down and gave us this almost a one on one full press demo of the next and what  it could do and how you could have audio and video and full images in your email, how you  could revolutionize communication in the company and how this would change everything. It was very  much a net centric vision in like 1991-ish. So it very much he had that insight at that time.  The next was what the web was built on. So that sort of insight early on that networking was the  future was definitely, a big chunk of that was Steve's vision too.

This was 97.  And he said, I have this idea of things that we could do by connecting the computer to the  network and there are a bunch of products that I really want to build here. And if you listen to  that talk you can actually see the prefiguring of all the things that were built out later.  In 1997.  1997. He always had this long term view.

And I don't want to be like  that. So I didn't do it. And in a way I'm kind of glad that I hesitated because it gives me  an opportunity to thank him this morning in a public setting among people who probably  understand that better than anyone else on the planet. So it's a special pleasure this morning  to introduce and thank a person who has changed so many of our lives. Steve Jobs.

But what I wanted to do was just chat. And so we get to spend  45 minutes or so together. And I want to talk about whatever you want to talk about.  I have opinions on most things.

There it is. Apple has lost a visionary and creative genius and the world has lost an  amazing human being. Those of us who have been fortunate enough to know and work with Steve have  lost a dear friend and an inspiring mentor. Steve leaves behind a company that only he could have  built in his spirit will be forever the foundations of Apple.

This is a guy  who lived his life exactly as he wanted to. Was said that Steve exceeded every goal he ever set  for himself. He's a guy who lived his dreams and changed our lives as a result.

He didn't care what other people thought.  He cared about making great stuff and he succeeded every step of the way. He stumbled,  occasionally made mistakes, he wandered in the wilderness after being fired at Apple and yet he  kept coming back and I think it was his extraordinary drive that really made him the man he is.

Transcript:  Steve was very focused. There's a famous story about him coming into a conference room and  somebody starting to chat about the weekend and him saying can we raise the tone of conversation  here? He was a get-to-work guy. When Steve walked in the room it was really apparent immediately that  he knew he was the smartest guy in the room. Usually he was absolutely right. He was down to  earth and later in the last few years he really didn't do very many interviews. He didn't trust  the press. He didn't like the press. He wanted to control very tightly, control the image of  Apple in his own image. He was a control freak in every sense of the word and yet he inspired  us all. I mean without Steve Jobs you wonder where's the excitement going to come from in

Transcript:  Gadgets.com, Ryan Block. Good to have you Ryan. Thanks for having me. You wrote some interesting  things on Jobs' passing. I guess everybody here did. I didn't because I talk, not write.  But I talked some interesting things. This was a week. Tuesday Apple announces the iPhone 4S in a  strangely somber event. I wasn't at the event. You were at the event. I was there, yeah. And we saw  the video later and that's when it hit me. I didn't know at the time. Did you feel like  Tim Cook and the others were a little bit down? You know I heard people who were there say that

Start time: 7694.80
End time: 7763.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_28
Transcript:  they thought Tim Cook was a little nervous. Maybe. I definitely heard people say after the fact that  they thought that maybe he was a little depressed. I didn't really get that. It was all in hindsight  What I hear is what I think. Maybe they knew that Steve was about to pass or that he had just passed  and we found out about it a couple days later. I don't really know. What I do know is that these  guys are so heavily trained to do these keynotes that they've rehearsed it so many times that when  you get up there your mind just goes blank. You just do it. Yeah you're just doing it. So I really  actually don't think that there was probably a whole lot of latent emotion going on there. And I  think just generally if you want to kind of get the Steve feel during one of these things you  got to tone it down a little bit. You have to be supremely confident. I think that is actually what  really separates a Steve note from many of these other tech keynotes where the random CEO of  whichever company you'll have gets out on stage and is super pumped and Steve Ballmer sweating.

They get a lot of media  training I'm sure. I'm sure they do and I'm sure you know that probably Jobs may have spent some  time with them if there was time for him to give them a little coaching. They have a very

Speaker: SPEAKER_28
Transcript:  rigorous program that they've adhered to for years about how these keynotes go. How you get trained  to do a keynote when they have guests up from other companies. They always have app demos now  during these iPhone events. There's some stories that have come out about what exactly that looks  like as a third party company doing a demo on Apple stage. To say it's rigorous is actually  kind of reductive. It is just down to like crazy from what people have reported. Did you see the

Obviously a reserve for Steve  Jobs whether he'd be there or not. There was a story and I don't know how true it was that  Jobs watched the keynote in his comfy chair drinking his favorite apple juice and eating  rice pudding. I don't know how to we have no idea if that's true. The author may have been drinking

Speaker: SPEAKER_28
Transcript:  No I mean I think there were a couple factors that came into play here. One people forget that  apple has a cycle to their product launches and you know this this kind of follows their cycle.  For them it's been every other year has been the big launch. You know the original iphone is a big  launch but it wasn't the iphone that they knew was going to make them a worldwide success. It was  their entrant. They had to get that product out the door. It was the 3G that they really got behind  and that's the one where if you look at the sales charts that's interesting that's when they hit  the hockey stick is on the 3G. 3GS was a you know an upgrade they sold a gazillion of those things  but we all kind of acknowledged that that was a minor upgrade. Then the 4 again huge hit right and  then now the the 4S. So I mean you know it's every other one. Yeah it doesn't feel like  for the iphone that this was some huge shock that it wasn't the quote unquote five that  that I think had been kind of and you know it really didn't help that some of the sites that  had been starting these rumors you know as I guess they really started. We heard everything from

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  think this was a huge launch mainly because I do mainly because of siri and from a business  perspective which I think is mainly what what ryan is talking about it's you know it's it's a  slight continuation of the trajectory that started previously but from a cultural perspective I think  I think 10 years from now we're all going to be talking to our computers all of our computers  to artificial intelligence agents like star trek and I think that this will be traceable back to  this. This was the day that started. Exactly now now the android. Android does it but doesn't talk  back to you. The android didn't mainstream it okay we remember the mainstreamers remember the  edisons and the fords people who didn't invent the light bulb with a car but the mainstream. That's

Transcript:  Well you and I've been around a while and of course we've been saying both I'm sure for years  that the GUI the the user interface hasn't changed since 1984 when apple came out with the mouse and  windows interface and and and everybody was I think we were all saying well what would be the  next big thing and it would be speech it would be touch. Just like Bill Gates said it would. We knew  it but it but it happened finally. Now has any nobody here's tried I mean we've all tried siri

You know what we did and

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  and this didn't feel strange at all when it happened of course we immediately went into kind  of that live coverage. We did it I did I stayed here with a bunch of people till eight and then  Eric Lanigan took over and took calls till midnight and what I felt like it was almost awake it was  when something like this happens to our community and he really was a part of our community there's  such grief that it's just valuable to just talk it out. So we weren't trying to analyze it we  weren't trying to say what happens next. We were just talking about our feelings and that was great.

Or our John Lennon.  Remind me very much of December 8th. More like closer to John Lennon. Yeah it really now John  Lennon was killed in violence suddenly unexpectedly but it did feel very similar.

So you know I was thinking a lot about this why  why people feel this way why so many people who never met him feel this way and I think there are  a lot of reasons you know I personally consider myself very fortunate to have crossed paths with  him on a number of occasions. Did you get to interview him much? I've never gotten to interview him.

Transcript:  connection with Steve I think maybe through the keynotes and but I think I actually came most from  the products and I was thinking about why this is and you know part of his Steve's goal with every  product that he made was to create something that I think that he felt people could connect to and

Start time: 8314.32
End time: 8323.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_16

Transcript:  the left side of Steve Jobs brain talking to the right side. You know and I think what we wound up with in the end  was you know a series of products that some of us have had for you know decades depending on how far  back you go with with using Macs that you know in the end it wasn't just that the products worked  well and made sense and were intuitive in ways that other products weren't and it wasn't even  that they were products that we were able to forge emotional bonds with that I think that we you know  before the iPhone I don't think people had very many emotional bonds with their cell phones  for example. This is something that very early on in the early days of Engadget like 2004 it's  really what drew me to doing a site just about consumer electronics is the emotional bond that  you form with a piece of hardware sometimes. It's very interesting isn't it? But it wasn't  it wasn't those things to me what it was I think was that because these products made sense and  because these products were usable they they made you feel like somebody understood you  that Steve understood you and I think that might be a big part of the reason why people felt such  an emotional connection with him as an individual. Wow that's really interesting. So Leo

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  one of the things I wanted to one of the stories I wanted to point out in this shows how emotional  people in Silicon Valley got as a result of Steve's death. Brian Lamb who was the editor at Gizmodo  when the iPhone 4 prototype incident happened wrote this remarkable apology essentially the  way he behaved and from reading it and maybe maybe Ryan knows a little bit about more about  this than than I do but it reads almost as though one of the reasons that Brian left was because of  was the result of the iPhone 4 incident in the way they handled it. He felt bad.  Yeah he felt really bad and he called himself an a-hole. I can't speak for Brian I mean I think he

Start time: 8455.80
End time: 8505.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_28
Transcript:  would have to speak to that. He's one of my dear friends and I you know I had a lot of conversations  with him at the time when this was happening and everything he describes in the piece on the  wire cutter is exactly how I remember it going down behind the scenes. Of course I've never been  able to talk about it. I mean he can talk about it freely. I don't I think that there are definitely  some misgivings about the way that that Gawker Media as a company wanted to handle that story  and I think maybe there were some differences between how the editorial staff wanted to treat it  and how you know the people who run Gawker wanted to treat it. But you know all that stuff is kind  of I think at the end you see that Steve maybe thought it was water under the bridge and I think  that's kind of the important part is you know that you got to at least Brian got to you know bury the

Start time: 8505.70
End time: 8588.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  hatchet a little bit. I love that he talks about getting a call from Steve Jobs when they have the  iPhone 4 prototype and the call goes, hi this is Steve I really want my phone back. The fact that  he called is very interesting. He says he wasn't demanding he was asking and he was charming and  he was funny. I was half naked just getting back from surfing but I managed to keep my stuff together.  I appreciate you had our fun you're fun with our phone and I'm not mad at you I'm mad at the sales  guy who lost it because but we need the phone back because we can't let it fall into the wrong hands.  I thought maybe it's already in the wrong hands. He continued there are two ways we can do this. I  can send someone to pick up the phone. Brian says I don't have it but you know someone who does or  we could send someone with legal papers and I don't want to do that. He was giving us the easy way out  and before he hung up this is what I love he said by the way what do you think of it?  I think that says it right there. I think we often see him as a calculating machine  as a person who was calculating every moment but I think he genuinely loved these products he was  creating and he's saying Brian what do you think you like it? I mean that is a guy who really wants
