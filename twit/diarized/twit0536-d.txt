Transcript:  Absolutely. Thank you for having me.  It's kind of a last minute thing, but I'm fresh off the plane from Helsinki and jumping into a little bit of a...  Well, I thought it was going to be madness, but actually it seems pretty quiet.  But we'll talk about that.

Transcript:  But it's so glad to have you. We missed you on this weekend.  I'm glad to be here. I missed it terribly.  And it's funny because I collect all week long stories that go, oh, I want to hear what Jeff has to say about this.  So I have three weeks of stories. I hope you're ready.  I am.  Also joining us from Engadget, Devinder Hardwar is here.  Always a pleasure having you on, Devinder. Thanks for being here.  No problem. It's fun.  And actually, I have the iPad Pro in front of me, and Engadget just wrote an article saying, eh, not so fast. It's not that fast.  It ain't a destiny. So we'll talk a little bit about...  It's pretty crazy.  Yeah, we'll talk a little bit about that as well.  And we have a newbie, and we want to be very gentle and kind for a few minutes anyway, to Jennifer Booten.  She's a tech reporter at MarketWatch.  She covers the markets. She covers finance.  And there is a lot this week to talk about, including Mark Andreessen dumping his Facebook...  a significant portion of his Facebook stock.  Jennifer, welcome to a twit.  Hey, how are you doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Take us on.  Take us out.  Take us out.  So, boy, you go on Facebook.  French flags over faces. Facebook made that possible.  They said they were going to do that.  Last time they did it was the marriage equality Supreme Court decision.  And now, but they've made it very easy for Facebook users to show their solidarity.  You see the Paris peace sign, the Eiffel Tower peace sign on all over Twitter.  Not that any of that makes a difference, but I think it's...  I think it's...  You know, I saw some people say, hey, you didn't do that when last week Beirut had or the Russian plane was bombed.  Why Paris? I think Paris is the capital of the world.

Start time: 319.78
End time: 389.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not only that, Leo, but it was the first time that I didn't realize it because I hadn't seen a safety check before  because none of my friends were in the basically Pacific region where these things had happened in Afghanistan and so on.  And so this was the first time it was also a manmade disaster, not a natural disaster.  Yeah.  And really interesting stuff.  Zuckerberg said, OK, fair criticism and we should have done Beirut.  We will in the future.  But they also have some very interesting criterion for this that you can't really, in their view, use this for an ongoing war or epidemic  because there's no definition of safe.  Yeah.  In the case of a one-off event, a horrible event like this, it happens.  There's a period of time you can say I'm safe or I'm not.  And you can have some veracity to that statement.  So I think there was a lot of criticism of Facebook.  I think it was misspent just because if they'd done other manmade disasters,  other terrorist activities and didn't do Beirut, I think it'd be fair criticism.  But the first time they did it was Paris.  They're going to do it now.  I think it was legitimate criticism and but legitimate answer, by all means, for the future.  And this was the first time they did it for a terrorist event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Patrick, you were in Paris, so you didn't get.  But I heard from some people, Cedric Ingram, for instance, I saw that he was safe.  Other friends, I have a friend who's in Paris today, was safe.  And Facebook apparently knows where you are if you ever use it while you're there.  And in at least one case, we'll send you a text message saying, are you OK?  Let your friends know.

Start time: 412.00
End time: 451.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow. Yeah, so as I was saying, I was in Helsinki, but I still I think there are two things on Facebook.  There's the French flags, which feel, you know, it's one way to express support.  It feels a little bit gimmicky sometimes.  And certainly in the in it did feel a little bit as a Parisian.  It felt like, yes, it's wonderful to see all of this.  But at the same time, what you were saying earlier, they didn't do it for other disasters,  including, you know, some terrorist attacks, the thing in Beirut last week and things like that.  So that did feel a little bit OK.  It's, you know, different approaches to different people.

Transcript:  I think, though, in America, at least we feel a real bond with France.

Start time: 455.06
End time: 513.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, it is, you know, the reality is there is some amount of proximity of culture.  And, you know, it feels more you feel more intimately hit when it's a country that is closer to you culturally  and historically and all of this.  Then it's not an excuse, but I guess it's an explanation.  But certainly for the are you safe tool?  I have to say that this was immensely useful, including for myself.  It's hard to realize how useful these things are until you're actually in the middle of a situation.  I was able to signal everyone in one fell swoop that I was OK.  But mostly I was, you know, it's it was a small area of the city.  And of course, you know, one, two, three hundred people hit is enormous.  But there's still a very small chance that your specific friends in a city of two million people are going to.

Start time: 514.90
End time: 525.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. Exactly. And how many how many friends of yours checked in?  How many how many friends in your world? Everyone. It's a long list. Yeah.  There was a number of my world. It was 12 people.  Well, yeah. So what was your number?

Start time: 527.73
End time: 596.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All of my friends who live in Paris checked in.  And for everyone, it was a relief when, you know, it was really the signal that they were safe was if they had put the the I'm safe on Facebook.  You were like, that was what I was going to to check.  It's like, OK, of course, you know, the very close friends you're going to call.  But there are a few people that you're not necessarily going to call 100 people.  So you think of the people who live in the city and you go check Facebook.  And once they're they've checked in, they said they're safe.  It's seriously a big relief.  And especially I was since I was in Helsinki, we had SIM card problems and I was using a Finnish SIM card in my phone so I couldn't be reached by by phone.  I had to check on the Internet and I had to choose, do I want to be reachable on my phone or do I want to have access to the Internet?  Obviously, I chose the Internet. But so Facebook was really the way, you know, after I switched cards to call my mother and, you know, my parents and my very close friends.  Facebook, absolutely the check in tool.  I can see how it's invaluable. Like, seriously, it's it provides an incredible service to the community in that case.  Yeah, it's also a great example. Sorry.

Start time: 599.16
End time: 614.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But just quickly, it's a great example of how Facebook's using its platform for good, because normally all we hear right is about how Facebook is taking over people's privacy, you know, eroding our privacy.  And this is a really great use of the platform. That's not just like self, not just publicity for Facebook.  Right.  Jennifer.

Start time: 615.78
End time: 655.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And at least it's a useful tool, whereas I feel like if people are just changing their profile pictures to the French flag, I think it's nice, but it doesn't really serve a purpose.  Besides some people saying that they're behind it. But then what else are they doing? You know, besides changing for one second their picture.  But the but the tool, the survival tool saying you're safe. I think that has served a good purpose in past natural disasters.  Look at the the earthquakes, for example, in Afghanistan, and it allows people and even people, for example, who are on vacation there.  And I have a friend who is in Europe right now. And if they had been in Paris at the time, that would have been a useful purpose of that tool as well.

Start time: 656.40
End time: 678.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, even more so the Twitter tag Port-Uverte, which means door is open, that was used by a Parisian residents to send a signal that they would be willing to put up somebody who's seeking safety or even just somewhere to stay in Paris that on Saturday night.

Start time: 679.22
End time: 766.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's how it every one of these instances, we find new uses for this and the scale changes. Four million people, according to Facebook, used the safety check.  And of course, that's not all there is. I don't want to say his name because he shared it with just his friends. But somebody I think you and I both know was in Paris was to go to a birthday party for his friend at La Belle-Équipe.  His mother called as a result. He did not go. He is alive. But all his friends died there.  Wow. And he tells this story on Facebook in a way that that that you know, what can you do? But but your heart pour out to him for what has lost. But your gratitude that he's there. That's what Facebook enables. It's the connection.  I just wrote a column for the New York Observer remembering Katrina, where which was a NOLA.com is a site I helped start back in the day where people used it and use the forums.  They use Craigslist. They use whatever they could to tell people they were safer to connect with people.  Facebook's case, this is a very specific purpose driven application they created that that does a job and they turn it on to do that job. They turn it off when they don't.  And yet I'm going to get some hassle. But I think it's pretty amazing that they really anticipated.  They said it was inspired by the Tokyo tsunami or the Japanese tsunami and the and the reactor problems in Japan.  That's what inspired them to make the safety check and how the safety check is now used and how they anticipated the use case and thought of it. It's pretty amazing.

End time: 944.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's Twitter should implement something like that as well. I wouldn't be surprised if they did in the near future.  And that hashtag, Portes ouvertes, basically open doors. Just for people to understand, there was a lot of confusion in the beginning of this thing.  We started having reports of gunfire and attacks, but we didn't know how many were there.  There were people who were staying close to you know, who were it was a Friday night.  So in Paris, people like in every city, you go out, you have drinks with friends and people were close to those areas and they didn't want to stay in the streets.  So that was also heartwarming. I think if you some taxi cabs also just turned off the meters and just drove people home because people didn't want to stay in the streets.  They didn't want to take the subway. But the Portes ouvertes was nice, of course.  I think there was also one thing that was still related to technology, but kind of heartwarming, heartbreaking.  And the next day you could see people sending tweets asking to be retweeted because they hadn't heard from some of their friends or family members.  They knew where at those places that had been attacked and you would see those photos being retweeted many, many times.  And you knew that there was a very good chance that person was dead and it was kind of putting it in front of your face.  It was heartbreaking. There was also another thing.  A couple of teenagers started accounts for basically broadcasting those pictures of people that they wanted to have, that other people wanted to have news about.  And there were a couple of kind of mishaps or, you know, I'm guessing they were kids, but one of them, one of the people who was there at the concert,  My understanding is that they pretended to not be, they didn't call their parents or something.  And once they saw that retweet being retweeted a thousand times, they answered to it and they were like, oh my God, I got a thousand retweets.  And you're like, what are you thinking? But they were very young people.  And then one of those accounts created to retweet these basically announcements was saying this person has not been heard of or, you know, this person was killed in the attacks.  One retweet is one piece of support.  And so you would see people retweeting this in the very, I guess it's lack of taste.  I guess it's teenagers. They're not sure exactly how to handle all of this.

Start time: 944.20
End time: 977.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is going to happen. I think what's interesting about it though is contrary to the past where a news story like this was really at arm's length.  You watched it on CNN. Thanks to social media, it's really much closer to home for everybody.  And even if you don't know anybody on Safety Check, but all you have to do is scan Twitter during these events and really in a way that the news media is incapable of doing, have a direct personal experience of this.  I think that's got to be good.

Start time: 979.31
End time: 1149.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, I have to add something. Sorry, I'm speaking a lot.  Well, this is your story.  That's why you're here.  But I have to say I can't count the number of people that sent messages mainly through Twitter because, you know, Facebook is going to be more personal and people you actually know.  But on Twitter for someone like me who's a semi-public person, there were so many, so many people that sent messages of support and just, you know, we're thinking of you and we're with you and we're happy you're fine.  And that every one of those messages counted.  You know, it was everyone felt made me feel a little bit less alone and a little bit more supported.  And even if it's people you don't necessarily know, you know, I went to bed, I decided not to watch the things that as they were unfolding, it was the evening for us on Saturday evening or Friday.  I can't even remember.  I decided not to watch because I knew it was going to be some kind of unproductive, almost voyeuristic thing where you were going to worry more than you were going to be informed.  So I just decided, you know, I'm going to go to bed and we'll see what happens tomorrow.  And at that point, it was I think we were estimating about 20 dead.  And I woke up the next day and it was the toll was almost 130 dead and 200 people hurt.  Sorry, I'm getting a little bit emotional.  But so I wake up and I see that toll and my heart just sank.  You know, it was it was really hard to just read that it was I thought it was going to be 20, maybe 30 people and it was 130 people.  And along with that, there were so many messages of people expressing support that it made it.  I don't know. It refueled my my heart, I guess, or my soul.  And again, with the Facebook French flag on avatars, it's really a dual feeling.  It's both at the same time, you kind of feel it's you know, what what does that achieve?  But also you understand that people who are hearing this, they want to show their support and you're on the Internet.  What are you going to do? You know, you're not you can't go and shake someone's hand.  Who's 10,000 kilometers away.  So it's also nice to see that people are actually doing it and that they're they want to tell you we feel for you.  So it's it does count, I guess, is what I'm saying.  It doesn't it's not going to solve the world's problems, but it does count.  And yeah, I could talk about it.

Start time: 1150.42
End time: 1185.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I as somebody who did that, both put the French flag on my Facebook and put the Paris piece, the Eiffel Tower piece sign on my Twitter.  It makes us feel a little bit better because you feel helpless in a situation like this.  And so I think people want to do something and that's something it's small.  But I feel like that also makes us feel a little bit better.  And we hope that it makes our French boy friends feel better.  Boy, you looked at face. Did you see what Amazon did?  It was quite dramatic. Yeah.  Yeah, there was a flag with so there it is.

Start time: 1187.28
End time: 1189.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there were a couple of initiatives like this.

Start time: 1190.84
End time: 1195.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you feel like that's just commercialism or is that that's heartfelt?  I feel like that's heartfelt.

Start time: 1196.02
End time: 1213.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I think yeah, I think it's a little bit of maybe a little bit of both.  But I don't think the heartfelt feeling is fake.  It's there was also Uber that made their little cars into French flags, which was a little bit tacky.  But, you know, it's super. What do you expect?

Start time: 1215.40
End time: 1220.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess so. Uber is always going to do the bro thing.  You know, whatever the bro thing would be, that'll be what they'll do.

Start time: 1221.42
End time: 1276.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But what are you going to do? Right. That's the kind of things you can do.  And there were a lot of other things, you know, maybe not as tech related, but it made a lot of people think, you know,  we've had a lot of discussions about refugees coming from Syria and a couple of people were saying, including myself, you know,  these this is so dramatic for us.  And there's been a lot of discussions about the refugees, you know, we we don't we don't have enough space for all of them and blah, blah, blah.  And you're like, what if this is your every day? Right.  How long until you actually want to leave and go somewhere else?  And and I guess the other thing is the the other shoe, which is going to drop fairly soon, I guess, is how are the this is going to be translated into policies  and possibly make policies even more encroaching on privacy?  Although I don't know how much farther they can go with what they've done after the Sharia.

Start time: 1276.04
End time: 1318.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We are definitely going to talk about it.  Well, while from normal people, you saw heartfelt outreach and stuff from governments, of course, immediate reaction is, oh, how can we use this to our advantage?  Here's YouTube. This is interesting, because, of course, YouTube would like to be the next CNN.  I mean, they would really prefer that instead of going to Twitter or CNN or Facebook, that you would go to YouTube.  And they have not only the let we stand with Paris, but they have a button that says latest news.  And this is interesting. This is the first time I can remember YouTube using a news story as an opportunity to promote itself as a news source.  And it's not the first thing I think of is going to YouTube.

Start time: 1319.10
End time: 1321.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would have never thought to go to YouTube. Yeah, that's interesting.

Start time: 1322.18
End time: 1335.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think they'd like you to think of it.  Please think of us as a news source.  And you know what? They can reinvent themselves if there's one thing that's for sure true is nothing is nothing is permanent in the Internet.

Start time: 1336.16
End time: 1356.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And there's been, you know, most of the news stations use YouTube to host their content.  I mean, in France, a lot of them are going to be using Dailymotion because it's French.  But there's still a lot of them also going to YouTube.  So I think it's a relatively easy affair from the YouTube engineers to develop something.

Start time: 1356.34
End time: 1372.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's interesting that when I clicked Learn More, what I got was France 24.  There's no other brands on this. I don't know if France 24 if how that happened.  If there's a relationship between YouTube and France 24, is that a state run television network or is it a private?

Start time: 1372.02
End time: 1386.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's basically it's basically a state run.  So that seems like a logical choice.  Yeah, it's somewhat separate from the state, but the it's financed from mostly from the TV contribution that every person who owns a TV pays.

Start time: 1388.57
End time: 1390.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's be a natural thing to go to, I guess.

Start time: 1391.32
End time: 1405.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And it's it's it's one of the it's it's the one that is international facing.  So they have it's kind of more like CNN.  And well, I guess BBC as well, they have a French channel, an English channel and an Arabic channel, actually.  So they do have three languages.

Start time: 1406.54
End time: 1425.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The other thing I did almost immediately is, you know, the first thing that struck me is, well, I want to understand this better.  What is what is this all about? What is now?  I guess you don't call it ISIS or ISIL anymore.  We call it Daesh. Yeah, that's the new thing.  That's the Arabic initials for the Islamic State.

Start time: 1426.30
End time: 1430.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's actually a very there's a funny story behind the or.

Start time: 1430.00
End time: 1446.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, this is not what they want to be called.  Apparently it's annoying to them to call them Daesh, which is why we want to call them Daesh.  Like that's going to. Oh, let's annoy a terrorist.  That's smart. Let's all do that.  It's all just as annoying as we can troll the terrorists.

Start time: 1447.70
End time: 1456.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All of the all of the politicians are I don't know how purposeful it is, but I'm sure they know that, you know, the difference between the two words.  But all of the politicians are calling them Daesh.

Start time: 1457.22
End time: 1472.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the thing that was interesting to me is I wanted to I wanted to know more.  I wanted my thought was why?  What's why are they doing this? What's their point of view?  And I was able very quickly to find some really good resources, one from the Atlantic, which had a cover story on this in March.

Start time: 1473.00
End time: 1476.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was Matthew Iglesias wrote a great piece on Vox explaining saw that for using.

Start time: 1477.34
End time: 1766.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep. As recline retweeted a few videos and then Der Spiegel had an interesting article tying the top leadership of Daesh to former Iraqi leadership under Saddam Hussein, which I thought was interesting.  So this is the Internet is really can can shine in a time like this in some very interesting ways.  However, when we were to take a break, when we come back, let's talk about how government reacts to this.  And sometimes that's a little more disturbing.  Our show today. We got a great panel.  And I'm sorry it's so big and we've got so many people.  That means we're all going to have to take turns.  And and boy, we picked a bad time to break in Jennifer Boonton from Market Watch.  But you're great. And you and you and I'm not worried about you.  But I just I apologize for the size of the panel.  But there's a lot to talk about, obviously, with the events in Paris.  Devinder Hardewar also here from Engadget.  The return of Jeff Jarvis from Parts Unknown.  I was following your travels.  There's another one where the Internet's great.  I was following your travels and your frustrations on Facebook.  And it was a lot of fun. It was a lot of fun.  And thank you, Patrick Béja, for joining us at the last minute to give us the Parisian perspective.  My pleasure.  Our show today brought to you by Stamps dot com.  This is the time of year where you do not want to go to the post office because that's amateur.  It's amateur hour at the post office.  Lots of people go there once a year to mail all their Christmas gifts.  And if you're running a business and your mailing is part of your business, you don't want to go there.  You want to do it all from your desk.  That's what Stamps dot com is so great for.  Anything you could do at the post office, you could do at Stamps dot com.  You have a digital scale.  They're going to give it to you a USB scale that will calculate exact postage for any letter, any package, any class of mail, including media mail.  It's easy to set up.  You print these labels that are professional looking.  You can print right in an envelope with your company logo, the return address.  The addresses are populated automatically from if you're an eBay seller from the eBay site or from Amazon or from Etsy.  It makes you look like a pro and it saves you time.  And all you need is your computer, your printer.  You don't need a postage meter, special ink or anything like this.  It makes a small business look like a big business.  There are no long term leases.  There are no hidden fees.  There's no postage meter.  There's no postage meter.  Ink is more expensive than inkjet printer ink.  That's a hundred times more expensive.  Plus, of course, they charge you to reset and they they charge you processing fees.  If the postage changes, you've got to bring it to the post office.  You don't want a postage meter.  This is the modern world.  This is welcome to the 21st century.  You even get discounts you can't get at the post office.  And it'll automatically fill out the customs forms, the certified mail, the return receipt, even send an email saying, hey, your package is on the way.  I love Stamps.com.  Here's the deal. Go to Stamps.com.  Click the microphone in the upper right hand corner and use our promo code TWIT.  You're going to get a hundred ten dollar bonus offer.  Fifty five dollars in free postage.  Yeah.  Fifty five dollars in free postage.  You get the digital scale and you get a supply kit and a four week trial of Stamps.com.  It's all great. It's all good.  Once you use it, you'll never stop Stamps.com.  We thank them for their support of this week in tech.  Don't forget our offer code is TWIT.  So, of course, immediately government responds to this.  Glenn Greenwald with a very emotional piece in the intercept this morning.  Written at 423 a.m.  So I think he was up all night.  Exploiting emotions about Paris to blame Snowden and distract from actual culprits who empowered ISIS.  Isn't that it's almost shameful that a variety of news people, government officials, he says, former Bush Cheney apparatchiks,  people with deep ties to private NSA contractors all saying, hey, thank you, Snowden.  And of course, as Glenn points out, Snowden didn't tell us any didn't tell the bad guys anything about how we observe them.  He let us know that we were also in the electronic dragnet.  And anybody who saw Zero Dark 30 knows that even Osama bin Laden, as early as 2003, knew not to use the cell phone or the Internet.  Terrorists know that.  Here's an article, February 5th, 2001, USA Today, terror groups hide behind Web encryption.

I'd like to know what kind of phones they had because they were communicating with encrypted technology.  They're just one more dark.

Transcript:  Yeah, they're not they're not being monitored as you know, I guess just people didn't think of it.  But I'm sure that now people, you know, the government officials are going to go knock on Sony's Sony's and Microsoft's door and try to get some video.  And I think they're going to be able to get some visibility into that as well.  But obviously, I think the issue is they're always going to find something else or use some encryption that they it's easy to do it.  The problem that we're being faced with now, there are a couple of things.  First of all, after the Charlie Hebdo attacks, there was a very strong movement in the French government to try and empower the police forces to have access to more information.  On everyone and, you know, basically formalizing and legalizing, I think what they had been doing for a while anyway.  So that's why they were pushing it so much.  That's the way I look at it.  And it did go through.  So I don't know what more they could be doing.  But and the other thing is it's the big problem with these kinds of attacks is that it seems that most of the time, if not all of the time, they're perpetrated by people who are already known by the that's what always blows my mind.

Start time: 1897.20

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They've interviewed these guys.  They know they're there.

Start time: 1901.08
End time: 2000.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they are they are people who are, you know, they have giant lists of people that they should be surveying, who are already being surveyed anyway, right, that they have the proper judicial approval.  They have everything and they are if they had the resources for it, they would be following all of these people anyway.  And the way they're pushing, I think because they just don't know what to do and they want to appear to be doing something.  I don't think there's incredibly malicious intent in there.  Maybe that's me giving them the benefit, the benefit of the doubt.  But what they're doing is pushing it to say we have to be able to survey everyone.  But really, I'm not sure how efficient it would be because the people that need to be surveyed are already they already know who they are and they have the right to survey them anyway.  So that's where the disconnect comes from.  And that's where people think, although I have to say, and I'll finish on this.  When I heard about the attacks immediately, as tech literate as I am, I had a few minutes of, you know, I thought and I have been fighting those laws very publicly to my the best of my ability.  I've been saying they are bad laws.  But for a few minutes, I was thinking, you know what, just let them spy on everyone.  I give up. Let's let if there's a modicum of a half and a fraction of a percent that it will help.  Let them do it. And then, you know, I had to remind myself that it actually it's tempting.  Doesn't matter. It just doesn't matter.  So imagine people who don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's what it's about. Benjamin Bratton. He's an actor.  It's Bill Bratton, chief New York police commissioner, said this morning on ABC this week with George Stephanopoulos, ISIS taking advantage of the technology that the head of the FBI has been complaining about.  I've been complaining about going dark, the ability to go dark.  I think you're going to see that playing a significant factor in this event.  I'm very interested to see what types of phones they were equipped with, what types of apps they had on their phones.  Were they in fact even in communication with each other at all?  And then on Face the Nation, I guess he was making the rounds.  He said, these apps, these devices that now allow these terrorists to operate without fear of penetration by intelligence services.  This is the first example of this, which, of course, is not true.  We have gone blind as a result of the commercialization and the selling of these devices that cannot be accessed either by the manufacturer or more importantly by us in law enforcement.  Even equipped with search warrants and judicial authority.  This is something that is going to be needed to be debated very quickly because we cannot continue operating where we are blind.  So I think you're going to see the drumbeat once again.  In Great Britain, apparently, David Cameron has kind of backed down on his plan of enforcing back doors in encryption, realizing it would harm the economy if nothing else.  But then these things happen and people get the political wherewithal to pursue this once again.  So I wouldn't be surprised at all.

Transcript:  I think this is why these shows like this one are so important.  And it's so important that the audience of our shows is informed and also informs people around them.  Not in an aggressive way. You know, you don't have to go all Snowden.  What do you say?

Start time: 2114.02
End time: 2131.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, let's let's give us some ammunition.  What do you say?  And I think this is just as you experienced a very real concern.  Yeah. But how do we catch these guys?  What do you say to somebody who says we've got to give them these powers?  What if we make it?  You know, they have to get a warrant.  What's wrong with that?

Start time: 2133.31
End time: 2272.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's the problem.  The problem is when they don't have to get a warrant, which is what is happening in France now.  It's unwarranted.  There's some kind of weird shadow, not shadowy, but weird organization that is supposed to have some oversight,  but it's nominated by the presidency or, you know, the government itself.  There's no counter power there.  And they are able, in theory, to absorb all of the information and, you know,  to basically do what the NSA and other intelligence organizations have been doing in the US.  And that has been exposed by Snowden.  And what we can say, I think, is what needs to happen is police work on the people that are already in the view field,  the field of view of the information agencies.  And bringing everyone in the country into that field of view is actually not going to help.  These are two separate issues.  Again, I think it's very important to understand whether or not the people who made those attacks  had crossed the paths of the intelligence agencies at some point.  And it seems the first elements of the investigation seem to indicate that that is the case.  They were people who were very prepared.  There were professionals.  They had gone to Syria and probably, you know, they had been there and had come back.  That's the first elements that we've seen.  So really, when you're expanding the power of these agencies to gather information from the entire country  and people who have no relationship with these specific people, you're not helping at all.  You're just making everyone's life, everyone's, you're just attacking everyone's privacy.  And if the issue is that you have to be able to be more, to get access to information faster and more efficiently,  that's not a problem.  I think we're all in agreement that that should happen.  If you have someone that you're gathering information on that calls someone else  or that has some kind of contact with someone else and you want to have information on that person,  sure, just, you know, get a warrant or even get a special powers of something and get their information very quickly.  That's fine.

Start time: 2282.69
End time: 2296.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, for sure.  Like other hackers could get access to those back doors as well.  You know, it opens up all sorts of interesting doors and dangerous doors for our software.  And it kind of defeats the purpose of having decent encryption anyway, too.

Transcript:  I often, though, wonder, especially in the wake of the passage of CISA,  if how committed companies like Apple, Facebook and Google are really to...  I know that they very prominently and publicly said, oh, CISA's a bad idea.  But at the same time, I feel like in the behind the scenes, they were saying, yeah,  but it wouldn't be such a bad thing if you passed this.  CISA was, of course, the cybersecurity law that allows companies to share information about attacks,  cyber attacks with each other and with the government without warrant.  And most importantly, I think for these companies, without liability.  They can't be sued if they give your information.  I love it that Apple says your stuff is, you know, on this iPhone is encrypted.  No one can get it. We can't even get it.  We can't give it to law enforcement.  But I wonder, I wonder if that's just lip service.  And if behind the scenes, Apple is saying, I mean, they have to adhere to U.S. law, right?  Do you trust your iPhone to vendor?  Do you feel like no one can spy on what you're doing on your iPhone?

Start time: 2364.20
End time: 2388.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, it's tough.  I kind of assume that, you know, if somebody in the government really wanted to get access to something, they could.  But I also have like a corporate profile on my iPhone so I can access my enterprise mail.  And my IT department, I know, can do a lot of things on my iPhone, but I do it because I need to get access to my work mail.  We make these concessions all the time.  But the scary things are, yeah, what can the government do that maybe Apple or other companies aren't telling us about?

Transcript:  Yeah, you know, here's the information that you were talking about, talking about, Patrick, how Paris, ISIS, let's call them Daesh terrorists may have used PlayStation 4 to discuss and plan attacks.  This information comes from Belgium.  The federal Home Affairs Minister, Jean Jambon. Does that mean ham?  Yes, it does.  OK, you know those Belgians, they're weird.  Jean Jambon said that the PS4 is used by ISIS agents to communicate and it was selected due to the fact that, here it comes again, it's notoriously hard to monitor.  He said it's even more difficult to keep track of than WhatsApp.

Start time: 2462.28
End time: 2483.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think that's what you have to do. You have to have people actually, what are you going to do? Are you going to actually monitor everything?  I think one of the pieces of information that came out of this was that, obviously they don't want to admit to it, but they have so much information they don't know what to do with it.  I guess it's for reviewing after the fact if something happens.

Start time: 2483.36

Transcript:  You know, I just came from the airport.  Was it difficult to get into and out of?  No, no, no. It was fine. I think it's going to be relatively normal.  I think there's a lot of people who are... My concern is not with Paris itself.  I think Paris is going to be fine. We already had Parisians back in the terraces yesterday, basically flipping people off when they were...  I think BuzzFeed did an article going to terraces asking, what do you have to say to terrorists?  Or like, how are you living your life? And they were, you know, giving them, giving virtually terrorists the finger.  And they were enjoying their coffees and beers at the terraces.  But the real concern is more on the policy side of things, obviously the privacy things and how things are going to evolve with Assad and the military and the privacy options and things like that.  But no, Paris seemed relatively normal. It was easy to get in. There weren't any issues at the airport.  That's not normal at all. It's always difficult.

It's about the news, informs you, and you can mock somebody, which is really what it's all about, right?  This picture doesn't show a march in Germany expressing solidarity with the French like DJ Vigirl tweets. It's actually from an anti-immigration event in January.  Hey, one march looks much like another. I don't blame her for getting that wrong. Were the terrorists, do we know, using Twitter and Facebook? I know that there was some jubilation from various Daesh accounts on Twitter.

Start time: 2828.56
End time: 2919.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I don't know that they were. I think it's taken a little bit, I think a day for Daesh to actually claim responsibility for those attacks. I don't think there's been a huge amount of activity.  I think actually a lot of that we didn't have a lot of information on the terrorists and which led to some pretty ethical work by the journalists. My first fear was that they were going to plaster the airwaves with their faces and names in the way that is the most harmful to.  Let's not do that. Let's not do that.  Exactly. But since we don't know, basically most of them, it's terrible, but most of them blew themselves up. So we really didn't know anything and we still don't know much at this point.  And I don't think they used social media a lot. You know, my theory, and this is completely personal, I'm not even sure how much all of this is geared towards the West or towards France. I think Daesh is currently in a relatively tight spot.  They're losing ground to some of their enemies locally. And this is a recruitment tool that they made, you know, to distract the world from the fact that they're not as powerful as they were a few months ago. And to get people to join them in some parts of the world that are more susceptible to these kinds of things.

Transcript:  Yeah, the social network was a much bigger problem. The social network Oscar nominee and Oscar winning in many, in many respects was far more, you know, fantastical about its story than Steve Jobs was.  Whereas that Steve Jobs kind of took real events and just mashed them all into very tight timeframes.  But it was a lot more true to Steve Jobs and the social network was to Zuckerberg or that whole story.

We interviewed Danny Boyle a couple of weeks ago and I said, I imagine the family of Richard the third wasn't too happy about that portrayal either.  But at least Shakespeare had the good sense not to write about people who were recently alive and many of whose friends were are still alive.  That's always a risky thing to do.

Whereas, you know, I've read all the Steve Jobs biography so far and she has refused to talk to anybody, including Walter Isaacson, who's made probably, you know, that's the Apple approved, the Steve Jobs approved biography.  And she didn't even talk to him. So I think the film has other things to say.

Transcript:  Yeah, it's interesting. And I have to admit that that is one of that is probably the most reprehensible story and anecdote in Steve Jobs life is how he denied his daughter for so long.  Except that the movie doesn't show that he's living with Steve Jobs.  I know. And I have mentioned this before in 94, I spent a long weekend with Steve, Laurene, Reid had just been born and Lisa and they were a loving family.  And this is, of course, you know, it's very different from the portrayal in the movie.  On the other hand, Jobs is so venerated, very few people ever bring this, you know, really want to talk about this issue.  And it is it is pretty reprehensible.

Transcript:  You know, we want to talk about his successes and, you know, how he was tough, but but fair or whatever.  It's all you know, it's all mythos. It's all made up.  The human being is far too complex, especially a genius like Jobs, far too complex to portray in a movie or a book or anything, I think.  I don't feel like I'm any closer to understanding Steve than I ever was, frankly.  Let's take a break. How about that?  Just trying to manage my manager time.  So much to talk about today. I want to talk about the FBI paying a million dollars to Carnegie Mellon to break tour for months.  Months. Talk about it.  Overreach.  But first, let's talk about my mattress, because that's much more peaceful and restful and nice.  And I have a very nice mattress. His name is Casper Casper, the friendly mattress.  Casper Casper is a site, Casper Casper dot com, where you can go and get American made mattresses, premium mattresses for a fraction of the price you'd pay if you went to a mattress store.  And that's because the match they eliminate the middleman. The mattress store markup is a massive.  You can do better. Casper's mattress is obsessively engineered.  They use latex and memory foam to give you a great, great support.  See, I like a firm mattress, but they give too, because Lisa likes likes it to give a little bit.  We both love our Casper mattress, and I think you will love yours too.  Now, the challenge, of course, is how do you sell direct from the from Casper?  Because people want to try before they buy.  You were all used to going to the mattress store and lying uncomfortably on a mattress with our shoes on and the salesgirl giving us the stink eye, trying to imagine what it'd be like to sleep on this every night.  For the rest of our lives, it's not a good system at all.  The way the Casper works, you order it. It comes in a box, surprisingly compact box.  You open it up. Oh, so comfortable.  Now you have 100 nights to decide. This is the trial period.  100 nights. If any time in those first 100 nights you say, yeah, it's not for me, they'll come and get it and refund you every penny.  So you can try before you buy for 100 nights. Really the best way to do it.  Lying in a bed in a showroom has no correlation to how you're going to like that mattress.  I was talking to my son, Henry. We sent him a Casper when he was last year.  I guess he was a sophomore in college and he lived on the third floor.  We got his that it came in a nice compact box. He could get up there. He loved it.  He moved it to his new apartment. And I said, you're going to take it with you because he's moving again.  He said, yeah, it's seen a little action. I think I might get a new one.  And I think that's probably a good idea. And the nice thing about Casper is it's easy.  It's affordable. Five hundred dollars for a twin. Nine fifty for the king size.  I mean, just compare that even to the best sales at the mattress store down the street.  And you're going to save an additional fifty dollars just by using the promo code.  Casper dot com slash twit.

It's kind of remarkable. It makes me feel like a slacker, to be honest.  Maybe that's why Katerina is learning Finnish.  No one can call you a slacker if you learn Finnish. So Carnegie Mellon.  This is crazy, crazy. I'm going to try to get this right.  Correct me if I got the details of the facts wrong.  According to the Tor project, the FBI wanted to uncloke users of the Tor network.  And then anonymizing network we've talked about often the onion router used by the Silk Road.  Apparently that was one of the people they wanted to catch was one of the people involved with the new Silk Road.  They were also going after a child pornographer. Nothing wrong with that.  So they went to Carnegie Mellon researchers to crack TOR's anonymizing network.  And according to the Tor project, paid CMU a million dollars.  So they I guess they wanted to know how to do it. The FBI wanted to know how to do it.  So they paid CMU a million dollars. Of course, the issue is, yeah, this is great.  They caught the bad guys. But during the period in which TOR was de-anonymized,  many thousands of people used it and their privacy was nonexistent.  There was no warrant or there's no indication that there was a warrant.  According to the Tor project, there was no oversight, institutional oversight by Carnegie Mellon's institutional review board.  They were paid by the FBI to attack hidden services, then sift through the data to find people they could accuse of crimes.  So that's another issue which I'm not sure about. But the other issue would be, was it a fishing expedition?  Hey, just see what you can find in there. Or were they actually going after this Brian Richard Farrell?

Transcript:  Ah, it's a good question. That's a good question. I don't get the impression that it's ongoing.  The Tor project noticed in July a group of malicious relays. That's the best way to crack Tor.  We're trying to pick out people who are looking for hidden services, sites hosted on Tor like Facebook.Onion.  They used a mix of nodes and exit relays along with some vulnerabilities in the network protocol that allowed for users' real IP addresses to be discovered.  Those relays were subsequently removed by the Tor project.

If the FBI is going after somebody and trying to gather evidence and does, in fact, as we know this does happen, exploit zero-day flaws and stuff to do after that person,  they're presumably doing that with a warrant. It's a kind of wiretapping. And B, it's targeted. This is more like a fishing expedition.  This net caught anybody who used those relays. And it was run for a period of, I think, four or five months.

Transcript:  Collateral damage.  Right.  Matthew Green, who's a really great cryptographer, one of the really the thought leaders in this field, he's a professor at Johns Hopkins,  wrote an article about why the Tor attack matters on Wednesday.  And that's the point he makes is the collateral damage. I mean, nobody's going to argue that you shouldn't go after somebody possessing child pornography or staff members at Silk Road 2.0.  But he says there's no reason to believe the defendants were the only people affected.  If the details of the attack are as we understand them, a group of academic researchers deliberately took control of a significant portion of the Tor network without oversight.  This attack ran for five months, potentially de-anonymized thousands of users who depend on Tor to protect them from serious harm.  And they took money for it.  And they took a million dollars for it.  This is similar to RSA taking money from the NSA or was it the NSA paid NIST? Who was it to recommend a broken protocol?  That's a that's a story. This is an old story, but that's a story.  It's a it's a NIST, the National Institute of Standards and Time. Is that it?  And the NSA were in cahoots to promote a weak crypto standard, hoping that bad guys would use it.  And you know, it's it's go ahead.

Transcript:  I was going to refer to something you said in passing at the beginning of the show.  You mentioned The Wire, the TV show.  And I think it it can put a little bit of focus on something that it seems that seems like a completely foreign subject or right to us now.  You know, go watch The Wire again and you'll see how difficult it is for police.  Right. It's always been different. It should be.  Yeah. And that's that's what I don't understand.  When did we go? Was it 9-11?  I don't know. When did it go from?  Yes.  It has to be difficult for the police because it's not like in The Wire.  I know it's a work of fiction, but it used elements of reality.  It's not like, you know, the people they were spying on were evading tax.  They were actually selling drugs that were killing kids.  You know, it wasn't probably I'm going to say something a little bit controversial, but I think factually it's probably true.  They were probably making more damage to American society than the terrorists actually did.  If you count in a cold manner, the number of dead.  So how did it work that we actually went from?  It has to be somewhat difficult.  You have to have protections for people and make that job reasonably difficult.  You have to have a warrant to we can pay, you know, we can inject bad certificates or we can pay Carnegie Mellon to de-anonymize the Tor network.  I don't understand how we jumped that shark.  This is as a society.

Transcript:  It felt exactly like that feeling you had, Patrick, right?  That you OK, maybe let the government survey surveil everything, right?  Because maybe that would help prevent another attack.  And yeah, after 9-11, I was in college when that happened and my college experience was basically colored by our response to 9-11.  And it's crazy to see how this entire country went from, you know, some place where police had to go through a lot of legwork to get surveillance done to where it was basically like our first response was to just like do whatever it takes to catch people.  And I'm worried now, like especially after the Paris attacks, that we're going to see something similar happening.

Transcript:  And I confess I did go through a bit of that afterwards.  I mean, I went from being a pacifist to a hawk.  But we have to have standards of a democratic society and we have to stand by those and we can't be run by just the exceptions.  And, you know, being able to keep secrets is and have privacy and to encrypt as part of what we need to be able to have in an open and free society.  If you cannot presume that something is secure, then nothing is secure.  So we need that as a society.  And then and then, yeah, we have a system of warrants that enables the government to go after the bad guys.  You know, when the New York Times first started working on the war on those wiretaps that Snowden ended up revealing so much, I thought wrongly at first, well, this perhaps is just to get the base data to see the exceptions.  But no, it was it was tapping into our very Internet.  It was tapping into the core. It was lying to us about what was happening.  We have no faith in our own government right now.  Whatever I go ahead and say, I joke about apologizing for the NSA.  These days now I apologize for Donald Trump.  That's another story.

Transcript:  It has a negative effect, too, on our own security.  You know, this when the when the NSA co-opted the RSA with a 10 million dollar payment to to promote a weakened crypto standard, that crypto standard is still in our browsers and still to this day.  Years later is a weakness, a weakness that companies like Microsoft and Google have been trying very hard to banish from the browsers.  That's there because the RSA took 10 million dollars from the NSA to put it in there.  A moral hazard if there ever was one.

An anonymous hacker believes that Securus is violating constitutional rights of inmates has released information that says 70 million phone calls placed by prisoners in 37 states.  Now, you might say, well, they're prisoners.  Screw them.  But many of those phone calls were to their attorneys.  That's the key.  Constitutionally protected.

You know, ever since we've started to have serious problems with all of these consequences of the terrorist attacks, I've been thinking a lot about Master Yoda of all people.  You know what he says?  He says a bunch of things that we conclude with, I think, fear leads to the dark side.  And it's a pop culture reference, which as with many pop culture references have a lot of truth, right?  These terrorists cannot defeat us militarily.  They can't.  They don't have the resources.  They cannot kill enough of us to make an impact.  What they can do is make us afraid so that we will change who we are.  And that's exactly what the venerable and fictional Master Yoda was saying.  Fear leads to the dark side.  And I think that's what we're seeing.  We're afraid.  So we're making decisions that is making us, you know, changing who we are.  And I think not for the better.

And people are so quick to just want to say that surveillance should be the end all because, you know, that's how we protect ourselves.  But you do have to have some kind of standards there.  And after what happened in Paris, I'm sure a lot of people are going to come back on that a little bit.  But like you said, it's important to remember that terrorism instills fear.  Terror.

It's funny how surveillance is like one of the prevailing plot points in movies and TV shows these days and not just like, you know, things related to spying.  Even the latest like James Bond is all about the whole global surveillance network and how that could be used badly.  And it's almost to the point where we're getting sick of it, where it feels like all these movies are just recycling the same idea.  But it also feels like as a culture, we have something to work through because we're feeling this.  We don't know what's going on with all the surveillance around us.

And either way, if you're pulling that much of your money out of Facebook,  and you're an early investor and he sits on the board also, I believe, then yeah, that's going to raise some eyebrows.  But it's also Facebook hasn't really shown many indications of trouble ahead.  So it's an interesting situation, and you could say some of it is profit taking,  but it does for a lot of people kind of raise some questions as to why he would be doing that right now.

So to me, the more interesting question is, where will Mark Andreessen put $160 million next?  That's what's far more interesting.  Yeah, he did well in it, and at some point, you turn the money around.  And that's what he's doing.

Transcript:  Yeah, the stock is doing better now than anyone could have possibly.  I wrote a story earlier this week about how all of the haters now are talking about how great Facebook is,  because remember when it went public, it had that botched IPO and people were really kind of questioning.  There were some analysts that were saying, oh, we don't know about this stock.  And here we are two years later and it's doing so well.  It's hitting all time highs.  It's one of the most valuable companies in the US right up there, not too far behind Google and Apple.  So I think, you know, why not go out when you're on top and yeah, reinvest that money and somewhere else that may need it.

What's interesting about Andreessen is that he doesn't just like shout to the void.  Like he is interacting with people.  He replies to people and not just, you know, starred, you know, popular people on Twitter or something.  Well, but that's okay.

Transcript:  No, but I think, you know, it speaks to the specificity of the ecosystem of Twitter.  I think there hasn't been a social network that is about immediate interaction in the way that Twitter is.  Obviously Google Plus is not as successful as Google would have wanted it to be.  And Facebook has sort of returned a little bit to their more intimate chat with your circle of people origins after having tried to make everyone public and, you know, sharing things publicly to sort of and chase Twitter.  But it didn't really work out and now Twitter is left alone in that sphere of very public interaction with people you don't actually know.  And there's nothing else that does that.

And Tim Cook's desire to basically get you all to stop using computers and start using iPads.  Please. The end of the PC era or just ridiculous.  I ask you.  But first, a word from carbonite.  You never know when disaster will strike at work or at home.  I had a call on the radio show today.  A guy was in his house, but he had a visitor who'd left and didn't close the door behind him.  So a homeless couple came in and stole his laptop.  He didn't even see him do it.  But I guess he found out later.  A homeless couple. And he said, Hey, can they do anything with my laptop?  And I said, Well, I just hope you have it backed up with carbonite.  See, weird stuff happens.  Hard drives die, fires, flood, homeless people steal your stuff.  And then, especially if you're in business, you might be out of business.  If your accounts receivable and your client list and your your your your suppliers lists are all there on your hard drives and you lose that data.  But it'd be hard to get that back.  Now, you may be saying, Well, that's not a problem.  I have Joan accounting go down every week with a external hard drive.  He backs the whole thing up.  We put it in a closet.  See, that's not it.  What if there's a fire?  Then you lose everything, including the backup in the closet.  Carbonite is great because it takes your data all the time.  Whenever you're online, it's continuously backing it up to the cloud encrypted channel encrypted at rest.  It's there.  It's in the carbonite data center.  Air conditioned.  Your data is relaxing.  It's enjoying a vacation.  But the minute you need it, boom, you get it back.  You can log on to your carbonite account on any computer.  They have free apps for the iOS and Android.  You get your stuff.  You can see if it's there.  You can even email that to somebody else.  Prepare for the unexpected.  Protect your data with secure, automatic.  That's really important.  Cloud backup from carbonite.  No wonder a million and a half homes and small businesses trust carbonite to back up their computers and their servers and keep them in business.  You just it's like fire insurance.  You can't buy it after you have a fire.  You got to do it now.  While you're listening to the show, go to carbonite.com.  Use the offer code twit.  You'll get two free bonus months.  And right now, there's some very good deals up to 30 percent off carbonite.com.  Is the offer code twit.  Did any of you get a iPad Pro?  Did you rush to the store?  No, I waited by the Pixie.  I want the Pixel C.  But I got the iPad Pro because I you know, they put it on Apple put it on sale Wednesday and they said, you know, you could pick it up at the store.

Transcript:  Well, I got OK, so I bought call me crazy, but I bought this is a keyboard and cover.  Apple was selling this at the store from Logitech.  It's called the create.  Apple's own keyboard is one hundred seventy bucks and it doesn't have any dedicated iPad keys.  This keyboard case was twenty bucks cheaper and it has a home key, a search keys.  Well, that is a bargain.  It's a bargain at only one hundred fifty bucks.  And they look a lot better, too.  Yeah. Well, you know what?  When look at this, this thing is it's heavier than a MacBook, like a lot thicker than a MacBook.  I don't know why you would use this instead of any laptop, frankly.  I mean, I guess because of the touch, right?  And Apple steadfastly refuses to put touch on its OS 10 stuff.  So that's the big difference.  You got touch and you got a fingerprint reader, which is the battery life like.  Oh, it's basically permanent.  It's forever battery life.  It's the thing is so huge.  But now, Devinder, I think Gadget said that despite Apple calling the A9X, the processor in here, a desktop class,  you guys said it's not.

But it's just from what we've seen and what I've been reading all around the Web.  It's nothing too special.  And there are some benchmarks that have been comparing it to things like current Intel chips or something.  But they're not like Apple.

It's a great gaming platform, except that so far nobody's designed games to take advantage of the real estate.  So all you get is a blown up game.

The target for it, including me, honestly, I'm not sure who it is for, but I think that you were talking about aspirations.  I think these devices and that includes the Pixel C are very different from the Surface Pro because they're trying to bring the strengths of a mobile OS, of iOS, to a more work like environment.  And the strengths are simplicity and ease of use and things that aren't as obvious for, you know, that don't really exist as much in a desktop OS.  And that's why they don't I don't think they will ever merge iOS and Mac OS.  These are two different approaches.  The game is to try and make iOS capable enough to that it will be able to to to accomplish a lot of work tasks without making it as complex as a classic desktop OS.  And that's the ultimate goal.  If they manage to do it, I think there might be a lot of people who are interested in getting an iOS device, a big iPad Pro, for example, so they don't have to worry about managing a full desktop OS.  I'm not sure the current iPad Pro and iOS 9 are quite there yet, though.

Let's let's let's like get another iPhone out there that's plastic and maybe a little cheaper to make and maybe market it to some folks and see if anybody bites.  Nobody really bid on that.  This feels similar in a way.  But yeah, the idea of tablets ultimately becoming more productive, which, by the way, something Microsoft has been touting for a long time.  I actually really like the new Surface Pro 4 and the Surface Book.  I love my Surface Book.  It's so good.

Transcript:  Yeah, I think this is Apple so far down.  Yeah, they're just in too deep.  Right.  iOS has been all their touch innovation.  OS X, honestly, as you know, great as it is, I use it on my work computer.  It still looks basically the same as it did when it came out in 2001.  Like they're like really dedicated to this desktop interface.  I'm wondering if we'll even ever see another full-fledged desktop OS that doesn't look like anything from OS X from Apple or is the goal to just push iOS to eventually be that thing and keep this OS X design as their main desktop interface going forward?

Transcript:  I think, you know, imagine if iOS was pushed enough, as I was saying, that it could do everything you need because I'm guessing, Leo, you can do everything you need.  It's an iPad.  There's no file system.  Well, I mean, with the cloud, there is kind of a simile.  It's better now than iCloud was, you know, three years ago.  And you see this split screen.

And also I will say though that Joanna, WSJ's Joanna Stern reviewed it and she said she was able to export video faster on the Pro than she was on a MacBook.  But for the most part though, I still think it's, you're more efficient.  At least I feel like I would be more efficient having a full laptop rather than, rather than how that's set up with the mobile operating system.

But Jeff, you know, I mean, I feel like there's a certain masochistic thing where I see people like Christina Warren and Joanna saying, I'm going to use this as my only computer for a while.  And yeah, of course you could do that.  But it's a little masochistic.  It's like, yeah, but it's going to be a little bit of a struggle.  Why not just use a laptop?

If you go to Google, the last two years at Google, I tried to complain about things that weren't in the web.  They said Web, Web, what are we bothered with that?  The future is mobile.

And I like to have multiple things open, even multiple screens if possible.  And that's just easier on a desktop right now.  And I definitely understand the need to have a mobile experience.  And even when I go to events, I bring my laptop, but it can be cumbersome and just takes longer to boot.  And there's various things, or it's battery.  But right now, you're right.

I mean, I just also feel like, though, Apple didn't do a whole lot to accommodate this larger screen.  These icons, look how spaced out they are.

I'm really interested in seeing how Microsoft's Windows 10 phones handle that continuum feature, which lets you plug in the phone to monitor and use as a full desktop.

It's been integrated in the previous devices, so we sort of know them already.  But I think everything was done for this and the apps being blown out and not making use of the real estate.  That's exactly how I felt about the first iPad.  And I kind of got used to it. I thought the icons for the apps were very small.  Yeah, I think we'll get used to that.  The simplicity in this case might be a feature that is willfully designed.  It might evolve as well.

Transcript:  You're over here playing games and I just I don't think that gamers, a lot of gamers are going to go out of their way to spend all this money on the Pro.  I feel like Apple at least was thinking that it would be for more creative people who will take advantage of the stylus or other people in the enterprise or whatever.  But I just wonder if gamers, the people playing those games are going to spring for the most expensive iPad on the market just for games.

Transcript:  And the difference between this one, which is great, a big deal in productivity between this one and the iPad Air 2, which is the only other one that can do the split view currently.  So two apps side by side is that the screen real estate isn't big enough for the iPad Air 2 to have iPad mode apps side by side.  What I mean by iPad mode is that, for example, on the let's take the example of the mail app, you'll have the list of emails and in a column on the on the left.  And then your email that you have selected to read on the right of that screen.  And if you switch that to side by side mode, if you do half and half, you're going to be in iPhone mode, which means you can either have the list of emails or the email you have selected.  And the iPad Pro can run two full iPad mode apps at the same time.  So that what it actually means is that on the iPad Air 2, you can't really use it for productivity that split mode robs you of the big attractive feature of the UI.

Yeah.  I feel like the Pixel C is maybe the first look we're going to get at what could be Android meets Chrome OS.  It's ostensibly an Android device, but it also when you look at it, it looks a lot like a Surface or, you know, an iPad with the keyboard case.

Transcript:  I've talked to a lot of Microsoft reps about, you know, what is the deal with the Surface keyboard pricing?  Because it seems when you get to the point where the Surface Pro 4 is $899, you have to spend another $130 for the keyboard.  A student, somebody who's been saving up for the Surface, might not realize that and feels a little disingenuous.  What's interesting is that the Surface competitor is coming out from Lenovo.  I think HP and Dell as well, like they're going to be including their keyboards, you know, at prices cheaper or the same as the Surface Pro.  So that's getting a little weird.

Transcript:  Yeah, Microsoft's careful to, you know, not step on their dance partners toes too much.  Keep it at arm's length.  Let's take a break.  Let's take a break.  When we come back, I want to talk about what at first everybody was all excited that T-Mobile's offering free streaming, binging on video.  And then TC Sautek writing in The Verge took all the wind out of my sails.  T-Mobile, he writes, is writing the manual on how to F up the Internet.  Is it a net neutrality problem?  I'm going to talk in just a sec.  But first a word from our friends at Citrix and Citrix Go To Meeting.  It is so true nowadays that people, our businesses, companies are distributed all over the place.  You know, we're doing app design with people in India and Canada.  We're doing web design with people in Austin.  And it's really important when you're doing that, that you're able to have these meetings.  This is where you get together, resolve problems.  You have a rule.  No more than three emails back and forth.  But then you got to have a meeting.  Then you got to talk.  It's a way to cut through the Gordian knot and get stuff done.  It's also a great way to brainstorm.  A great way to meet people.  And then you might say, well, you can't meet people in Go To Meeting.  Yes, you can.  Because Go To Meeting not only shares screens, but it also shares video, HD quality webcam video that makes it really feel like you're in the same room.  It really is an experience of being together.  And you can do it from any computer, tablet, smartphone, no travel, no traffic.  You get things done.  You're fast. You're efficient.

John Ledger, the CEO of T-Mobile, had another big event.  Their Un-Carrier X event.  Anybody go down to that?  Was it in Los Angeles?  I was invited.  But I decided to pass.  And actually, I guess I'm glad I did.  They announced BinJohn.  So T-Mobile for...  And I'm a T-Mobile customer.  One of my phones on my Nexus.  No, no, that's a Google Fi phone.  Now I don't remember.  You know what's annoying?  Google Fi uses T-Mobile, but you don't get the benefit of like these music stuff and the BinJohn stuff.  You do get the international travel benefit, right?  So I like T-Mobile.  My iPhone's on T-Mobile.  And at first I thought, oh, this is great because, well, I've already been using...  When you listen to Spotify or Google Music or Apple Music on your iPhone, it doesn't count against your data cap, right?  You don't have to pay for it.  Now they're doing the same with Netflix, HBO Go, ESPN, Showtime, everybody but YouTube and us.  And at first I thought, oh, that's great.  But then I thought a little harder and I realized, isn't that basically fast lane?  The scheme is called zero rating.  And it really is a threat to the open Internet.  So this is hard because when you're a consumer, you go, yeah.  But what you forget is that favors and it's making T-Mobile, the judge and jury on this, favors certain incumbents over the other guys.  Now I think what we should do as an experiment is apply, say, as twit, right?  And say we'd like to be part of BinJohn.  Ah, yes.

Transcript:  Do I have to pay him?  I should really apply.  Because if it is really neutral and anybody whose streams can apply, I would want to be on that.  That's the whole net neutrality issue that T-Mobile gets to be the decider on Netflix.  You're OK.  Twit, no, you're not so OK.  And if you're a T-Mobile customer, you're going to watch a lot more Netflix than you're going to watch Twit.  It's the antithesis of net neutrality.  All bids are not equal.  But good luck convincing anybody of that.

Transcript:  So there's zero rating in some countries is necessary.  You know, it's the whole Facebook's internet.org initiative.  Right.  And I think in those cases, there is a heavy debate on whether or not zero rating is OK.  And if we can make an exception to net neutrality in those cases.  I have a much harder time accepting it in the case of T-Mobile.

Start time: 6590.93
End time: 6611.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and listen to one of our chatters.  Little Bobby Salsa writes, the opposition to Bin John just shows that net neutrality advocates don't actually care about consumers.  They just like criticizing ISPs.  And that's the problem.  It's hard to explain to people who are getting free stuff why that's a bad thing.  It's like a free speech argument almost.

Start time: 6613.46
End time: 6642.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In the sense that you're defending something that doesn't sound right at the first but is necessary as a principle.  Yeah.  And everything that's going on in universities right now.  Well, that hurts our feelings.  Well, OK, but debate is part of democracy.  Well, how could you let anybody hurt our feelings?  Well, because that's that fitting free speech.  And it becomes a paradoxical argument.  Yeah.  And the same for this.  It's a paradoxical argument to say that, yes, you may not get that Netflix movie for free, but you're defending a much higher principle.

Transcript:  Well, and if you want the next Netflix.  Exactly.  Yeah.

Start time: 6649.42
End time: 6726.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's basically if those kinds of rules had been put in place at a time when video wasn't common on the web, YouTube would just not have existed at all.  And very likely, you know, let's imagine a world where this is the norm.  It's very likely that video streaming on the web would have made be made incredibly more difficult.  And we wouldn't have Netflix today because as we've seen, the ISPs are brought into this level of consumption that the video streaming requires kicking and streaming, not streaming, which would be more appropriate.  Kicking and screaming.  And they have done now it's sort of, you know, they've they've given up, kind of.  But they really don't didn't want this to happen.  They've been fighting Netflix and YouTube and everyone else to not upgrade their infrastructure or to make them pay for those upgrades.  And I can guarantee you that if that that that would have been almost impossible.  And to those students, tell them if you enjoy Netflix, it's probably because the open Internet and some level of net neutrality has made it possible for an incumbent like Netflix to exist.

Start time: 6726.08
End time: 6772.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, now they're going to pull up the ladder because they made it.  And it's very I think it's going to be very hard to it.  What would be interesting?  The FCC has rules against this.  What will be very interesting to see if is if they see it this way and if they enforce those rules.  And I think this is a little an interesting.  OK, you really want a conspiracy theory?  A very interesting play to put the FCC in a spot.  Yes.  If they enforce this, consumers like little Bobby Salsa will say, hey, I want the free Internet stuff.  You're not looking out for my interests because it's harder to understand the deeper principle and the deeper hazard if you don't enforce net neutrality.

And those are the people that are utilizing a lot of these sites, especially YouTube and Netflix and Hulu.  So that's what they're used to.  Maybe they don't really remember a time when it was as open of an Internet and maybe they aren't really bothered by it.  Yeah, yeah.

Transcript:  But they're they're basically reaping the rewards right of that past of life before the broadband era really took off.  Like it took us getting rid of, you know, minute fees for Internet access and broadband becoming basically unlimited for a lot of people for this innovation to take off.  And we're seeing history sort of repeat itself in mobile, right?  Because mobile still dealing with these bandwidth caps.  We've pretty much lost the whole dream of unlimited bandwidth on mobile, even T-Mobile because of this on carrier move.  They quietly raised the price of their unlimited plan by fifteen dollars now to ninety five dollars a month.  So that's the sort of like price you're paying for something like this to happen.  You know, it's just it's kind of scary.  And I don't know what it's going to mean for like the future of the mobile web.

Transcript:  So the attorney general of the state of New York, Eric Schneiderman, has said that's gambling and it's illegal and has shut down fan duel and draft kings.  Fan duel and draft kings both have implemented geo fencing technologies that prevent users in the it's a handful of states now that have banned this kind of including Nevada, this kind of fantasy football betting.  But I've also seen articles said that say it's really easy to use a proxy and just go right around them.  They're not trying all that hard.

Transcript:  They've gone after Schneiderman.  He sent out cease and desist letters on Wednesday.  They've gone to the Supreme Court to throw those letters out.  I'm not sure what the grounds are.  I guess the debate is does daily fantasy sports qualify as gambling?  Right.

Start time: 6973.22
End time: 7020.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, their argument would be well, this was their was a fan duel's argument was that it's a game of skill rather than a game of chance.  So when they go to the Supreme Court, when they when they present their case, they're going to present it under the premise that all of these people who win more often have more skills.  And they're going to prove that in various ways.  And it was interesting, though, because on the conference call before the operator started, it was only supposed to be pressed and before the operator stepped in and cut out regular people from taking calls, they they had to answer three calls from fans who, you know, weren't the most kind of educated questions or things like that.  So it kind of played into their argument, played against their argument a little bit.

I don't know what I actually don't understand their point.  I think I understand fantasy football and daily.  I mean, I understand that.  And it's betting like horse racing is betting.  But I think, Jeff, you're a good guy to comment on this.  Is this is this debate over all is a gambling or is it a game of skill really underlie the basic failure of kind of legislating morality in general?  Should there be laws against gambling of any kind at all?  Well, well, a few things there.

I think I think it's you know, you watch who buys lottery tickets near me and their poor people who can't afford to do that.  That's one level.  The other level is now I'll get myself in real trouble.  But hey, that's why I'm here.

Somebody who has a faster connection to the Internet can have perfect knowledge.  Milliseconds.  And it's just hopeless.  And so but I but I don't think I'll be honest.  I don't think any gambling should be regulated.  I don't think it should be I don't think it should be regulated at all, especially since the state's already doing it with the lottery.

Start time: 7213.02
End time: 7250.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

And the only it's kind of it's kind of like smoking.  You don't want to do some kind of prohibition because we know how these things go.  You know, we've seen many examples, but you still want people to have access to it, but you want a relatively controlled environment for it.  And I think that's what it's about.  If if you completely outload gambling, there would be a lot of it would go underground.

But I think it's like it's like marijuana laws.  It's it's a vice law that comes from a puritan point of view that just doesn't it doesn't.  And what you're seeing, this argument shows how it doesn't hold water.  Is it a game of skill? Is it not a game of skill?  If it's a game of skill, it's legal. If it's not a game of skill, it's illegal.  How do you even decide that?

Transcript:  Well, I think the market well, this is a longer conversation and I think a good one.  But I feel like the stock market is perfectly well known that the stock market is rigged and that people who have inside information and there are lots of them have a much have have it are the only people have a shot at it.  But they've got to encourage people to think it's the American way that you can invest a buck and make 20.  And so that I mean, that's really that that talk about the con game.  That's the con game, because if those people don't put the buck in, then the other guys don't make the buck.  So, I mean, the stock market, that should be regulated.  Well, it is. Yeah, not very well.  It's regulated by the people who run it. That's the problem.  All right. I'm going to wrap this up with one last sad note.  But, you know, I was kind of sad that this wasn't more publicized.  One of the pioneers in mainframe computing, Gene Omdahl passed away this weekend at the age of 92.

Had the had a floppy disk, a three and a half inch diskette.  And his and his little daughter came over and said, Daddy, you 3D printed the save icon.  So that's what that's what's wrong with kids today.  Anyway, Gene Amdahl, who who was responsible for creating the System 360, the most successful line of mainframe computers in IBM's history.  I don't think even mainframe computers even even know anybody knows what those are.

So the Mountain View Police Department pulled them over.  How do you pull it over?  Well, there's no control.  Interesting as the officer approached the slow moving car, he realized that there was no one driving.  He there was a passenger.  So the officer asked the passenger how the car was choosing speeds and informed the passenger about vehicle California Vehicle Code 22 400 a about, you know, whatever.  Driving the right speed.  The self-driving car pled guilty to slow driving because they want them to feel friendly and approachable rather than zooming scarily through neighborhood streets.  No ticket. Robot voice that said I am guilty, guilty.  I am guilty.  No ticket was issued, not because there was no driver to give it to, but because the officer deemed no law had been broken.
