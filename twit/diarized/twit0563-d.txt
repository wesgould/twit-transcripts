And right down the street down here is Washington's headquarters, the winter headquarters where he and Alexander Hamilton were hanging out,  where the Schuyler sisters came down and Hamilton was like cavorting around the camp, you know,  with many, many ladies on a regular basis during the winter quartering in Morristown.

Transcript:  So I can't wait.  I tell you, don't tell your husband this, but I got to play with the PlayStation VR on  Monday.  We in fact, it's triangulation so you can see it.  We interviewed the Rick Marks, who's the guy in charge, been there for a long time.  And it's awesome.  But it's one of those.  Oculus is a little bit like this too, where you don't move around a lot.  In fact, the game that I got to play, you're sitting, you sit in a chair.  And so you don't need a lot of space.  But I have to say that's going to be the one to beat, I think, the one to watch anyway,  because it's going to have 50 games by the end of the year.  It was really fun.

Start time: 449.40
End time: 456.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I watched you play.  Did you see it?  Yeah, I did.  I did.  I did it when my husband wasn't watching because he's been dying for the VR.

Start time: 498.79
End time: 510.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the camera.  So the idea is that you're going to have the same hardware you probably already have.  They do have a kit for $400 that has the camera and the Move to Moves and the visor.  But a lot of people will have it.

Start time: 511.48
End time: 514.11

Start time: 576.06
End time: 596.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The only time it looks cool is those amusement park settings I've seen.  Where they have like the foam board set up and you kind of like walk through like you're doing stuff.  I haven't yet see one of those situations where they look stupid.  Because they actually are moving through physical things and they're touching walls.  Sitting on benches like it's there.  When you're just sitting there floating in the middle of space, sitting in the chair, you look like a doofus no matter what you do.

Start time: 596.90
End time: 615.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think it's because of the controllers look a little bit more comical than cool as well.  They look like, you know, yeah, little balloon toys or something that you're trying to shoot things with.  So I think that with controllers that look a little bit less colored, multicolored, popsicle looking things.

Start time: 617.56
End time: 664.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I was just going to say this week, I was excited, but New York Times just wrote out their VR app.  And one of the cool things they did was they added the walkthrough, the visual walkthrough of Pluto.  They're talking about the aircraft, you know, took 10 years to get there.  And they built this like nine minute visual VR walkthrough in their new New York Times VR app.  So it's a standalone app. You can download it.  It asks whether or not you've got Google Cardboard so you can watch it just as a video.  Or you can order Google Cardboard and do it there and plop it right into the cardboard mask and then do the visual walkthrough.  And so I don't have the cardboard yet. I just ordered it.  I think I lost my other set of it. So my son was excited.  So we launched it today and he was just doing the video and holding it up and walking around doing the visual tour of Pluto for the first time.

Transcript:  See Miles, how old is Miles? He's like five, four or five.  Five. Yeah, he'll be six.  So that's to me what's most interesting. This is a generation that's going to grow up with this.  This just could be commonplace for them.

Start time: 675.46
End time: 704.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. Yeah. And for him, that was the first time he'd ever seen anything like that.  I mean, you know, using like using the accelerometer and using what was his reaction?  He thought it was amazing. I mean, he loves like Starwalk kids.  So at night being able to go outside and hold up the phone and see, oh, he recognizes certain planets to be able to get that overlay.  So, you know, just having that overlay over the actual sky and be able to see that was pretty cool.  So I'm interested to see whether or not this has a widespread adoption, though.

Transcript:  Nobody looks good playing video games. You look like a slack jawed beast.

Transcript:  First of all, you can see Mars from with a naked eye tonight.  So just use real world. Not as good.  Not the VR is good when it gets dark and look for a red dot.  This Mars. That's it. It's just a red.  You're part of the universe.  So in a box. And secondly, I am very athletic when I'm using my controller and I'm yelling at the screen.

End time: 758.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The best thing about watching is funny when you talk about that, like, because people get so into it and you see people throwing their controls and they get so angry.  Yeah, they're so tense, depending on the game that they're in, like a fighting game or sports game.  You can just see the weight of the world in their body language.

Start time: 758.72
End time: 787.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's amusing. Well, that's what's interesting about VR is that.  And Georgia, you probably can explain this, but it doesn't take a lot of cues.  You know, obviously, VR is not super realistic. You're not feeling anything. You're not smelling anything.  You have sight and sound is about it.  And yet, even with the barest of cues, your mind takes over and immerses you in it to the point where it is hard.  When you if you've done a lot of VR, when you take off the visor, it's extraordinarily disorienting to enter the real world again.

Start time: 788.78
End time: 860.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, our our our brains are made to be exceptionally visual.  We spend most of our brain power on visual cues over sent, even over touch.  And so because of the immersive experience of being able to see something that's all the way around you, our brain really believes that.  And some of the coolest applications are now not just dealing with like, as we spoke before about like a spider phobia and dealing with that through virtual reality,  but also we can go through social anxiety and dealing with paranoia through a virtual experience.  And so there's some new applications coming out to help people deal with, you know, being able to do an interview by making it much closer to real life without having to have like it just being you and the same therapist, because that's not very effective.  And so I think that that immersion to it really does work.  And we've even done studies with people with phantom limb syndrome where they have a missing arm that has pain, has neurological pain, even though the arms been cut off that it really hurts or it feels like your hand is in a fist.  They don't have that hand, but they've been using mirror.  So they put a mirror in between.  So you see the mirror image of your other hand releasing from that pain and been able to feel neurologically better on the other arm that isn't even there.  So it works really, really well.

End time: 1081.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, nothing's better than making balloon.  Let's take a break.  There's a bit of a lot of news this week.  We really should get into it.  We've got the Google I.O. and a considerable number of applications.  Actually, I think we're going to have a good philosophical conversation about this because there's some really there's two different ways to look at what Google did this week.  There's a little bit of Apple News as well.  Facebook security.  It's the usual suspects.  And I got a really beautiful thin laptop from HP that I want to show you that has one thing that just frosts me.  And I feel like it's a trend in the industry that I just I think needs to be ended.  So we'll talk a little bit about that.  This is the new HP Spectre 13T, which is gorgeous.  And in many respects, a brilliant idea, a real competitor, the MacBook with one exception.  But first, let's talk about stamps.com.  I don't want you to go to the post office anymore.  Nothing against the post office.  I always it's funny.  I have a very fond kind of feeling for the post office, I guess, because mail carriers would bring my toys when I was a kid.  Right.  I would wait for the mail carrier to come because I was going to get my Mr.  Potato Head that I ordered eight weeks ago.  Or and by the way, that means a lot of time waiting for the mail carrier or, you know, just cool stuff comes in the mail when you're young.  It's not bills.  It's cool stuff.  However, as you get older, maybe form different opinions.  And one of the last things you want to do is go to the post office and wait in line to buy stamps.  Stamps.com doesn't just eliminate that eliminates everything you would do at the post office.  Stamps.com lets you buy and print real US postage from your desk.  No postage meter.  No, just your computer, your printer.  You don't need anything else.  Just a Stamps.com account.  They'll send you some great stuff that makes it even better because you can print right on the envelope your company corporate logo.  It'll take your return address, the sender's address from your address book for sending out bills and brochures.  If you're if you're a seller on eBay or Amazon or Etsy and you're not using Stamps.com, you're really missing the boat.  Stamps.com makes your package look more professional.  You could print labels for any kind of mail or it'll even make suggestions.  Like, hey, you should probably send this media mail and save yourself some money.  I want you to go to Stamps.com right now.  Click on the microphone in the upper right hand corner and use our offer code twit.  When you do that, you're going to get $110 no risk trial offered.  Of course, it includes a month free of Stamps.com, but you get some other stuff too, including a digital USB scale.  So you never have to guess at the postage.  It knows exactly how much.  So you never do too little or too much.  You get a $5 supply kit.  You get $55 in postage coupons.  You can use over the first few months of your Stamps.com account.  I mean, this is a this is a remarkably good deal.  We use the digital scale here.  I think we have a video of Carly plugging in and it's as simple as it can be.  In fact, this is I think she's going to open the trial offer box.  You can see what comes in there.  Stamps.com.  Again, sign up today.  Don't go to the post office.  Just go to Stamps.com.  Use the promo code twit and get a four week trial.  110 bonus offer.  Everything you see in that box, including that USB scale.  Stamps.com.  Google I.O. was this week and I have a demonstrator of one of the things Google announced.  The new Google Home, which is actually a Glade air freshener, but it's roughly this size, right?  It kind of looks like that.

Transcript:  You know, there's a yeah, right.  That's the that's the hint that you're now a teenager and they put the Glade all over your room.  Spray you with spray down with Febreze before every every day.  They announced a number of things, but I think the overarching announcement is interesting.  So I want to know what your take is on this.  We'll start with you, Clayton, because there's some people said, oh, yeah, it's all me to stuff like Amazon has an Echo.  So now we have the Google Home or Facebook's got Messenger and bots.  So now we have a law.  Apple has FaceTime.  So now we have duo, you know, the VR visor looks almost exactly like the Samsung Gear VR and works pretty much the same way.  It's it in one respect, you could look at that and say these are all me to products and Google's late to the party.  The other interpretation is that Google has a secret sauce.  Marco Arment wrote this actually on his website, Marco dot org.  Google has this secret sauce is going to make every one of those devices and programs a leap ahead because they have been doing something.  None of the other companies have been doing building their machine learning and artificial intelligence over 10 years, gathering information about us, about how we use it.  And so all of these products will be superior to the existing products just because of that alone.

Transcript:  Well, this sort of idea that because the Echo came out last year that Google wasn't already working on something similar to this is ridiculous.  I was impressed with the overall keynote.  You know, in years past, if you think back to past Google Keynotes, it was a mess, like a hodgepodge of things, things that didn't make sense, things that really seemed out of touch with, you know, with its users, with it, with consumers.  I thought it was pretty focused and I thought it reflected, you know, the organization, this new alphabet organization under Pachai's leadership.  It's really focused on things that Google's good at.  I mean, Google now and we were just testing before the show, like even just testing sports scores and things with their speed with which you can return results.  The contextual learning, I think, has been far superior than anything out there.  Although, you know, obviously seeing what Amazon's been able to do with the Echo, Google had what the smart hub.  The queue or remember that?  What was it? What was the router?  Oh, the on hub router.  The on hub.  So they've been dancing around this idea of trying to bring everything under one umbrella for a long time.  I think we're seeing a better implementation of that.  Overall, I was impressed with the keynote.  What about you guys?

And then we heard anything about it since then.  Then AlphaGo beats the world champion.  It's like, oh, never mind.  Yeah, never mind.  Marco Armit wrote on Marco.org.  Marco is well known.  He started a Tumblr.  He's written great apps, including Instapaper and his latest podcast app, which is overcast.  He said that this is actually a risky moment for Apple, that Apple might be faced with Blackberry's fate.  Blackberry was the king of the world until the iPhone came out.  But because Blackberry hadn't been doing the spade work all along over the years to make them to make the leap into smartphones, they just got eclipsed completely by the iPhone.  And he said this is the risk right now that Apple as well as Amazon and Facebook are facing because of Google kind of investing heavily in big data web services and AI for many years.  Here's the question I have, though.

Start time: 1352.86

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How many people are using AI?  How many people are actually using it?  Almost every person I'm out to dinner with or drinks, they're always shocked and kind of surprised that I can press a button and get a sports score.  Does anyone you know who's a lay person use it?

Start time: 1380.86
End time: 1426.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, I'm totally joking because I just got to be the opposite person.  In general, it's amazing to me how people get in that mindset and say, oh, Google's Johnny come lately.  And I'm like, well, Apple has done this for years.  They sit back and let every other phone have all these features for two or three generations.  Then they come in and it's thinner and lighter.  And I mean, granted, it actually works when they do it.  But they come in three years later after they look and see what they've done, learn from the mistakes and made a better product.  So why doesn't Google get that credit for doing the same thing?  And that's what I feel this is.  Duo looks friggin awesome.  I was sitting with a buddy who does face time.  That's all he does copy of FaceTime.  And people never pick up his calls, probably because he's annoying, but also because they can't see the stupid faces that he's making.  I'm sure that if he had that, he could make some stupid face that people were more likely to pick up his calls.

Start time: 1426.84
End time: 1434.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Google is essentially the same as Skype or FaceTime with this one exception.  Knock knock.

Start time: 1434.50
End time: 1468.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's neat.  I thought it was as personable.  You can feel something.  It evokes a feeling that makes you want to answer the call or not answer the call.  But it is better than a blank screen that just says FaceTime audio or FaceTime video.  And my second point is as far as automation, what he was saying, kids use it more than adults use it.  My daughter and her friends, they were number one.  I yelled them all the time.  So I'm asking me dumb questions.  So I hear them all the time.  Siri was this.  OK, Google was that like they're always instead of like instead of asking us as parents, I hear kids doing it a lot.

Transcript:  Oh, my kids love the echo.  They walk into the room and they can actually interact with my five year old, my three year old.  She can say when she's just turned four, but she can, you know, you know, she can ask the echo to play Christmas music or whatever they want to play.  You know, R.E.M. or whatever.  And it's just instant.  They're just like shocked and they start dancing around.  They have a dance party and I don't have to be involved.

Start time: 1488.94
End time: 1524.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, but it's great in that it's going to make it like it's going to be so much harder to hang up or not answer the call when you see your friend being making cute, sad, pouty faces at you.  Why aren't you picking up the phone?  So I think that for that, that's the exact reason to face them.  I don't know what I'm in for.  And so I think that they answered a question that we have perfectly.  And I think Owen said it really well is it makes it much more experiential and we don't have to worry.  What am I going to be in for?  And it's much harder to say to say no to someone directly to their face and not answer it when they're like looking going like, hi, please answer.  I really need you.

Transcript:  See, I was anticipating really a lot of pushback over all of the things Google's doing.  I'm you know, I'm all in on Google.  I am I fully embrace our future overlords.  But I I can understand people saying, well, now you're putting, you know, an array mic in every room of my house that the NSA could turn on at will.  And it has, you know, I can hear a pin drop in my in my house.  You're putting you're putting well, for instance, one of the complaints about alo came from Edward Snow.  Nalo has strong encryption built in.  It has the signal strong encryption from the open whisper system systems that WhatsApp has as well.  I mean, it's good, strong encryption.  But it's not on by default.  You have to say I want to go into incognito mode.  And Snowden said, no, it should be on by default.  But I feel like if you want to choose that, there are plenty of choices like signal and WhatsApp and even incognito mode.  You're not going to get the AI in alo, which is their messaging app, to know about you and listen to you unless you don't do that for a while.  So I'm willing to trade that privacy, especially since I don't really care if people.  All you have to do is ask the pertinent question.

Start time: 1639.40
End time: 1652.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

I mean, you'd be mining for a year to find half of the applications we're talking about.  So after you figure out who you trust, the next question is, when's the last time you committed crime?  Because I myself is a former criminal and sometimes future criminal.  I know better than to use objects that might talk to the NSA, FBI or the police.  Like I said, you actually my driver's license right now.  It doesn't have my home address on it.  You cannot find me.  I'm in the Batcave.  So criminals know better.  I'm not saying I am one.  I'm just saying I might be one.  But getting the future.  Anybody so motivated can do it right.  You would know better.  Yeah.

Start time: 1703.86
End time: 1775.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that the point of that, like, and I understand the thoughts of like, if you're not doing anything wrong, then you shouldn't have to worry about it.  But it's not just about that.  One is we should never have to give up our privacy in order to have a really cool feature.  So and the second thing is that it can be used against you.  So everyone probably has something on them that they wouldn't want other people to know what kind of nefarious websites they serve, what type of people they talk to, what are their basic interests and that can be used against you in order to gain control.  And so I think that there's something really dangerous about giving up your privacy so effortlessly.  And unfortunately, by nature, people are made to want to have things easier more than they'll think ahead.  So we'll save off.  We'll sell our future for right now.  And that's the way that we are.  And so because of that, because there's so many cool features on Aloe, you'll be like, oh, you know what?  I don't want to turn on incognito mode.  Then I can't do any of the cool things that I want.  And now it's not just finding out about what you do, but also your mannerisms, the way that your patterns of speech are, the things that you enjoy, the things that you don't enjoy, your political alliances, where have you traveled to?  It's getting really intrusive.  And I think that that's dangerous.

Start time: 1776.80

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's an interesting actually insight, a little bit inside baseball, but there's an interesting story about the engineer who worked on the encryption in Aloe.  He has a personal blog.  And, of course, as with all engineers at Google, he's allowed some leeway.  As long as it says in his personal blog, my opinions, I'm trying to find it here, are not those of Google.  But he said that he really wanted to push for default end-to-end encryption.  And so his name is Tai Duong.  He was actually a hacker.  He or at least a white hat hacker who came up with a number of serious flaws in a variety of technologies.  He published on his blog, the burning question now is if incognito mode with end-to-end encryption and disappearing messages is so useful.  Why isn't it the default?  In other words, lobbying for that.  Those paragraphs about that have been erased from his post.  And his title has been changed from Tai Duong is working on encryption at Google for Aloe to was working on encryption for Google at Aloe.  But what's interesting is that Google is sensitive to this.  I think you're not going to get.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I mean, so here's my thought.  And this kind of goes back to what Marco Armit was saying.  Apple chose a long time ago and has doubled down on it since to go the privacy route.  We're going to sell the fact that we are not collecting data on you.  We don't want to know anything about you as one of the features of our operating systems and our devices.  Google's always gone the opposite direction, saying, no, but the more we know about you, the better we can help you with things like the Google Now cards.  And is Apple going to paint itself into a corner?  Will Siri eventually ultimately be very limited because of Apple's stance on privacy?  And can Google go full speed ahead?  And then the question is, are the mark is the market going to weigh in on in favor of privacy and go with Apple or in favor of convenience and go with Google?  And I think those are unanswered questions at this point.

Start time: 1908.75
End time: 1921.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What are the limitations?  I mean, what are the you dive into some of the limited?  First of all, I think Siri is just behind just because it's behind, not because it doesn't have access to all of this data in a way that Google does.

Start time: 1921.58

Transcript:  Even if it does, Apple doesn't want to cross that creepy line, right?

Start time: 1924.90
End time: 1962.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. Of course. Yeah, they're they're all in on not crossing that creepy line.  So can they create a robust enough platform that people are actually using even beyond our kids in ways that are useful, like the assistant feature and being able to sort of preemptively see things that are coming up?  And we, you know, I think we're going to see more shades of this at WWDC this summer about how intuitive right Apple proactive and seeing things ahead of time and making them useful.  But are there I'm curious what the limitations are right now.  I don't mean other than the speed with which we're able to receive results, but that's Google has been out in front on that.

Start time: 1964.02
End time: 2010.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, just think about maps, for instance, Google, because they own ways is collecting huge amounts of data about your commute.  And of course, the creepy line, I don't find it creepy, but some might find it creepy is that Google Now cards will tell you, oh, it's going to take you seven minutes to get home.  And and maybe you want to leave now or we'll tell you you're going to be at the air.  I see you're flying out of town tonight. You might want to leave now for the airport.  I think that's insanely useful, but I think I could see reasonably some people might think that's creepy.  And I don't think it's something Apple can do very well because they well for two reasons.  One, they aren't collecting that information and two, they don't want to be perceived as collecting that information.  They don't want to cross the creepy line. That's going to be is that going to be is that going to be a market problem for them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that in the end, everyone wants to have a virtual assistant that's really going to be able to help them.  People can't afford to have an assistant to be able to deal with that.  And in the end, our level of stress will be lowered if something can help us out.  Say, listen, you know what you have to, you know, appointments at the same time, you're going to have to leave this time to be able to arrive there.  And so I think that unfortunately, most people would sell off their privacy to be able to have their day to day life be more calm.  And in most cases, it's not going to matter.  Most cases that will not be used against me.  I think that the danger is that we're so effortlessly giving that away that it should be something that we're discussing more often.  I think that most people are like, you know what, I'm not doing anything wrong, so I shouldn't have to worry about that.  But then, you know, as political, the political atmosphere changes, you don't know how that's going to be used to gain self or someone else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Most people live in a default world.  They don't even know what the privacy settings are until there's some big hub about it.  So they live in a world where, oh, my privacy is on price.  So it doesn't matter case in point.  Apple just doesn't have anything to sell.  So them collecting data on you isn't as effective as I bought a tile from Best Buy.  And they asked me, did I want my receipt emailed to me?  And they emailed me my receipt.  And now for the next three weeks, everything I open on a web page is going to say tile by tile.  And I'm like, idiot, I already bought one.  That's why I have the receipt.  And that's the power that Google has to push things into your face.

Start time: 2103.80

But I can't get annoyed at it because I'm using a free service and the services service I don't pay for.  And they've got to make money.  And if they think they're making money off me, buy something I already got the cookies to them.  They're going to figure out in a week or two that I didn't click it.  But Apple just doesn't have that mechanism to say, oh, I've been listening to you all week.  Let me sell you some cookies to an affiliate program that I've got set up.  They have no way to benefit from it.  So that's why they're so gung ho on.  We're going to sell you products that don't sell you to the world.  You're not for sale.

Yeah, that would be bad.  But that's a hypothetical risk that hasn't happened.  And in fact, if you think about it, one of the reasons life insurance companies ask you so much information before they give you life insurance is so that if you lie about anything, they could deny you your your payout.  Oh, he said he didn't smoke.  But you know what?  We got video of him smoking.  They know plenty about you already.  I don't think that's a hazard.  But you make a point.  And yet, if that does happen, isn't it going to be too late by the time that happens?  You know, what if we get an authoritarian government that decides to start using this against us?

Transcript:  Well, because this has a very fairly sophisticated array mics in here that aren't is just not like the microphone on your smartphone.  This is a microphone that can hear everything in your house.  And what we don't know and could very well be happening, we just don't know, is national security letters could be going out to Amazon saying, oh, by the way,  we'd like to turn on the Echo at 140 Keller Street and listen for a while.  Would you?  That's the most frightening of all of us.

Start time: 2439.48
End time: 2470.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that could be happening right now.  We just don't know.  Because we're opting into these technologies, right?  We're buying and choosing to put an Echo in our home or not or turned it off.  In the case of Owen, we have all these other devices that we choose to plug in and we were opting in on these different websites and obviously Google Now features when we  or as you mentioned, a lot of its default.  So we're not necessarily opting into a lot of it.  Some of its on by default.  But with the government, that's an entirely different animal and absolutely does not have a right to be spying on Americans.  You know, what point do you give up your civil liberties?

Transcript:  We need to have we need to have the government supposed to protect our rights.  And the funniest part is that they don't need to bug us anymore.  We're bugging ourselves.  We're like bringing all this stuff in.  So it makes it really easy for them.  And there's no way that that a government entity that would be able to to do good wouldn't say, you know what, let's just turn on this little tiny advice.  It's already there and it'll hear everything.  And let's be able to track whatever's happening for whatever reason.  And if a government is doing the right thing, then you wouldn't really have to worry about that.  But unfortunately, you never know.  You never know with people and power.  You just want more of that.  And if you end up with a government entity that might be more nefarious than you want, they may be using this for ill will and be able to control other political opponents so that they're not going to go out there because they know what websites you've been surfing on late at night and be able to leak that out, which would ruin your campaign and be able to tie up people's hands.  The FBI.  We know this for a fact.

Transcript:  The FBI planted bugs all around the federal courthouse in San Mateo County because they were wanting to hear privileged conversations between attorneys and felons or felons on trial.  So, and they did this.  And so now admittedly, you're in the public.  It's a little different than in your house, a lot different than in your house.  Nevertheless, I think this shows there's a strong inclination on the part of law enforcement to gather information any way they can.

We think that the government could get themselves together to listen in on the do something on somebody's phone.  Hold on while I sip my tea about that.  Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

I don't think we're so far away from.  I don't think we've never been into your history.  Buff Clayton.  We've never been far away from that risk that that's something we have to be eternally vigilant of.  The government that is not.  That's what the founding fathers were worried about.

Transcript:  Sting for crying out loud wrote when he was with the police in the early 80s.  Every breath you take is about Reagan's America.  That was Sting's.  That was exactly this idea of surveillance and constantly watching.  And so we've been this has been around for many, many years.  This isn't new under Trump.  This isn't new under Obama.  No, I think body cams, all of these things.  You know, is it making us safer?  How intrusive is it?  We're in public spaces.  Can people be listening in with microphones and all of these things?  Police departments, of course, want this technology, right?  There you see it around the NYPD.  You see it around New York City streets with police cameras and things all over the all over the city.  But in the end, it ends up being very often just citizen awareness that stops things.  Remember that that van that was parked in Times Square near New Year's Eve or during the Christmas holiday season?  It was packed with explosives or whatever.  It was because like a little bodega owner noticed it and called the police, even all of the cameras that were right there.  And one of those little sub towers where the police, they can go up in the ladder and hang out, didn't even notice it.

Transcript:  There there's a widespread use now of stingrays.  Local police all over the country are using these devices that simulate a cell tower and collect not just the cell phone information of a bad guy,  but everybody in the area, everybody goes by the stingray, joins the cell tower.  They can collect text messages.  They can collect information from your phone.  They have certainly know who you are.  This is spreading a net.  And so we see, in other words, law enforcement is certainly willing.  And I would say 99.9 percent of them are probably well intentioned,  but certainly willing to use technology to surveil us with the intent of making us safer.  And I respect that intent.  I personally.  OK, so the reason I brought all this up is I tried to raise some concern about what Google's up to.  But at the same time, I think that these are devices I want in my house.

Transcript:  You know, from the history perspective, right, Thomas Jefferson talked about fearing the government,  that the government should fear the people, the people should never fear its government,  that they should be always in fear of the people.  Right. And that when the government becomes too big, we should throw off the shackles of this government.  So the idea that, Owen, to your point, saying, you know what, that they're you don't think that they're competent enough or that they just don't have the wherewithal.  Yes, they're going through all of our emails.  But what the heck?  Are they really going to sit there and pour through all of this or create the algorithms to really study and find out, you know,  minority report style, pre-crime where things are about to happen?  I don't know. I'm troubled the fact that they computers make it easier anyway, that they have access to our phone calls or listening to anything we say.  You're right. You never know when someone's going to be using this information, as in the case of the IRS.  Look what the IRS scandal in the Cincinnati offices.  I mean, I don't care what your political persuasion is.  You know, Democrat, conservative, libertarian, whatever the fact that they were targeting conservative groups and actually limiting their ability at free speech and to be able to get money and to actually form organizations and the IRS was specifically targeting them.  That's troubling.

Transcript:  Now, on the other hand, I think alo, which is their messaging program.  I you know, you have encryption.  You it's not on by default.  I think that has some very interesting ideas.  The idea that you, for instance, this is where I think Google's doing something very intriguing.  And it's not just alo.  It's also the instant app feature that they kind of ended the keynote with as a quick mention.  I think what they're trying to do, and it will be beneficial for Google, is become an intermediate between you and your apps.  One of the problems I had with Facebook's messenger bots is that you had to subscribe to individual bots and then they annoyed you.  You know, I subscribed, as I mentioned before, to that weather bot and it just bugged me so much that I had to block it.  I couldn't turn it off.  I had to block it like a stalker.  And the way alo is going to work is you don't add bots.  You interact with bots by interacting with Google.  So you say, Google, what's a restaurant near me?  I need an Italian restaurant near me.  What are the best ones?  It tells you this.  Make a reservation at that one.  It then calls on OpenTable.  And if you don't have OpenTable installed, the instant app will load just enough OpenTable, not the whole app, just enough OpenTable to make a reservation and get back to you.  I think this is really interesting.  I think this is a kind of a two things.  It's a new form of search.  Google, of course, the king of search, had realized and they said this at the very beginning.  Sundar Pichai said this.  The 10 blue links are not search anymore.  That's not what people want anymore.  It's a new kind of search that's more interactive, more talking to an agent that's working on your behalf.  And it's also a new way of thinking of your devices.  In the case of a cell.  And apps.  Yeah, because you don't need apps.  You just write your cell phone now becomes your do everything device and it calls upon the skills it needs.  It loads the skills it needs ad hoc as needed.  I think that's a revolution.

Start time: 2936.93

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it could be.  I think the future was apps.  And then we have 30 apps from one company that all do different things.  Right. Messenger.  Then you have Facebook pages, Facebook mentions, Facebook Live, 30 apps from one company.  And this is putting these overlays sort of circumventing the open web, but also not having you have to open all of these different apps, but pulling out the best parts of these apps.  And we started to see this over the past few years with Apple as well and iOS, you know, extensibility and being able to tap into certain certain features.  I think it's one of the best things to happen to mobile since the beginning.

And the other hand, we know as well as anybody, the risks inherent in using these tools.  How do we balance this? Oh, and what do you think?  You're the of all of us.  You have been probably the most affected by inappropriate government attention.  You get you've been pulled over how many times this year?  Six last year, 13 for driving while black.  Pretty much 90 percent of the time, because you're a big African American driving a nice car in a nice neighborhood.  Yeah.

Start time: 3035.52
End time: 3076.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  So like that's what I was saying earlier, like as far as I'm concerned, not to pull the black car, but people of my nature have been used to the government doing things to them and being on top of them and secretly doing stuff.  For history and a lifetime.  So I know that they're doing something I was supposed to do.  I try not to worry about live my day to day life.  And I know that if it ever gets bad, when people say the rioting and protests and all that kind of stuff, I know that there's a fire in people's hearts that if the government went too far, we will burn this sucker down and it would look like Batman Dark Knight.  And we would rise up against the overlord.  I do have you know what?  I do have faith.  I do have faith.  I hope it doesn't come to a red dawn.

So, you know, everybody has their own opinion.  But at the end of the day, when all people are oppressed at one time, that's why all empires have fallen.  You know what I mean?  That's right.  America's looking pretty good right now, but you tell me one other empire in history that has not come a-tumbling down.  And when greedy gets too greedy, then the needy gets super needy.  But I would also point out.  Yeah, look at Greece.

Transcript:  It's good.  But shouldn't we fight for more?  I think that everyone still has a right to be able to surf whatever they want to surf.  And it shouldn't be preeminently, you know, dealing with what you might do.  It should be what you have done.  And so I think we should still be informed and be able to say to our governments,  this is not something that we think is acceptable.  So that they don't go too far.  And we have everyone being able to feel that freedom of not having to be creeped out about their echo in their house.  Which I'm with you, Owen.  It creeps me out.  I don't have one for that reason.  Really?  I don't like it.  Yeah.  I don't even like having Google know my location on my computer or every time I surf the web for somewhere  and I always sign out of Google and then they add another look, you've been looking at kites.  Here's some other kites.  I'm thinking, you know what?  How did they know that?  This still bothers me.  Yeah.

But what if they go in there and they see, OK, well, you smoke weed and they find a picture  and they find a picture you smoke weed.  They're like, oh, you don't have to look far.  I posted one on my Facebook page or like again, I think of crazy things like, you know, there  are perverts in the world.  Right.  So what happens if you get mistaken as a pervert because you've got pictures of a child?  Oh, it happens to be your nephew or niece.  But this person has a hard on and wants to put a case against you.  And they feel like I just think all the outlandish things of why now I can't even use my fingerprint  on my phone and get on my phone quick because I don't want anybody looking through my phone.  You don't you don't use fingerprint?  No, I got I always tell myself a criminal or not.  I got I got I got I got taken to the police station.  I had a warrant out because I had a ticket.  I was in the hospital. I missed court.  It was fine. I wasn't doing anything criminal speed.  But when they took me in, I was like, well, I already paid the bail and they took me in  anyway because the system was messed up.  The friend print me and the guy's like, oh, unlock your phone.

If you said anything incriminating, I'm going to listen to it.  I'm like, oh, listen to the tape.  But he really wanted to get on my phone.  And again, long story short, I paid the bail because I was going to be going to court and I missed it.  And I had to pay work and everything.  But in their system, it said that I was out on this bail.  So I was like, why do you want to go on my phone?  Now, again, I don't have anything on my phone.  It's kind of a fishing.

So he's like, he's like, I need you to fill out this form that says I read you your rights.  I'm like, well, you didn't. He's like, I just need to sign it because he read it to me later.  I'm like, well, I can't sign that. And he's like, why not?  You're trouble. Have to sign it. Oh, you're not playing around.  When I know I'm in the right. Oh, you ain't going to Sandra Bland me.  Oh, I was like, I can't sign that.  He's like, why not? I'm like, because you didn't read my rights.  So after I got here, I can't acknowledge.  He's like, you have to sign. So you're saying I have to sign it.  You're forcing me to sign it because you can initial that and I'll say force to sign now sign it.  And they just walked out. Ten minutes later, I was like, oh, anyway, but you're lucky to get your knees.  And look, I tell you what, like I said, I am super duper polite.

Transcript:  The big problem Google has though, the big problem Google has right now  is they have abandoned so many great things.  They put out so many things like the on-hub router.  There's an example that had all this promise that never materialized  that there's going to be a lot of people are going to say,  well, I'm going to wait and see.  Is Aloe going to be great?  Is the Google Home going to be great?  I'm going to wait and see.  Yeah, Google Glass.  The one thing Google...  Google Glass, yeah.  Google Glass wasn't that great though.  No, it wasn't.

Start time: 3817.52

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google also has the ability to, and the thing I respect is,  they do let things go to bring in new things  because when something hits, it hits, and then when it takes off, it takes off.  They usually don't beat a dead horse.  But the other problem Google has is they have no marketing budget whatsoever.  This duo thing was the first thing that I can think of that they've done,  as I said earlier, made me feel something.  Now, Apple, even though I'm sick of it and I'm force-fed it  and I understand it, they always make me feel like I'm going to be a better person  when I buy their stuff.  I know I'm still a piece of trash, but when I first buy this phone,  I feel like I'm better than everybody else that's not in this line.  Well, that's a great idea.  And that's what Apple does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, again, they try it.  I might buy it.  Again, the problem is they don't make me feel anything.  Google, if anybody's listening to Google, listen, hire me.  I will make a commercial for you to actually make people feel something.  Even if they hate it, I'll make them feel something.  Y'all don't make people feel anything with all this stuff you make,  which is the biggest problem because you can't even bring people in and trick them to buy it  and then fall in love with it.

Cut off, gone, totally deleted.  No sign of it.  Amazon.  But, you know, to your point, where do you go to buy Google stuff?  I mean, are you going to have one on the front page of Google.com, the coveted homepage where we saw the Nexus for a short time, right?  Was it the Nexus there for a short time?  Yeah.

Transcript:  I think it's a great idea.  Free basil.  This is a place where people can just hang out and chill.  And I think that that's what people are missing.  People are so sick of buying things online with computers where we can actually go there  and actually meet other people and hang out and relax and not have to feel any pressure,  have some cool Apple products hanging out in the background.  You can check out the nice beautiful rose gold, but relatively useless MacBook and just enjoy.  There'll be music, there'll be bands, there'll be artisans.  You can go there and have a meeting.  There'll be places where you can hang.  This is an area where we can actually deal with community and have Apple products in the background.  I think it's brilliant marketing.  And those 42 foot glass doors, opening those up so that it becomes part of, it's no longer a store.  It's just an area you can walk in and forget where inside is and outside is.  I think it's great marketing.  That's my thought.  Leo, Leo, Leo, you are so wrong, Captain.

Well, the trick to get them to go outside is to bring the outside to inside.  To the grove inside the store.  There's trees and plants.  Have you not been to Japan and seen bonsai trees inside of a room and the spirit and the essence of life and the feng shui?  You don't know nothing about feng shui.  I don't want feng shui.

Transcript:  They just had a problem with that out here in Philly with Philly Jesus went to an Apple  store and apparently he went on there on a day when there was a new manager, somebody  that knows going on, but he goes in and charges his phone every day.  He's a homeless guy that walks around dressed like Jesus.  He has a big wooden cross.  Everybody knows him.  He's harmless.  But they actually had him arrested, which did nothing but raise his profile.  And he got to speak to more people about being Philly Jesus.  To your point, I know I was yelling at you, but I'm kind of joking.  They're doing it all to sell things and to make more money.  Yeah.  It's all it's all marketing.  Like I said, they're really great at marketing and invoking a feeling.  Like I said, if you listen to the way she was talking, she was pleasant and she was  happy and it invigorated emotion.  That's what they do.  And as far as letting homeless people in, they need to, but I highly doubt they will.  Of course they're not.  I had that incident, my own incident with Apple and Sandy.  What's that?  Four runner.  Yeah.  In LA.  So Apple is, you know, they're going to have to tip toe around that because the Philly  thing got a lot of buzz out here.  And people were upset because again, it's something that the guy did every day and they  actually let him go in there and charge his phone.  They didn't do anything about him.  They had a, I guess they have a time limit or something.  How much time you can spend in the store if you're not doing something.  So I just think they probably don't unless like they probably noticed that he didn't

Transcript:  But yeah, I think it's great marketing.  I think it's going to work well for them.  I think that it's a nice idea to be able to have a store where it's not unwelcoming and  hopefully it'll be welcoming to everyone.  I doubt that that'll be the case to that.  But yeah, I like the idea of it just being open.  You can just walk in.  You don't have to worry.  It's not going to be one of those stores where you feel like you go in and everyone's staring  at you and you're not, you know, able to enter there and be able to just chill out.  And I think it'll be great for the brand.  And yeah, they did this for marketing for sure.

You ask them because there's 42 million people just floating about.  So it's already there again.  It's just something else to market for them.

And then they, oh, we just put on new Chromebooks.  So everybody's got a Chromebook now.  So I'm sure they're killing it in the educational market.  What is the future of Chrome OS?

Start time: 4565.56

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I feel like this is the future.  In other words, more of the question is what's the future of Android in some ways, right?  Because although I guess you still need Android for a touch device, a phone or actually, you  know, here's what the question is, Clayton.  What's the future for tablets?  My wife was, Lisa was asking me this is, well, are they going to still sell tablets?  If you can get Android apps on your Chromebook, what do you need a tablet for?

Start time: 4591.23

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because you don't want a keyboard and you don't and you want the touchscreen.  You want the portability.  I mean, having a Chromebook is cool and all, but the whole reason tablets are awesome is  because I don't have a keyboard attached to it.  Somebody said.  When I'm going to go, I take my tablet.  I don't dislodge my laptop.  Even my air.  I got an air sitting right here too.  I barely even take this thing out anymore unless I'm traveling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You see, I'm the opposite.  Now I don't use my tablet anymore because like my MacBook, it's like as thin and almost  as light as a tablet.  But I appreciate the keyboard.  If I have to write, you know, a long email, tap it on glass is just does not do it for  me.  And I hate having to carry the tablets like they do have the light ones, but I liked having  a trackpad.  I just want it to be able to do all of it.  I want the touchscreen, the keyboard, it all there and to be light and to be able to travel  with it.  So now I use my tablet.  Does it make a difference?

Transcript:  I don't know what my staff has done to me, but it doesn't feel quite right.  Gazelle.  Gazelle.  Thank you.  Gazelle.  Gazelle is a great place to go both to buy and to sell your gadgets.  You know, if you have a bunch of gadgets sitting around, as we do in the basement, by the way,  it's like putting $100 bills in drawers and chests and boxes, just letting them gather dust.  You wouldn't do that.  That would be crazy talk.  Well, that's what you're doing.  If you're not going to Gazelle and selling your old gadgets, go to gazelle.com right now.  You'll get a quote on your iPhone, your iPad, your Samsung, your Surface tablet, your Kindle tablets.  They will give you top dollar.  And by the way, there's no commitment.  You go, you get a quote, you've got 30 days to take advantage of it.  So you just find out.  Just find out.  Once you decide, yeah, no, I'm going to take advantage of this.  And by the way, don't stop with one.  Just get everything in there.  You say, okay, I'm going to check out.  They send you a box.  They pay the postage on anything worth more than a buck, which is almost everything.  Even broken iPads and iPhones are worth something at Gazelle.  And they will send you a box.  And then they turn it around fast.  If you forget to wipe your data, don't worry.  They'll do that for you.  They'll also check the quality.  And sometimes, and this has happened to me now twice, they will up the offer.  They said, no, no, that's whatever.  Better memory, more memory than you said, or it's better quality than you said.  And they will up the offer, which is they have no obligation to do so, but they do it.  They're very honest.  And you're going to get a great price.  Then they'll send you a check or if you want it right away, a PayPal credit.  Or if you're the savvy shopper, get an Amazon gift card because they will bump that up by 5%.  So it's an extra 5% for you.  So that's how it works to sell at Gazelle.  But you might ask, well, what happens to the stuff they buy?  Well, the very best stuff they sell on Gazelle.  So it's a great place to get slightly gently pre-used, pre-owned devices.  They sell iPhones, iPads, and Samsung devices at Gazelle.  You can get an iPhone 6S, a 6S Plus, an iPad, Samsung Galaxy phone.  Every one of them fully inspected, backed by a 30-day return policy, sold without carrier contract.  But yes, of course, they work on all the major carriers in the US.  Three, six, or 12-month payments too now with a firm, which is really nice.  It's just a checkbox, a checkout.  Say, I want to finance this with a firm, and they'll do that too for you.  They also offer 12-month warranties on cell phones and iPads powered by Assurance Solutions.  And these are great warranties.  They cover water damage, cracked screens.  It's awesome.  Gazelle.  To buy or to sell.  G-A-Z-E-L-L-E gazelle.com.  Give it a try today, and we thank them so much for their support this week in tech.  We talked about Android on Google.  That's going to come later this year.  But if you have one of three devices, including the latest Chromebook Pixel,  you can turn on developer mode and get that starting next month.  I did that immediately.  Stop taking pictures.  And no, I'm just kidding.  Take all the pictures you want.  You want me to stand up?

So now I at least wait a week, see what grows through and then to get that secondary tier  update.  Because somebody was arguing with me.  What Apple has all this R&D.  Why can't they fix this before they send it out?  And I said, well, the infinite multitude of things are on people's phones.  One app might affect the update.  Something else might affect the update that they can't plan for.  So they do the best they can as a general surface.  And then, oh, 30 percent of population has this goofy app that affects the update in this way.  They patch it.  They fix it.  So it is what it is.  I just let other people be my guinea pig.  I don't need to be first and first first on anything like that anymore.  I don't want to have to deal with those issues.

Transcript:  I think a lot of people thought this was fake, actually.  The other story here is Facebook Live and of course the Facebook News this week.  But you know, like Facebook Live now being ubiquitous instead of it just being like,  you know, celebrities and tied to their pages and so forth.  The real push into live video for Facebook, what it means for businesses, what it means  for individuals, you know, where Periscope, I don't think really ever got the traction  that something like Facebook could have.  And YouTube, quite frankly, doesn't have the gravitas that Facebook Live is probably  going to have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, before shows, after shows, I know one of our weekday guys, you know, he does  radio for three hours after he gets off of the morning show.  So he'll kind of do live.  I know he's a workhorse.  So he'll do like a Facebook Live before he goes on the air, kind of like teasing what's  coming up and sort of interacting.  And so there's a lot of that.  I do four hours of live TV.  And so the last thing I want to do is like jump on and do extra things later.  But I think there's definitely the traffic that our pages get is just through the roof.  I mean, it's bonkers.  So it really works.  It really works.  And because it's tied to Nielsen ratings, you have to remember it's weighted, right?  It's not it's not a one to one.  So viewership to social media interaction.  But obviously people, the social media interaction, Facebook and Twitter and so forth is weighted  in all of that.  So it's possible for shows that don't have as much of a viewership to then capitalize  on their social media following and help them in their overall Nielsen ratings.

Transcript:  Get the Puck out of here.  So you know, I know that movie companies, for instance, are paying stars more if they  have a larger Twitter following, although that seems to me kind of dumb, but they do,  right?  That this is because it's seen as such a huge marketing tool.

Start time: 5657.22
End time: 5673.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's not dumb because they're real.  If it's real.  It's not.  So first of all, it's more real than anybody else is going to be real because enough dummies  want to know what the Kardashians are doing over what the president of the United States  is doing.  So let's just start off with that.  That's real.  OK, it's real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me OK.  We're not out of the bubble into the real world.  We're talking about superstars and celebrities and the money they get paid because they're  their own marketing company.  Right.  So case in point, Kevin Hart has thirty four million people.  He goes into the negotiations.  He has thirty four million followers.  I don't know what it is.  Oh, OK.  It's high.  It's really high.  It might even be that number.  Yeah.  So he goes into a deal and he says, all right, I want to get paid this for the movie.  How much additional are you going to give me for marketing?  And they said, well, why would we give you anything for marketing?  He's like, well, you have a marketing budget, right?  He's like, yeah.  He's like, OK, well, on my last movie, I drove this X of numbers to videos.  And promos and things I'm going to be doing.  And that's extra out of my time.  So if you're going to pay a promotional company, I got more than this fake promotional PR company  that you got going on.  And I'm the product.  So why not pay me that?  And at first they snubbed him.  He said, all right, I'm not going to work with you.  Then they came back.  They paid no money.  And guess what?  Him and the cast do things like where they go and they buy a whole movie theater or a  city tickets and pay for all the tickets and go sit down with them.  They watch the movie and they pop up and Kevin Hart's like, oh, how'd you like the movie?  Everybody gets a picture to take with him.  The other cast members are all over the city doing it.  And the first promotion is real and organic that they could do as opposed to the stupid,  oh, four out of eight people said, you're right.  Real dinosaur.  So, again, celebrities have real numbers, they can prove real real units like it's a  legit by the way.

Transcript:  We were right on.  This is Kevin Hart's page.  He's got almost 30 million, almost exactly 30 million followers.  And look at the big ad for his latest.  But you know what's the funniest thing?  There's a fake Kevin Hart who has a million followers.  It's good to be fake.

Transcript:  It's the overflow traffic.  It's the overflow.  Well, to answer your question, you know, you know, Nielsen rolled out their social content  ratings.  I think it was last year, 2015, but it was just Twitter.  Oh, interesting.  Twitter.  And then in January of this year, Nielsen rolled out, they added Facebook content.  Yeah.  So during programs, what they're saying is like, obviously 60% of people who are watching  these programs are sitting there with some sort of tablet advice while they're watching  these shows and they're interacting with them.  They're on Facebook.  And certainly if you like the Phillies or something like that, if there's a Phillies game that's  live, it allows you to interact in that way.  But they're looking at the overall tweets, mentions, at replies, likes, engagement during  those programs.  And then of course, these Nielsen social content ratings are weighted in your overall Nielsen  ratings.  So you can look at that.  If you're a show that doesn't maybe have as much viewership, but you've got a really  rabid fan base online on Facebook, who people are jumping in and really talking about your  show live, that can be really powerful to help move the needle.  Very interesting.

So if you have a good team that curates things that are about you and that are on message,  people are fine with that too.  What they don't like is you got a robo tweet coming out that says, Hey, I learned how to  bake 12 cookies yesterday and there was a mass shooting 15 seconds ago and you're on  this Autobot just tweeting out stupid stuff.

I have no problem with you having a team, Romany, Malco or whoever, or he's doing it  himself or whoever's doing it, but I just want it to be you authentic, at least in your  team.  So you said, okay, this is what we're going to do.  I approve this.  I approve that.

Transcript:  Yeah. And so I talk about I'm passionate about buy and hold investing.  I really think it's like the number one way to build wealth in this country.  Legacy wealth for your family.  And instead of like relying on, you know, hoping that your 401k is going to be there,  the average 401k is seventy thousand dollars when people retire.  So the podcast is really just totally devoted to  to buy and hold real estate.  That's it. Is we focus on how to start when people think they have no money.  There's so many so much private money out there.  Who people who want to earn like five percent interest do is like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, no, no.  So I'm in the Midwest where you can get a high ROI.  Like I won't touch a house unless I can do a minimum 12 percent return  cash on cash for the year.  Minimum 12 percent. Like in the stock market, people are moving  and buying like utility stocks right now at like four percent return if you're lucky.  So that's what you know.  And then by the way, you're building like assets for yourself.  And it's actually passive income.  Like every month you're you know, if you have one rental house,  OK, eight hundred dollars a month and double that.  Sixteen hundred dollars. Right. Three.  You know, and you that's how you figure out.

Start time: 6218.26
End time: 6227.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, that's minus 40 percent for vacancy repairs and expenses.  So really, it's closer to like 30 percent.  But I had to take that out.  So you want to take out 40 percent.  Not to get all financial.

So we'll have case study episodes with newbie investors,  guys that own like one rental property.  I interview those people. I have some experts on as well,  like some great finance experts like Mike McCallewitz, the author of Profit First,  which is, by the way, you should like be structuring your whole business  around the way that he implements finance.  And then also just monologue episodes where I'm just talking about my strategies,  things that have worked for me, how I've been able to buy 15 properties and so forth  and and build like this portfolio of properties for my family and to help others do it.  So many clients started with me three years ago, had zero properties now at 15.  And it's I love watching people like overcome their fears and face their fears  and actually start to take action and really like and build something for their family.  Most of my clients, I swear to God, overwhelmingly have just like had a baby  or they just stopped being selfish, you know, because they're not single anymore  and they have a baby for the first time or they just are a new dad.  And now that that's the thing where they start thinking about, well, wait a second,  how can I start doing something important for my family?  So anyway, not to derail things.

Start time: 6304.46

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Start time: 6313.96
End time: 6355.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, because I had a lot of fears of money growing up.  So like money doesn't grow on trees.  Did you grow up poor?  Middle class. But, you know, I had a lot of memes.  And I think a lot of people suffer from this stuff, thinking like money doesn't grow on trees.  We're not the Rockefellers.  You know, that's something we can't afford that all of those things were implanted.  So be careful the way you talk about money with your kids, because it stays with them.  Right. And so I talk a lot about that, too, trying to overcome those things and trying to.  I'm really passionate about trying to talk to inner city kids as well.  And because they're they're just thinking you have to get a paycheck.  Like, that's the way you build wealth.  And it's absolutely not the way you really build wealth in this country.  Going in and getting a paycheck is not the way you do it.

So it always works just as a layman from what my cousin,  who's talking about holding paper, he bought like four blocks in Detroit  and he got them for like four thousand dollars a piece.  Like he got a whole block with like six houses on it.  And the taxes and properties are so cheap.  He went and he fixed them up.  And now he's renting them out to people who who are don't have a lot of money.  Something to HUD and things like that.  But he's renting things off like 750.  But his mortgage on that house is only one hundred dollars a month.  So he's got 20 houses right now and he's making five hundred  dollars a month on all these houses.

Transcript:  I just want people to stop thinking that like, oh, I've got a crappy credit score.  And, you know, we have our self-worth tied to this artificial number  in this country. Credit score.  You go to other countries that don't even have credit.  You could fly to Finland and they don't even have a credit score, I don't think.  So you're like, what your self-worth goes up because you took a plane  ride to another country.  So you don't have to be tied to like traditional banks, which are the worst.  And using like a credit score to build wealth like Owen was talking about.  There's so many creative ways to do it.

We've heard rumors that it'll have 4K video recording  and you'll be able to control it with a watch.  But who knows?  The Chinese company will unveil the quadcopter in a live stream this week,  and we will bring that directly to your eyeballs or to your ears.  What else?  Apple says they'll end support for iTunes allowances this week.  That's also happening on May 25th.  Apple says after this date, any unused allowance credit will be rolled over  into your basic iTunes account.  So you better figure out a better way to pay off your kids for scooping dog poop.  Also coming up this week, earnings for HP and the IEEE  Women in Engineering International Leadership Conference in San Jose,  the annual GoTo Software Developers Conference in Chicago  and the Cloud Foundry Summit in Santa Clara.

I kind of alternate fiction and nonfiction.  So I listen to a fiction book and a nonfiction book.  Here's the deal. I'm going to get you two books.  You see, I have two credits. So this is fun.

Transcript:  Well, you know, because I'm a real estate freak,  if someone is honestly interested in that realm,  there's some great audio books on audible  that you've got to check out.  I mean, I think one of them is  The Millionaire Real Estate Investor by Gary Keller,  who built Keller Williams Real Estate.  He wrote it before the crash,  but had people actually paid attention to what he said,  we probably wouldn't have the crash.  And it's really like the foundation of everything  that I do in real estate.  It's a fantastic book.  He's written a lot of books.  I didn't realize this.  This book though is really, really excellent.  And it walks you through that.  And I'm also a huge fan,  the audio version of Rich Dad Poor Dad.  I've mentioned that to you before,  but such a great book.  If you've not read one of the greatest books  in business ever written  and really will wrap your brain around how to think about,  like if you grew up thinking about money  or struggling with those ideas like I did,  and sort of shifting that mental paradigm,  it's a great audible book.  Those two, I listened to like once a year.  Great books on audible.

Although he tells a great story about meeting Elon  and how Elon changed his tune about that.  It's a really, really good book.  Lisa and I have been listening to this together as we walk.  Another thing you could do,  see the thing is audible is great for your commute,  but there's other ways you can use it.  In the gym, Lisa and I like to take walks, take hikes,  and we'll listen to a book together as we're doing that.  But how do you do that?

Audible.com slash twittoo.  We thank them so much for their support.  They've been a support.  I think we're the first podcast in the world  to have Audible on as a sponsor.  And they've been a sponsor with us for many, many years.  But I've been a subscriber for longer than that since 2000.  Since before podcasts existed.  All right.  We can kind of wrap things up.  I do want to mention that BitTorrent has a new Apple TV app.  BitTorrent Live.  This is kind of intriguing.  They are including twit on it.  So another way to watch twit on your Apple TV  is to get the BitTorrent app.  They also have other networks, equally cheesy networks.  So that's good.  All in the same boat.  You might want to check it out.  BitTorrent Live.  It is free and it is on your Apple TV.  Let's see, what else is going on?  Want to get all the little bits here.  The Moto G.  Are they going to do, were you a Moto X fan, Clayton?  I feel like you were.

Start time: 7175.34
End time: 7256.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I feel like Moto, of course Lenovo bought them.  It's interesting because Rick Osterloh,  the guy who really, I think was the guy  who you can give a lot of credit to their success for,  stayed with Motorola after Google bought them,  stayed a little bit longer after Google sold them,  but now he's moved over to Google, which is interesting.  He's been running Google hardware division,  which means Rick will be in charge  of the new Google Home, among other things.  Lenovo has decided they're going to really go all in  on the less expensive Moto G families.  They've got three of those.  And I've seen some talk about a Moto Pure,  which is an interesting idea.  They made the Moto X Pure.  The reason they're calling it the Moto Pure  is it's going to be a pure Google experience.  It's not going to have any other stuff on it.  And I think there's a market for that in Android,  especially with the Android N coming soon.  People are going to want to be able  to get the latest versions of Android software.  Western Digital bought SanDisk.  Don't know what that means.  The hard drive market has just collapsed  into just a handful of companies.  16, get ready for this, billion dollars.  SanDisk, of course, makes SSDs and flash cards  that are probably the premier flash cards in the market.  $16 billion.

Start time: 7262.48
End time: 7290.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, a meeting.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Glenn Beck, oh, this was really a surprise.  So Facebook, after getting accused of steering  its trending topics away from conservative stories,  denying it, of course,  and there was only one anonymous curator  of trending news that claimed it.  And I don't think there's a lot of evidence  that Facebook was doing that,  although their algorithms are not as automated  as one would think.  There are humans involved.  And of course, human judgment means there'd be bias as well.

Start time: 7291.54
End time: 7309.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But there's a little something to that  when they come out and say,  we don't have people do anything.  And then the very next day,  they're like, oh, we have some people do some.  So that's a smokescreen in itself.  So when you put it in, there's only one person.  It only takes one person to snitch  for it to be somewhat of the truth.  Well, they took this very seriously.

Start time: 7309.40
End time: 7340.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a very good point.  And they took this very seriously  because the meeting,  I had a couple of close friends who were at the meeting.  And when you walk in and Sheryl Sandberg is there,  Zuckerberg is there, Peter Thiel is there.  They were taking this very seriously.  And they admitted as much.  They said, look, this is not perfect.  This is in beta.  There's a couple of different products at play here.  Obviously the trending topics on the right sidebar  is different from the newsfeed.  But yes, it's not perfect.

Start time: 7341.40
End time: 7358.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so unexpected, because Glenn Beck,  the conservative pundit who was also there,  lambasted the other conservatives there for a witch hunt.  He said, what disturbed me about the Facebook meeting?  And it wasn't what you would think about it at all.  He said, we are really kind of lynching Facebook.

Start time: 7359.76
End time: 7390.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, look at, all right.  So look at Glenn Beck, right?  He's had to lay off 40 employees.  His company is basically going under his network.  And maybe he sees an opportunity  to be amongst the millionaires.  Say, you know what?  Hey, is Facebook interested in some sort of olive branch?  Maybe wants to buy the blaze?  Maybe we could get some sort of streaming partnership  involved here, kind of come up with some ideas.  It was odd.  I mean, and I don't know.  I found that moment odd.

Start time: 7391.04
End time: 7397.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you think he parted ways  with his conservative colleagues on this,  that this was maybe an attempt to curry favor  with the other guys?

Start time: 7397.84
End time: 7406.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that was the sentiment that came out of the room,  certainly, that they were sort of in shock  that he was like kissing up to them as much as he was.  That was certainly the news that had come out of that room.

Start time: 7407.22
End time: 7421.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He said it was, this is the quote,  it was like affirmative action for conservatives.  When the conservatives start demanding quotas  and diversity trading and less people  from Ivy League colleges,  I sat there looking around the room at our side  in quotes wondering, who are we?  Who am I?

Start time: 7423.04
End time: 7456.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the real question is, who are you?  You're anybody that could be bought for anything.  That's not any meaning.  So when your ship is sinking  and you see somebody coming by with a cruise liner,  for the Lord's sake, yes,  you're gonna be down with the cruise liner  and you'll say anything to get aboard that boat.  But little did he know,  we already know he's a zombie and living dead  and they're not gonna let him on that boat.  But at least he tried.  I can't knock the man for a valiant effort to say,  hey, do you wanna have more conservatives on?  If you guys promote me in the blaze,  then nobody could really ever say  that you're squandering people's insanity  because obviously, if you're showing me,  you back insanity.

Start time: 7457.56
End time: 7485.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's no doubt at all that we have to be very,  that both Facebook and Google,  and to a lesser degree, Twitter,  carry a huge amount of responsibility.  They could, for instance,  easily throw the election one way or the other  should they decide to.  I think in every case,  these companies really wanna tow the line, don't they,  Clayton, or do you not think that that's the case?  Toe the, well, I mean, I think that-  Toe the line's the wrong phrase.  Go right down the middle.

Start time: 7486.72
End time: 7522.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, and I think that's what came out of this meeting  was, look, what we want is,  the way that I understood it  from the people who are in the room were saying,  is that Zuckerberg explained if we allowed  for truly the algorithm to do its job,  that's it, no human sort of curation  of what is really a trending topic,  also what is appropriate for the newsfeed,  the clickable, shareable things.  He said lunch would be a trending topic every day at noon  because that's what people are always typing in.  So every day at noon,  the word lunch would be the top trending topic.  Okay.

Start time: 7522.52
End time: 7523.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is there anything wrong with that?

Start time: 7523.80
End time: 7532.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, Twitter tried that, right,  until they started moving into Twitter moments  and realizing that,  does anyone wanna see all of these random hashtags  that are always populating?

Start time: 7532.92
End time: 7538.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But isn't it really risky if they start curating it  because bias will, in either direction, will come in.

Start time: 7539.70
End time: 7552.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, and it's apparent that whether or not this is true,  one sort of liberal on the algorithm panel or whatever  was just kind of trying to keep things off  of that trending topic list in a way.

Start time: 7553.16
End time: 7559.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe not even intentionally, just unconsciously.  You know, I mean, that's where your biases sneak in.  They're unconscious.  Right, yeah.

Start time: 7559.72
End time: 7613.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and we all have them.  Like, if anything is gonna be curated by humans,  it's gonna have bias.  You try to do an impartial news story,  you're still coming at it from a certain end.  I do therapy, I have to always check out  my unconscious biases that may come in to therapy  by my own views of the way that I'm gonna deal with it.  I think that, unfortunately, the AI is still,  we need to have something  that's gonna be overlooked by humans.  If not, it's gonna be really dull  and trending topics will no longer be useful  and no one's gonna look at them.  But I think that it is something  that we need to be checking for.  But yeah, like, you know,  to think that anything is gonna be completely unbiased  is impossible to achieve in the first place.  So, you know, they have to take a look at it.  And I think that, you know, good for Glenn Beck  for jumping on at the perfect moment  where, you know what, you end up supporting me  and that'll show that you are definitely not biased.  So I think that that was just a smart move  on to social engineering.

Start time: 7614.06
End time: 7647.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Facebook should have made a statement similar to that.  Again, it's the biggest thing when these companies  sit around with these expert panels, these PR people,  and they don't know how to tell the truth and to be honest,  and they come up with their schemes and their plans,  knowing that everything comes out at the end of the day.  If they would have made any kind of remote  to close statement that she said,  hey, sometimes we make bias, we have a panel,  we're gonna look into it, people accept that.  But when you come out and say, no humans,  and then next day you say, well, 10 humans,  like you just lose all trust factor,  I don't care about anything you're saying after that.  Because you're in your mind lying.

Start time: 7650.42
End time: 7713.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a great point.  And one of the other things that came out of this meeting  was the idea of diversity and this idea that,  well, if you're gonna have 21 year olds  out of Silicon Valley all sort of curating this news,  and it's gonna be group think.  And so Glenn Beck was blasting the other conservatives  in the room for sort of calling for diversity.  He thinks, since when did we start talking about quotas  and all these sorts of things?  And the other conservatives in the room are saying,  we're not talking about just skin color here,  like that diversity is actually deeper than ethnicity.  Oh yeah, heaven for a fan, you talk about skin.  Well, I mean, but like, Susan Rice for crying out loud,  national security advisor for President Obama saying,  look, the national security team,  it's all typically white male go to Yale.  And so maybe not the white part so much is as important  as that sort of group Yale think.  Like what if you had different viewpoints across the country  that were influencing this news feed or what's being curated?  So those sort of institutional biases,  but then also that life experience bias  might be completely different if you live in Dayton, Ohio,  than you do San Francisco.  This is the problem when you have,

Start time: 7714.12
End time: 7724.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I think this has happened.  Facebook moved from a social media,  social network into media media.  Right, and one of the biggest in the world.  Yeah, very powerful overnight.

Start time: 7725.30
End time: 7749.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the thing that drives me crazy about Facebook.  Facebook is playing this chicken and the egg game of,  when something goes wrong, oh, well, we're not media,  but then they live the rest of their lives  force feeding the ultimate media down your throat.  And again, when you talk about a diversity panel,  what's the diversity panel?  Are you gonna have one person in every state  of each ethnicity and each generation?  So you need a 30 year old, a 40 year old, a 50 year old.

Start time: 7749.12
End time: 7772.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's be fair though, Facebook's financial interest  is in not currying, not leaning one way or the other,  but giving you, getting you to read more Facebook.  That's all they really care about.  They're completely agnostic.  It should be if they're gonna do their business, right?  So they should show liberals, liberal stuff,  they should show conservatives, conservative stuff.  And here's the other thing.

Transcript:  What I was gonna say, also part of this,  the idea that the newsfeed needs to be curated.  I mean, you're curating it yourself, right?  By the people, if you, for instance,  if you only watch like MSNBC,  that's the world you live in, right?  You're gonna probably have friends that are like that.  And so those are the pages you're gonna like,  that's gonna pop up in your newsfeed,  it's gonna reinforce your own world beliefs,  your own world biases, right?  If you have a conservative viewpoint,  you might click on and like certain things.  You might have libertarian views,  whatever that happens to be.  You might like Gary Johnson, you might like, who knows?  But those things are gonna bubble up  in the top of your newsfeed.  You're gonna probably unfollow people you don't agree with.  So you're curating your own environment  and you're creating this your own cloud.  I'm curious how much of Facebook's influence  is in that world on the things that you're curating.  We know that they split test moods and sentiment  over the years and they kind of got some backlash  for seeing that people were angrier during certain times  because they were putting angry content and shootings  and things like that into their newsfeed to sort of test that.  And that's the kind of stuff that I find troubling.

Transcript:  Check any posts.  I was gonna say, just check any post.  I fully agree with what you're saying  but it also doesn't work that way  because if you go to a Hillary Clinton post right now,  you're gonna get the, she's a witch, she's heaven sent  and I don't know what's going on.  And you're gonna get that  for each one of these candidates right now.  So even though we're curating people out,  you're still being force fed certain things  that people just jump on because they're angry or whatever.  So there's still a really crazy mixture  that Facebook is pushing in your face  for what they validate as important content.

Transcript:  I think it's just really interesting  that people claim usually bias and want for diversity  when it doesn't include them.  It's rarely that people are really thinking outside  of the box and wanting to have different opinions  and different thoughts and having different ideas.  We feel really uncomfortable with other people  and other discussions that are usually similar to our own.  We don't really look at it heuristically  that we wanna see different feelings to that.  So it's kind of interesting that people don't mind  to have news that is their type of news  when they curate it, but then when they feel like  they've now been omitted from that dialogue,  now they're saying, you know what,  it would be really nice to have diversity.  But they weren't doing that for other groups of people,  other ways of thought.  And so you know that that in and of itself  is their own unconscious bias.

Although I did like all the presidential candidates  both on the left and the right, including Gary Johnson,  because I did wanna get more of that in my feet.

Georgia had a wild dream and it intercepted Leo's mind  and then we had a Chewbacca and we had an alpha hunt  for the woods and none of it is my fault.  I am here for you and the people see,  Clayton, you're over here doing it again.  You think he the Chewbacca mom,  people have lost their minds, but not me.
