It's time for TWIT, This Week in Tech, the show that covers the week's news, although this week,  I think we're going to cover the future because we have a peerless panel of prosnognikators here.  I think I misread that last word. Mr. Prosnognikator 1, John C. Dvorak from Channel Dvorak.  In studio.  In studio with us today, sir. And dressed like a somebody from the Renaissance Fair.  Exactly.  Precisely, sir. Also here with us, really glad to have her back. We haven't seen her in a while.  Veronica Belmont from Tekzilla and Core on the Sony platform.  Hey, Ryan.  Hello.  Good to see you. And sitting down the hall from her in the dining room. No, no, you're in the dining  room. He's in the podcast studio.  Correct.  He's got the goods set up. Ryan Block. Hey, Ryan, how are you?  Hey, how's it going?  From GDGT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or you can call it Gadget. That's fine, too.  Really? Are we okay with Gadget?  I'm all right with that if you're all right with it.  Oh, I love it. It is what it is.  It just makes it a little bit easier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I always, you know, I still have my GDGT, my Gadget incipio case on my iPhone from the party.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hot tip. I think we might be making some more of those soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Good, because people ask me all the time. They say, where can I get one of those cases?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've been seeing them around. Actually, one of our people went home to North Carolina.  Somewhere deep in North Carolina, he saw two of them on the street.  I was blown away. We only had like a couple hundred of those things made.  Wow, that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Welcoming somebody who's never been on TUT before. In fact, I don't think I've ever  met him actually. Robert X. Cringely from Cringely.com.  Bob, it's great to have you.  Nice to be here, Leo.  I asked to have you on because you're known for making predictions.  And here we are beginning not only a new year, but at least to my way of thinking,  beginning a new decade, although I've received much email telling me I'm wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So people get really worked up over that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Silly people.  Over what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Over the decade when the decade officially starts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, they do. Who cares?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If I did a decade beginning show on December 31st, 2010, people would really complain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The year 2000 was, of course, the bigger.  Yeah, that was the whole big thing.  Yeah.  And oh, God, you know, it's not really the beginning of the decade.  The decade starts with one.  Tell the computer that.  So anyway, so if it started in the year 2000, which is when we partied,  then the decade, we don't have a decade.  So there you go. We partied ten years ago.  And by the way, did you know that this was the first decade, I think, in,  uh, I think maybe perhaps in history.  Of course, there was no Dow Jones in the 1700s, but generally speaking,  over any 10 year period, decade wise, if you would invest a thousand dollars in the Dow  Jones Industrial Average over 10 years, you will have a little more money.  This is the first time you've actually would be down 50 bucks.  Fifty. Well, 50 is not bad.  Nine fifty or nine fifty or something like that.  Of course, you would have been down a lot more during the day.  Right.  But.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And that's also on average, too, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's just just if you invest in the market as a whole, is it the Dow?  Is it the Dow or the market of the whole?  The Dow? I think it was the Dow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I think it's from the beginning of a decade to the beginning of the next decade.  You could probably have measured it from 1925 to 1935 and had a bigger dip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Because of the depression and the crash.  Yeah, I'm not so sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not so sure. And I'll tell you why.  Because in 1925, the real run up that took place that caused the crash really took place from  about middle of 1929 to just the beginning of 1930.  And that thing really ran up three hundred over 300 percent.  The Dow Jones went up in that one small period.  So 1925, I believe the market was pretty low.  So maybe not.  Except it was in October of twenty nine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  John, what about are we on the Planet Money show here?  Here's another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I think if you went from 1923 to 1933, I think you might be possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Look, John is just looking back at his youth and these things that he remembers as a young boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When I was a kid, money was worth something.  We used stones for money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Dinosaurs owned the earth.  So is there something to be gained from this observation that the last 10 years have been crap?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're just fooling around with knobs and buttons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I am. This is the knob and button period of the show where I actually don't do anything.  And John and I just kind of fool around.  Kibitz.  Bob, what you been up to these days?  Cringely.com is the blog.  You doing any TV shows?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I love it.  Read it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I write it.  A few people read it.  I was at PBS for 11 years.  Left there about a year ago and tried to carry my audience with me and I managed to do that.  I've got my numbers back where they were before.  And that's great.  And I do that.  How long did it take you to get your numbers back?  Believe it or not, the new AOL and also.  I saw that.  I thought that was funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, we like AOL.  They provide bandwidth for this show.  So I'm not going to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, we love AOL.  I am not going to complain.  They provide revenue for my children.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, and to be honest, AOL, the new AOL is really stuff like Engadget,  which Ryan, you were involved in starting and that's a huge property.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's been a little over a year since I left AOL, but I miss it from time to time.  We'll have to trade some more stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It really is the new AOL.  It's very different.  Their new look is interesting.  It feels like a very different company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Everybody who I know is still there is I think they're having a very different experience.  That is, I mean, when I was there, it was still the Rondy days and nobody liked Ron or Randy.  And I really think that Tim Armstrong has kind of given the company a shot in the arm  and maybe an opportunity to right a whole lot of wrongs that have happened to AOL in  the last 10 years.  But we'll see.  You know, they've only been spun out of Time Warner for a little while.  You know, Tim has only been there for less than a year.  So I think, you know, bringing on people like Robert and, you know,  they got Saul Hansel from the New York Times too.  You know, these are some really, really great people.  They got Saul Hansel went there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He left the Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He did.  That was announced a couple of weeks ago, I think.  Huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He's good.  I always thought he was a very good reporter.  That's interesting.  So let's talk about the year, shall we?  And the decade ahead.  We do know some things that are going to happen starting Tuesday, January 5th.  Google is going to make some sort of announcement.  Ryan, I think it seems pretty clear this is going to be the Nexus One, the Google phone.  Yes.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm going to be there.  We're going to be covering it live.  But if it's anything more than the Nexus One, I think I'll be surprised.  It's looking pretty much like it's just going to be the Nexus One announcement.  Really interesting timing being that everybody has kind of planned their CES for the last year.  And then all of a sudden, two weeks before Google announces they're going to have this  little press conference and everybody has to rearrange their schedules.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Were you going to be going down Tuesday?  I mean, at least they didn't make it Wednesday or Thursday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I was actually, I had planned on going down Wednesday.  So it wasn't a big deal for me.  But a lot of my friends in the industry have had a really difficult time reshuffling their  schedules because everybody's, you know, if they booked a flight to be in Vegas on Tuesday,  then now they have to rebook everything and then go out to California and then...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  How big a deal is the Google phone? Is this important? I mean, Google,  I mean, they're going to sell it themselves, but they're going to service it through T-Mobile.  So it's kind of not that different.  It's just another phone.  It's just another phone. I mean, they didn't make it completely out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They've done this before. They sold the Android, the first Android phone, the G1,  as the Android developer phone one. I think it was what it was called.  And so they sold it themselves as their kind of developer platform phone,  their kind of flagship device for building Android apps.  If you needed some hardware and you didn't live in the US to get a T-Mobile device.  So this is not unprecedented.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Would it have been a bigger deal if they had sold this completely unlocked and compatible with not  only T-Mobile, but AT&T and other GSM carriers?  Well, that would have been a great situation.  Is that what you want, Veronica?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would have loved to see that definitely because I'm on AT&T right now.  And while I'm not in love with the service completely, I would like to be able to try  the Nexus One, at least beyond having just a review unit, which hopefully will get in the house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, it would be a shock to Apple. I mean, it would be a real shot across their bow to say,  hey, if you're an Apple iPhone user, just take the SIM out and put it in the G1,  you know, whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, unlocked it's going to be what? Probably around $600.  That's a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's an unlocked smartphone. I mean, that's pretty much how much all unlocked smartphones  go for. And they are going to sell it unlocked, I guess through the website,  very similar to the way they did with the G1. But yeah, I think what would be really interesting  is if this had the bands necessary to run on AT&T. It does not, as far as we know right now.  I mean, they could pull some rabbit out of their hat or...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We should say everything is speculation. You don't have one, do you, Ryan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't have one, but I've played with it and I know people who have one and  it does not have AT&T 3G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We've seen a lot of video of it. It looks like it's super fast. It's very thin. Are you played  with the tube, Veronica? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's super fast and the screen is unbelievably gorgeous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Better than the Droid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Wow, because the Droid is a better screen than the iPhone. The Droid is a very nice screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can see like the tiny, tiniest little pixels on there. It's very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What John?  Apple is going to refresh their screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, in fact, Apple may do it sooner than later. The rumor, of course, and we talked  about this last week, is that January 26th they've reserved Urbibuena Center for some announcement.  Any speculation, Bob? Do you know anything? What could they possibly be announcing on January 26th?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, the speculation is that this is the long-promised and ever-delayed tablet.  I don't doubt that that's part of it. I think there'll be more than that. One thing to remember  is that Apple always does January events, so that's not unusual. They'll have several products  and they'll pull something out at the end and it's probably this tablet. I don't think we have a  special reason to believe that these rumors are incorrect. It's about time. Hasn't it been like  three or four times that they've almost introduced this thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Somebody said that this will be Steve Jobs' last one more thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  How would someone know to say that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that seems a little speculative. I think the interesting thing to remember here is if this  does turn out to be true and they do do an event in January, what makes this different is that  traditionally their January product launches have happened at Macworld and they're no longer  attending Macworld. They're no longer exhibiting at Macworld. Macworld is no longer a part of their  product launch strategy. And it's moved to February.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It wasn't last year either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this would be the first time that they would be launching a product in this time frame,  in the first quarter right around CES Macworld time frame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's kind of sad because one of the reasons they said they left Macworld is they didn't want the  pressure of announcing something in January. I'm sure Macworld would have gladly moved in two weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's very expensive for them to go to Macworld and to have to make their announcements right  at that time as well. I just feel kind of sad for Macworld at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The most profitable high tech company in the whole country,  the only guy who's making any money and it's too expensive for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  To me as an Apple fan and part of the Apple community, it seems a real diss to the community  to abandon Macworld to be honest with you. And if that's why they did it, that's pretty scrooge-like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It does cost them tens of millions of dollars in some cases to go to Macworld to set up the booth.  But it makes you feel like they just don't give a crap and I guess they don't have to anymore.  More important than that though is control. We all know that Apple is obsessed with control and they  don't control Macworld. At Macworld, they are an exhibitor. Now granted, they are like the  exhibitor, but they are still an exhibitor. They don't control Macworld. They love to control  their events. They love to control everything. So I think for them, it's about control. When  they want to do it, how they want to do it. They had control over that keynote. They had absolute

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  control. It was no different. Actually no, they don't control who gets into that keynote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Macworld attendees get in. They don't control the list on that. They control A-list, but anybody who  is at Macworld and who can get in through Macworld gets into that keynote. Got your invite to January

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  26th yet? What's that? You got the invite to January 26th? I think we'll know when they go out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think we'll hear about it. In other words, no. So I'm trying to figure out who wants a tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Does anyone here today need or want a tablet? I'm glad you say that, Veronica, because I'm the  one guy on MacBreak Weekly who keeps saying, I don't know about a tablet. I'm kind of in about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm not really sure what I would use it for. A different question here, and that is what do  they mean by tablet? What would you like to see, Bob? What would you like to see? Tablet used to  mean pen computing. Who talks about pen computing anymore? Nobody. I have a tablet right here. It's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  called a Newton. There you go. By the way, they're going to call the new Apple tablet the Newton 2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That'd be a great moment. The Newton was a great product. Of course, it was way ahead of its time  and it never went anywhere. What are you looking at me like that? Look at you with a Newton in your  hands. John's making fun of me and my Newton. There's an incredibly rabid Newton fan base

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  still to this day. I guess, was it 2010 or 2009? The dates changed over. The Newton was, it was  like 2012. The Newton could not compute dates past a certain year and the Newton fan base  is all freaked out about this because their Newtons would stop working out. I think it was  last year or this year. Power it up, Neil. Power it up. You would know better than I would. They

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  shipped a firmware fix. Oh really? Yeah. There are user written firmware base and there are  Newtons running Apache, running web servers. I should fire this up. Why? To get back to the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  tablet though, it's like a very niche audience and I'm just not sure. I'm sure technologically,  whatever they do is going to be awesome. I'm sure it'll be great. It's going to be a giant iPod. I'm  sure we'll all be very stunned by how it works. But day to day, I'm just not seeing a need for it

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  for myself. I mean, there's a lot of people that are going to probably use it. What I think is going to happen is  that they are, you know, they always make an advance on the UI side and I think what we're going  to see is something surprising on the user interface that's not a pen and it's not a touch and  it's not a voice and it's, you know, or it's all of those combined somehow, who knows? But we'll see  a pretty screen, a very thin box and a new UI twist and they won't give a damn if the volumes  are low because they're going to have troubles. So it's interesting that you say that though,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Robert, because this kind of gets back to one of these conundrums that I think that the tablet  device has and that is what platform does it run? Does it run OS X or does it run the iPhone platform

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  in much higher resolution? Let's say it looks like this, right? Like he's holding up a Newton.  The Newton. Now here's what I'm thinking. How do you get this thing open? You push this. Okay,  so you got a little thing here and this is what you're going to see people using it with. They're  going to be like this. Hello, mom. Yeah, no, I'm on my new iPod. What you're saying is that a tablet  can't, it's not going to be a phone. It's going to have a phone in it. Yeah, no, it's got a phone in  and I'm talking to you now from the phone. It can't be a phone because it would be, we're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It looks kind of cool, don't you think? It'd be dorky to have it. Here, I'm putting batteries in.  You can turn it on and you can play with it. When has dorky stopped us before?  Not stopped me. I will buy whatever Apple puts out because I'm just that kind of guy.  Well, it comes with a Bluetooth. Look, batteries. It'll come. Okay, Bob, what would you, design is  for us. If you wanted to make a successful product based on a tablet, what would you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think just what I said, it runs the iPhone. It probably has a gigahertz processor. It has  prettier big screen. They have some way of running movies on it elegantly. It has a new UI thing  where you'd use gestures or you spit on it or something. That's what the New York Times said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The New York Times quoted an Apple insider said, the user interface is not like anything you've

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  seen before and it's going to blow your mind. Blow your mind, they say. There you go. There you go.  And they have content deals. So this thing that does-  Well, do they? Now, wait a minute. Content deals. That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Do they have content deals? We've heard a couple of rumors that they were talking to a publisher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  New York Times already said that they were going to do something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But if they were talking to Random House or some other publisher, I'll show you how to use it,  John. You just need a little hand working with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay. Before we get into the content though, I mean, if we are assuming that it's going to  have this revolutionary new user interface, then it's not going to be running the iPhone OS. So  that implies a third platform for people to develop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Four. Four. You have the server, you have OS X, you have iPhone, and you'd have a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  told people to start thinking big apps using iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes, that's true. That was another- So wouldn't that mean there's going to be the same

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  operating system? It makes more logical sense. They're not going to do another operating system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't- Yeah, it's hard for me to see them doing another OS, especially another kind of mobile  oriented OS. I mean, it seems like it either needs to be a very mobile centric version of OS X,  something that works better in a tablet form factor, or it needs to be kind of  you know, enlarged version of iPhone OS. Will it be a reader? Is it going to be a Kindle killer?  That would be cool. Oh yeah.  I think that's going to depend on the screen. I mean, the reason to buy a Kindle is the E Ink  display. And if you have a display that's even better and more versatile, like a Pixel Qi display,  which is incredibly low power, but color, and could actually serve as a substitute for E Ink  in many cases, then yeah, it could be- The Newton, by the way, ladies and gentlemen-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You broke it. You broke my name. No, it's not dead.  The screen, the touchscreen no longer works for unknown reasons.  Yeah, it works fine. Activating packages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I was at E Ink 18 months ago, and they showed me a color E Ink display running full motion video.  Ooh, we need that.  And that was 18 months ago, which is about the right time for it to become a product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that there are a few Japanese companies that have had color  electrophoretic displays, and there are even some devices out in Japan that do that as well.  But they're incredibly expensive. The video refresh rate is still very slow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What's wrong? The only reason you use E Ink is for the battery life. What's wrong with having  an OLED display and I have to charge it every night? And it's gorgeous, it's color-  It's not just for the battery life. It's not just for the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Why else do we want E Ink?  Because it's thin. It looks like paper,  because it's easier on your eyes. There's no need for better concentration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This sounds like the only people are talking at once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  To me, it would be better, I would rather read on a big iPhone or a laptop than I would on my Kindle.  Would you not, Veronica? Say it again?  Would you not rather read on your laptop or a big iPhone than on your Kindle?  No. You like the Kindle?  Yeah, I love the Kindle. I use my Kindle every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely. It's much easier on the eyes than staring at an iPhone or the screen for

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  four hours at a time. I read everything on a laptop. I have a Kindle and I read on it at night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Put the camera on this. This is some of your old stuff on here, Leo.  You're probably on there, John. This is the Newton. I like cheese.  I like cheese. I like cheese. Hey, cheese is.  Stop it. You wrote that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like cheese too. Cheese is good.  We're soulmates. I'm just seeing if it

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  recognized the word. So it's an e-book reader, but it doesn't have E Ink. And you think that if,  Bob, you think if it were an E Ink display were to come along, say from Amazon that had  full motion and color, that it would be better? That's what we want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, of course. It expands the data types that it can present. You'll pay more for a movie than

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  you'll pay for something else. It's costly though, right, Ryan? That's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  objection you're giving is it's too expensive. It's costly. Even regular E Ink is not quite  there technologically yet. So we're still years away from color E Ink that's going to  do something like full motion video. We may never get there. It may be an LCD based displays  that get us to where we need it. But Bob says he saw it 15 months ago.  I'm sure you saw it. And like I said, there are displays and devices like this in Japan already,  but they are, again, are incredibly expensive. They're very hard to manufacture.  And they just don't refresh fast enough in most cases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Ronika Belmont, I would like to ask you a question.  Do you really believe that E Ink is better and easier to read than a laptop screen? I find that  hard to believe, young lady. Yes. Yes.  Is it maybe that I'm old? John, you're old. What do you think?  What? I don't think that the Kindle is that easy to read. I know it's more solid.  I think it's very easy to read. It's easy to read, but I would prefer to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  read a laptop because I want color. I want motion. Well, Leo, maybe you just need to make the text  bigger. I know your eyes are probably not what they used to be. I made it all the way.  You can do that on the Kindle. I made it all the biggest you could be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you've got it written on here. I love Obama. Give me that.  You've been using this thing to this day. I wrote that in 2000. Isn't that amazing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I love Obama. You're making that up. Look at you.  She's making that up. There's no Obama on here. You need this fancy pen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You do need a stylus on this thing. Now, there's a lot of reasons why this didn't make it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  chiefly because it's black on gray. Black on gray? It's like black on black. You can't see it.  It's like that funny quasi-green color. Yeah, exactly. With kind of a horrible  eyes. Yeah. The contrast. The crystal look to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, they didn't have Active Matrix at the time. This was a passive matrix. This is way out of its  time. Way out of the technology. So it seems to be... Who's going to disagree with me and Veronica?  Our position is that the world doesn't want a tablet. Napple is chasing up the wrong tree.  You agree? Am I misstating your point of view, Veronica?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I thought you were going to see who agreed with the E Ink over reading the laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, no, no. I'm done with that. He's had it with that argument.  I gave up on that. Do you agree, John, that the tablet is a bum idea?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I don't. I think the possibility exists that this will be the decade of the tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bob, you agree? The decade of the tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think they're not going to pitch it as a tablet per se. I think that they're going to find a  different spin on it and find a way to make us like it. So yeah, I think a lot of people are

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  going to buy them. That's interesting because the world is expecting a tablet. So there's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  little risk in saying, well, it's not a tablet. It's fine. So the Kindle is not a tablet either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ryan, what do you think? Yeah, I'm with Robert. I think that it's going to be a different spin  on it. I mean, tablets have not been successful to date. Tablets are not something that people

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  go out and shop for or desire. And by the way, I wrote a column in PCMag about this. I blame  Microsoft for the whole fiasco aspect of this. It's entirely possible that they're responsible

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  for tablets not having taken off the way that we all kind of- Because they made the crappy tablet,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the UMPC. They've made three or four iterations of this. And the fractal here is Microsoft was  also the one who killed the smartphone business until Apple came along. They were running that  and then into the ground. Nobody cared because their model, their ability to change kind of the  way you look at these things is impossible. So can Apple- Well, I want to know what kind of spin

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you think they'll put on it. Yeah, that's it. I think they just need to reframe the conversation.  What's the spin that makes it better? Because I can see a larger multimedia device, like a large  touch, for example, which I could use around the house, but I wouldn't want to take with me on a  trip because it would be too hard to type out a bunch of emails on a touchscreen interface. I mean,  I can do that on my iPhone, but I don't love to. I just want to know what spin you think they could  add to it that would make it more mass marketable. Well, one thing they could do is they could

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  make it a different enough device that they can break the deal with AT&T and have it come out

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  as a subsidized Verizon device. It has to be always on the internet, right? It has to have 3G.  It can't just be a Wi-Fi device. Yeah. Well, it could, but-  There's a problem. There's a problem because I already have. I'm already paying for  my iPhone. I'm already paying for- What if you pull out your little card and

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  put it into this thing and you still got the same account with AT&T? Would that bother you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's hard to pull that card out. Nobody's going to do that.  Yeah, that's not- That's a non-starter.  Maybe they can come up with a toolkit. I think you're going to kill it. You make me  pay for $60 a month for additional network access that I already have paid for at home  and on my phone. A third connection. That's a problem.  They finally have tethering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, they'd have to allow tethering. That would be good.  Well, AT&T doesn't like that idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Unless Apple could say to AT&T, we're leaving you unless, because it's not in their interest to  provide tethering. Right.  So how do you solve that? AT&T doesn't think I'm inevitably-  How do you? Well, yeah, this year apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  AT&T would probably implode at that point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Apple would be insane to extend that deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So then you're stuck with a tablet that either has an expensive 3G connection that nobody wants  to pay for because they already have two others or has no 3G and is completely worthless. Now,  what do you do? They can't solve that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There exists a possibility that it's optional and that you can buy the tablet with the 3G module  based on the service that you want, kind of like how you buy laptops that have 3G  modules based on the service that you want. One word.  You might get one with AT&T, you might get one with Verizon. I don't think it's got to-  It doesn't have to be either or. They do a deal with Amazon and it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  WhisperNet. Which is Sprint.  No, WhisperNet's AT&T. I thought it was Sprint too, but it's AT&T.  No. Are you sure?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is on the new device, on the original device.  Oh, the old one was Sprint. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So, they could do, if they have a lot of content deals, they could do a Kindle-like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Why don't they do the ultimate content deal and partner with Amazon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think Amazon would want to partner. Because I think Dobbs and Bezos both have such

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  a need to control that they would kill each other. Ego would stop them. But wouldn't that be a good

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  play? You say, look, you suddenly have access to 650,000 books. This is the Kindle 3 kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, if they did a licensing deal, I could see it working because Amazon would be selling books  anyway. And you use WhisperNet.  And essentially, the model should be for any of these devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why would Amazon want people to buy this device over whatever new version of the Kindle they come

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  out with? Because they would. Because the device is not  what Amazon's interested in. Amazon's interested in selling books.  This is a razor blade scheme. They have no interest in being in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kindle business, I would submit. It's a razor blade scheme. You sell the license,  you have your product, or even a Nintendo scheme where you have this deal, this device,  and then you sell games into it. Exactly.  So Amazon sells books. They're selling enough Kindles that I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  think they would want to continue at least making the margin off of those.  No one knows. We can also back the conversation up here a little bit because Amazon has already done

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  this. Kindle lives on the iPhone platform. It would not take much for them to be able to enable  purchasing of ebooks on the Kindle iPhone app. So assuming this device runs the iPhone platform,  then they're already there. They don't have to do a content partnership.  Apple doesn't have to do a content partnership. They're already there.  I'm trying to solve the network, the wireless access issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He's trying to decide whether he wants one. No, I want one. You know me. I'm in line to buy it.  I don't care. If Steve says buy it, I'm buying it. I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's true. You lockstep. Of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Come on. You're buying one and you're buying one and you and you and you're buying one.  You're not going to buy one, Bob? You're not in line?  Not right away. No. Not right away. What does that mean? Tuesday?  You buy it Wednesday? No, you wait until the second iteration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The second iteration. I have a Kindle 1, I have a Kindle 2.  Yeah, maybe you meet a stewardess. That's about all you're going to get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  My first iPhone was a 3G. Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. I'm impressed.  What did you have before that? A Razr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, now I'm underwhelmed. Boy, that's really old.  I am too. Now I'm really depressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's no reason to have to keep up with this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We're going to take a break. We're going to come back. I still want to hear your predictions for  I'm sorry, 2010. We're not supposed to call it 2010.  No. Oh, no. I'll talk about that too.  And more with us, John C. Dvorak from Channel Dvorak, from Tekzilla, it's Veronica Belmont,  Ryan Block from Gadget, and Robert X. Cringely from Cringely.com. And of course,  we're going down to CES in two days, three days. You going to CES this year?  God, no. Yeah, you always say that,  but then you show up. No, I'm not going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really not? I'm not really going to make a point.  Really, really, really not. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Ryan, you're going. You're going to be down there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I will be there. Yeah.  You're going to come by and help us. We're actually launching some new stuff on Gadget,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  specifically for CES. Well, please come by. And Veronica,  you'll be there with Tekzilla, I know. I will.  Yep. Robert, you going to CES this year?  Absolutely not. Yeah. See, the old guys say,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  God, no. I've been there.  I'm jealous. The show has not

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  changed for five years. Well, good, because I haven't been there for six. So I'm excited.  It'll be new for me. You haven't been there for six years.  I have a, oh, if they brought back Comdex, I would be so in. PC Expo. No, I'm just joking.  Boy, that's an old reference. I'm just joking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Some Jack Benny material. I haven't been at CES since 2004.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's been six years. And I thought it was time.  One of the reasons was because of the overlap between that and Macworld. And I always said,  well, I'm here. I'll just do Macworld. But we're going to go down with 10 people.  All our cameras are all our gear, all our equipment. And I can vouch for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You've got some wild set. Have you gone to the other room?  This guy is unbelievable. This guy's taking the money he's making on this show and putting it  into gear. He's got the greatest rig. This is going to be one of the, this is going to make  network TV people look like small potatoes. What you're setting up. I don't know about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Amazing. It's very interesting what Colleen's  building right now in the other room. She got a, it's portable rig using like four different EVDO  cards that go in there. You can't, you won't believe it.  But a lot of this is off the shelf technology. For instance, we're going to be using Slingbox  and a SlingCatcher at this end to send the video back to our studios where it'll be really onto  the, yeah, we're doing all sorts of interesting kind of stuff because we have to do this on the  cheap. You know, I can't spend a million dollars if David spent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It looks like you've almost spent half a million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I know. Anyway, we, part of this is because of the great folks at Sync who are making this  possible. Sync is of course the in-car hands-free Bluetooth music, turn-by-turn directions,  information, get traffic information. You can get, Veronica, this is where you can go put the  blonde wig on, dear, if you'd like. This, John just wandered out to put on his blonde wig. I  think you could do it. It's, you know. Next time.  Next time. All right. I'll give you, we got one more ad. I'll give you another shot at it.  Turn-by-turn and Bob, anything you'd like to do right now, this is a good time.  Just be our guest. I'll turn the camera off. See, they can't see you anymore.  I can see you though. He's just sitting back. Look, he's just relaxing. Just putting his feet up.  Take a nap. It'll be a while. It's going to be a while. It's a long ad. No, we're almost through.  Cinkie is supporting our CES coverage. We'll be in Vegas the 6th through the 10th,  all day Friday, Saturday and Sunday. We're doing the parties on Wednesday and Thursday,  all the events. Kiki with me, Dicty Bartolo, the Gizwiz, Paul Therotte from Windows Weekly, Ryan  Shroud from This Week in Computer Hardware. The whole gang is going down. Scott Wilkinson from  our Home Theater Geeks podcast. So we are going to cover this every which way but loose. It's going  to be a lot of fun using weird creative wireless technology that probably won't work. But please  tune in and see live.twit.tv the 6th through the 10th. And if you catch me, we're driving the Lincoln  down, the Lincoln MKT down with the Cink. If you can see, if you catch me, say hello and I'll give  you a tour of the Cink. This thing is amazing. Or go to your Ford, Lincoln and Mercury dealers and  say I want to test drive Cink. Or visit the website. All Cink owners have a special website  at www.sinkmyride.com. But you can go there and watch the videos and find out more about it.  There will be big announcements from Ford about Cink at CES. They've already kind of leaked some  of this Wi-Fi built in, this HD radio tagging. But there's more coming from Ford and Cink. And  we're going to interview the CEO of Ford I think on Wednesday and on Thursday or Friday we've got  the chief engineer behind Cink. So tune in all for the rest of the week. Our coverage from CES.  SinkMyRide.com. We thank them for their support. You probably know a few things, Ryan, about Cink.  Have you ever used Cink? Oh yeah. I've used it many times. I love it. I love it. Yeah, you can

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  rent cars now with it. Yeah, they've actually done a really surprising job of getting it into  so many vehicles. When they first announced it a few years back, I was like oh, we'll see how this

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  goes. It's the Microsoft Auto platform, which I'm not that familiar with. Although I understand  they just made a deal with, is it Kia? Somebody to do it, to put it in their cars. Yeah. Kia's  are still around? I know. You don't even know. I just don't know anything about cars. Cars are

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  not like my gray zone. Me too. Well, yeah. Microsoft is doing a better job of getting it  in what car companies remain these days. Brands are shutting down left and right. It's probably  making it easier for them to cut these deals. The thing that impressed me about Ford is they

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  kind of have a vision for this thing that is much more open than you'd expect from a car company.  Much more of a platform. They want to do apps and app store. I think they're really kind of  paying attention to what's going on. I'm very impressed by this. But enough about that.  And there goes Dvorak. He's back. You could tell he's back. We're all back now. John has this kind  of internal timer. He knows when the commercial's over. So Veronica looks the same. No, no blonde

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  wig. Nothing. No wig. She's just no fun. I'll go look. She won't come on Cranky Geeks. No, no,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  no, no. Stop. It's okay. Don't let him bully you into that. She won't. We got the costume ready

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  for her. I don't work downtown. I have no way of getting downtown to do Cranky Geeks during the

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  week. Don't worry about it, Veronica. I tell you these things. Of course, John, if this makes you  feel any better, I asked her to be on the twit last week and she said she couldn't. She was going  to the craft fair with her girlfriends. The craft fair. And how was that craft fair?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I don't do crafts. I bought some scented candles and I bought a picture. A picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Now you know how bad I feel, John. She actually stiffed you to buy some scented candles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to make plans with my lady friends because we don't have a lot of free time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, with your lady friends? I'm not knocking. I wonder what they do with the candles.  Oh, you are. You put them around the bathtub. That's it. That's it. That's what I'm talking about.  He's a horrible, horrible man. You can have a nice relaxing dip in the tub and all your cares

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  will just wash away. I love candles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Sorry. I think we've got a show title. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, brother. Sprint. I love cheese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. I know what to get you for your birthday. I like cheese candles best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Let's say Obama on them. Sprint is, according to Engadget, going to be introducing probably at CES  a WiMAX EVDO mobile hotspot. Now, I really like the MiFi. I've been using the MiFi for some time.  This is kind of like a MiFi only. It's got WiMAX as well as EVDO on it. 50 foot Wi- sorry,  100 foot Wi-Fi range. They say $50, according to Engadget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, with subsidy, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  With subsidy. Yeah, it's not how much the modem is. It's how much the monthly fee is for the  bandwidth. There is a company that is doing an EVDO modem that they claim is unlimited.  Unfortunately, it's got a very- what's very limited is their coverage. Have you seen that?  What is the name of that? Somebody keeps telling me about this. Is it Magic? It's not Magic Jack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's something like that. Yeah. Data Jack. Data Jack. That's exactly what it is. Very good.  Have you used it? No, no, I haven't used it. I mean, the unlimited argument is- I find it  kind of funny because as annoying as it is that these guys do cap your data at 5 gigs when  it's supposed to kind of be unlimited. I've used EVDO for years and years. I'm a very,  very heavy EVDO user. It's hard to get past 5 gigs.  Yeah, I've never really gotten there. I mean, if you're doing torrents and stuff, I guess maybe,  but you wouldn't really want to be doing that on EVDO anyway. It's so slow.  Yeah. I mean, you have to really kind of go out of your way to do 5 gigs a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's got a very limited- I mean, it's great and many- if you're in Minnesota,  you're going to be happy about these guys. I don't know. Are these in MVNO? Who are they getting?  Look at the coverage map. It's just weird. I can't think of who these people are. They've got like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the Central Valley, but not San Francisco. Did you talk about that poor guy that was  charged like $17,000 for downloading movies over EVDO?  He exceeded the limit, I take it. Yeah. Well, he also did it from Mexico.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, that's nuts. That's just crazy. So you're international roaming-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they worked it out, but that's what happens. You got to be careful with downloading stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Pay attention. So they're using the T-Mobile network. I don't know if it's HSDPA. It's not  EVDO. If it's T-Mobile, it would be- isn't it HSDPA? Yeah, it doesn't say EVDO.  High-speed internet service. We just got DOCSIS 3 modems from Comcast.  You did? Yeah. 100 megabits down.  What? No, what is it? 50 megabits down and 12 up. It's for 100 bucks a month. It's amazing.  Yeah, we have it too. It's unbelievable. This is their response to Fios.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How many areas are being served by this? They're rolling it out completely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  For how long? I live in Charleston, South Carolina,  and nothing happens here and they have it here. She does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  She's making faces. So you have it in North Carolina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  South Carolina. And my telephone line was I think installed in 1776 or 1876.  When did you move to South Carolina? My wife is from here and I like to sleep with her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Every night? So when did you move to South Carolina?  It's not answering the question. That's where she is. I've been to South Carolina.  It's a nice state. It's a lovely state.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, I live in Charleston. Charleston is the greatest city in the country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What are you kidding me? Is it really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's beautiful. That's not Savannah, Georgia you're talking about.  No, Savannah, Georgia is not as pretty as Charleston.  Charleston, South Carolina is more lovely than Savannah?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're the same. They're very similar.  It's antebellum kind of. Right, untouched. In fact, when  Sherman was taken to the south, he got to Savannah and he was just obviously burning  everything down. He burned Atlanta to the ground. He took one look at Savannah and he said,  I like to burn that. We'll leave this one here because I  might want to retire here and he left. The funny thing is that Sherman got to

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Savannah and he was going to go to Charleston and he went to Columbia instead because he was seasick.  I've been to Greenville. It made me seasick.  So Columbia was burned and Charleston was saved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Best restaurant in Greenville. Everything was fried. Everything.  And hush puppies even with dessert. Poo butter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hush puppies with poo butter? What's poo butter?  That's what I call my wife. What is poo butter? Is it peanut butter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, it's sweet butter. Oh yeah, with poo butter. That's what it was.  Yeah, it was honey butter. Anyway, getting back to reality,

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  we have DOCSIS 3 in Charleston, South Carolina. That's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes. And you love it.  And now here's the question. Does Comcast? No, in Oakland? No.  We have it in Petaluma. You might have it. You know what? You should check.  I'm going to check with my guys in Comcast. Yes, they do because Colleen has it there.  She also lives in the East Bay. What town?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'm in Berkeley, so I don't know. It's very close. They're similar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  All right, I'll check it out. Mostly you take a turn to the left and then you're in Berkeley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think I'm using a San Pablo node, which may not have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You have to get a new modem. That's the thing. They send you a DOCSIS 3 modem  and you get on the DOCSIS 3 head end. So is it noticeably faster?  Because the feeds are coming over slow. I know. A lot of the servers you're going to.  What about you, Bob? Do you notice a difference in speed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, I didn't get it. It's here. It arrived last week and I haven't got it yet,  but the funny thing is they rolled it out and my speeds went up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, they're kind of upgrading everything in a sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So I just did a measure before we came on this thing to see whether I could support it.  And I have 12 megs upstream. 12 megs up? Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This video looks fantastic. It might also partly be because some  of the people who used to be on your head end have moved over to the other one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think they've moved everything. I think here's my theory is that they're going to DOCSIS 3  everywhere and they don't upgrade your modem unless you pay for the high end. So you might  have a DOCSIS 1 or 2 modem, but it's getting some of the benefits.  DOCSIS 3 is only channel bonding. That's all it is.  Oh really? That's the big difference? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah, we have it here and it is amazing. What about the cap though? What about the cap?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, you guys still have the 250 gigabit cap? You know, I haven't run into the cap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I monitor the cap on my machine. It's annoying, but unless you're doing some  serious, serious file transfer, you're not going to run into it. I've yet to run into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can't get over 50 gigabytes a month and I'm using the thing full time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I work from home. I work on the internet. I do nothing but use the internet,  like almost 18 hours a day. We've yet to hit it.  It's really, I think if you're downloading tons and tons of new things.  You'd have to work hard. Yeah.  I can't even imagine.  It doesn't sound like a lot when you think about it over a 30-day period, but it actually is.  250 gigs is a lot. 8 gigs a day is a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  So, but you're getting, what kind of speeds are you getting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So we opted for like the lowest DOCSIS 3 plan. So I think we're on 30 megs by 10.  So we get 10 megs upstream, which is actually how Veronica and I are able to-  You're both on Skype looking great. Yeah.  Yeah, exactly. We're both on the same-  No problem.  ...action right now because we just have like bandwidth to spare. I could probably go start  up a video game and play while we're both playing.  This is to me. You should do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll start a raid.  Download Avatar. See what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We'll see how it happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somebody in the chat room is asking how do you monitor this. You go on,  just go to Google and put a-  Comcast bandwidth monitor.  Yeah, a Comcast bandwidth monitor and you'll get about five or six programs and some of them  are pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But Comcast is supposed to have one. Once they did the caps, they said,  okay, we'll tell you what you're using.  I haven't seen it.  I think you have to go to-  I use a-  You probably don't go to comcast.net very often. Do you even know about that?  No, I don't.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just go straight to the Comcast Cares guy and I just say, hey, can you take-  Frank, hey, Frank, what am I using?  Frank calls me up.  What's my bandwidth?  What am I supposed to be doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  John, John, you have people, don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes, he has people. It's made of people. Bono, the rock star. You remember him, Bono?  Big investor in Elevation Partners, Roger McNamee.  Yeah, oh yeah. Not only is Bono hip with it, wearing sunglasses all the time,  but he also has an article in the New York Times for January 2nd on his top 10 new ideas  for the new decade. Would you like to go through some of those, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would love to know what Bono thinks is going to happen in the next decade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He says, in the spirit of rock star excess, I offer yet another top 10 list.  Oh, top 10 list.  The main difference, if it matters, is this list looks forward, not backward,  which is I was trying to get all you guys to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well, if you just would ask us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where is this on here? I don't see it in the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I made it up. It's not in the list. You want me to put it in the list?  I'll put it in the list right now. Wait a minute. Hold on.  Let me push a button. 229. There it goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We don't do well with change, Leo.  We need to spell things out for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  delicious.com slash twit slash 229. It'll be right there.  He says, the main difference to my list, if it matters, this list looks forward, not backward.  So here are 10 ideas that might make the next 10 years more interesting, healthy, or civil.  Some are trivial. Some are fundamental. They have little in common with one another,  except I am seized by each.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Looks like a psychopath in this photo.  That's Bono.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Seized?  He's seized by each and moved by its potential to change our world.  He's seized up?  It's funny. It's like a big hand gripped him and moved him.  Number one, return of the automobile as a sexual object.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's wet. I think you nailed it with that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  How is it the country that made us all fall in love with the automobile has failed with only  a few exceptions to produce a single family sedan with- Oh, I could just see Bono in a  single family sedan with a style, humor, and grace of the cars produced in the 40s, 50s, and 60s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, this is another crap in top 10.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, this is good. He says, get Steve Jobs and Johnny Ive, Frank Gehry, Jeff Koons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Frank Gehry, you'd have a blob car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bono, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  All right, number two, and this one I like, intellectual property developers.  It's like one of those guys who has the voice recorder. Note to self.  I think he just puts words together that he thinks sounds good.  It's exactly.  Mint chocolate chip real estate.  The only thing protecting the movie and TV industries from the fate that has befallen  music and indeed the newspaper business is the size of the files. I would agree with him on that.  The immutable laws of bandwidth tell us we're just a few years away from being  able to download an entire season of 24 in 24 seconds. I think that's happening now with DOCSIS 3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you can get it fed to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We're at the post office, they tells us. We're the post office. Who knows what's in the brown  paper packages. I don't know. I'm sorry. I must have left something out. A decade's worth of music  file sharing and swiping has made it clear the people it hurts are the creators, in this case,  the young fledgling songwriters who can't live off ticket and t-shirt sales.  You know, the last time I went to a YouTube concert, it was $150 for a ticket. Bono.  T-shirt sales like the least sympathetic among us and the people that's reverse Robin Hooding  benefits are rich service providers whose swollen profits perfectly mirror the last  receipts of the music business. When's he going to get to intellectual property developers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know. It doesn't get to it at all. This is bogus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Okay, next one. Equal right to pollute and the polluter pays principle. I think this is carbon

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  credits. Carbon tax, carbon credit, carbon cap and trade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  A person, Dr. William Lee and a word, angiogenesis, a process by which new blood vessels grow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is good, except when it's very bad. I think Keith Richard used this, didn't he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Blood vessels are the supply lines of cancerous tumors. Dr. William Lee of the Angiogenesis  Foundation is called Research in this Realm, the first medical revolution of the 21st century.  I think there are medical revolutions about to happen. I don't think this is it. One of which is  tailored anti-cancer drugs. You know, every cancer in every human is different.  One of the reasons that chemo is so horrible is because it's a scatter shot, but they are getting  much better at doing individual genetic analysis and tailoring a drug to your specific cancer.  And I think before this decade is out, I, Leo, not I, Bono, that we're going to have these kind  of tailored drugs that are very accurate and very effective. You need to write a column.  I should write my top two. Let's go to the next one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Matter doesn't matter. It's getting worse. God, it appears is a Trekkie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's talking about Dr. Anton Seilinger, an Austrian physicist who is a rock star of physics

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  for his work in quantum teleportation. This Veronica, this could be for certain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, in every one of these things, he says that he has this following clause,  which I know very little about. I love how he says,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it appears God is a Trekkie. And then at the end of that paragraph, he said,  could it be that God is a nerd? He's come a long way in this essay.  The Festival of Abraham. Nice bookends there, Bono.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. He's, you know, he studied writing back in the, back in rock and roll school.  People power in the upside down pyramid. I'd go for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the lamest thing. All right. All right. So you skipped the festival.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The festival of Abraham. I skipped it because I don't understand it. What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It means they were all coming together, all the religions and they were going to be one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We're going to be singing kumbaya. He says he wants an arts festival.  It celebrates the origins of the three Abrahamic religions, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're gonna have to tell you something. Yeah, that's gonna work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, Bob. I write about four op-ed pieces a year for the New York Times.  And they wouldn't publish this crap from me. I know it's because it's Bono.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's where to God. It's like he had, you know,  I would like to see John Mayer's take on the.  Seriously, Dave Matthews in 2010. No, no, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There. No, you don't. John Mayer.  Yeah, he's a, he's a gadget. Fiend. That man knows his stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You've seen the video of him tech supporting his dad.  Oh, yeah, it's great. He's so funny.  Dad, you can do this, dad. It's in the system preference pain.  Dad, don't give up on me. It's so funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right, here we go. People power in the upside upside down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know what? I'm firing Bono from this panel.  I don't care if he's a rock star. He mentions Hillary Clinton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, well, let's skip the next. Taking the fight to rotavirus.  Viva la nonviolent revolution.  And you're right, Bob. This is crap.  Kicks off the African decade. The African decade coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Now, here's an interesting thing. The New York Times just followed,  fired one of its freelance columnists for writing a piece on 3M and not disclosing that in fact,  she had been flown to the 3N plant and fetid and taken out to dinner before she wrote the piece.  And they said, that's a violation of our, even our freelancers can't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's kind of ridiculous. I've seen way worse ethical violations occurred at the  New York Times in the last five years. I mean, way, way worse.  So we're out together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's good. It was clear.  But the thing is, she didn't have to disclose it in the piece. She should have just told the editor  and the editors could have disclosed it as a thing at the end in italics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Our friend David Pogue comes up again in the article that I read about this, which is, what is it?  Is it pinch the New York Times? What is the, there is a Twitter guy. He's got a strange handle,  like tweak the times or something. So he said, I mean, David takes money from Raytheon. He took,  he took money from Raytheon to go to Disneyland and speak. I mean, how does he get these gigs?  If it's a violation of their freelancers agreements.  Yeah. How can I get on that?  He's not a journalist. I asked him about this and he said, I'm not a journalist,  but he's a freelancer writing for the New York Times. So I don't know.  And then he's perceived as such.  He's also makes them a lot of money. And so, yeah, that's unlike this other person.  So John, what is the big story of, of the decade going to be the upcoming decade?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, it could be last.  It's going to be the decade of the tablet.  You lie.  No, you'll see, you'll be stunned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So you think it's not the net book, not the smart book, not the notebook, the tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the decade of the tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The decade of the tablet. You brought those tablets down from the Mount for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was just saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's a long shot.  What's the big story of the next 10 years going to be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, the next big story for the next 10 years. I don't know. I hate doing this prediction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I hate it too. In fact, let's just forget it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because no one's ever really right.  No, yeah.  If you're wrong, then they say you're wrong. Like five years from now.  John, you do this every year.  It's kind of a zero sum game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it is a zero sum game because people will pick this stuff.  She's actually, Veronica is absolutely correct.  This is the thing with me and the mouse. I wrote about it in 1984.  It will live forever.  That will live forever.  I made this off-handed comment that this is a new device and nobody knows if it's going to be  successful. There's no proof that it is.  You know why we do this?  And I'm still eating crap over that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Because the week between Christmas and New Year's, nothing happens. Everybody's gone home.  So there's nothing to talk about.  Avatar, the first film to cross the billion dollar mark.  Today, it's expected that Avatar will cross the one billion dollar  mark of domestic and international receipts for Rupert Murdoch.  News Corp owns this one.  20th Century Fox.  Wow. Everybody said this is the most expensive movie ever made.  We never really found out how much. 350 million was the speculation.  Five.  Five, even five. They've made a billion dollars.  Everyone thinks five.  It was a good bet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, it's Titanic all over again. The same statements were made in 1997.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know the funny thing is Titanic did not feel like a huge step forward in cinema making.  It felt like, I mean, it seemed like they really put that money to work.  Well, for the effects.  No, I disagree.  No, it was a huge step forward in the manipulation of young girls.  A three-quarter scale ship and stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was unbelievable. I mean, it was an entire studio that was filled with water.  And it's.  Sure, but that was kind of like Brewster's Millions in movie form.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like, how can we blow a ton of money?  It feels like Avatar, they actually, with this ungodly sum of money that they used to make the  movie, really did something that cinema.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Except give any writers some of the money, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, but they had to do that to replace the limped pools of Leonardo DiCaprio's eyes.  Oh, it wasn't that bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They had limped pools. They were just computer generated limped pools.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've been laughing lately because all the geek guys have been going nuts over Avatar  and seeing it three or four times.  Those chicks are hot.  Now you know what it was like when we were pre-teen seeing Titanic for the first time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Those eight foot tall blue chicks, they were hot.  Don't look at me like that.  It's a cartoon for God's sake.  Most of my love life is a cartoon, John. That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought the movie was a disappointment.  I thought it was spectacular to watch. I saw it on the IMAX.  For one thing, I didn't like the fake 3D.  If they're doing depth of field shooting, this is not 3D by any means.  If the background's out of focus, how am I supposed to focus on it to get the 3D effect?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That works in 2D, actually. That's how you do 3D in 2D.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sure it was shot for 2D and they just put the 3D stuff in there.  I know, it was shot explicitly for 3D.  Why were they doing depth of field shots like that?  I don't know.  It was very annoying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I kind of wish I had not seen it in 3D the first time, at least, because I found it very distracting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Me too, Veronica. A lot of people said they didn't bother them, but it bugged me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You've got a visual of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, I was able to see the 3D. I was very surprised.  But I was wearing, first of all, my advice, don't wear glasses to the movie because you'll  be wearing two pairs of glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you see the 3D IMAX version?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I saw Real D, which had the black poindexter glasses that you wear over your regular glasses.  It was effective. I would like to see it in IMAX. It's hard to get into IMAX.  Even in San Francisco right now, it's still sold out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The glasses for the IMAX thing are huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I've worn those before. Did you see it in IMAX, Veronica?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ryan and I saw it last Friday.  And you're saying it kind of bugged you. I wanted to see it in 2D, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I saw Alvin and the Chipmunks.  I would like to go see it again in 2D.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Bob?  I saw Alvin and the Chipmunks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  How was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The squeak-wool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It was good. The guy from Chuck is in it. He plays a loser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Really?  Yeah.  That's a stretch.  Okay, where are we? Where are we on the list?  Twitter. In 10 years, will there be a Twitter?  No.  Veronica?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe? I don't know. I guess.  This is what you're here on the show for.  I know, but this is the wind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You're not supposed to be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, there will not be a Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Thank you. That's all I have to say. And you don't have to justify it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tell me back in 10 years and let me know how that works out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We'll be called something else.  Ryan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What do you mean by Twitter?  Twitter? Or something similar to it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You can say no. You can say that the idea will persist. But will Twitter.com still be the  venue it is today or will it be like the Friendster.com?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it is highly probable that with broadcast push publishing protocols like PubSubHubbub  and Webfinger and stuff like that, that you're going to see the decentralization of status  updates. And in effect, that could really undermine Twitter and to a certain degree,  Facebook. I think it's entirely possible. I think if Twitter was smart, they would try to get in on  that now and try to own as much of that as they could to maintain their dominant position.  They have an opportunity, but they have to open. They really have to open.  Yeah. If it does become decentralized and they're not in on that really early,  it's going to really sneak up on them and could potentially really damage them.  Bob, have you heard of Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yes. And Alvin has as well. I think that Twitter won't be a brand in 10 years and that it will  peak and they'll sell out on the downside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How about Twitter as just the API but not as a website anymore?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's a good API.  That probably will continue, but under someone else's ownership.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's already happened. Who is it? WordPress.com. A couple of sites are now using the Twitter API,  so you can use Twitter third-party tools to post to WordPress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's wild. By the way, somebody in the chat room has really given Veronica a bad time  saying that the only thing she's sure about is she's not going to wear the blonde wig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Don't pay any attention to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just don't like predictions because I think things change so quickly that it's kind of hard  to say for sure what's going to happen in a decade.  They're all bogus, but they're kind of fun.  In a decade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Let's talk about sci-fi because you do the sword and laser podcast with Tom Merritt and  you're very into sci-fi. Is there a sci-fi thing that you've seen in the movies,  you've read in a book that you think will become real?  Concept is a good one.  A concept that might become real in the next 10 years?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Terraforming.  Oh, I like that. Terraforming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm going to go for Terraforming Mars.  Oh, I thought Dubai maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's maybe more the 25-year range.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's pretty far. I think 10 years, I don't think we're going to start terraforming yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who knows? Things might get bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You've read Red Green Blue Mars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Might have to push it forward a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to predict a new programming language that will set the world on fire within the next 10  years.  You're kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a safe bet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google's working on that new language. What's it called?  Go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go.  Go.  Yeah, that's one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Go. It's got an exclamation mark. Go.  Could work.  Ryan, what do you think? A science fiction...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm surprised they didn't name it Google programming language.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Will we see a replicator? You know what I think we might see?  We might see the holodeck.  I don't know about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, we're getting close.  Those physicists who are working on the transportation stuff, they all say uniformly  that I've seen that it works on a very small atomic or subatomic level,  but it doesn't work on larger objects. They can't move massive structures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm never putting my thing in a wormhole. I'm sorry. That's just not going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think radar on cars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would really like to see... I don't think that we will have it in the next 10 years.  I would really like to see an automatic transportation system, all minority report.  We were actually just talking about this last night at dinner.  I'm not into jet packs. I'm not into flying cars.  I like the idea of the car driving itself. That way people can go back to drinking at night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think actually, of all the things you just said,  autonomous vehicles is the most likely thing to happen in the next 10 years.  Absolutely.  I hope so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The reason why I don't think it's going to happen is because of the massive amount of

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  infrastructure that would need to change in order to really, really make it work correctly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Moore's law...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, how many years did it take to make the national highway system? Like 50 years?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You don't have to put wires in the highway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think between DOCSIS 3 and terrorism, we're going to see the rise of residential telepresence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I like that. Nobody's going to want to travel because they don't want to sit in their seat  for the last hour. We know 4K screens will be around certainly in the next few years.  They're already out there. That's so high. It's  quad current high definition, enough so that it really feels real. You put it on a big screen,  maybe one whole end of your room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a dichotomy here because there's a huge group of younger people, for example.  They don't even care about these big screen TVs. They watch everything on their laptops.  They don't have a TV set of any sort.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And they don't want to travel. They don't want to meet people. They just want to stay home.  They don't want to do anything.  They don't care really. There's no market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Although you do also have to remember that a lot of people who are younger are not necessarily  spending their daytime on computers. If they're in class, they're not sitting on laptops all day  long doing laptop stuff. So that's more of a recreational thing for them. I think once a lot  of these people join the workforce and they're working on their computers all day, there is  actually a little bit more incentive to shut the laptop down, go in the living room and just  kind of relax a little bit in front of the TV. So that could change. I mean, they could swing  the other way a little bit as people get older. Vivek Kundra will become president and put John

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Dvorak in jail. I like it. One can only hope. I think that might well happen. I'm just kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That might well happen. That could very well be in your future. The binary and the cobalting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The binary. All right. I like this. So Bob says we're going to have telepresence because nobody's  going to travel anymore. Ryan, you say autonomous vehicles. I'm not predicting it's going to happen,  but I hope. You say it could happen. I would love it. It could happen in a decade. I think  we're close to that. Well, we got the radar. Brad Templeton, yes, and that's going to happen.  Veronica, you predict terraforming. Sure, why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We'd like to see her terraform her hair into blonde.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, John, you are singularly focused. It's because he's dressed as a Ren faire character.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do you predict will happen? It's going to be the decade of the tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm asking you a sci-fi thing. Oh, a sci-fi thing. In movies now, but might happen actually.  How about minority report style gesturing? I think there'll be a pre-crime thing like

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  minority report and we'll start arresting people for bad thinking. I think there's going to be  fascism in the form of the way it's been shown on these sci-fi. Talk sci-fi. We're going to have a  fascist world government. It's going to be a disaster. How many more economic collapses  before that happens? We're going to have a big one in 2013. And will that be the trigger?  The trigger? Yeah, we're doomed after that. Make your money, find something, find a hole.  Gold? Should I get gold? What should I get? Canned goods? Canned goods. That's only good.  The last X number of years though, the cans freeze dried. Lentils. Actually, lentils and rice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Bob, I know for a fact the reason Bob's in South Carolina, he has cornered the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  lentil market. Lentils and rice. You just have bags and bags and bags. Black eyed peas, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You might be right. So fascism. So what would we do to prepare for that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think we first of all, Leo, one of the things we've got to do.  What would we do to prepare for that? We've got to line up our clothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I want a uniform. So we all have to wear sweater vests?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Guns, by the way, could come in quite handy. Sweater vests.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like you, John? Yes, absolutely.  It's the future is sweater vests. Future is now and it's sweater vests.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Let's talk in sweater vests. Let's talk about technologies that have long been  called for but haven't emerged. Obviously flying cars aren't going to happen.  And the tablet. And the tablet. How about  voice recognition? Will we see major improvement? No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good so we can keep screaming at our technology. And machine translation. That's another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I hear we're very close to voice recognition. Machine translation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's machine translation? Well, you translate French to  German to English to Swedish. Google does a pretty good job.  Pretty good. Are you really ever doing anything serious with this stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I write to Abby's family. They don't speak English and I don't speak French. So I write  to them using Google Translate. We've had some interesting comedy, mirth, merriman,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  kind of mix ups. I was hoping for the live translation.  Like they showed at the Intel Press Event at CES a couple years ago where you just point  like a camera at a street sign in a foreign language and it automatically translates it  within your viewfinder. Google Goggles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Google Goggles. Love Google Goggles.  I wish Google Goggles would do face recognition. I predict a heads up display.  You like saying it. Google Goggles.  I predict a heads up display with a little earpiece and something that's shining on my retina.  As I walk down the street, you'll say that's Veronica Belmont. You used to work with her in  2009. No more of this. Hi, how are you doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Exactly. You look, oh, Veronica. Yeah, she has 14 kids and now is a blonde.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't that the Wuffy stuff from Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom?  It's like Wuffy. Yeah.  Cory for a Doctor Who book. Our next Jordan Laser pick by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Is it? That's a good one.  It is. Who's making that sound?  Who do you think is making that sound? All right. How about, so anybody think  voice recognition will get good by 2020? No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No. It'll get better. I think it's going to  I think we're real close. I think between now and 2020.  I don't think there's going to be a breakthrough. But one thing that's actually really, really  interesting that not a lot of people I think are considering is that Google is probably one of the  companies most on the forefront of voice recognition technology right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Absolutely. Because of their Google 411. It's been brilliant.  Yeah. 411 and Google Voice Search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They call it up and they send a voice to India where somebody listens and then they type it out

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  as bogus. No, no, no, no. In fact, I think that they've been using, they've been saying they've  been using Google 411 as a way of perfecting their voice recognition. As a result, I think you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  right, Ryan. It's very good. So they have that built into Android on the home screen. So you  click a button and then you do a search query with your voice. And then that's also in the  Google mobile app. So voice recognition for them has actually become a really big thing.  And that's also something they've put into Google Voice. So your voicemails get the advantage of  using that kind of advanced voice recognition. I mean, granted, it's still not great. They've got  a long way to go. But I think they're getting more stuff coming into their system and they have a  lot more resources put into their voice recognition platform than most people realize. I mean, if I  was like Nuance, you know, the dragon people, I'd be pretty freaked out. Absolutely. What do you think

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google will be in 2020? They will be our rulers and I welcome them. Our overlords, our Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  overlords. Bob, you have an opinion on, well, I've started two topics without calling on you.  They'll be Microsoft. They'll be just down and out in the magic kingdom. No, no, they'll be

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Microsoft. I mean, they'll be the dominant market share provider of data and information services.  But they'll be a big aging company and they'll have lost their mojo. It's kind of sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think they'll be busted by the EU at some point and split up unlike Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting. The EU does not like them. The EU is getting meaner by the day. And once they

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  start throwing their weight around, because one of the things they're doing is basically  raping American companies because they can get these huge settlements like $1.5 billion from  Intel for doing what? Intel already settled with their main problem company, AMD. Now,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Neely Crows is gone though. And part of this was because of Neely. Well, she was a mean...  She was a mean son of a gun. She was the EU commissioner of competition. She may have been  a lightweight compared to the new guys. Well, that's true. It could be somebody meaner than

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Neely Crow. Oh, he needs a Frenchman in there. We're screwed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  All right. What about Google? What do you think, Ryan? What's Google going to look like in 2020?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Really hard to tell. They've gotten into a lot of markets that I don't think people would have  seen them get into even just two or three years ago. They now have a mobile phone platform. They  have a desktop operating system that's about to come out. They've got a browser. I mean,  they've actually started to permeate the device side of things, which is really kind of crazy  when you think about where Google has come from. So I don't know. I do know that for all of the  trepidation people have about Google, every time I have let Google into my life any deeper than  they were before, it has always been a good thing for me. It's always worked out for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google makes life better. How about this for a concept? Somebody comes along, a group of people,  and they come up with the most amazing algorithm we've ever seen for search and destroys Google  overnight. Google's not in search anymore. That's where they still make their money, though. They're  making their money on... It's very rapidly moving away from search. Yeah, but there's so much

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  lock-in with Google now. I mean, between mail, calendar, apps. If Bing were better... Let's say

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  we end up living like a Google Light Pro. Bing is out of the picture. Let's say, well, no, let's say

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Bing were better. Just pretend. Bing isn't bad. Well, it's a subjunctive, isn't it? Bing is.  Is Bing better? Is Bing better? What if Bing were better?  Doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. That's the right answer. Thank you, Bob. Better is not good  enough. That's exactly right. You have to be... You guys are all wrong. And it's about the halo,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  too. Bing doesn't have the halo of web apps that Google does that improve your life in a variety  of different ways. Would you rather use Gmail or would you rather use Hotmail? Gmail. I don't  think anybody would say Hotmail unless they still use Hotmail and they just don't want to switch yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think that Google will ever end up being the quote Microsoft in 2020. I think they  encouraged innovative thinking in a way that maybe Microsoft hasn't in the past. And I think that'll  keep them fresh going into that next decade instead of kind of stagnating and just becoming one of  those companies that we kind of laugh at in a way in that regard. When we talk about the halo of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  apps and we talk about comparing it to Bing, we should be comparing Google to Yahoo. Yahoo was a  big leader until Google came along and Yahoo has a million kinds of things going on. Groups and mail  and everything in between. Lots of the stuff, of course, has failed. The tubes thing and all the  rest of the stuff that they've tried to do. And they have Flickr and all the rest of it.  And they're just going by the wayside. I'm telling you, the same thing can happen to Google. And I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  think Google knows this. I think a big part of the reason why Yahoo went wayward is because they took  focus away from their technology products and they put it more towards their content product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, it turns out that's not a bad move though. Look at, I mean, they've got like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  top 10 content properties. They're doing great. Oh, sure. But it's slipping. And the way that the  web is moving now, it's moving away from that kind of a content portal. It's moving away from a lot  of these destination sites like Yahoo. And that's why you've seen AOL really kind of refresh its  content strategy away from AOL.com and more towards products like Seed and Engadget and so on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  To your point, Veronica, though, this is why it's so difficult to predict because right now,  Google is clearly, you know, master of the universe. But in technology, discontinuities  happen where things just change unpredictably. And to your point, John, somebody could come along  and best Google by just a flip of an algorithm. And it's unpredictable. You don't know when that's  going to happen. Well, you know, I do know one thing. I know when an Audible commercial is about  to happen. Me too. Right now. Folks, if you're not listening to audiobooks from Audible.com,  you're missing out on a world of great entertainment. Look, everybody got up and  left. It's amazing. She went to get the blonde wig.

Yes, it is reading. You're listening to every word  that was on the written page, but it's being read to you by a very talented actor who has the style,  the panache, the pacing to help you get into the book in a way that you just cannot get on paper.  I am a huge Audible fan. Highly recommend you check it out. And I'm going to make it possible  for you to do so absolutely free. In fact, your first two Audible books are free.

Transcript:  magic kingdom. That is not on Audible. Oh, I'm sorry to say, I'm sure if you ask nicely,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Corey will read it to you. Corey would actually call you up and read it to you if you want to.  They do have some wonderful sci fi audibles really made an effort to enhance the sci fi category with  their audible frontiers. They read books that never were recorded. So if you're going back  and reading some, you know, classic sci fi, audible is a great way to do it. And I know you've in the  past with sword and laser used audible and recommended audible, I just got the sword of  Avalon because of you and Tom actually because of Tom said you should read it. It's really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We've just finished mists of Avalon. But they have a whole series.  Mrs. The first. Yeah, that's the one I downloaded. And they go back into into prequels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I said, Oh, that's just going to be girly. But then he said, No, it's Arthurian legend. And that's  that's when he had he had me at our knowledge. No, it's his Arthurian legend. I love Arthurian

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  legend. Tom is like an encyclopedia. It's incredible. Like on our last show, he just  talked and talked and talked. And I was like, Wow, you really knew a lot more about this than I

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  thought you did. So cool. Now there's there's a bridged and there's unabridged. The 10,  Nastasya, Nastasya Richardson reads the abridged version. She would be wonderful. But I have,  yeah, but I have to say, I'm sorry, I am a unabridged guy. And they have Davina Porter reads.  It's a three volume set. Did you get your first two for free? And Davina Porter is absolutely I'm  just gonna play a little bit of this one of Audible's best readers. She has such a great

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  British accent. There was a time when a traveler if he had the will and knew only a few of the  secrets could send his barge out into the summer sea and arrive not at Glastonbury of the monks,  but at the Holy Isle of Avalon. Oh, I love her voice. My favorite reader is Jenny Sterling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I have to look for her. She's a she's got a great voice. They have such you know, people actually  when they become audible fans start looking for the readers that they want to listen to not just  the books audible.com here's what you do go to audible.com slash twit to our recommendation  this week Mistress of Magic the mists of Avalon book one and its sequel. Get your both of those  absolutely free that right there that's it's like 30 hours of great audible listening. But there are  many many choices. We thank them for their support. We encourage you to give them a try.  I love it. I know you will too audible.com slash twit to continuing on with our decade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you're still in audible. I'm asking when are you going to do some books? You know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  you have the greatest voice in the world. Please I it's a lot of work. Oh, it's a huge amount of  work. I didn't take to do a book. Well, I had Cory Doctor asked me to read for for fun. He put an  album out of his short stories. He asked me to read one of his short stories. It was an hour long  short story. It took me about 20 hours and recording and editing to get it right. Oh,  really? It stinks. Well, I know. I'm now maybe I'm slower with when you know, I need a producer  and all that. But I did all myself. But it was fun. It was really fun. But boy, it was a lot of

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  work. He got some good people reading that Robin Williams had a show on audible. Yes, loved that  show and an interview show. And and I don't know how long it lasted. He talked to Walter Cronkite.  He did about a dozen of them, I think. But he did he did a two part. If you ever can listen to  what he did in two part with Buddy Hackett, I did listen to that and Buddy Hackett destroyed him.  It was so funny. I'm buddy. Robin Williams had did not have a chance against Buddy Hackett. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That was a great series. I'm just looking to see if audible still offers those for download. They

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  may not. Oh, that's a bummer. Of course, because he was embarrassed by Buddy Hackett. It was very

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  funny. Well, it's in my have a great voice. So you should be doing that. Come on now. Thank you. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  know you're a busy guy. You know, that's what it is. He's too busy for this kind of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I like doing I'm doing what I'm doing. I like what I'm doing. I'm making 24 seven. I don't have time  to read. I did though when I did the Cory thing I did it on twit live and people were listening  and making fun of me and I did the editing and everything. So I'll let you know when that comes  out. But that I'm you know, Cory does that stuff for free. Oh, repent Harlequin said the tick tock

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  man. All right. So what else we have for predictions? We're gonna cloud what is going to happen to cloud

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  computing in the 2010 to 2020 time frame is now I some have predicted I think this is probably  true that we will no longer have data on drives. Our data will live out. They've been screened this

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  forever. I don't think that's true. You don't like I don't like it. I don't care. But it's that it's  too unreliable. You need to have backers that are solid. I don't care. Whatever. It's what it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  reliable. You agree that this is going to be the you know, this is the next year or two the cloud

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you're doomed terrorists I'm telling you you've been listening terrorists and the cloud that's  going to be a big theme for the next decade. Hey, look, if the world's going to be taken over by

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  fascists and terrorists, and we're all living in our houses and fear, we're going to need the cloud.  Really? What am I? What I'm going to sit here not connect to anything you're going to get connected

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and bow they're gonna do it's gonna be bad. So you should say I should have like a data dome

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  over my house. You need a data dome data. So we need the dome of silence. So Veronica, I'm with you.  Do you use Google Docs now? I'm sure for everything, right? Don't come crying to me when everything disappears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I like to have local backups of everything just to be on the safe side. And I think that's  just a good practice to have in general. But I definitely think within the next 10 years,  we're not going to have to worry about hard drives for our day to day computing needs at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, I just started using it. I just love it. It's a service called backupify. Do you know  about backupify? No, it's designed to back up your cloud. So it's from the cloud to the cloud. It  uses Amazon Web Services is free if you continue if you use your Amazon account. It backs up Twitter,  WordPress, Facebook, delicious Basecamp, Google Docs, Zoho, Flickr, photo bucket is pretty cool.  Gmail is non functioning currently, but they was working. I'm sure they'll get working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, okay, so here's a question. What does it do if you have a service like a Twitter,  for example, or something that can't really be say a service goes out of business? What happens  to that data? How is it in? How is it being compressed or encrypted? And how do you get  it back if it's a oh, you mean restoring it? I don't know. Yeah. I wish it didn't exist anymore

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  in the cloud. Just kiss it goodbye. Look here, I've got this is these are my archives and backupify.  I got XML. Yeah, it is all stored in a standard XML format. Somebody would have to write a XML  reader to get it back. But these are all the pictures I've uploaded to Flickr. They're all  stored here. Here is my entire blog, not just the data, but also the design. Everything's stored  here. And this happens automatically daily. My Facebook posts, storage metadata and XML pictures.  This is what you need. If you're going to live in the cloud, you need a backup. And now it's backed

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  up to Amazon. Somebody mentions this in the chat room. Did you have the opportunity to back up on  this backupify thing? Your GeoCities website that was wiped out overnight? No, I didn't have a GeoCities

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  button. So what about you, Ryan? You live in the cloud. You think the cloud 2020 is all going to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  be cloud, baby? I think it's going to be a very cloud centric blend. I think there's still going  to be local data storage. It's got to be. Yeah. But I mean, look, I don't think anybody is going  to seriously argue the concept that we are moving towards the web as the medium in which we interact  with applications and data. But there's always a need to have data locally. And that's not going  to go away. Just like there's always going to be a need to have a desktop operating system.  Even if that desktop operating system... Really? Well, I mean, look, Chrome OS is a really interesting  example. That is a desktop operating system, but it doesn't really do a whole lot other than run a  browser. But the thing that was interesting about that announcement was the fact that  there are limitations. I mean, you can't just run a browser. You still have to have some kind  of windowing system. You still have to be able to plug in a printer or plug in a digital camera  or something in order to be able to interact with this stuff. So we're not there yet.  There needs to be certain things for you to be able to interact with your devices and your data.  And the web is not a solution for that. So there has to be an intermediary. And that is,  in most cases, an operating system with a local storage solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Mr. Crenshell, what do you think of the cloud?  I think that I'll always have local copies of everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, we agree on that. But is the primary place...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't agree with it at all. You think that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I tried to run a company on Google Docs and I thought it was a disaster.  Oh, interesting.  And so it will get better. But the funny thing is that I...  I... Being as we are, I am... I get pretty good tech support.  And so when I tell 300,000 readers that I'm trying to run a company on Google Docs and it's  not going very well, then someone from Google calls up and they say, well, what's the problem?  And I say, well, I'm trying to do this and it doesn't work. And so they say, well,  all you have to do is do this and this and this and it's fine. Everyone should get that.  And I say, wait a minute, you have to be an avatar to know what this and this and this are.  At Google, you can maybe think that way.  That's how engineers are.  Regular people don't do what you do. When I was working at Apple 30 years ago,  honestly, 30 years ago, we would test... A guy would bring a program in and we would  run it up on an Apple II. And the first thing I would do is pound on the keyboard.  And the engineer would immediately say, don't do that. No one would ever do that. And I said,  do you have a three year old?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Also, I saw you're saying is that the problem with cloud adoption is that people don't know  how to use it right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Now, what I'm saying is that there is no problem with cloud adoption, except that right now,  it doesn't work as well as it should because the people who are rolling it out  can't relate very well to the user.  That's the history of technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's how it always works. I mean, things that we know how to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'd like it to change, please. And right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, Louis, I am interested. It's a message to Louis. By the way,  let me just say something that hasn't been brought up here.  Okay.  Here we go. We got the cloud. You're on the cloud. You're on cloud system B  and you've got all everything. You got your mail, you got your dish, you got your that.  One day somebody takes a dislike to you and says, you know, I think you're a spammer.  We're cutting off your account.  Hey, you know what my friend...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, so you have local backups. We've already said that 50 times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's why it's important. You got to have the local.  Typically, if you're male, you're not going to have local backups.  I'll give you a good example. My friend, Bill Jelen, Mr. Excel,  has been for the last four years making videos on YouTube to help people use Excel.  For reasons that Google will not tell him, no one knows.  They deleted his account and all his videos. They're gone.  This guy is making a living helping people with Excel.  He was giving these videos away. Google deleted them. They're gone.  And that's a good example.  I mean, I would...  That's a great example.  Even if he has local backups, that's not the point. There's no longer on YouTube.  So what is he going to upload them all?  No, they say you can't create another account once we've deleted your account,  your persona nom grata.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And this is not any kind of justification for that action on Google's part at all.  There must be a reason, but they won't tell him.  But, you know, I mean, to John's point, they can shut you down and then all of a sudden,  your email is gone or whatever.  Well, I mean, if you're concerned about that, then don't use a service that you don't control.  I mean, it seems fairly...  All these cloud services you don't control.  Isn't that kind of the nature of cloud?  Yeah, well, exactly. So don't use it if you don't want to.  Nobody's forcing you to use Gmail or hosted Google or Google apps or whatever.  So, but that's the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Are people going to use start...  I mean, is cloud going to become the predominant way of computing?  In fact, it really leads to a second question,  which is the desktop computer, the desktop operating system, how long before...  And, you know, we just don't have such a thing or we don't even think about such a thing.  It's such infrastructure. It's like middleware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I think we're already there.  I think actually there's a last round of OS updates.  This is the last windows.  Yeah, between seven and Snow Leopard.  I mean, these were not feature releases.  Yes, now you're right.  These are actually just making the experience faster and more invisible to the user.  And I think that says a lot about desktops.  Apple's saying, yeah, you know, the next major release of our operating system,  we're almost not even going to charge you anything for it.  We're going to charge you a token amount of money for it,  even though we put almost two years of development into it because,  you know, it's not about features at this point.  It's just make it faster and more invisible so you can just do the things you want to do.  And for most people, that's getting on the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, I want to mention to Louis that he can put his email back up so I can double  check that I got it right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, this is a very...  Hey!  It's very loosey goosey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Bob, you got any personal messages to family or friends you'd like to use the network to?  I know, mother.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We're done, Bob.  We're done.  I really thank you for being here and I hope that we haven't scared you off with the trivial,  uncertain nature of this show.  In fact, it's usually much better prepared and planned.  But I hope you'll come back and join us again because the consensus is you were great.  We really appreciate your time.  Cringely.com.  Next time we bet.  Next time.  Yeah, these guys have a tradition of making a bet.  Come on, just before you go, Bob.  No, a tradition of losing a bet.  Well, make a bet you're going to win, Bob.  One bit.  You get to choose it.  Make a bet with the Vorak.  I will underwrite the bet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Make it a big one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What do you think?  What can you guys disagree on?  Is there anything you guys can disagree on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Over the years, we probably agreed more often than not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so.  I'm a huge John DeVorek fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I'm a fantastic Robert, the real Robert X.  Cringely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Transcript:  I like to sleep with her.  Bob, have a great evening.  Thank you for being here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, Bob, I'm coming to South Carolina.  Sometime you have to take me to the best.  He's in Charleston.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, that's I will.  I'm right downtown in the historic section of town.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, I'm so I'm so jealous.  That's where I wanted to go.  All right.  Thank you, Bob.  Take care.  Ryan Block is GadgetGDGT.com.  A great gadget podcast.  He does with Peter Rojas on the website.  Go sign up and tell them all the different gadgets you own or want to own.  And you learn about those gadgets.  It's a great place.  And I'm sure it'll be the place to go on Tuesday for coverage of the big.  Well, we don't know what Nexus one and the Nexus one launch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, we just launched news too.  Oh, that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's a big thing for us.  So is that just GDGT.com slash news or is it right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's news.GDGT.com.  But the trick with the news is so one of the things that we do is you get this personalized  stream of content about the products that you have or that you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Awesome.  Awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  So the more stuff, the more products you add to your list, the more content that you're  going to get.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right.  And so I've done that and I keep adding stuff to the list as I get gadgets.  It's really useful.  So that's good to know.  That's going to feed my news feed.  And I see you have the withings or why things, Wi-Fi body scale on there.  I just bought that.  I just bought that.

Transcript:  You want to see my weight?  All you have to do is go to Twitter.com slash Leo scale.  Oh, brother.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you on a diet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, I guess that's the only reason you'd really do that.  Right.  To embarrass yourself?  Yeah.  So just lie.  No, no, you can't lie.  You'd get on the scale.  And then Twitter.  See, there it is.  It tweets my weight.  And so every time I get on the scale, it tweets it and tells you how much more you have to go.  You have 218.7?  Yeah.  That's down to 10 pounds.  Congratulations.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're up to 230?  I was up to 228.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I was getting fat there.  Didn't you sell like some sort of a patent Nostrum for weight loss at some point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Easydiet.com.  You're still doing that?  No, I stopped doing that 15 years ago.  It was a gimmick.  Wasn't a gimmick?  That was a publicity stunt.  It was?  Did it work?  Did you make any money?  No, I don't make money.  I just do publicity stunts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is Kennedy's.  You decoupled the money from the publicity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, somehow.  I don't know why.  It's the point.

Transcript:  2010, by the way, not 2010.  I'm urging everybody.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you said there's a reason for this.  It's shorter, fewer syllables.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We've been saying 2001, 2002, 2003, but we've gotten a bad habit.  If you go to the National Association of Good Grammar, nag.com, you will learn.  Actually, they have a site called 20 not 2000.  One nine one one.  How did you pronounce that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nineteen thousand and ninety nine.  The year World War II ended.  How did you say that year?  The year that World War II ended.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's right.  So why is it we say 2001, 2003?  It should be 2010.  Okay.  Not 2010.  So I say anyway, 2010.  I should say 21.  See, 21 is wrong.  20 ought one.  I can see why we didn't do that.  I understand why we slipped into this bad habit, but let's not continue it.  Otherwise, it'll be like 2024 and we'll be saying 2024.  That's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you see what I'm saying?  Yeah, I think you're on to something here, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's just a little something.  I consider it kind of.  Public service.  A public service.  You know, I'm just I'm like Bono.  He's ending, you know, hemorrhagic fever in Africa.  I just want people to say 2010.  Yeah.  It's just my thing.
