And you're still doing your office hours every morning on YouTube.  I know, because I see.  Early morning.

Start time: 265.00

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, every morning.  It's fun.  I think we've... someone did the calculation.  I think we've got 165 in a row or something every day.  That by itself is something.  I mean, that's amazing.  It's really effortless for me.  It's just really fun.  It's kind of grown into an incredible group of media professionals  that can field almost any question about media production.  And so we have a great time every day.  It's really a lot of fun.

Transcript:  Yesterday you did focus on education, which was actually really...  or the day before yesterday, which was really very interesting.  You had Rick Salmonon, who's one of my favorite photographers.  You've done so many great things.

Start time: 305.66

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We do education on Friday, the second hour.  So we do the first hour, the very first hour, the pre-show is like an hour.  It's just us messing around.  And then there's a show at 7 a.m.  And then the second hour is where we have different things.  So on Tuesdays we have audio and Wednesdays we have cameras.  But Fridays we have education and Saturday as well.  Because educators just need to think about this a lot right now.  How do you do virtual media?  How do you create content for your classes?  How do you deal with your classes?  How do you make that work?  And we've had about half to 75% of the panel has become educators.  So there's about 15 to 20 people that are all...  everything from university to e-learning to elementary.  And they're in the administration.  They're the teachers.  And so it's really you're getting from the trenches the issues and answering all the questions.  It's really an interesting conversation.

Start time: 359.50

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, no kidding.  And you've got musicians on.  And you do it all at Zoom, which is insane.

Start time: 365.50
End time: 389.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, for that kind of conversation, I don't think Zoom has a lot of competition.  It's just being able to collect those people.  And now, for instance, we started bringing on music artists because Zoom improved all the audio.  So now we're getting 192 kilobits, 48k responses.  We had Brian Vander Ark on from the VervePipe and Peter Himmelman.  And so we've been bringing more artists on.

Start time: 390.64
End time: 396.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you're not having them do a double end, or you're just having them on Zoom and the audio is good enough to...  Yeah, that's pretty good.

Start time: 397.52
End time: 413.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And a lot of it's about the conversation.  So the artists aren't just playing a concert.  They're talking about the songs and they're talking about their creative process and a lot of those other bits and pieces.  So Daria Musk talks about she's been doing it longer than anybody else.  And then, of course, Peter Hillman was on Twitter years ago.  A lot of the Twitter people.

Transcript:  We've got Amber on.  And I see Luria Petrucci, formerly the artist, formerly known.  It's good.  She'd probably be happy.  Callie Lewis, I forgot her stage name.  It's youtube.com slash Alex Lindsay, if you want to see office hours.  Now that you just flashed up our story of the week only because it's the gift that just keeps on giving.  TikTok.  I don't even know if this is up to date.  I have no idea.  This was this morning.  So should I do the whole darn thing?  I don't even know if I want to.  It probably really begins in Tulsa, Oklahoma, when the president was having a rally and a mom got on TikTok and said, you know what we should do?  We should all register for tickets online and not go.  And it went viral.  Maybe because it was really interesting to the other TikTokers or maybe because China said, let's make this one viral.  Who knows?  Millions of tickets were purchased.  They got a little help from the K-pop stans who also joined in the thing.  And it really was, I think, a little bit of the egg on the face for the Trump candidate candidacy because none of those people showed up.  So they had a big overflow arena that was unused.  They didn't even fill the main arena.  And Brad Parscale, the campaign manager, got demoted, I think partly because of that.  Maybe that's why the president decided he didn't like TikTok.  But of course, as you probably know, he issued an executive order saying, TikTok, you have 45 days or we're going to chop your head off.  TikTok saw buyers in the United States, never did find a buyer.  But during the show last week, Microsoft said, yeah, we're out of the running.  TikTok has said no to us.  Oracle didn't have anything to say at first and then said, yeah, well, we didn't buy it.  We just bought a 12.5% stake, but we're going to be their technology partner.  And because we're a big US database company, we'll be storing the data in the US.  No one knew what the president would say.  He apparently this on Saturday said, I approved the deal in concept, whatever that means.  He also said the new company, TikTok Global, which again is not a sale.  They just took a stake in it.  Walmart took a seven and a half percent stake.  So Walmart and Oracle between them have a 20% stake.  ByteDance, the parent company, apparently has about 40% US investors.  So it's now owned by 52% American investors.  I guess that that satisfied the president.  But he also said, and you got to kick in $5 billion for our new education initiative,  teaching kids that Washington could not tell a lie and what slaves, slaves, what slaves.  I don't know. It's crazy.  It's really unknown.  The president said he was going to cut, he was going to tell Apple and Google they could no longer offer it for download as of this morning.  That's not going on.  WeChat, the other chat program widely used in China, also was going to suffer the same fate this morning.  But a judge in California issued a preliminary injunction.  I don't even know how the US government can tell Apple and Google, hey, take that out of the store,  that there's no law that says they can do that.  I guess Apple and Google might cooperate depending on the political winds.  In fact, as far as I can tell, maybe you guys have some input on this.  As far as I can tell, the only thing that the US government can do is under the auspices of CFIUS,  the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US.  CFIUS can turn down foreign investment in US companies, but that's not what this is.  This is a foreign company.  And the other thing maybe they could do is cut off the finances.  They can cut the flow of money.  The government can do that. They did it with Iran.  They've done it with others.  That would be a way of effectively putting TikTok out of business,  saying, well, you can't transfer money into or out of the United States.  None of that has happened. I don't know what is happening.  I don't know what is going to happen.  Alex, what do you think?  The reason I ask you is because your kids are big on TikTok.  You're big on TikTok.

Start time: 683.02
End time: 685.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're not big on TikTok. We play with TikTok.

Start time: 685.80
End time: 688.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, your kids have the most highly produced TikTok channel in history.

Start time: 692.55
End time: 711.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The interesting thing over the last six months to a year is how well produced a lot of the stuff on TikTok has become.  It has the same trajectory that we saw with YouTube,  where there's a lot of junk being thrown in at the beginning.  And then as people start to make money, they start spending more money on equipment and process and everything else.

Start time: 711.48
End time: 728.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can also give credit to the algorithm.  And this is true also on YouTube.  It's a brilliant business model.  You make a platform people want to put stuff on.  So you get a lot of people, millions of people, contributing video for free.  And then you have an algorithm that finds the best stuff and surfaces it.  So probably 99% of the stuff on TikTok is crap.

Start time: 731.96
End time: 820.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't matter.  And you don't see it very often. You rarely see anything.  Yeah. And what it's really good at, one of the things that TikTok has that YouTube doesn't,  is the high iteration rate.  So it's so easy to move on to the next video.  And even if you watch the video, you're only watching it for 15 seconds to a minute or less.  And because of that, it's able to get lots of information back from you.  So it's constantly hearing back what you like and don't like.  It's counting your view time in seconds or milliseconds.  It is looking at, do you share it? Do you save it? Do you like it?  All these other things.  But just the action of watching it for more than a moment  tells it that there was something about that that caught your eye.  And then it's basically doing kind of a final four process  where it essentially sends it out to a small sample  and then keeps on expanding that based on the responses.  And so I think that it is, but the real power of TikTok has really been the use of copyright free  or at least released audio.  The audio is really hard to do in production.  And so being able to use other, setting the system up from the start  where you can reuse the audio and really work out, working out the deals  where you can use 15 seconds of copyrighted music.  Those things have been incredibly powerful.

Transcript:  Did they get that from Musically or was that in TikTok before they acquired Musically?

Start time: 825.22
End time: 827.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I think that was largely Musically.

Start time: 828.00
End time: 830.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that was a US company they acquired a couple of years ago.

Start time: 831.56
End time: 860.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then they made deals with the music industry.  And then the music industry, I think the rumor I heard was,  I don't know exactly what the number was, I think it was $60 million or something for 15 second samples.  And then of course they turned it into a much bigger process.  But the For You page is the one that really, it's hard to see,  like when you watch it on a webpage like what we're looking at here,  it's hard to see why anyone would use it.  But when you watch it on a phone...

Start time: 860.58
End time: 872.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then what's coming out here is I haven't logged in.  So this is what everybody would see.  This is not based on anything I've done.  And yet it still surfaces the most interesting stuff  because it's got information from everybody else.

Start time: 873.00
End time: 895.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it zeroes in pretty quickly.  A lot of people will jump on TikTok.  And the first time I jumped on it I was like, oh, this is horrible.  But it's about three to four hours in, you start to...  It starts to basically, not at one city, but three or four hours of usage over time.  It will start to zero in on what you like and what you don't like.  And the algorithm is really interesting because it's...

Start time: 897.56
End time: 914.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We should point out that the algorithm does not go with the company.  China's regulators said, no, no, no, we're going to keep that.  But nobody bought it.  So that really isn't the issue.  Oracle will not get the algorithm.  They'll just be the US database company.

Start time: 915.09
End time: 935.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know how...  I think the algorithm is important, but I think that a big piece of what's important now  is just the sheer size and the response and the culture that's built around it.  I think that that's...  Now all these users are, even like Charli D'Amelio, have already started to move.  She opened up on Triller over the last week.  Yeah, Charli's the only real celebrity that's gone there.

Start time: 937.06
End time: 954.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Triller now looks to be the right-wing answer, like Parler was for Twitter.  It's attracted Eric Trump and others.  Oh, is it? I don't know whether it's...  I think Triller is pretty quickly turned out to be the conservative response to TikTok.

Start time: 956.43
End time: 960.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's interesting is that there's a fair number of conservatives on TikTok too.  You'll wonder if that's true or not.

Start time: 961.08
End time: 986.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  TikTok is not inherently liberal or conservative.  It's not even inherently anti-Trump, despite what happened in Tulsa.  And that's the other kind of problem I have with this is that there's no legal grounds for doing this.  There's no evidence that TikTok's done anything.  It's all supposition that TikTok, because it's a Chinese company, might be spying on Americans or be used to propagandize Americans.

Start time: 986.98
End time: 989.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it just makes Americans really inefficient.

Start time: 990.87
End time: 997.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a waste of time, but then...  It just lets them waste a lot of time.  Almost everything on your phone is a waste of time.  Yeah, exactly.

Start time: 997.68
End time: 1001.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I think that that's probably the most damage that it does.  It sucks up lots of time.

Start time: 1002.70
End time: 1006.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where do you come down on this?  You don't seem like a natural TikToker, but you love music.

Start time: 1007.98
End time: 1011.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm actually not a natural TikToker.

Start time: 1012.46
End time: 1015.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Although that beard could be, and you might not even know it.  Yeah, right.

Start time: 1016.96
End time: 1038.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What I wondered through this whole thing, and maybe you or Alex knows, is with all of the things that were thrown at TikTok,  it's sending all this information back to China and all of this kind of stuff.  Did that actually affect the way that Americans use the service?

Start time: 1039.12
End time: 1102.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's again an assertion that has never been shown or demonstrated.  TikTok says, no, no, we use American servers and we back up in Singapore.  We do not store American users' data in China.  All we know is that they could.  That the Chinese government, it's by law, just by the way, it's the same as in the United States.  The Chinese government can go to any Chinese company and say, I want that information.  And by the way, don't tell anybody.  But that's the same in the US.  So it's a presumption.  If the president knows something, he's not sharing it.  He's not even giving any detail at all.  I doubt very much there's any evidence.  Now, on the other hand, I do think the Department of Defense says service personnel can't have TikTok on their phone.  That's completely reasonable.  Goldman Sachs has said that any private company can do that.  I don't have a problem with private companies or end users saying, I don't have TikTok on my phone.  I don't want it.  But partly because it was a time sink.  But partly because I don't want to send any additional information to China just because I don't have Facebook or Instagram on my phone.

Start time: 1103.26
End time: 1145.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I don't think I don't think it's I don't think that it's collected any more data than Facebook.  So I think that I think that's almost impossible.  Yeah, it's collecting a lot less as far as I can tell.  Yeah, exactly.  And I don't let my kids have it on their phones.  But but that has more to do with the type of content that you let them create content on it, which is interesting.  We create we created together.  You know, so it's what's fun about it from a producer's perspective is that it's one minute or it's 30 seconds and it's really easy and fun.  And it's something you can you can just kind of create and put up.  And we haven't created that many.  As soon as I got really busy, they kind of stopped in February because I got so busy with COVID.  And once March came, I couldn't even take a day off.

Start time: 1145.10
End time: 1153.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you were doing Lucas art Lucas film quality.  Well, we were experimenting.  I mean, the first one on the phone.

Start time: 1153.08
End time: 1187.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, we were the year before over 2019.  I had done a lot of consulting for folks that were in TikTok.  So I was helping with some some live concepts and so on and so forth.  So so I was doing a lot of stuff behind the scenes with it and building some things.  And so I wanted to my kids wanted to see what I was doing.  So we started having fun with it.  And so we started with phones.  And but admittedly, the last one of the last ones we did there before I got really busy was we were shooting with a Blackmagic 6K and yeah.  I mean, OK, log.  And so it was.  But again, for me, it was more of an experiment in the production by more than anything else.  Yeah, exactly.

Transcript:  Do you let your kids use TikTok or not?  Would you let them have it on their phone?  For instance, Georgia?  I don't.

Start time: 1200.42
End time: 1204.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't let my kids use social media at all, though.  That's really the problem.

Start time: 1205.74
End time: 1210.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you ask me, I agree with you on that.  Yeah, I just don't feel comfortable with that.

Start time: 1211.62
End time: 1264.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just it's not a safe place for them.  And I feel more comfortable when they're older.  They they can make that choice for themselves.  But I don't I don't use it all.  They don't have any Facebook account.  And I think that the entire TikTok thing, when we talk about privacy, it just seems that hypocrisy of Facebook gets away with known privacy violations and, you know, Cambridge Analytica and other situations.  And really, they get kind of a mid slap on the risk or please stop doing that.  Whereas TikTok, you know, they say we're going to completely get rid of you.  And that's what bothers me.  And so it's not really protecting the people for TikTok at all.  It really is that the government is upset about this in comparison to Facebook, which, you know, do whatever you want.  We'll ask you stop and then please stop again when you do it again, which I think is exceptionally inefficient.  And I just find that really upsetting.

End time: 1293.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't I don't have a problem with getting rid of TikTok if we decided it was a threat.  I don't think there's any precedent or any law that allows the federal government to say you must take that off the is there.  Can you think of any case where the government has said to Apple or Google, take that app off the store?  I don't think they've ever done that.

Transcript:  Well, in some ways, I think that China is getting a little bit of its own medicine.  Well, China does.  This is the kind of stuff that that's why we shouldn't do it.  America.  Yeah.  China has the great firewall.

Start time: 1303.22
End time: 1306.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

End time: 1313.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 1315.14
End time: 1339.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Doesn't it also set that precedent that if you do something that we don't like, right, be careful, everyone, because if you do something that we don't like, we're going to force your hand.  Right.  Like so it didn't go through with it.  And you really have to think that if they did not do this, what would happen?  Because you don't want 100 million angry TikTok users coming after you and influencers.  Right. We've already seen some of them may actually be voting age.

Start time: 1339.28

Transcript:  Well, the insanity, the insanity of this to get to your point is that is that we making a bunch of TikTokers really angry on election year because they're not all 16 years old.  They are a lot of huge, huge number of them are over 18 and having them all angry.  They've invested an enormous amount of time into this into this platform.  Right. You know, these are people that wouldn't likely vote most of the time.  And you're now energizing them.

And it used to be then it was your you know, now that we live in these little tiny secular units and we don't really need anyone, we still need a tribe.  And so it's like their sports team.  So it becomes this us or them.  They're very, you know, linked to TikTok and to get rid of that and to not have their influences influencers.  You end up having this us or them.  You become the enemy.  And I think that, yeah, during an election year, this could have ended very poorly for a government to have to say, you know what, we're going to get rid of that.  And then what are they going to do? Right.  What do you do? You protect your tribe.

There are lots of issues with China to trivialize it and say, oh, look, we're going to get TikTok as if that's the solution is dopey.  It's a blunt. It's a blunt instrument.  It's not even that it's a trivial solution to a much larger problem.  And I don't think it addresses the real issues at all of China's exercise of soft power, of what China is doing to the Uyghurs.  There's all sorts of intellectual property theft.  There's all sorts of issues in our relationship with China banning TikTok doesn't really rise to the level of a useful tool against that.

Transcript:  You know, I'm not on it.  I see any time I see social media, I see a company, no matter who it is, that is trying to get as much information as they can.  And a lot of that information, like Alex was saying, you know, this is good information for them to have because they can see what you like, what you don't like, what you react to.  Of course, they want to be able to recommend videos that you're going to like even more because that's going to make the service even more popular and you're going to keep coming back.  But, you know, I think that that Facebook and and Google kind of ruined it for me as far as looking at what other companies are doing with their information and the amount of information that they actually want from us.

Transcript:  And the age of the user for TikTok is really different.  And you're getting an age group that no other media platform right now has. Right. 60 percent is between 16 and 24.  So you end up with a huge percentage of the most media savvy and huge media consumers because a lot of people at that age are not like they're doing school.  But even during the summer, they're spending a lot of time on social media.  That is where they hang out mostly.  Most of my clients between that age are TikTok users and huge TikTok consumers.  And a big threat to Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's not.  It's not just the popularity either.  It changes the way you actually look at media because when you get used to this accelerated media that you're getting with TikTok, it's kind of like when I started listening to Audible books, you know, we started in cassette.  And so it was played always played at one X.  And but when you started getting on your phone, you started playing at one point two five and one point five.  And now I listen mostly to one point seven five or two X for most books.  And your brain gets used to it.  It's used to that saturation with TikTok.  You get very used to things coming at you very fast.  There's no intro.  There's no not because I can't afford it because someone's making a decision in two or three seconds as to whether they're so they have to get into the meat in about two to four seconds is what you have to get into showing people what you're going to do.  And and so the issue is, is that you get used to that and you go back to YouTube.  Mainstream is just painful.  I got no time.  It's too slow.  Like, yeah, they you know, when you look at Facebook, I'm sorry, at YouTube, you watch a YouTube video and you're thinking in the back of your head, I would have watched five or six TikToks by the time they finished that intro.  You know, like, like, it's just, you know, like, and the intro, I don't think that's a good thing, by the way, to know, it's true.

And the more that you do that, the faster you want that interaction.  You want that shot of dopamine much sooner and you want to be able to consume because that like I'm missing out.  The more that you consume, the better you feel.  But then the worst that you feel kind of the opposite effect.  If you go through a withdrawal, which is great for TikTok, because you end up going through withdrawal, because I'm not finding out about the newest, greatest, best things.  And that actually makes those neurons more excitable to shorter and shorter attention spans, which increases agitation and is not great for ADHD and other situations or things that you are already kind of predisposed to.

Transcript:  Well, the other thing, though, is really interesting is the is the lab that it has become for accelerated learning.  If you if you go to TikTok and start searching how to use or, you know, little cooking pieces and so on and so forth, because of that constraint, people have gotten really good at showing you how to do something complex really fast.  You know, and there is a true cooking videos on TikTok are amazingly compact.  And they are. And as someone who shot some of those, they're really hard.  It's hard. It's hard. It's hard to show all the steps in a minute that you have to do, whether it's whether it's cooking or some kind of little skill or that because they do all they show all kinds of things.  And they and it's a very powerful use of fast cutting time lapse, you know, all kinds of, you know, a lot of speed ramps to kind of pull all that together into that.  And it's and it's they're getting better and better at it.  At first, it was kind of hamfisted. And now there's a real science that people are not on science, but there but there's a skill set that's building on how to show things.  In fact, a lot of things that I'm like right now storyboarding out for some of the production that I'm working on.  We're trying to stay inside of that constraint of one minute maximum five minutes for teaching a skill.  We'd rather build playlists that are going to stack through those things as opposed to one long video because it forces us to stay inside that constraint.  And make it more is this a bad thing or is this just evolution?

Transcript:  Is it a bad? Is it is it a bad thing for people's attention spans like they when they talked about when Sesame Street first came out and they kind of tried to keep thing within like 15 seconds to like, you know, two minutes segments so that they were kind of really short.  We there's a huge outrage of it's going to ruin the attention span of children and the way that they grow up.  We are getting to be less and less tolerant of being able to delay to work through things.  Delaying gratification becomes a skill that I test children on.  And we have to actually I actually help kids train to have longer attention spans because the thing is, is that, yes, you can learn on TikTok.  But most classes we are still dealing with the antiquity kind of way of teaching where you're sitting in a classroom.  It's dry and dull for most of the point of time.  You're not getting up. And those that can survive going through schooling to be able to do that can get much more elaborate teaching versus people that can't handle it because they're already predisposed perhaps.  Or because of this, they have learned to not be able to suffer for prolonged periods of time, which is a complete skill.  Being able to suffer and delay gratification.  It's a skill that is being lost. Right.

Start time: 1879.52
End time: 1894.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Most of the time they were not spending on Sesame Street, hopefully.  And so it was just a small amount of time and the rest of life was kind of dry and dull.  And you had to kind of go through things and there was more hands like like facial interactions and dealing with personal skills that they're losing.  That's nostalgia.

Start time: 1895.04
End time: 1907.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just the amount of time more than I worry that that might just be nostalgia for the way it used to be rather than is it a genuinely better way to learn is in a boring, slow grind?

End time: 1965.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is not a better way to learn 100 percent.  It is not a better way to learn the way that we used to learn the way that for most like our brains have not changed in one hundred and fifty thousand years.  So we have caveman brains in a modern society and we used to learn by doing things by were mostly mimics.  Right. So we would just learn by observing others.  And because we had to go where our parents were, we would watch and see and then do that works exceptionally efficiently.  I do think that there is a cost to the amount of time that people some people spend on social media and on the Internet.  And almost all of my clients, even the ones that are very young, right, in the teenage years, say that they're on.  They spend too much time on social media.  And so they also know the way that they feel their mood is changed because of that.  So I don't like the way that we learn anyways.  I think that the kids that used to be the leaders, the one that are moving and they have to be thinking and things have to be fast paced.  We lose them in a classroom where you have to sit and have someone drone on perhaps for hours.

Start time: 1966.69

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the thing is, is that we're we did a lot of eye tracking about a decade ago.  So this is before a lot of the stuff got big.  And we were watching people's attention because we were trying to figure out how to do how to execute some of these things.  And one of the things we found is that talk for three to five minutes straight, one person talking three to five minutes straight and people you just the attention span just dropped like a like a I mean, it's like a cliff, you know, between three and five minutes.  They were just gone, you know, and they'd wait and they and it's not that they closed the window.  They just weren't looking at it anymore.  So so then what if what if was Eddie Murphy doing it or somebody who was a compelling speaker?  We were just doing it as informational. We're giving you information.  This is what maybe the speaker needs to be more interesting.  The speaker. Yeah.  The next generation of speakers going to have to be at entertainment quality, most likely.

Start time: 2016.22

Transcript:  But the other thing is, I learned that when I was giving talks, I used to give a lot of talks and I noticed that really all people wanted to be was entertained.  I was always giving them a lot of factual stuff.  They just wanted a few jokes and entertainment and a little tap dance.  They did not care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You probably had some keeners that actually did care.  Right. And you're very entertaining with with what you give.  But it's true if you're not if this is not your area, your field of what you want to know.  I like it. Jim's the one that's listening.  And it's not about perhaps like his favorite music or a beer.  Like maybe that you lose Jim in that point of time.  Right. Like what?  So it's not an entertainment.  I gave a talk once.  I have to get a beer first.

Transcript:  Never do this.  I gave a talk once to HBO.  I followed Louis Black, the comic.  Oh, no.  Never, ever follow Louis Black unless you're Eddie Murphy, Richard Pryor.  Because it was like people were like they were they were like falling asleep because I'm not Louis Black.  And I wasn't doing comedy.  So there is something to me.  It could just be the presentation as opposed to the length of time.

Start time: 2096.44

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the big thing is, is that we're like for the stuff that we're doing with you look at office hours, what I do in the mornings, we're you know, we're information dense.  It's very information dense and it's all talking and it's you move it along.  Well, yeah, we're changing the subject every two to two to three minutes.  And it is that's intentional.  Average view time. Average view time.  Oh, yeah, it's absolutely.  We will take a subject at certain times and let it run for 10 or 15 minutes.  But that's like the maximum.  And generally, it's two to two to three minutes is generally with the clock we're on.  And it our average view time is not over 90 minutes.  So, you know, so it's a you know, and so that's all we pay attention to is average view time.  Like how long do people want?  I don't care how many people watch.  I care about how long they watch.

Start time: 2141.28
End time: 2160.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, you know, and so I always say what's the difference between somebody with with viewing?  You were talking about eye tracking and you know that the things just fall off a cliff after three minutes.  What about listening?  Do people still take things in?

Start time: 2161.06
End time: 2217.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they absolutely continue taking things in and listening to it.  But it's a passive listening mode.  And so for us, that's not the most effective place.  That's not where you want to be.  If you're trying to teach someone something, you want to keep them inactive as as much as you possibly can.  You know, and the places that we see that that active mode is generally conversation or action.  So when they're taking action on things, they're they're in active mode if they're in conversation,  which is why we spend so much time.  The thing I do in the morning is all conversation because that's what we literally tell people that are going to come present.  I'm going to give you we're going to talk for 15 minutes and then it's all going to be Q&A.  And and and then and then the whole thing snakes through and people stay active because there's a chance that they you know,  they're they're they're staying active because they're being heard, you know, and then there's an active place for them.  There's there's a positive reinforcement to keep on being part of that conversation.  And it's a much more compelling thing to watch, you know, and and we see that with talk radio has been doing that forever.

Transcript:  So it's not like everybody except me because I end up talking to the same people for half an hour.  I'm terrible. I am.  If anybody should be fighting against Tick Tock, it's me because I am long attention span.  I can't do short attention span.

Start time: 2234.75
End time: 2268.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It goes the other way, though.  You know, like again, I'm talking about short short videos, but it's mostly short as far as keeping that content really dense.  So where teachers like in the stuff that we're doing with the teachers are finding a lot of success is flipping that what they call flipping the classroom,  which is I'm going to give you a bunch of videos to watch and then we're going to have a conversation about it in class.  And that's a lot easier on the teacher in a lot of ways other than creating the content.  It's a lot easier on the teacher because the students are more engaged because they're not just listening to something that they may have only a tangential interest in.  Well, the chat is already board.

Transcript:  So he gives both. I resent this. I am I am definitely a horse and buggy broadcaster.  And I want to go back to an agrarian age where you guys had eight hours to listen to a show.  Actually, honestly, I think that's why I do well in certain forms of media, which are basically background media that it's just a constant drone in the background.  Nobody's really listening. It's just going on and on and on.  And that you want it longer. It's like Tibetan bells or something.  You just want it to go on because it's just background noise.  That's me. I'm background noise. I'm Walport.

Start time: 2346.06
End time: 2429.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and I think that but I think that all of these things are they each one of them has their own place.  You know, so video is really good at showing you things, because as Georgia was talking about, you know, we've been doing the same thing for one hundred fifty thousand years.  And a lot of it was watching somebody else. And so video video is really good at teaching you how to do something or explaining something.  Conversation is good at sussing out these little bits and pieces.  Audio is really good because you can do it. You can multitask.  I like to listen to stuff while I'm cleaning the yard or cleaning my house or doing something of having something in the background.  But I can I can listen to a long, you know, six hour book or eight hour book that's there because I'm doing something else with it.  And so and I'm able to deal with those topics in a slower, more interesting way rather than trying to have my having paid all of my attention to it.  So I think that one of the things that the advantage that we have now with the new media devices is that we can use all of those things at the same time.  We're not doing it very well right now. We're not doing using video where it belongs and audio where it belongs and conversation where it belongs and, you know, and print where it belongs, where it's really good at reference.  Show me what are the steps. And so we see it in little glimpses of where that's working.  But as I think that COVID is forcing us to get much better at using these media types for what they're good at because we have to, you know, we're in this huge rethinking.  Yeah, COVID really has all sorts of unexpected side effects. It's kind of interesting.

Yeah, yeah.  Ain't nobody got time to respond to everybody.  Our show today brought to you by, it turned out to be the curmudgeon of the crew today. Our show today brought to you by Wasabi Hot Cloud Storage.  I love Wasabi. It's the perfect solution. If you're looking for a replacement for buying new hard drives every week.  There's a lot of businesses that generate a lot of data. They know, in fact, pretty consistently.  We're going to be using a terabyte more data every month or every year or every week. We're going to be buying more storage all the time.  This is exactly who should be putting stuff on Wasabi. Up in the cloud.  Typically, you can store data in Wasabi's cloud for less than just the maintenance fees.  The maintenance fees alone on the same amount of on-prem storage.  Wasabi's disruptive price performance model makes buying cloud storage just a natural addition to what you're already doing.  There's two ways to pay. You can buy at their simple flat fee. They don't have a bunch of tiers. There's no charge for API access.  No charge for egress. That really bugs me. A lot of cloud services. Oh, it's cheap to put it on there.  But if you ever want your data back, you're going to be paying not with Wasabi, one flat rate, very affordable.  Or you can buy something called reserved capacity storage.  This is for anybody who knows, hey, we're going to need this much more storage. We're going to need more storage every month, every year.  Reserved capacity storage makes buying cloud storage a natural addition to on-prem.  If you're thinking about buying more hardware storage, just compare it against the price of five years of reserved capacity storage, for example.  You could buy storage in one, three or five year increments. And of course, the discounts greater, the more you buy and the longer you buy.  You might be saying, well, all right, fine, but on-prem is more secure. It's safer. I trust it.  No, no, no. Wasabi security is greater than on-prem storage because they're professionals. They're doing the right thing with your data.  Eleven nines of durability. They host in premier tier four data center facilities that are highly secure and fully redundant.  They do active integrity checking. Everything you store in Wasabi is checked for integrity every 90 days.  And because it's redundant storage, you're not going to lose a bit. You're just not going to lose anything.  It's secure by default. All data stored in the cloud at Wasabi is always encrypted at rest, even if you don't specify it.  They follow all the industry best security models and design practices, access control mechanisms like bucket policies and ACLs.  My favorite part of Wasabi, the thing that just for me clicked is you can make your data immutable.  That means it cannot be erased. It cannot be altered. Ransomware can't get to it.  Fumble fingered employees can't get to it. Your data is absolutely immutable. That's what you want.  It's compliant with every industry. HIPAA compliant, FINRA, CJIS compliant, Wasabi.  It's not just highly secure disruptive technology that's turning its industry on its ear.  Storage is 80% less expensive and up to six times faster than Amazon S3.  In fact, the only question I have is why aren't you using Wasabi?  And by the way, if you're a managed service provider, this is great for you and resell because you can earn more and charge less.

Apple had a little event, but it's just one event.  It looks like Apple's going to have a lot more events because they didn't even get to the iPhone.  They didn't even mention Silicon, Apple Silicon.  Jim, they talked about a watch. They talked about an iPad and they talked about Apple One, their new bundle.  Tell us, give us your analysis of what we saw on Tuesday.

Transcript:  Well, first of all, if you look at the Apple Watch, what we've been seeing since the Apple Watch was first released is a focus on fitness and medicine.  Yes. So they've, it seems to have gone back and forth year after year where you have a focus on fitness.  You know, we've added new routines and things that you can track.  And then the next year they have some medical things that they put in and they partner with some of the greatest hospitals and foundations in the world to help people and doctors.  This year is kind of the first time that I look at it and see the two really came together.  Everything is starting to mesh more. You know, when you look at Apple Fitness One or Apple Fitness Plus, sorry, I'm actually really looking forward to that.

Transcript:  So I think this was really important. You know, the SE, the Apple Watch SE, still has a lot of compelling features, but not as expensive.

Start time: 2891.30
End time: 2895.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It seems like it should have been less than it's $279. It seems like it should have been less than that.

Start time: 2896.76
End time: 2926.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. But if you look at the Apple Watch SE, you're only missing a couple of the higher end medical functions.  So, you know, you still get cellular and GPS. It's still water resistant. You know, you have a lot of the main features.  You even get the high heart rate, low heart rate things. So I think that there's a lot packed into an SE for the price.

Start time: 2927.44

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess so. I just feel like, well, particularly because of the family, the kid version.  Family setup.  Family setup. I thought it'd be really nice if they could get that price point down below $200. I feel like, I don't know, Georgia, would you, I mean, really the alternative is,  if you have a kid who's in maybe fourth grade or later, there's a lot of pressure to give them a cell phone, not just for them, not because their friends have one,  but for you to keep track of them so they can call home if they have a problem.  But this seems like a better solution that gives you all the features you want in a smaller package. Would you consider doing this with your kids, Georgia?

Start time: 2967.08

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So my kids do have, like they have our old, you know, they have smartphones and they have Apple watches just because of my fields.  You know, they don't use their phones. They have to pay for their time to be able to use their phones.  But they do have their watches and they can use them as they wish.  And I know that sometimes they're using their watches at night because even though you should have all of your charging devices in a central unit,  so your kids aren't sneaking them at night because trust me, all your kids are sneaking them at night.  We don't really do that with the watch. Like they're, you know, they can read some of the news and they can't play that many games.  It's not that much fun. Yeah.  It's fun and they might do it every once in a while, but I don't think that that big of an issue that we're controlling it.  I think that more families would be able to afford it, especially now when, you know, you're kind of stuck in if it was underneath, you know, $200.  I love that. I love that.

Start time: 3018.46

End time: 3063.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's which is so nice and that you can see it.  The teachers can see that it's on school mode, which is the big deal.  If you're cheating, my son just messaged me saying he's never, never used his watch at night.  Hey, it's good that your son's watching. That's awesome.  He's watching me, which is great because they don't have any, they've used up their, their video game.  They're stuck watching.  That's so sad.  But I think I've seen a light on her too.  But anyways, I think that that's great because I think that that was the problem is worry about like cheating and what's happening.  So the teachers can kind of take a look right away and it's on school mode.  Brilliant. I'm sure that there'll be like some little fake school mode.

Start time: 3064.34
End time: 3080.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Also brilliant because pictures that come up, you know, when I'm talking about price, at least you don't have to have an iPhone for each kid.  Mom or dad can have one phone and make all the watches work, which is huge.  Alex, would you get you think your kids, I think they probably already have smartphones, right?

Start time: 3081.12
End time: 3095.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, they don't. They don't. Yeah. No phones.  And in fact, I control a lot of that at the router level.  So the kid, we I have timers on the network that they use.  So yeah, so they're.

Start time: 3096.06
End time: 3107.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And Alex, you're in the lucky position that you actually probably know you're more technologically savvy than your kids.  I don't know how many other families.  Like how do you control the router at your house?

Start time: 3109.01
End time: 3194.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's I have an amplifier and the kids are on the guest network.  So the smart.  Yeah. So then what happens is I turn it on and off and it's turned on for school and there's a little bit of time for.  But most of the time is off.  Like I don't have them connected to the Internet for a long period of time.  I didn't always do that. And I really felt like things were kind of going south.  And so I turned off most of the access most of the time.  And so they have been far more creative, happier, more connected to each other, more connected to the school, to the family.  You know, it's the Internet is accessible, you know.  And so and so just leaving your kids out there is like having them play stickball in, you know, a red light district in the war zone.  You know, and so, you know, so I don't have them just randomly wandering around out, you know, out on the Internet.  So, you know, so they all they're it's a big deal.  The hard part, the hardest part has actually been school because it's all virtual here in Marin.  And it actually has made it much harder because I was more clamped down before school before school came up where we'd open it up for certain periods of time for them to use it.  They have to use all their they can't take their electronics other than school for classes.  They can't take their electronics into their bedroom.  Generally, in fact, we're kind of keep most of their electronics usage in the living room, you know, is where it's OK.

Transcript:  I feel like this these kids features are actually perfect for that for people like you who don't want to give their kids a phone.  And I think any kid who's not in maybe in high school, for sure, they need a phone college.  But I wish these were a little less expensive, though, because I feel like, look, you can you can use this to give them allowances.  You can you can each phone watch has a phone number.  That's by the way, don't forget, it's two seventy nine and then you're going to pay ten bucks a month for cellular access as well.  You can limit their contacts. You can have approved their contacts.  You can have emergency S.O.S. on it.  High and low heart rate notifications. You can have fall detection.  By the way, this would be great for seniors, too.  I want to actually give my mom my hand me down Apple watch because I'd love to have her have that on her wrist all the time.  She should have it. Yeah.  And she has an iPhone. But even but if she didn't even this would be incredibly valuable.

It's the auto fall detection that it will call for you if you don't reply.  I've fallen down the stairs and you have massive amount of damage.  And it was really nice, though I was still conscious that it said, you know, I will call emergency services for you if you need to.  Because I think that, you know, like you're not I don't I didn't have my phone with me, but I did still have my watch.  Right. Are you OK? Yeah, I actually yeah, I think I might have broken something actually.  But anyways, this happened recently.  Now I'm worried. This was about a year and a half ago and I was excited to show my brother some VR.  I'll give you all the gory details. And you flew down the stairs running down the stairs.

It's quite kind of uncomfortable. And he's like, well, you could just sit on the donut.  I'm like, there's no way they're sitting on the donut.  No, that's not going to work.  It would bring up a conversation I don't want to have.  So I actually curled up a little bit of a pillow, put my little cloth.  I have little blankets in the office, so I put one over it.  So it was kind of a cushion. And I sat on the side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you were right. Because at first it was just like, I don't need this.  I got a phone. What do I need this?  And now, you know, I actually I use it to make memos to myself.  I use it for health reasons.  You know, if I'm exercising, if I'm doing if I'm working out with a trainer and I forget to start the watch, I feel like I didn't get any exercise.  It's like it doesn't count unless the Apple Watch.  Unless I fill a room. Wasted that workout. I wasted it.

Start time: 3413.94

Transcript:  You know what, Leo? I think that there are two things that showed this time that Apple is starting to hone in on what's important with the Apple Watch.  One is family setup with with supporting younger people and older people.  And the second is Fitness Plus.  I think to me, those two things, you know, all the other features aside, those two things showed that they they're starting to zero in on what's important.

Start time: 3444.04
End time: 3458.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I agree. And I have a Peloton. I love my Peloton because I don't have to go to the gym, especially now.  I don't have to go to the gym to take a spin class. It's every bit as good as a real spin class because they're live classes.  You can see your metrics. You wear a heart rate monitor.

Start time: 3458.14
End time: 3503.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Isn't that exciting? Like being able to see like I hate I turned off all of the help.  Like I felt just shamed by my watch saying like you're not working out enough.  Everyone else is beating you. You know, get up.  I just felt shamed and it was a humiliating experience. I didn't want to.  And I was really angry about it. Now, other people would like Renee would be like, oh, he filled another ring.  And I'm like, oh, I stopped sharing. I stopped sharing. I stopped any of that.  Yet Fitness Plus, I was really excited about because one, I want to learn how to dance because I can't.  And I would love to. And two, being able to have my stats real time now, looking at me saying, you know what, you know, build your heart rate up.  This is how you're doing. That was the opposite experience for me.  So I'm with you, Jim. Are you going to be actually doing Fitness Plus and getting on board?

Start time: 3504.34
End time: 3583.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So when when the Apple Watch first came out and I wrote the story a few years ago, it helped me lose 50 pounds.  So that was a huge thing for me.  And I use the the Apple Watch as information, you know, so I know I can go out and have a big Mac, but I'm going to pay for that in one way or another.  So with Fitness Plus, when I was watching the keynote, one thing that did concern me is that I can't do a lot of the exercises, you know, with my knees and maybe age.  I can't do a lot of those high intense exercises that they're doing.  But they did say, hey, we have some beginner classes that you can start off with.  So, yeah, I'm very excited about that. I want to get healthier.  I just had another birthday, so I know that I need to be able to do that.  And the fact that I have all of the gear that I need just with my Apple TV and my Apple Watch, I can I can do this.  You know, I don't have to go out and make an investment of, you know, a few thousand dollars to buy a fancy piece of gear, whether it's a rowing machine or, you know, a bike or a treadmill or whatever it is.

Start time: 3584.92
End time: 3630.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Although I also like that you could change the amount of time that you're working out for.  I find that like an hour. Yes. No, I can't do an hour to be able to to curate the amount of time that you're going to be training.  That's amazing for me because I'm like, oh, good. I can do like a 15 minute class.  I have 15 minutes. I can do this. I'll still have time.  And now, which is usually for anxiety and for depression, I just ask for 15 minutes.  If you increase your heart rate by 15 minutes, you will have in about two weeks.  If you do that four times a week, you're going to have a noticeable change.  And it's the fastest change for depression and is effective for anxiety as medication.  You're going to notice a noticeable change in about two weeks. You're paying it forward.  You're not going to feel better right away.  You're going to probably feel worse and be upset at your therapist or whoever is your trainer that you're making.  But then you'll feel better after. And so this is great. I agree. Yeah.

Start time: 3631.04
End time: 3677.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And let's not forget that this isn't a situation where Apple went out and found a guy on the side of the street to make a training video.  You know, these are world class people and they're making new training videos every week.  So this is you're not going to be doing the same thing all the time.  They're going to recommend new ones. They're going to have new ones in there all the time.  Now, that doesn't mean that you won't do the same workout, you know, two or three times a week or whatever it is that you're going to do it until you get used to that and you can you can do it.  But, yeah, see that guy? Yeah, I'm not I'm not keeping up with him at all.

Start time: 3679.19
End time: 3692.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love this stuff. I agree with you.  The idea of having short ones is really clever. They're short as 10 minutes. That's really clever.  They have a huge variety. And yeah, go ahead, Alex.

Start time: 3692.04
End time: 3706.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just say, you know, I think Beachbody is probably more at risk than Peloton.  So with all these videos coming out, you know, they have a whole video program that is going to be kind of pushed up against that.  There are a lot of companies at risk. This is cheap. It's 10 bucks a month.

Start time: 3707.02
End time: 3709.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 3710.08
End time: 3729.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. So everyone like by the time that you've done three months, right, you're kind of already your barrier to entry is like pretty much nothing.  You have all the equipment that you need. You can make it.  You can curate how difficult the type of workout that you're dealing with.  And then after, you know, if you like the service, Alex, you're a weightlifter.

Start time: 3730.64

Start time: 3733.86
End time: 3835.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think I think that there's a lot of integration opportunities there that they haven't done yet, which is with the tools that we use.  So, for instance, you know, I think it's great that you could you only need your TV and you only need your watch and you can go a lot further.  But there's an opportunity to that people are experimenting with that Apple could probably tie in a lot tighter with a variety of support tools, which is, for instance, I'm going to design your workout.  But if I'm talking to your to your let's say your I have I have this it's not not it's it's a Bowflex, you know, but but if it's talking and mine's revolution.  So it's got these gears on it and stuff like that. It could easily keep track of my reps, my weight, everything.  Sure. So you could end up with an end.  Bowflex has played with these things, but it hasn't been that successful because the integration with things like the watch don't exist.  And so as you start to tie those integrations in, you can get into a point where it says, OK, you're going to go now you're going to do a bench a bench routine or you're going to do a curl routine.  And it's keeping track of your sets. It's keeping track of your reps.  It's keeping track of the weights. It's you know, all the things that it needs to do.  You don't even have to know what the weight is. It just says this is the next weight automatically changes it and you pull it out and do it.  And those kinds of things are are just around the corner, I think.  And this focus that Apple's providing, the first step is you get lots of people using it.  Then it gives Apple the ability to go to all these manufacturers and go, OK, we've got 50 million people or 100 million people using this.  And that makes the manufacturers more likely to partner with Apple to provide integrations.  So I think that seeing hardware integration and other software integration, but hardware integration with workout tools is probably something that with this rolling out and expanding is a couple of years away.  Oh, I think that absolutely that that would happen.

Start time: 3837.08

Start time: 3846.44

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 3852.78
End time: 3871.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But without that dedicated, without the dedicated routines and process that Apple is now adding, it's just really hard to get someone to invest hardware development time against it.  But if you get if you have 100 million people using it or 50 million people using it, the numbers start to pencil out to build things that are integrated completely with those workouts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's actually a part of a larger Apple strategy they've been talking about for some time because they really kind of reached peak iPhone.  Everybody who wanted an iPhone and bought one that they were going to start focusing instead of sales on revenue per customer.  And of course, that's part of the services conversation.  Now that they've announced Apple One, which is a bundle services bundle and Apple Fitness, which is the one new service in that I'm feeling like this is a very synergistic play for Apple.  For instance, it probably is best if you have Apple Fitness Plus.  You sure you can use it in your iPhone. We know you have that.  But you might also end up getting an Apple TV so you could put it on your TV.  I can see people doing that.  I could see people saying, well, if I'm going to pay 10 bucks for Fitness Plus, maybe I'll pay $19 and get Apple Music too, because there's music integration that even has playlists that go along with it.  So if you have Apple Music, it's going to be a better experience.  This is this is so synergistic from Apple's point of view.  Tell me about your thinking on the pricing of Apple One, because this is their first bundle.  We were a little concerned when we first heard about the rumors of it that it might not be priced as attractively as it could be.  It includes Apple Music, Apple TV Plus, Apple Arcade, iCloud, Apple News Plus, and then later this year, Apple Fitness Plus.  It is definitely a bargain.  It's a bargain if you're if you're already buying all those $15 a month to get music, TV plus arcade and 50 gigabytes of iCloud, 20 bucks a month, five bucks more.  You get 200 gigs of iCloud and you can share it.  But the family sharing is very interesting.  And if you want Fitness Plus, that's 10 bucks by itself.  But for 30 bucks, you'd also get all of Apple Music, Apple TV Plus.  I think for Apple, this might save Apple TV Plus because a lot of us are on the one year free trial that we got when we bought our new iPhones.  And that's going to run out November 1st.  And I have a feeling there's going to be a sudden dip in Apple TV Plus if they don't if they don't do something to save it.  But if but if it's part of a bundle.

Start time: 4009.00
End time: 4088.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, Leo, I'm I'm paying right now.  Twenty two dollars a month for a family plan of Apple Music, which is by itself.  Fifteen dollars. Yeah. I I'm paying extra for iCloud storage.  Right. And I have Apple TV Plus, which just calculated out.  It would be five dollars a month.  I'm paying twenty two dollars a month and I would get Fitness Plus, which is ten dollars a month.  Yeah. So now I'm already saving.  Yeah, I'm up. I'm up to thirty dollars.  You know, thirty one dollars there.  I'm not a gamer.  So Apple Arcade really doesn't mean anything to me.  But on the family plan, maybe my son might like it or two to two terabytes of iCloud storage.  That's nice. Yeah. Yeah. I love that.  I did have Apple News Plus before.  And, you know, well, that's what I mean.  So I get a whole lot. But if it's coming for free and I'm spending free, yeah, I'm spending about a dollar less than if I bought everything separately and I get Arcade and news for free.  Then, you know, that's what a bundle is all about.

Start time: 4088.98
End time: 4104.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think it's smart because I think like you, for me, TV plus Arcade and News Plus would fall off the cliff.  I wouldn't renew. But but I'm going to get them for free.  And then maybe you use it. Maybe you get hooked on it. Maybe, you know, you're a lifer.  It's very smart, I think, from Apple's point of view.

Start time: 4105.06
End time: 4138.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think the pricing is a lot better than what I had anticipated it to be.  If they were looking at saving, you know, five dollars, then that wouldn't have been good, I don't think.  But I think that they priced it in a range where a lot of people are already playing close to the amount that the bundle is and they're going to get more.  And that's what we look for from all all bundles.  So I'm definitely looking at that.

You could end up increasing the amount that subscription because our Apple numbers really going to continue increasing to infinite.  No. And that's what the shareholders want. They want increased growth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm thinking I'm thinking through it. I mean, I think that there's a lot to build in as far as building value.  I think Apple and I do think that Apple has to as it continues to do this, it has to think about antitrust at some point.  I mean, people are starting to bring that up. And as you start to bundle these together, it becomes complicated.

Start time: 4218.78
End time: 4299.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and it's but I think that, like, for instance, there's places that Apple hasn't played very hard yet.  And I don't know whether it's contractual limitations.  So, for instance, the fact that they're still not that or that they're not producing a lot of their own music, just just paying artists to just be the studio is something where they're either playing nice or they're contractually obligated not to do that, you know, to keep their contracts with the music industry.  Because if you look at Apple Arcade, you know, they could do the same thing where they're just, you know, funding artists, you know, to do that and to go down that path.  They're already doing that with with video. So I think getting more they can get more aggressive in all of these things.  So we have the health is just the beginning. You know, there's tons of videos that are going to come out.  There's hardware integration opportunities. There's lots of other bits and pieces that can be added to that.  There is then you have music Apple could, you know, you saw you see touches of it where things are showing up early on on on the Apple platform.  You have Billie Eilish's song that shipped with logic.  Right. You have, you know, so you have these things that are these tie ins that could happen, you know, beats one is arguably the largest radio station in the world.  And so there there's a lot of things that Apple has leverage in in that area.  Arcade is a great precursor. But, you know, when when as we see more of the AR stuff coming out, it's a it's an incredible platform for a our game.

Start time: 4299.74
End time: 4369.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Arcade is another example. I mean, Apple is in the game business.  And so they've stopped Microsoft's X cloud and Epics store.  They've stopped these game stores, you know, and I think with a fairly legalistic interpretation that benefits them economically.  They're saying, well, it's a store we got to vet every they said Microsoft, you can go ahead with X cloud, but you've got to let us you got to sell each game separately.  And you got less vet each game or we're not going to let you do it, which obviously is a nonstarter.  What is what is Apple do to avoid antitrust?  Honestly, this is an example of me saying, oh, get out of the way.  Let Apple do what they want to do. This is great.  If you're Spotify or your Peloton, I could see here's Spotify's statement.  Once again, Apple is using its dominant position and unfair practices to disadvantage competitors and deprive consumers by favoring its own services.  We call on competition authorities to act urgently to restrict Apple's anti-competitive behavior, which left unchecked will cause irreparable harm to the developer community and threaten our collective freedoms to listen, learn, create and connect.  I don't know. I think as a consumer, I'm saying I don't think you're depriving me.

Start time: 4369.32
End time: 4483.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think this is good. Well, yeah, as a consumer, I think I think that the problem is almost everything Apple Apple is so consumer centric that almost everything they're doing is to the advantage of the consumer.  We're paying what we're paying for these apps.  We're not paying 30 percent more because of that walled garden, because that we're no longer pirating all that software.  We're paying a fraction of what we used to pay.  I mean, I remember I paid seventy five hundred dollars for an app, you know, and I paid many, many for many apps.  I've paid hundreds of dollars.  And so we're now buying these apps for the price of a latte that used to be 50 bucks or a hundred dollars.  And all of these things have become more available because of this platform and more profitable for a lot of folks because of this platform.  And so so the the so the consumer is benefiting from it.  But these larger organizations are trying to figure out the problem really is, is that Apple's pulling away.  They're using they have the size, they have unique technology, they have a focus that makes it an integration between the hardware and software that nobody else has.  So nobody else has what Apple has.  And if it would be one thing when it was a little company, but now it's the largest company in the world with this super tight integration that makes it almost impossible to compete, you know, and especially for anybody as they kind of just keep going.  So there's there's some point where it becomes a problem.  I don't I think that legally antitrust is complicated right now because Apple technically only owns 19 percent of the global market and far less than 50 percent of the U.S. market.  I think that Android was the best thing that ever happened to Apple because they sit in this.  If if if Android didn't exist, Apple would be in all kinds of trouble.  But because you know, they they because they sit in a minority position, I mean, obviously, Spotify and and and Epic are trying to define Apple as its own thing.  But that's that's kind of circular thinking, you know, that to say that Macy's is its own platform.  It's you know, it's or Walmart is its own.  Well, that's our response.

Start time: 4484.54
End time: 4505.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They say customers can discover and enjoy alternatives to every one of Apple's services.  So it's not like there isn't competition on Apple's own platform for every one of these things.  This is not only that.  This is tough because on the I I don't want Apple to become so dominant that Spotify disappears.  That wouldn't be good.  I agree.

Transcript:  Right.  And I don't know where the problem is, is that in our current laws, it's just very hard to define what what people are trying to.  I mean, they you see the same problem with Amazon.  You see the same problem with a lot of these other ones where it's not that they have a majority position anywhere.  They just have really dominant minority positions everywhere.  You know, and I think that that is a it's a challenge that Apple I think Apple has to be careful of in every step they move forward.  They have to be they have to keep in mind that something at some point that that pin could go over.  I don't think that they've hit that pin.  I don't think that I think any legal challenge is going to be difficult in the United States, maybe less difficult in Europe because they're Europe.

Start time: 4545.80
End time: 4567.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, also European antitrust law is all about protecting companies, which case you could say probably fairly peloton.  Spotify and others are threatened by Apple.  Epic maybe.  But in the U.S., it's what's the consumer harm?  And I think it's hard to show consumer harm here yet.  Unless these companies go away.  Go ahead, Georgia. I'm sorry.

Start time: 4568.08
End time: 4602.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, well, like the other pieces that an oligopoly still causes like, you know, there isn't a ton of competition.  And because of that, there are different risks to the consumer of not having the same amount of choice that we used to.  And as these large companies, these mega corporations that, you know, are just raking in cash, buy up all of the smaller, right?  They gobble up all of the technology that could become at one point competition.  There is less choice for us.  And I think that that should be curated and looked at very carefully.  But when you deal with a monopoly, no, they are not.

Start time: 4609.93
End time: 4629.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think you're seeing that problem in general is that Apple, you know, I think Apple users tend to circle the wagons pretty quickly.  So I think that Epic thought that it was going to come out with a it was going to push into this and rally the troops and all the Apple users would just rally the wagons.  Right. You know, and kind of closed up.

Start time: 4629.00
End time: 4668.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, well, part of that big problem, I think, is that it, you know, they admitted that they wanted to start their own app store.  And that led a lot of people to sit back and say, hey, wait a minute.  You don't want to pay the 30 percent to be part of Apple's app store, but you want to charge other people to sell apps on your own app store.  Yeah.  You know, there was a lot of a lot of things that for me that didn't make sense about Epic's argument.  I can see why they wanted to do it.  What about Microsoft's?  It was very self-serving, obviously.  On Apple's part?

Start time: 4669.45
End time: 4677.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  On Epic's part.  Yeah. But what about X cloud Microsoft's X cloud where it's basically like Netflix.  It's a streaming game service.  Yeah.  Apple's blocked that as well.

Start time: 4679.48
End time: 4724.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And this is this is where Apple starts to get itself into a bit of mess because, you know, they do have exceptions.  Right.  And when they when they allow those exceptions like for Netflix and I love Netflix, I love Apple TV plus.  And the fact that Netflix won't integrate with that just drives me crazy.  Yeah.  But, you know, when Apple allows these types of exceptions, then other come it frees up other companies to come in and say, yeah, but I want that exception as well.  And I think that's clearly where Microsoft found itself.  But it didn't work.  Right.

Start time: 4725.14

Transcript:  You know, so I think I feel that allows people to take a step back and look at what's going on and say, I have to say, I feel like Apple is about to put on the afterburners that if I were Android, I'd be very worried at this point.  And as a result, Apple has to worry because they have to always just as remember when Microsoft came in and gave Steve Jobs one hundred fifty million dollars because they didn't want Apple to go away because it was the only thing keeping Microsoft from facing antitrust.  Right.  You know, yeah, accusations.  They want it. You want to keep a vibrant ecosystem competing with you.  Otherwise, it looks bad.  On the other hand, as a consumer, I want to be in the I want to bathe in the warm Apple tub.

Transcript:  Yes.  So on the new.  Let's take a break because I want to talk about they also announced new iPads.  And I think in a way that also shows how Apple is about to kick on the afterburners with Apple Silicon.  And so that's something else to talk about.  Georgia Dow, Jim Dow, Ripple, Alex Lindsay, perfect panel for this conversation.  But we're going to take a little break.  I think our show today brought to you by our fine sponsor Express VPN.  Did you know I didn't know this?  You probably know this, Alex, that you've seen the office, the US office.  Love it.  Maybe because you loved it so much, you saw the UK office, which started it all with Ricky Gervais.  Did you know there are nine other countries with their own versions of the office?  I had no idea.

Transcript:  It's not like it's not the Michael Scott office.  It's right.  It's their own Bulgarian office or whatever.  Anyway, the reason I bring it up is because now I want to once I found that I want to watch these.  And here's the way you can do it with Express VPN.  We talk all the time about VPN protects your privacy by keeping prying eyes of your Internet service provider or your mobile carrier from what you're doing online so they can't sell it to marketers, which, by the way, they will if they can get it.  We also talked about how it keeps you secure and a Wi-Fi access spot because all your data is encrypted.  The bad guys can't see what you're up to.  But the third reason people use VPNs, Express VPN, especially, is because it lets you change your location with Express VPN.  You can choose from almost 100 different countries.  And when you emerge on the Internet from those countries, those sites think that's where you're from, giving you access to content you can't normally get in your region.  If you have run out of things to watch on Netflix, Express VPN is a must have.  For less than seven bucks a month, Express VPN lets you access thousands of new shows and movies on Netflix, on Amazon Prime, on Disney Plus, and tons of other streaming services.  Now, you wouldn't want to try this on other VPNs because they're not fast enough.  But Express VPN is so fast you can watch HD video, no buffering, no issues.  In fact, Express VPN is so good, I just leave it on all the time.  I forget to turn it off all the time.  I don't even notice I'm running Express VPN.  It works on every device you've got.  Phones, laptops.  You can put it on your router, protect the whole house if you want.  You can put it on your smart TV.  It's just the best, absolute best VPN out there.  And of course, needless to say, your privacy is 100% protected.  They have independent third party audits of both their privacy policy and their secure server, trusted server technology to make sure that no logging is going on, no information is being saved.  Your footprints disappear immediately when you log off.  And that's exactly what you want.  Express VPN.  You can try it right now.  We've got a special deal that brings the price down to below seven bucks a month.  I think that's a really great deal for the best VPN out there.  Go to ExpressVPN.com slash twit.

The NFL, I pay a hundred dollars for the NFL ticket where I used to in the US, but they'd black out half my Steeler game.  So frustrating.  And so I just, the next year I paid for it in Delhi, India.  So I still pay them for it.  But I just route through Delhi to watch the game and it works perfectly.

They said, yeah, if you have a Netflix account and you're suddenly in the UK, you watch what's in the UK.  So they don't mind.  They just thought, well, that can't possibly be a good experience because they didn't know about Express VPN.  It is. It's awesome.  Express VPN.com slash twit.  We thank them for their support of this week in tech.  I am going to say that I think Apple, they didn't announce new iPad pros, but their new iPad Air is practically a pro, right?  An 11 inch pro.  It's got a USB-C connector.  The styling is the pro styling.  It's got face ID.  And most, most importantly, the new iPad Air has a very fast.  I think it's the fastest processor they sell now, right?  Jim, is that right?  Or am I wrong?  No, you're right.

Start time: 5082.16
End time: 5110.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The, the air has the, the new A14 chip.  There, there still are some differences between the air and the pro.  Look at the lidar.  Well, you, you, it's, it's a 10.9 inch screen as opposed to a 12.9 inch screen.  So the screen is one thing.  The number of cores that are actually used is, is different too.  The, the pro still uses more cores than what the air does.

Start time: 5112.15
End time: 5114.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's on a lesser chip though.

Start time: 5115.99
End time: 5222.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, exactly.  I mean, this is not ideal for Apple to, to release a brand new chip on a lesser iPad.  The cameras are different.  The pro has an array of cameras on the back where the air doesn't.  The pro is, has one terabyte of space.  It has true motion or promotion and true color.  120 inches.  So, yeah, there are very noticeable differences.  Somebody like, like Alex would probably still want a pro besides that.  Besides, even with the, the A14, they'd probably still go by a pro because there are a lot of other things going on in there that the air just doesn't account for.  Now, even if you look at the iPad eighth generation for the average user, that's going to be the perfect device.  329 bucks.  Yeah.  I mean, that's just going to be, and that's for the wifi.  If you want cellular, it's 459.  So, but the iPad air is a very powerful system.  I don't think that there's a lot of people that came out after the event and asked, well, why would I ever want a pro?  I think once you start digging down to those real pro features, you start to see that there are still reasons to have the pro.  Now, when the pro does get the A14, I suspect that they'll allow the pro to use more cores and be even faster than the air, even though it's the same chip.

Start time: 5223.30
End time: 5256.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How much of this is also, by the way, I love it that they have touch ID in the on off switch.  Yeah, that's cool.  I would like to see that across the board.  Now that we all wear masks, face ID is not quite as great as it used to be.  But I wonder how much of this is just flexing Apple Silicon.  This is their first five nanometer chip.  It is a mind boggling chip.  I can't remember.  They have the numbers of transistors and this thing, it almost as if they're saying, OK, Apple Silicon, here it comes.

Start time: 5258.00
End time: 5306.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And also, I think that the integration again between the hardware and the software and being able to build the silicon exactly for what they need becomes a really compelling process and really difficult to compete with for other people because everyone else is trying to do it all.  You know, they're getting it from over here and kind of piecing it together over there.  And Apple being able to really move towards all of those things together is a big advantage.  You know, and I think that I do think that the separation between the pro and the and the and the new air is is actually pretty good because pro folks like me won't buy anything without LIDAR at this point because of because we can see what's happening as a pro user.  Whereas but it definitely solves most of what you would want to do.  The vast majority of it is solved with the air.  It's incredible value for as an iPad.

Transcript:  It also works with the magic keyboard, which I think was a big differentiator for the pros.  Is this I don't is it the same magic keyboard that you would get for an 11 inch pro or do you have to get one?  It is so.  Yes.  So that's good news.  If you already have an 11 inch pro, for instance.  And I think the magic keyboard and the trackpad really make the iPad something different, something new.

Start time: 5330.46
End time: 5359.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The magic keyboard literally changed the way that I use the iPad.  My iPad Pro.  I I would never use the iPad Pro in a way that that Alex would or maybe even Georgia would.  I mean, I'm just I'm writing.  I'm doing my thing, you know, but the keyboard, the magic keyboard really changed.  So I think it's probably one of the best accessories that Apple has put out in the years.  I agree.

My husband was an iPad user.  I used my Mac and he now he has the pro and he was like always like, you know what?  I have a better computer than you do with because of the weight of the Logitech keyboards.  And I didn't like the other keypad and the way that it sat up.  I did not find that comfortable.  But now with the pencil, this and this is now lightweight.  I could bring it anywhere with me.  I think that people that use a computer for work, this becomes a better solution because you can use the pencil.  And with the new software and this is change.  This changes the game completely.  And I think that this is a great value.  And I think that a lot of businesses like I would have loved if they had an option that was kind of like even cheaper.  But like this is an amazing option for people.  Right. And you end up with touch ID.  So you're very secure.  It's really good.  And the colors, I'm not going to lie.  I love the colors.

And you if you listen to something that has surround sound, it's like it's this huge sound around you.  And I'm like, I don't I don't understand that.  I don't understand how that works.  Like it should not.  That should not work.  And it well and it does.

Start time: 5458.06
End time: 5525.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is another difference.  The the pro has four speakers and the the air has two, I believe.  Yeah, just.  But yet that's that is a good point that this is where Apple's magic of, you know, making stuff work that shouldn't work really comes out.  But, you know, when when I got my iPad Pro and the Magic Keyboard, I used it for months.  I never used my Mac.  The only reason I went back to using my Mac and that's what I'm using now is because I was testing out Big Sur.  So then I started using my Mac again.  But I didn't miss I didn't feel like I was missing anything using the iPad with the Magic Keyboard.  I just, you know, kept going, kept doing my thing.  All the apps that I needed were there.  Everything that I needed was there.  And, you know, like Alex said, if you know, with lighter and the things that Apple's coming out with, you could probably do more on an iPad in a lot of cases than what you could on your Mac.  So it's all it's all in what you become comfortable with.

Transcript:  So it's only only walks like me that say, oh, it's five nanometers, a 14 bionic.  This must be better for a normal user.  You're going to look at the feature set and they're going to say, well, this I need this or any that.  And it's going to make sense because I thought with the release of this A14 that maybe that sets the clock ticking to update the the pros because even though they just updated them, they know they no longer have the fastest processor out there.  But you don't think that's the case, Jim.

End time: 5589.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think that it's it's as important as what some of the me that some people thought that that was important.  I don't think it is because there are a lot of pro features and a lot of power in the iPad pros.  It is now. Are they going to update with the A14?  Of course, you know, they're they may even bump that with something else, but they are definitely going to update it.  But, you know, like you said, they have they have Apple Silicon Max to to consider in all of this, too.

Start time: 5589.10
End time: 5606.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and I think that I think that updating too quickly then creates kind of a turmoil for buyers.  You never know when to buy if they're upgrading.  So I think I'd be surprised if we see anything before next year because just because they already did it this year.  So it's kind of like, you know, they can't.  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

But for most people, it's what will it give me and what is the price?  And that's pretty much where it ends up.  Will it do the things that I need and can I afford it?  And that's it. They that's where it ends off.  So I don't think that most people even recognize that it's a faster chip.

You know, I mean, I don't think that it has almost all the things because the primary use that I have for it is I'm constantly all my creative process,  whether I'm writing or I'm designing, let's say a presentation.  It all starts on my iPad so I can draw things out on every slide and I can figure those things out.  You know, it's very interactive and easy.  There's still some speed issues as far as but I think that adding the mouse and the keyboard make a big difference in how fast it's just a matter of the apps then catching up and letting me use those with the same level of precision as I have on the desktop.  And then there's the again that last little bit of some of the media related stuff that the new iPads are, you know, that we may see, you know, in other in other pieces of hardware, you know, as we come down.  And again, I'm I'm really tracking, you know, the addition in Final Cut in motion of the 3D engine.  I think that that's shouldn't be seen as trivial, you know, compared to where Apple's going.  You have an authoring package that is going to effectively be able to build a lot of 3D content next year for a our glasses or will it be a VR glass?

Transcript:  OK, new iPhone next month.  OK, so early October, late October.  Well, I think that they're going to try and do it as as early as they can,  because they have to get it out there for the shopping season.  Right. You know, so they have to make sure that all of that is, you know, syncs up.  So I'm going to say October 6th.  As long as that happens, as long as they can get it out, doesn't matter when they announce it.  Actually, it's when they can ship it to get into that holiday shopping season.  So you announced October 6th, you ship on the maybe the 16th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Please. I think air tags are one of these things that that could come out at any time.  Right. You know, that would fit into any keynote that they have.  Typically, Apple is very focused when they do the iPhone keynote.  The air tags could be, you know, one of these not a one more thing, because that's usually a big thing.  But, you know, it could be just an add on to to the iPhone keynote, because it's certainly not as big as the iPhone.  But they are very focused in all of their their keynotes on whatever products are announcing.

End time: 6033.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they could they could quite easily have another event, especially since they don't have to bring people in.  I mean, these are these are very well done virtual events so they could have an event every week if they wanted to.  The last one was only an hour long. Oh, but it was an Alex.

Transcript:  OK, I got a question for you. Produces all of these awesome TikTok videos.  Like up your game. Yeah, yeah. It should have been shorter.

Start time: 6051.00
End time: 6052.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Should have been a minute. Here's the thing.

Start time: 6053.06
End time: 6159.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's the thing is that is that there's there's this crutch that Apple has around teleprompters that I just think that they need to get rid of.  And it kind of drives me crazy because it's so if you watch it, even on short things, they're saying a couple of things in that clip and you see their eyes going like this.  Where they have this kind of dead stare.  That dead stare is because they're not converging on the camera. Right.  And so so the thing is, is that and there's no reason to do that because if you storyboard these things out, what happens is you know that I only need you to say these eight words and I'm going to do it in this frame.  And then I'm going to jump to a graphic and then I'm going to jump to something else.  And I can do that. And I felt like there must be some reason that Apple is trying to still hold on to a little of the stage experience or something,  because it still had what I call presentation pantameter, which is this weird sing songy thing people do when they're when they're reading teleprompters or when they're reading their notes on the on the DSM.  Right. And so the I'm sorry, the down downstage monitors.  And so the so the kind of the what I feel like they get what I really feel like they should take some YouTubers probably not tick tockers, but YouTubers and have them like just get Marquis Brownlee and I just Dean and Renee.  Richie to just like just bring them in as a team, give them an Apple budget and let them build a keynote.  OK, because it's not tight enough.  It's the whole thing. What I'm saying is what they're doing isn't tight enough.  It's not this this long drawn out thing with these long spaces between every pair.  Every sentence is, you know, is not when you you do that on stage because you have to.  But you can make it so much more snappy.  They could have pulled at least five or ten minutes out of that and made it feel like a lot more energy.  In fact, I think. Is Tim Cook on a green screen?

Start time: 6159.72
End time: 6180.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Tim is in the hall that looks like at the campus in front of a no pain window.  And then they do a drone shot right through the window.  And then I want you to look at this shot because you know you could look you could tell.  First of all, I feel like his teeth are a little blue, which I think maybe is a tell.  I don't know. What do you think?

Start time: 6181.22
End time: 6191.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Before the pro speaks here, I want to say no, because I actually saw Tim's reflection in the window.  Oh, anybody can do that. That's easy.

Start time: 6192.08
End time: 6198.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But what if you shoot from the back and map it?  Well, let's take a look.  So now Alex.

Start time: 6200.19
End time: 6205.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I saw the reflection, too. And a lot of people said, oh, no, that proves he's there.  That seems like the least likely way to prove.

Start time: 6206.60
End time: 6275.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll be honest. I'm not 100 percent certain.  Here's the thing that I think that I there's a couple of things in a couple of the shots is that it does feel so that see that there's a little halo around him.  That's kind of a yeah, that's common.  That's a tell.  And so that's a common green screen issue.  The trees are incredibly still, which is an odd thing.  They're not moving.  They're not moving very much.  You're right.  The his hair.  So if you go, if you jump to the lab section, look at how this looks different from the lab example and how much and how much crisper.  And, you know, there's something about the lab example that look that feels more real.  Now, I don't know, to be honest with you, they totally could have shot that practically.  And what you would do for the drone shot is you would you would push up to the window and then you basically take a drone.  Take a drone and fly it right on.  And you set that drone playing out like literally hovering and you can look at the transmission in the drone.  Yeah. And you match the two as close as you can.  And then because you can see a little transition as they go through the window.  And that's a really common thing for us to do.

Start time: 6275.70
End time: 6288.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Lisa, poor Lisa Jackson, she they put her down in the first floor.  But and you see a lot of reflections there.  So this to me didn't look like no, I that looks real to me.

Start time: 6289.41
End time: 6290.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think this is real.  I think this is absolutely.

Start time: 6291.04
End time: 6298.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But then they definitely then there's going to be a drone out of the out of it as well.  But I guess you're right. That could just be a dissolve.

Start time: 6299.04
End time: 6305.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's just a transition.  The the other thing, though, is that if you look at the sea and the grass is moving here, there is a little breeze here.

Start time: 6306.00
End time: 6310.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The trees are moving. So they weren't moving with Tim.  Oh, you nailed it, Alex.

Start time: 6311.82
End time: 6371.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So and I don't know that for certain, but I'm just saying that that's that is a that was something that I know.  I kept on looking at it going, wow, I can't imagine those trees being that still all the time.  And then the a couple move every once in a while.  So it's not like they never move. But it seemed it seemed odd.  The still behind that there were definitely somewhere like in the upstairs lobby of here.  Catch Steve Jobs Theater.  Catch the there was definitely in there.  There's definitely some rotoscope. Right.  So they're not they're definitely cutting those screens behind the the person's walking.  There's rotoscope. Yeah.  Yeah. There's so it's not it's not a green screen.  It's that you shoot it. You shoot them in there.  That's a cut right there.  That's easy to do. Now, this is I think this is just the shot.  I think they might be comping.  They might be adding that Apple watch to the to the white.  But I don't. Right.  I think those things are I don't I don't think there was any reason to to do that.

Start time: 6372.14
End time: 6389.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is also a real shot where she's in the Steve Jobs Theater.  That feels like a real shot, too.  So I know it doesn't matter.  But I thought as long as I got Alex here. Yeah.  It's weird. We were saying that feels like a way that sure feels like a green screen.

Start time: 6389.72
End time: 6425.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When it feels a little I feel like the edges on his hair are just a little clean.  And usually when they when those are clean, they again, if you go back to the lab, if you go back to the lab shot,  you'll see. See, look at how the feeling of that feels real.  Yeah, it feels you know, it doesn't feel comped.  And I don't know. Like it just feels like a more realistic.  And so I don't but I don't I don't know, to be honest.  But this feels like he's also moving around a lot more in here.  And it's a wider shot. So it's more in focus.  And but there is something else about it that that definitely didn't feel quite right.  I do like the transitions. I thought it was imaginative to have fun with that last time, too, with the drone.

Start time: 6426.04
End time: 6427.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's fun. I think it's a fun transition.

Start time: 6428.64
End time: 6432.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that my number one thing is to get rid of the teleprompter and cut it tighter.  Yeah, I hate the teleprompter.

Start time: 6433.70
End time: 6438.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that because maybe they don't want to make these poor executives try to remember a script and stuff like that?

Start time: 6440.19
End time: 6467.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that absolutely makes sense when you're on stage.  I don't know if it makes sense when you're when you're able to spend a little bit of time with them and have because remember,  there's only little sections that they're doing there.  And and it might be that they don't want to have it.  I mean, given the amount of effort that is required to put together one of these events, it seems and there's some there's some companies that do this better than others.  You know, they I think that probably Salesforce is probably near the top of the list of of their ability because they practice those things for weeks.

Start time: 6468.20

Start time: 6482.66
End time: 6489.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I agree with you on the teleprompter, but I don't mind this new format compared to the stage for.  Oh, no, I think it's better. I think more informative.

Start time: 6489.22
End time: 6520.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that we're going to go.  I think when they can go back, they'll do one more and they will feel so slow because they're each one of these WBC was at one level.  This one, I think, was a step forward.  I have a complaint again about that.  I think if they if they got rid of the teleprompter and they cut it a little tighter, you would never be able to go back like literally.  It's like one more step forward of incremental step forward.  And you could never go back because now it's a show.  It's no longer, you know, and, you know, if you brought the press back in, you just play them a video and let them go out and play with the gear.  I don't have to bring don't bring them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what? I've been going to, I think, every Apple event since 2000.  And it's great to go there.  Don't rub it in, Jim.  But, you know, there's there's there's a lot to be said for for the way that they're doing these now.  I mean, I'm sitting in my living room.

Start time: 6549.32
End time: 6563.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love it that I don't have to wait till the verge takes a picture of the screen so that I can analyze like this shot.  I wanted to look and see what the A14 had in it.  And now I just freeze the video and I can look and it's perfect.

Start time: 6564.66
End time: 6586.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Jim, to your point, though, would you as a press person, would you feel like you were slighted if you came to Steve Jobs Theater and they showed up?  And instead of a stage thing, you watched a movie that was this.  Right. And then you went out and played with the hardware.  You know, did it matter to you that they didn't do it live on stage and just watched on the big LED wall?  You know, here's how you do it.

Start time: 6587.00
End time: 6650.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They had a middle point where they had someone personally there.  People would watch this video.  Yeah. And kind of because then they get both.  They get that control. They can make it kind of shorter, cleaner.  They they don't have to worry. And they showed some things hands on.  But most of it was then a curated experience of videos with a live like, you know, your favorites were still out there.  And so you got to meet them. And then after you go off and you can, you know, go try on all the stuff and then we have all the parties afterwards that everyone loves.  And you end up with both experiences.  But I do like how clean it was and how short and concise.  And there wasn't any of that waiting while everything gets set up.  And, you know, Steve yells at people for turning off the Wi-Fi, not stopping the show.  I kind of miss that.  Show around. It's kind of nice.  Like, I like the live idea of things that can go wrong. Right.  Like when Elon Musk is out there shooting like, you know, a ball bearing at the window and it breaks like that you wouldn't get, which I love.  But I do like that it was done in an hour.

Start time: 6650.20

Start time: 6657.44
End time: 6668.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, to Alex's point, you know, I guess the thing that I miss right now about actually attending the events is getting some time with the hardware.  Right.

Start time: 6669.45
End time: 6673.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, right.  And so you've got that and you got and you just watched a movie.  Would it matter?  That's the question.

Start time: 6674.44
End time: 6714.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think that it would upset a lot of people that went because as much as Apple's doing a great job doing these virtual events, they also do incredible live events.  And I think there's a lot of people see something or feel something when they go to these of having Tim or Craig or, you know, Schiller come out and and talk.  You know, if it's if it's not for that, they could just continue on virtual events.  I mean, it's more comfortable to sit at home and in my living room watching my Apple TV.

Start time: 6716.36
End time: 6746.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's all I ever do anyway.  So I don't mind.  Yeah. As a viewer, I think a lot of times I feel like I would I just wanted to move faster.  This goes back to our our attention.  Yeah, the tick tock thing is that I just want them to get to the next thing.  And I think that the obviously the generally the most viewed thing is not the whole show.  It's the condensed version, the 10 or 12 minutes that goes out later that day or the next day of, you know, this is just the stuff that was announced because a lot of people don't know.  This one the protein. Yeah.

Transcript:  Yeah, I like the Vive too.  And I have to say when Facebook announced, and I was very disappointed that you would  have to have a Facebook account to use the Quest, I said, well, I guess I won't be using  the Quest 2.  What do you think of the new Oculus Quest?

Transcript:  I would love it if I didn't have to sign in with Facebook.  You already know my feelings on Facebook.  So annoying.  And you're actually, it's so horrific, especially, and everyone knew that they were lying.  When they first acquired Oculus, they said, you know what, we're not going to change anything.  We're not going to infiltrate.  Don't even worry.  This will be fine.  And then, of course, after everyone has it, now you're going to have to log in.  We're not even at 2022 and we have to log in to the Quest with Oculus.  For that, we're just going to use the features that we can and the games that we can that  we already have.  And we're in a very lucky position that we're able to do that.  But that's also kind of infuriating to me.  So I find that really depressing.

Transcript:  Ironically, John Carmack, who left id, the creator of Doom, to go to Oculus, says he's  kind of embarrassed over the Oculus social apps.  You'd think Facebook, I mean, if you have to use a Facebook sign on it, at least it  should have some good social stuff.  He says kind of embarrassed by spaces, which is gone.  Would you ever use it for socializing?  It seems to me not a very pleasant way to get together with friends.

But I thought it was kind of fun in this post-COVID world.  I think that there's definitely a place for that where you can still watch a movie and  you really feel like when you're sitting in a false theater and watching a movie together,  you can still kind of like poke and bother the person next to you and whisper and you're  there in the room.  It's kind of interesting.  I think that there's a little bit of a barrier to entry, but it's a midpoint.

Transcript:  The Oculus Quest was, I thought, the best VR not because it had the best quality, but  because it had no wires.  Right?  So it really had a great experience and it was lower cost than buying an Oculus Rift  or the Vive.  The new Quest 2 has two flavors, 299 for 64 gigabytes of storage, because remember, you're  not attached to a computer, 399 for 256 gigs of storage.  It's a faster processor, the Snapdragon XR2.  It's got 50% more RAM, 6 gigs of RAM.  It's 10% lighter.  It's still got all the cameras.  In fact, one of the things that was cool about the Quest is even though it came with paddles,  the cameras were sufficiently sophisticated that it could see your hands.  And I think more and more we were starting to see games that didn't require the controllers  that you could just use your hands to do stuff.  I don't know.  I don't have much experience.  Was that working pretty well for you or did you try it?

Start time: 7283.75

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it works really well.  It was really like, yeah, it's very effective.  It works really smoothly.  One of my children is pretty much just, you know, an Oculus user.  And we like, it was great.  It's just, it's so sad that all of the little tiny pieces that I don't think that most people  are really bothered by.  But for those that are more privacy conscious or like not that into Facebook,  I think that for some people this will be a deal breaker.

Transcript:  Did you see? Did you watch the Oculus Office video?  That I did not.  Oh, this is fun.  Let me see if I can see if this is something that you want to do with the Oculus Quest.  Here she is.  She's sitting in the kitchen.  She's at the, I'll turn off the music because we don't need this silly music,  but she's sitting in the kitchen.  She's put on the visor.  She's making strange gestures because she's seeing a giant display in front of her.  The rest of the world is black and white.  Look, her roommate just came in and she could see her kind of gray, black and white.  Oh, she says, oh, I better move into my office.  But you know what?  Your office can be anywhere.  She's now in the, I just, to me,  this seems like I would induce, it would induce nausea.  It would be so uncomfortable.  But you live in VR.  So is this something you would like to, there's a keyboard you would like to do in an office?  Look at the way, look at that weird disembodied hand.  By the way, this is not, this is, that is so creepy.  That disembodied hand.  I don't like that.

Start time: 7384.58
End time: 7433.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You see, I'm used to the disembodied hands because for most games they're just hands.  You don't have an arm.  So that wouldn't bother me.  And this, it does feel a little bit minority report and I'm, I'm okay with that.  I kind of think that that's kind of cool that if you can't actually be there,  this would be a great way.  Like if you're dealing with, you know, maybe, you know, a surgery and you need to move stuff around  to be able to actually be out there and manipulate things.  And to be able to send things.  And we can't go anywhere, but you could then kind of be in the office,  but you're not in the office is useful in certain cases where we wouldn't be able to simulate  that we're with other people.  And so I'm like, this, this future is probably going to be happening if we like it or if we don't.  But I think that this is a use case that could work.

Transcript:  This is the new Facebook Infinite office will roll out later this winter.  I think probably they're rushing it because in COVID times, at least, you know,  you get a lot of adoption early on.  There's a Logitech keyboard that will work with it and it'll be not only work with it,  but it'll be tracked and rendered within the headset.  So you can actually see the keyboard.  Facebook said new features will be rolling out over the coming months.  Early releases will focus on personal productivity rather than group collaboration.  So you like it.  You think that would be cool.

Start time: 7468.54
End time: 7475.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Transcript:  This is office work and this is like definitely not for me.  But even if you're a medical professional or you work in a law firm or like antitrust issues,  this becomes a huge issue.  And I'm sure that Facebook wants more data because most offices you're not allowed to log into Facebook  or they don't want you to or there's an issue with that.  And so again, it kind of creeps me out.  Like they're now trying to get their fingers not just into your home and what are you doing  and how active are you at home, which they can then get the data if you log into Facebook.  But also now, what do you do at work?  Right.  No.

I haven't done, I did the, I've done one kind of like a concerty kind of experience and it wasn't the same.  Just the sound and the mood.  But the movie was pretty interesting.  It was a horrible movie, but it was a lot of fun to be able to be there and to have everyone else that was there.  And they're all real people in the theater.

Transcript:  One of the things that causes, there are a couple of things that cause nausea with these visors.  One of them is a low refresh rate.  The new Oculus Quest 2 is 72 Hertz.  But Facebook says they can push 90 Hertz refresh rates out in software.  So there'll be faster refresh rates.  The screen clarity, according to reviewers, is better.  It's got a different pixel layout.  More pixels than the previous generation.  50% more.  So it sounds like it'd be a nice visual experience.  I don't know if I'd want to watch a movie.  Yeah, Alex, are you a, are you a guy I can't remember?  We've done a lot.

Transcript:  We were, we actually did help to launch the 360 video stuff with Facebook.  So we definitely had a lot of experience with using them.  And I played a lot of Robo Recall, conquered it.  You know, but, but I, the biggest problem I had with it is that the, in the gear, the Samsung gear, you could adjust, I could take my glasses off and adjust the focus.  The interocular.  Yeah.  It's not interocular.  This is, this is the, this is my eye.  Focus it.  Oh, well, focus.  This is not, yeah, this is instead of the IPD.  The problem really is just focus and it's not interaction, interactional distances.  That was the problem for me.  It was that I, I can't play the games without my glasses and I had to get my glasses underneath them and then they're all like bending around and it just wasn't a good experience.  And so at some point I just got tired.  And I think that this is actually a problem for a lot of VR goggles is that people with prescriptions that don't have contacts, you just get to a point where you're not willing to do it anymore.  Like I just was, I was just like, oh, I'm done with that.  Like, I don't want to play anymore.  And so I, I literally just, you know, the Samsung one was actually relatively easy for me to use because I can take my glasses off, throw them on and, you know, scroll focus in and then, and then go.  But, but the, I just found I got to kind of the end of the road with both HTC and with Oculus because I just got tired of mashing up my glasses against my face to play.  And I didn't really want to go out and buy, you know, things like, especially when I knew the problem with Samsung ruined me is I knew that there was a small mechanical fix for those that they weren't doing.  And so it made me frustrated.

Transcript:  Yeah.  Let's take a quick little break.  We have a bunch of small assorted unrelated stories we can run through and wrap things up in just a little bit.  Oh shoot.  I left my Raycons in the other room.  I should run and get them.  They're so beautiful.  When you're listening to music, Jim, you know this, it's great to have earbuds.  You can move around.  There's no wires.  But these are often very expensive devices.  I love my Raycons premium wireless earbuds for about half the price.  There's a lot to be said for that.  These new everyday 25 earbuds, the best yet six hours of playtime, seamless Bluetooth pairing.  This was an advantage that Apple had with the AirPods for a while.  But now these Raycons, man, they pair so nice and the base, they come with a number of different six different sizing tips.  So you can get the size and seal just right.  The base sounds fantastic.  The design is very compact.  And with those, when you get the right ear, but in there, the earpiece in there, the noise isolating fit is just superb.  I love my Raycons, stylish and discreet.  No dangling wires, no stems.  And because it was founded by a musician, I guess it's not a surprise.  Ray J, of course, is the Ray in Raycon.  But there are a lot of celebrities including Snoop Dogg, Melissa Etheridge, Mike Tyson, Rich the Kid.  They love the Raycons.  Now I want you to try them.  There's a 45 day free return policy.  So if you have any doubts, no problem.  You're going to love the price.  You're going to love the savings.  And I know you're going to love the sound.  That's why I recommend wireless earbuds from Raycon.  It's where I wear them.  And that's why they're not with me.  I left them in the other room for a limited time.  Get 15% off your order at buyraycon.com slash twit.  B-U-Y-R-A-Y-C-O-N.com slash twit.  That's a great deal on already a very affordable earbuds.  It's 15% off the Raycon wireless earbuds.

Transcript:  Yeah, there was a big issue Saturday, actually previously, with PS5 preorders.  PlayStation Sony took to Twitter on Saturday to apologize and say we have more and we're going to put more in the in the pipeline.  So don't do not fear the new PlayStation 5 will be $499.99.  If you want the digital optical disc, I would just say get the digital edition, which is $399.99, 100 bucks less.  You don't get the Blu-ray player.  But since most games these days are big downloads, even if you have a disc, I'd say get the digital edition.  I think that's probably what we're going to get.  I asked Michael, our 17 year old, he has both and his birthday is November 26th.  And he said, I want a PS5.  So that's going to be November 12th.  It's going to come out in the U.S. and the 19th in the rest of the world.  On the other hand, dad's an Xbox gamer.

Transcript:  Be interesting to see last time there was this great game of chicken between Sony and Microsoft and Microsoft blinked and announced a price for their Xbox one, which Sony then undercut by $100.  And that was enough to put the Sony PlayStation 4 way ahead for the entire lifespan, really, of these consoles.  This time, same thing.  Microsoft went first.  But Microsoft had such a stunning price point that there was no question of Sony undercutting it.  So they both are $500 consoles.

Let's see.  Peacock has done a deal with Roku.  You're now going to be able to get Peacock on your Roku.  What did it take?  It took NBC threatening to pull all its apps from the Roku platform.  They threatened that on Friday morning by Friday afternoon.  Roku said, oh, yeah, we'll make a deal.  So that actually was, I think, a mistake when they launched Peacock not to be on Roku.

It's a murder type show.  I think it's from Oxygen.  I got a note that a new season was released, season three, on Hulu, but not on Peacock.  And it's a Peacock show.  That pisses me off when they do that.  So now I'm thinking.  So I really liked watching The Blacklist.  There are very few network shows that I watch anymore.  But The Blacklist, I really liked.  But I'm a full season behind.  So I say, oh, Peacock, they make The Blacklist.  So I go in after I buy it.  They have one season out of seven.  It's their show.  Is it like the middle season?

I don't care about 50 year old shows.  I want some of the new shows.  But even the shows that I do want to watch, they only have one or two seasons.  And then I have to buy Hulu in order to watch the rest.  So what's the point?  Peacock sucks.

You like pay for a month?  Everyone knows. No, no, we don't rotate.  I mean, I'm saying that's like those.  You got to turn Disney off and on because I don't care about anything other than Mandalorian.  So it's like it's kind of like, OK, turn it on and watch Mandalorian.  Then turn it off.  I will admit I can see why they do it every month or every week because if they gave it me Mandalorian, I would just spend a whole weekend watching Mandalorian.

It's not a spool.  The only thing the only thing that took time was was the first leveling of the platform,  which is that you have to take this little thing and go back and forth.  You say go over to this corner and you go back and forth until it's and you have to do  something manually to get it to it's not auto leveling or whatever.  And so so I had to do that.  That took five minutes and and it was it was kind of a took some time, but it didn't it  wasn't hard to figure out how to do it.  And and then after that, I printed a test thing and I walked away and came back and  then it's just push button.

I'm sure that there are I mean the yeah, it's it's probably the size of the of the chain.  It's just the size of the print.  I think the only thing was different between that one and the one I got was the print size.  You know, I wanted to have a larger print size.  Nice.  So anyway, how do we get to that?  Mandalorian.  Oh, yeah.  So but I think that I think that the I've gotten subscribed out.  I feel like there's so much content.  I'm trying to figure out what to watch every time.  And I'm and I'm I've gotten more interested in the quality of the videos, you know, how  high quality is the video, the audio?  You know, I have a surround system in my house.

You know, so I don't I don't really you know, for whatever reason, I just don't I'm not  around that conversation very often.  Like we're not talking about shows.  So again, Mandalorian is one that we all talk about.  And maybe it's because it is that one every week that we have time to ingest it and think  about it and and talk through it.  But but outside of that, yeah, I pretty much.  Pretty much.  You know, I'm so disconnected from that because we just finished watching Person of Interest,  like my wife went into a grind of just watching Person of Interest for two months.  I just you know, and and so we just got to the end of it last night.  And so but it's much more fun because you just watch it every night.  You watch the same.  And here's the thing is that they make so much more sense when you're watching them  every night, like when you can watch like five or six seasons every night or two or  three a week or whatever, it all ties together.  You understand all the subplots and everything else, because I can't remember them between  week I'm too old.  Oh, I know. I agree with you. I have to binge now.
