End time: 1181.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  if if from the beginning a  Regular thin mask or anything to cover your mouth isn't going to stop you from catching the virus  But what it does do is minimizes your spray out. So if they would have said from the beginning  Hey everybody just cover your face would have been better  We would have cut down on people giving it to other people  You're still not gonna stop it but wearing something like this also cuts down on your viral load  You know  sometimes your kid comes home they got the flu or the cold and they're dying inside and then you get it and you're like  It's not that bad because you got a secondary wind of it that was that was watered down in a sense  So this helps you water that down. It's not overkill. This is something that we should have been doing from the get-go  It's not that big with inconvenience when you're out in the streets to wear this the problem  I have is that if you're black people are cops are following people in the stores and not letting them go in the stores  Is that ridiculous? Because you can't wear a mask  That's so because I'm black. It's just an extra thing. I have to worry about  So that's my only issue with it. But otherwise, oh, I also had someone  racially accost me  last week and  He would have never said he was behind my mask because he was a mask and glasses and a hoodie  Like he was just using the n-word. I know my heart if you could if I could have saw his face  Yeah, I would have never spoke to me like that. So, you know the good and bad about wear masks XK

Transcript:  It's true  they were also saying that when you're outside if people are exercising like at a high level like if they're biking or  Running or jogging the area of dispersal for them is much bigger  So you have to give them even more space and that's the more you could do to protect yourself protect your fellow humans  Just it's it's it's polite, but it's also in the best interest of us surviving

Transcript:  so I want to get back to this issue of do you ban the technology or do you regulate the side effects and this is tied in  also to kovat because  one of the things that we're going to need to do when the  Quarantine ends is unless we want to go back into quarantine again and again and again is keep track of any  emergent cases and  Everybody they've been in contact with quarantine them. That's containment versus quarantine  You contain the potentially infected people so that the rest of us can go about our business  That's gonna take and in China, they're doing it, but they're doing it in an invasive way  They're forcing people to Korea to and Korea to they're putting apps on phones this week after  This week Apple and Google announced  They're going to do a privacy forward  voluntary  Version so this is a coronavirus tracking system that will be available mid month next month on  iOS and Android  It's kind of an interesting idea  In fact this probably this document from Apple and Google is the best way to describe it  You have on your phone something called Bluetooth Ellie all modern phones have it  not the Bluetooth used to pair to headphones, but a  Lightweight low-energy version of it that does the pairing automatically behind the scenes  so Bluetooth Ellie is on you are given each day a unique identifier and  Whenever you come near somebody else's Bluetooth Ellie phone you beacon out your unique daily identifier to them  Not associated with your personality. It's not there's no personally identifiable information exchanged  So here's the example Alice and Bob meet each other for the first time and have a 10-minute conversation  then  During that in the background their phones are exchanging their identifier beacons this daily actually there's two  There's the personal identifier that's daily and then there's a 15 minute beacon generated every 15 minutes  And that's so you can I I guess so you can know what time they met a few days later  Bob is diagnosed positively for kovid  He voluntarily all this is volunteer you have to have the app you have to voluntarily  Say I'm gonna do this enters the test result in the app by the way the apps not from Google or from Apple  They are publishing an API that health authorities can use so you'll feel a little bit better about it, right?  You won't come from Google or Apple with Bob's consent notice again more consent his phone uploads the last 14 days of keys of  people he's run into  Of people he's run into and then they can be notified to go into quarantine themselves  this seems like a  good plan  With some potential flaws the biggest flaw is it's voluntary  Georgia is this doesn't bother you right?

Start time: 1404.87
End time: 1465.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It does bother me. Yeah  Me one is that well okay, so one is that if it's voluntary then it's not gonna work because the people one is we're lazy  We're not gonna volunteer in information if you're planning to go to party  You're not gonna want to tell people so people are still gonna do what they do because we're you know inept by nature  The second thing is that it's just one more slip away from our own feelings of privacy  Once we're comfortable with governments tracking us we will be more comfortable with governments tracking us and they're not gonna give back information  Afterwards so it's that kind of comfort level the third part to this is that it's kind of too late, right?  It's everywhere already they if they had enacted this in December or even January  They could have really done a really great job with people quarantine isolation  You know being able to get we missed we missed the initial opportunity to contain  I wish now all we're doing is giving up our information for truly nothing. Maybe the second wave perhaps

Start time: 1465.34

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's the idea so Georgia the theory is if we all shelter in place as really the whole world is doing right now  At some point the virus  Activity will will go down. You can't it doesn't live independently of humans  So if nobody has it in let's say this small area

Start time: 1482.40

End time: 1524.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It could be it doesn't yeah, the cat can't give it to you, but let's say you ate a pangolin for breakfast  Yeah, maybe then so but presuming that  Okay  Goes away, okay  But what happens is people come and go so we could say, you know, there's very there's either no or very few cases in Sonoma County  Everybody you can go outside  But what we need to do is keep an eye out if somebody gets sick  We need to trace all their contacts and quarantine them so that we don't all have to be quarantined. It's for down the road

Start time: 1525.26
End time: 1561.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But the problem with that is that people aren't getting tested  So they will they will this is not yes  This is all presuming that testing becomes widespread and right we're giving away our privacy for a system that no  Privacy is no personally identifiable information makes people comfortable with being personally trapped  What happens during any sort of issue where we feel really scared and fearful?  The government kind of goes for this power grab it happens. It happens in all kind of  Authoritarian governments, it's just really common  It did and do they ever give it back after no

Start time: 1563.62

End time: 1593.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  comfortable with being trapped and people will give it away and think that this is good and then after  You know will be more comfortable with the next little step that goes into the next way and it doesn't really help  Prevent us from being sick like if people aren't being tested then what does this even matter and they're not enough people are being tested  And that's the first thing that they should be dealing with if they really wanted to stop this spread everyone would get tested

Transcript:  Commend you uncle Leo with your spirit of trusting things first of four of us  Telling me that they're not collecting any data  And they're not somebody could flip a switch to do anything that they want to do and there's bad apples that do things all the time  So when you say that with such impunity it makes me giggle  So I understand that you have a hopeful heart and you think that things are gonna be helpful the way they are but they're not  secondly, so  people right now  Granted if testing is available and they're getting tests  But if somebody has a symptom and they just have a cold and there's no quarantine yourself  Next thing you know quarantine yourself and that number could get ratted off really quick without somebody even getting checked on and you say if  Tests are available, but they're not and so the system again as she said is too late  So what is it something to do just something to put more tracking things on my phone?  I already got to worry about tick tock and my daughter out here shaking and dancing every three seconds  But now you want me to put low LTE and tell me that it's no big deal  There's no reason for this because it's not gonna help us and unless they're gonna come around and round people up in paddy wagons  I say oh well  We just got a hit that you saw Susie on Tuesday and she might be sick and now you gotta get quarantine  Oh leave your house cuz you got six kids. Come on with us. We're gonna put you in the truck  Everybody else might be sick. I don't know what this is gonna do and it's too late.

They find out right away and you know, whether you know, how safe do you need to be?  What about your family and then we can track it from there now  We need to ramp up the amount of people that are being done  I think that we're trying to get to 10,000 a day

You're insane people gonna be breaking into people's homes  They're not gonna be able to live or afford to do anything  An employment's gonna run out because we have a corrupt system that won't just take care of people so I  Good luck. That's a very  dystopian point of view you have but it's a factual point of view people right now are  Struggling I have friends in New York that  literally are trying to move back home with their parents because they don't know what they're going to do and  Their credit is going to be destroyed because they can't afford that crazy apartment with their three roommates and the rent

Transcript:  247 I'm going back to the Google Apple thing. So okay. There are issues with it Moxie Marlins  Actually weighed in with a tweet stream Moxie, of course the creator of the open whisper systems the signal protocol  he's a security researcher and his first take was low let's look at this from a  security point of view he described in his tweets how it works and  He says I'll kind of go through some of his points  Published keys are 16 bytes one for each day if a moderate number of smartphone users are infected in any given week  That's hundreds of megabytes for all phones to download that seems untenable  It seems like some kind of personally identifiable information would have to be combined  With what the device framework gives you admittedly the device framework is anonymous  But how are you going to figure out where to go to say quarantine your phone?  He says keys published by a device have to be turned in turn published to all devices  That's a major denial of service vector because if anyone can anonymously blast keys  They can create a situation where there's gigabytes of data for all devices in the world to retrieve and compute in other words  He'd take every cell phone offline for a significant period of time  Not to mention the prank aspect of being able to lie to the computer and say hey  Significant period of time not to mention the prank aspect of being able to light up everybody  You've been nears devices with you've been exposed to kovat without them knowing you're the culprit you just say you've tested positive, right?  Aside for this the api's are novel in terms of what becomes possible from the app layer  I'm not super optimistic about opt-in contact tracing becoming a major factor  But I do anticipate someone will end up using this for some other interesting thing  His subtext is ad tech will promptly use this because it's a clever idea  So are the tech companies?

Transcript:  I want to talk about a way to make your air cleaner and better the molecule molecules an amazing device  We have them all over the place at home and here in the studio because molecule does something really interesting now  I I know there are people who are saying in other places  Oh, no, no, no, but they aren't testing the pico capabilities the photo electrochemical oxidation  Because it's all we can't it's too expensive  Let me tell you if you go to molecules website and read the white papers a really interesting test from the Berkeley  Labs the government labs Department of Energy run labs at the  Lawrence Livermore labs at Berkeley they tested the molecule and they tested their pico claims pico  Uses breakthrough science to break down viruses and pollutants things like volatile organic chemicals on a molecular level  It traps them and destroys them with ultraviolet light. It's really incredible  It actually makes your air better because it destroys  indoor air pollutants at a molecular level the unit they've have tests and you'll see these white papers on their website from the University of Minnesota  particle calibration lab and  Intertech a nationally recognized lab and now the new one from the Berkeley labs  particles as long as zero as small as zero point one microns a  Hundred nanometers were removed by the molecule air in the air mini during the 25 minute test duration  The particle capture of larger particles dropped from about 3500 to 600 in less than 25 minutes the science speaks  The molecule works, but it's more than just a science. It's my own personal  Experience I know that's anecdotal, but I'll tell you I know when the molecules been turned off or unplugged  Lisa does too she wakes up. She's I got a headache check the molecule. Oh Michael unplugged it  Molecules technology been tested by science tested by real people and it's given  Allergy and asthma sufferers around the country an all-new experience. This is a bad time for allergies right now in Petaluma  It's awful, but thanks to the molecule we sleep better  Molecule provides air purification for the whole home across a range of products whether it's the molecule air for large rooms the molecule air  Mini for smaller rooms you could choose the unit  That's best for your space or put together a bundle that provides air purification for your entire area  And if you are in a sealed office, this is a must-have  Ten percent off your first order right now go to molecule.com  M O L E K U L E  .com the offer code is twit ten for ten percent off  molecule.com  Twit ten it really works. It's really a remarkable technology. It's not a HEPA filter  It's better molecule.com offer code is twit ten  Owen JJ Stone  Mr. O Doctor  I've known you for a long time. I've always seen you as an honest a deep powerful man  Mostly powerful would you he's muted your are you there? Is it me it was us?  Are you as you yeah? Oh, yeah, there you hear me.

We're doing video now. I got three episodes in the can you guys could check it out  But I actually checked on my child because I'm a horrible parent and she gets pretty much A's and B's  I don't ever ask her about school or care  But I said the other day on the show I said so what's this zoom thing like she's like  well  we're in the classroom with the other kids and  Kids have dogs going on in the background or siblings running around crazy  And then it takes over when the teachers trying to talk to us  So I can't ever understand or hear what the teachers saying and I'm like, why don't they hit mute?  She's like I hit mute when the teacher speaking but other kids don't know how to use computers and they don't know to do that  So the teachers talking then you can't hear the teacher teachers talking the UK to teacher and I'm like, well, that's ridiculous

Yay, a lot of fun  They're gonna be doing it through zoom and I'm like  I'm gonna be having a chat with them at the end of the audit so that I'm done and I don't have to worry about  Annoying them how this is really an unsafe system to be able to use to talk to all the different therapists  So yeah kind of interesting I'd rather not but there's there's not many options for things that work really well  Zoom is really easy to use and so I think because of that  It takes over because there's not a competing product that is as simple to be able to you just send a link you go in

Transcript:  And you're there. I think it's possible to use zoom. You got to teach people to move for instance  You got to set up the settings so that people's can't zoom bomb  Admittedly zoom had problems. I was encouraged because this week Alex Stamos  Who I consider to be a top-notch security guy he was security Yahoo  Left when he found out the Yahoo been hacked, but the boss didn't tell him  He was security at Facebook left seems like he's here. He's present in a lot of car wrecks  He left when they found out about Cambridge Analytica, but I think he's really widely considered to be really good

Transcript:  He says I got a phone call from Eric you on zooms founder and CEO  This was last week after zoom, you know zoom went from 20 million daily active users in December to 200 million in March  And so insane they were a business product and they were optimized for ease of use. They weren't optimized for security

Start time: 3032.44
End time: 3037.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Transcript:  They wanted to be adopted as possible as fast as possible you and I on Mac break weekly some months ago talked about the really nasty  flaw that zoom introduced on Macintosh is because  When zoom was installed on a Mac it opened up a web browser created a web browser with an open port  The idea was it makes it easy the next time you're in a zoom meeting  Even if you want to install it you just click a link and zoom will download and run so it was about ease of use  Or maybe growth hacking but they didn't they were told about it  They didn't remove it Apple actually had to send out a push out a patch to fix it. So that's nasty

Transcript:  Dick, but he doesn't understand this stuff. He just clearly I mean like most politicians. They don't understand technology  They want political I did a zoom chat this week  Like I I told you before on on macbreak weekly that I I will not use facebook  I will not use zoom but because of the times we're living in if my family or someone else reaches out to me  We have to use zoom. Yeah, i'll do it. And so there was a charity stream this week to raise money for covet 19  It was a bunch of educational youtubers playing jackbox  And they used zoom and because I want to help with this I I use zoom for it  I'm not gonna like i'm not gonna go out of my way to use it  I'm not gonna ever start one but i'm not gonna be I don't think I have the luxury of  Being principled and refusing to use these technologies. I'm encouraged because because stamos

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Said he's going to come on as a consultant. He he  He said you want to ask him if I'd be interested in helping zoom build up its security privacy and safety  And I readily agree agreed. So I think stamos understands how important zoom is right now  and  I get the sense that he gets the sense from you on that you want is committed to this now watch carefully  Stamos will be the canary in the coal mine because just like a yahoo and facebook  If you see a post from stamos saying i'm out of here  Now we know

Transcript:  Well, it's just what's the what's the dna of the company? What's the culture of the company like an apple?  And i'm only saying apple because that's the company. I know the I know best but the other companies might do this too  They have a concept called private by design and the privacy group and the security group  There's a couple groups that have like almost unlimited power the performance team  Which can take your code away and say it's wasting battery  Security team can take your code away and say there's an exploit the privacy team has to approve every stage of design  And you can't like get to the end and say oh we're gonna go back and retrofit privacy  You every stage of of go forward on the project has to be private and a company like zoom isn't used to it  They were just go to market go to market go to market and it's really hard  Like if you're an engineer, it's so fra. Oh, i've got to check for oh, i've got to audit  I've got to make like it it puts so much more barrier to delivery, but it's imperative to  At least have like i'm not saying everyone has to run like apple like there are all different models  But you can't have like vectors for easy attack on your users  Just because you're negligent and auditing your code from the start. I'm going to give them the benefit of that

Transcript:  Remember that the company is an american company there in silicon valley  But all the all the coders are in china the three chinese companies  Uh at one point zoom routed all the traffic through china, but that seems to have been there  I'm going to give them the benefit of that because we do need something that's easy to use  We've little psa we've talked about jitsi before I use jitsi. It's an open source product  Uh, it was trivially easy for me to put jitsi on my debbie and server at my house. In fact, I I  It's twit.team. I created a server  It's https. It uses let's encrypt. That's all built into jitsi  Only I can start a meeting don't all run over there because I was worried about killing my server, but it makes it very easy  plus  You don't need to install any software. I can send a web address twit.team  Family, let's say to my family and say click this  And you're in and that's all you need to do. So that is as easy to use as zoom  It doesn't have all the features. You can't change your desktop background or your wall, you know the background behind you  You can't blur your camera actually you can't blur your camera. Don't  um  So there is an alternative  But good luck trying to get people to use it because I don't you think they dropped a ball too

Transcript:  Like it's interesting like slack  There were so many products that were close to slack  But slack really filled a niche in the market in a way that made people want to use it and they were like  Google had eight different versions of zoom and microsoft had skype and teen  Yeah, there was so many products on the market and zoom just ate their lunch. Yeah, I don't understand why now skype has just announced

Transcript:  They've gotten better. They fixed some of the things that uh, but they were famously  They were famous for saying that they're not going to encrypt and that's why they didn't get hpa clearance like facetime did for a while  Yeah, so you have to like it depends on what you care about and what you don't care about

Transcript:  So, uh, we are talking on mac break weekly about this strange  Uh thing that apple and amazon did together  Uh apple for some reason, you know, there's only three companies that get this privilege said, you know what amazon you sell stuff  Uh on uh your own app and we won't take a 30 cut  And the only two other two companies that get this privilege are altis one  And canal plue and those are both  streaming tv companies, right  Uh, so this is unheard of ben thompson had a great article in stritechery  Kind of debating all the different possibilities. We never really came up with why apple  Did this but ben's final conclusion I think is interesting. He says  One thing you should consider is the impact of  shelter in place  He says the coronavirus will not so much foment drastic changes as it will accelerate trends that were already happening  Changes that might have taken 10 to 15 years  May now happen in far less time and he says it seems possible cord cutting will be a leading  Example, I know I know our audience are big cord cutters as you might expect with a podcast for one thing that you know  Their audiences obviously are much more  Media literate, but I also think because our audience is geeks  They're able to search out the best ways to do this. Do you think when we come out of this?  Uh, it's it's over for movie theaters. It's over for cable companies. It's all about over-the-top  streaming video  Oh, and I don't think so.

You had to have an amc account  You'd have a sony music account youtube's big enough got to subscribe to that  It's a nightmare and video is still a nightmare because they want to they don't want to be like music  And they're fighting it and the theaters are fighting it  But this could be the extinction level event that we've talked about not in a bad way  But in terms of getting the dinosaurs out of the boardrooms and letting young smart, you know  People take over that can see a model where there's like a pool of revenue  If you go to the movie theater as part of the pool  If you go to if you rent you want to pay a hundred bucks because that's what tickets cost to get advanced access or in real  Time access  There'll be all of these options and I think that's sort of the evolution where this model has to be  That it can't they won't be able to extract single copy value from anything anymore the same way cds can't do that anymore  And they'll have and now streams are making more money again  And I think there's a model where video could make a lot more money if they just sort of  Lessen their grip a little bit

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's such a weird so I think ben is like a legit genius  but it's such a weird thing because amazon's service is not as good like  You're not going to compete with  It's such a weird service like the the apps are trash you you go to you press play and it says oh  You need a different subscription to play the thing  We're showing you that makes it look like you can play it  We have some originals but it's mixed together with we just jumble it together with a bunch of movies from the 70s  With no rhyme or reason like it's a bad service  And you think that their competitive strategy would be to make good service because they're the one of the richest companies on earth  And apple, you know, they're just starting off. They have zero catalog content  They're making some good shows some not so good shows  But that that doesn't seem like a very good competitive strategy to me if it is one  I feel like this is more about avoiding a regulation

Okay, you gotta you gotta kind of figure it out  The first couple everybody's coming up roses again  I just think that they should be doing more because they have the power to do more and they don't and it's just showing  what the  Moral compass of the company is I understand their company is the capitalism they have to do what they have to do  But I feel for the people that are working on the front lines the kids at the grocery store or adults at the grocery store  Um, oh they are they have shields and stuff up now and things like that  Yeah, and and they're on the lower end a lot of them don't have the best health insurance  So if they do happen to get sick, there's just so much to this that just is so sad and fresh
