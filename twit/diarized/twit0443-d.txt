Yet you'd be amazed at how many tech journalists are actually secret football fans.  I don't understand it. Here's a fellow who's got a clear allegiance to some team.  Bill Gates tweeted this a little while ago. Oh my. He's looking more and more like Woody Allen  as time goes by. That is a, he just, it doesn't, it does, Bill take off the tie. Maybe. Have you

Transcript:  when our team was in it and I, and actually I enjoy watching, but you gotta admit it's for the ads.  What are the, what a lot of it, I mean for a lot of people, even if they aren't into football,  this is where, this is the most expensive ad buy of the year and it is usually,  you know, you put your best foot forward during these ads. In fact, there's many companies  that don't advertise anytime. In fact, very famously about 30 years ago, a little company,  little fruit company named Apple had a Super Bowl ad announcing the Macintosh. That was a big deal.  1984, Leo. 1984. Why 1984 won't be like 1984. I remember the first time I saw a tech ad. It was  for a dot com, I think in the late nineties on the Super Bowl. And I was, oh yeah, remember that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  during 99 and 2000, all the tech companies that were, they were advertising the Super Bowl. There  were companies that they put their whole advertising budget into buying one, like into buying Super  Bowl ad. And I think some of them only, they were only had like one spot or maybe two spots.  And they, their whole budget for the year, they put into one Super Bowl ad. That sort of sums up  the dot com boom for you. Yeah. Most of them were out of business. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Here's,

Transcript:  Isn't it nice? Good for them. That's some of that venture capital money going in there.  I don't know how many other tech companies, probably IBM. There was some question whether  Apple might do a 30th anniversary ad, which would have been great. But these are millions of dollars,  these ads. So, you know, it's not something you do on a whim. They're doing 90 second  my verse commercials everywhere. Right. Right. What do you call it? Live verse?  Your verse. What is your verse? What is, what is, and Robin Williams in a, in a tub.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the big story of the week, we should probably get right into it because people are already  leaving, is, oh, did you, I'm sorry, the Super Bowl got in your way. I apologize. They just set  up a giant screen so that I wouldn't miss the game. And of course we've got people there.  So that was thoughtful. The big story probably, well, there's, there's quarterly results from  Facebook, from Apple, from Facebook and Apple and Microsoft. But I think the big story has to be  the shocker that happened on Wednesday. Google announced that they were selling Motorola. They  just bought it 19 months ago. Yeah. To Lenovo. Lenovo Rolla. Lenovo Rolla. Lenovo Rolla.  Now Lenovo bought in 2005, bought IBM's ThinkPad business and kept the name, kept the quality,  uh, didn't really innovate tremendously, but over time they've improved.  They're probably a good steward of Motorola. Yes. They wanted to buy Blackberry and the  Canadian government said no. Oh, yeah. Lenovo does make phones. They're very, they do make,  as you might expect, cause they're a Chinese company, they do make phones that sell well in  China. They don't have a presence as you probably know, if you live here in the U S or Europe.  Um, Motorola's Moto X is now sold in Western Europe in the U S in South America. So it'd get  them quickly into that market. Um, some people said that the, the problem was that Motorola  phones weren't selling well for Google. It was a big drain on Google. I kind of credit Larry Page  when he says he posted a blog post saying in order to succeed in the phone business,  I'm paraphrasing here, you, you gotta be all in. And we just didn't want to devote that much energy  to it. We're not getting out of hardware. Remember they bought Nest. We're not. And of course,  it's Google glass. It's not that we don't want to do hardware. Some people speculated that,  but we just don't think the phone business is a good business for now. I'm reading between the  lines, but this is what I think happened. Samsung bitched mightily, didn't like the idea that  Google was competing with them with handsets. Samsung is selling, I don't know, a hundred times  more handsets than Motorola did. They are important partner and they're starting to pull away.  They're doing Tizen. They're junking up their phones, making it less and less Android like.  And Google had, I think a little gut check and said to itself, you know, what is, what is our  business? Are we trying to make money on phones? No, we make money when people use Android. When  people use the apps on Android, that's when we make money. What is our interest here? Getting more  companies to use Android, not scaring them away, but getting more companies to use Android. This  to me makes perfect sense. You might wonder, well, why did they buy Motorola in the first place?

Start time: 595.52
End time: 601.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Patents. Like mailed into it over patent. Patents. Patent. And there was a great joy of tech comic

Start time: 603.34
End time: 641.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  in which, let me see if I can find it. Lenovo's shopping and they come to garage sale and there's  a big Android. It's a Google, Google yard sale. They say, what's the story with that blue one?  It was bought for me, but it really didn't fit says the Android. Oh, so it's like a regift.  I'll take it for a billion. Get serious. They paid 12 billion for it. What about two billion?  Eight billion and it's yours. What else are they selling by the way? The nest. 2.9 billion is my  final offer. Sold. Let me put it in a bag for you. Lenovo walks off, looks in the bag says, wait a  second, where are the patents? If you look at the timeline, they kind of clowned around with the

Start time: 643.48
End time: 673.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  entire Nortel patent suite and ended up losing out on that to Rockstar Billco. And then Motorola  was saying, you know, we're going to sue everyone else who makes Android devices. And then they  bought Motorola, kind of quieten them down. The litigation they were doing, sorry, the litigation  they were doing didn't really pay off because it was mostly standards essential patents and they  couldn't really win on those. And they were producing hardware, but they were not producing  money. And that's not a very attractive deal for Google. Nest seems to make much more sense.  Yeah, the, the, this deal is, is maybe not quite as good as the one that they were making.

Start time: 678.08
End time: 755.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, the, the, this deal is, is maybe not quite as bad as it looks for Google. I mean,  Google needed to get out of this. This thing was a massive drain on their bottom line.  They were all, they were not all in clearly on this. They tried to run Motorola separately. I  think they told them to go out and be innovative and do some interesting things. And they did,  they were starting to do some interesting things. So you could make the argument that  Motorola was really just getting started. I mean, the Moto X is a good product. They,  they, they were manufacturing it in the U S they were innovating a little bit on the way consumers  go and, and could customize it and that kind of thing. They maybe they started talking about  middle of last year about some of the cool things they wanted to innovate on, by the way,  a lot of that, that innovative group that was doing those cool things like pills that, you know,  or authenticate, you can authenticate, you know, wirelessly and stuff, just using your  electromagnetic forces in your body and crazy stuff like that. Or you remember that? Yeah.  They are reportedly the verge reported that they are actually keeping that unit. That that,

Start time: 755.86
End time: 766.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that's right. They're keeping Aura, which is the modular phone system that Motorola was developing  and all of the, all of the blue sky research, the R and D. Yeah. That R and D group that was

Start time: 766.26
End time: 777.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  run by, what's her name? The one Regina Dugan. She used to be with DARPA. Yes. Yeah. Regina  Dugan from DARPA. Really smart that they kept that, you know, they also had, had divested the

End time: 796.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  set top box. They did business. That was 2.4 billion. Yep. The patents were worth, some say  6 billion. This is not the money loser. It looks like, no, they probably broke even. It's not  profitable. Yeah. Right. It's not a money loser if you're losing money. No. And make, and clearly,

Start time: 797.64
End time: 814.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  you know, this was between Samsung and Google, there was some massive tension between those two.  That's what I think. It was going to end badly. That was not going to end well for either one of  them, honestly. And so this sort of clears the air on that. And, and it's no, it's no accident,

Start time: 814.86
End time: 829.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  is it that Samsung just before this announcement agreed, oh, we're going to A, put less cruft on  our phones, where they agreed with Google, we're going to junk up our phones less and we will give  users the right to uninstall the junk we put on there. And they'll also get rid of that magazine

Start time: 829.92
End time: 833.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  UI that they debuted on their brand. That is horrible. Very different than Android. I have

Start time: 833.68
End time: 842.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that on. Yeah. No three. It was really clear to me that Samsung was saying to Google, it was  saber rattling, maybe serious. Totally. We're moving away. We're going to do what Amazon did.

Start time: 843.38
End time: 845.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They had their own developer conference. They've been doing their own app store.

Start time: 846.76
End time: 856.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yep. So this was a rear guard. This was at Google saving its butt because  you can't have the company that's selling 80% of the smartphones out there, not selling an Android

Start time: 856.70
End time: 998.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  phone. Yeah. And this, I have no doubt this was in the works for a while. It's funny. I met with,  I talked a lot with Lenovo people at CES and, and they actually had now some phones there,  but they were, they kept clearly saying, and by the way, these are not going to,  we haven't announced that these are going to be released in the US. They were actually some  really nice phones as far as these sort of devices go. And they kept saying, we're not,  we're not saying that we're going to release these in the US. We don't have carrier relationships yet  and all of that kind of thing. And so I just had this feeling like something, they were sort of  dancing around something like something big was going on. And, you know, I mentioned a couple  people privately, like keep an eye on this. Something's, you know, happening with them  because they're, they're, they're really dodgy about this. And I've got a feeling they're either  about to announce something with a bunch of carriers or, or do a deal or something. And  clearly this was the deal. You know, it was to buy, to buy Motorola. And actually I think it's a,  there is another factor we wrote about this. Obviously we, we, our site, you know,  Tech Republic writes a lot of stuff aimed at people who use these devices to do work and get  work done and to pass them out in large companies. And this deal does have the potential to help  Android break through in the enterprise. Cause as you guys know, you know, in the enterprise and in  business, it's really, especially in the US, it's a, it's a big iPhone story, iOS. It's  somewhere in there, you know, 60 to 70% of the, the devices that are sort of sanctioned in the  enterprise, whether they're BYOD or, you know, things that you pass out are iOS devices.  Android's had a real problem breaking into the enterprise. This is a deal that could help  because both Lenovo and Motorola have great DNA in knowing how to work with the enterprise, both  from sort of BYOD standpoint and, you know, traditional enterprise machines. And so  this is the one thing we, we, we wrote a piece on Tech Republic this week that, you know,  this could be the move that helps kind of Android turn the corner in the enterprise.  Interesting. That's something to watch for. Interesting. I'm only sad because I,

Start time: 998.74

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just bought another Moto X. I got the wooden one and then, you know, I guess it's not a  coincidence. They had a deal on Monday. It was a hundred bucks off. So unlock 350 for 32 gigs,  250 for 16 years, or I guess 300 for 16 gigs. So it was a really good deal. I should have,  you know what? When you see a clearance deal, you should know, shouldn't you?  You'd think I've been buying this crap long enough to know. Well, they're still selling that device.

Start time: 1024.04
End time: 1027.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So they're not, they're not running away from that device. Well, and this is going to take a while,

Start time: 1027.72
End time: 1050.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  they've got to get China and the US government to approve it. This could take six to eight months,  could take a year. So I figure I got a little time left, but I think this Moto X was the best  Android phone ever. I would love to see better hardware, a bigger screen, but you know, I bought  the Note 3 and I love the hardware on the Note 3, better camera, but it's so crapped up. The ideas

Start time: 1051.10
End time: 1066.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  on this phone were better. They did, they, it took too long to get it out. So they have a lot of old,  like they have 720p display and older chipsets, but a newer version of this phone completely  spec'd out would be fantastic. And you have to think Lenovo at least short term is going to keep  that roadmap. So I think they're, and they're capable of doing it, aren't they? They will.

Start time: 1066.68
End time: 1079.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They can execute. Lenovo knows how to execute on hardware. I mean, they did it when they bought,  when they bought ThinkPad. I mean, they have executed their tails off with that. They did.  You know, year over year over year, they just keep putting out good devices. They keep improving it

Start time: 1079.74
End time: 1083.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  and they do good stuff. And I for one, can't wait for a Nest phone from Google.

Start time: 1084.03
End time: 1097.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google.  Just a big dial on the front. It knows when you're watching, knows who you want to call.  Running Linux with a click wheel.  But I'm not, am I wrong in thinking that really Google's, the value for Google is that more  people use Android. They don't care whose hardware they use it on.

Start time: 1097.70
End time: 1102.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They make more money off iOS still than Android, Leo. They really don't care what you're doing as  long as you have Google services on your device.

Start time: 1102.70
End time: 1124.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. That's, that seems right. And I also think that if you could put a better screen on the Moto  X, if you could put a better camera on the Moto X, if Lenovo could do that, this is,  the stuff that's in here, the awareness of what's going on.  Always listening to the processors, the active display.  It's brilliant. And I think that there's something here, but it didn't catch on.

Start time: 1124.88
End time: 1158.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It was the most innovative phone of 2013. If I gave, if I had a list of most innovative phones  of 2013, that would be number one on the list, right? They did things that nobody else was doing.  And they actually innovated and did some new stuff and provided new value in a year when there  wasn't a lot of new things going on. So I think it's a great device. It's a good start. It needs  to improve in some way, in a number of ways, but Lenovo just got a huge, huge leap forward in what  they were doing in phones. Yeah.

Start time: 1159.00
End time: 1162.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And they also had a bunch of Google people down there helping them. So we'll see what it's like

Start time: 1162.88
End time: 1168.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  when Lenovo gets their hands on it. Well, I think Google was at great  pains to keep a little bit of a fire, a Chinese wall, if you will, between Motorola and Google.

Start time: 1169.08
End time: 1184.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know. I mean, as far as I know, they had tons of Google people working closely with  Motorola. That's a Google phone. I mean, that runs Google's version of Android and that has a lot,  like the Google Now integration is better than the Nexus. I mean, they put a lot of effort  into making that the best Google phone this year. Yeah. Yeah. I agree.

Start time: 1189.72
End time: 1205.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think they will. I think they will. I think that's a selling point, don't you?  Yeah, it is. And they do a lot in America, right? I mean, I don't know. Remember, that's really a  U.S. market only phone too. I remember when it first came out, I knew a bunch of people in  Europe that were really interested in that device and they were bummed that they weren't.

Start time: 1205.84
End time: 1225.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They have added now. They've added Western Europe. They just started selling it in Western Europe,  South America too. So it gets them into markets that Lenovo is not in, but has already, they said  a year ago, Lenovo said, we want to be in the U.S. market. We're going to be in the U.S. market.  We're sniffing around for a long time to get in there.  Blackberry was, you know what, they probably knock it on wood. Oh, we didn't get Blackberry. Oh, wow.

All those people  that used to work for IBM down in RTP now work for Lenovo. They bought all of that ThinkPad division  originally and all that was being run down there, most of it, and they own that. Now they bought  that server division from IBM as well. So they've got all those people down there in RTP. So they've

We're talking about the Lenovo story,  first story. So that's not a, you didn't miss much. I'm about to wrap it up though.

Our show today brought to  you by Stamps.com. They didn't buy a Super Bowl ad, but they should have because Stamps.com,  if America only knew about Stamps.com, they'd go nuts. Stamps.com turns you and your little operation,  maybe it's a big operation, turns your desk into a professional fulfillment center. You print  postage from your computer, your printer. You put right on the envelope. If you're using envelopes,  on a label, you slap on the box. They've got a USB scale so you know always exactly what postage.  You know the rates went up this week. Stamps.com customers don't care. Automatic free upgrade so  they always have the right postage. A lot of people who have postage meters actually had to  make a trip to the post office and it cost them more money. This is such a good way to do mailing.  If you do mailing in your business, invoices, mailers, flyers, maybe you sell on Etsy or Amazon  or eBay or PayPal or something like that. You know what? Smart software is aware of those sites.  For instance, let's say you sell something on Etsy. You want to mail it out. It will automatically  print the mailer for you. Put the package on the scale. It'll print it, takes the address  of the buyer from the Etsy site. If it's an international purchase, it automatically fills  out the international forms. It just makes life easy if you're selling online.  All right, so here's the deal. I want you to try it. It's free for 30 days. Here's how you get our  special offer. If you go to the website, you'll see an $80 value but I think there's a better way to  go click that microphone. Use the offer code TWIT. That'll turn the $80 value into a $110 bonus offer.  You get $55 in free postage. You can use in the first few months of your account. You get that  scale. You just pay $5 shipping and handling on that. You get a $5 supply kit and free shipping.  Four weeks of stamps.com free. Stamps.com. Use our offer code TWIT. It is really awesome.  So this is a first. I think this is a first. The Super Bowl is being streamed this year free.  You can go to superbowl.foxsports.com. You three are on because you don't care. Actually,  Jason's on because he forgot it was Super Bowl Sunday. You guys are from Canada.  Yeah, our football's over three downs. We're done.  Yeah, you got the, what is it? The Grey Goose Cup and it's over.  The Grey Cup. Same as the Earl Grey tea. Yeah, there's no goose involved. But yeah,  I thought this was very interesting. They do have ads. They're not the same ads as on the TV.  There are fewer of them. But if you go to superbowl.foxsports.com, it starts streaming  right away. It does not, as others have done, say, who's your cable company? Who's your daddy?  They don't ask you who's your daddy. They just do it. And I think that's-  Is it US only, Leo? I don't know. Try it.  You want to try it? Go ahead. It's superbowl.foxsports.com. It must be. But how? I don't  know. Maybe not. Because I just want the ads, frankly.  Well, but this is the thing. These are not the ads that you'll see on the Super Bowl.  Only in the US. Matthew Ingram can't do it. You're in Toronto, right, Matthew?

Transcript:  You know what's hysterical? If you try to watch Super Bowl ads on YouTube,  they put an ad in front of the ad. An ad.  It's one of our sponsors. It's LegalZoom, so I'm not going to complain, but  that's a little weird. I have to watch a 30-second pre-roll ad so I can watch ads.  Only in America. Actually, it's international. It's all over the world now, baby.  That's right. Yeah. No, the ads are a big part of the Super Bowl. In fact, I was saying before we  began, the actual gameplay of any NFL football game is 11 minutes. So if you wanted to, you could  just edit out the ads, the huddles, the crap, and you'd have 11 minutes of action. It takes about  three hours. The Super Bowl sometimes takes even longer than three hours because they pause a lot  for the ads. If you go to an NFL game, a Monday night football game, or I was at a Monday night  football game about a month ago, and the game is stalled regularly. There's what they call an ad  timeout. The poor players just have to stand. It's just terrible. You're standing around.  Hey, it's money. It's lots of money. We play rugby, Leo.

But it's pretty interesting.  I think this one's just good storytelling.  That Microsoft ad is good storytelling.  Some of what people do in ads is that's more about brand than it is about product.  It's making you feel good about being associated with that brand.  And I think they did that pretty well.

By the way, at the same time as Google sold Motorola Mobility,  they bought an artificial intelligence company for half a billion dollars.  The idea being to use DeepMind's artificial intelligence to improve search,  the Knowledge Graph in specific.  Anybody have any insight on this idea?  Ray Kurzweil, remember the great artificial intelligence scientist,  joined Google's AI efforts about a year ago.  He's working on the Knowledge Graph,  building out something called, quite scarily, the Google brain.  Might as well just call it Skynet and get it over with.  The Star Trek computer.

Start time: 2192.86
End time: 2217.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It kind of makes sense because if you're Google, you look at other companies that have rested on their laurels.  Google could say, hey, we're totally dominant in search.  Look at Bing, look at Yahoo. Nobody's going to compete with us.  So we could just rest on our laurels.  Or if you're smart, as anybody who runs a company should be, you say, okay, what's going to disrupt this?  What's the next thing?  How do we get there now while we've got revenue from the old thing?

Start time: 2218.10
End time: 2240.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think Google, when you think about it, Google has really been doing that for quite some time.  They've been talking about what happens after search.  So how can we show you things or give you things or anticipate things?  I mean, that's what Google now is to give you things before you search, to make it so you don't have to search.  That's what's going to disrupt search.

Transcript:  Is it your opinion that Nest was more about the team than the hardware?  Definitely.

Start time: 2245.94
End time: 2283.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, for me, it's interesting hardware.  I'm less interested in the sort of smoke detectors.  To me, it's the design.  Those products are just a glimpse of what you could do if you rethought sort of home automation and the Internet of Things and so on.  And in order to make that stuff kind of approachable, like make it easy to use, make people want to have it,  you're going to have to design it the way the Nest was designed.  It's got to be appealing. It's got to be super easy to use and sexy.  And Google just isn't that good at that.

Start time: 2284.72
End time: 2343.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The best thing about Google and Apple to me and what makes them, it's very rare that a big company does not mistake their product for their business.  Too many companies think, oh, we've got a hit product.  We have to hold on to it. And then they drive it right into the ground.  But Google will kill anything that gets in their way.  And they never want it to be a search engine. They want to be the Star Trek computer.  They want to be an easily accessible repository for all the world's knowledge.  And Google search was an easy way to get there initially.  But in order to get bigger, that's why they started scanning books.  That's why they got into video.  They want to be able to give you everything at a moment's notice and, of course, harvest the data that goes along with that so they can afford to give you even more stuff.  And when you look at Nest, for example, Tony Fidel is not just making nice looking smoke detectors.  He's a guy who learned how to dent universes from Steve Jobs.  And there's very few product people like that left in technology.  And if you can get one of those on your payroll and make your the when the Internet of Things has to have an end point and those end points have to be as amazing as,  the central repository. And that's what Google gets out of all these recent deals.  I mean, Nest is beautifully executed, right?

Start time: 2344.64
End time: 2455.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And Nest really there is a bit of artificial intelligence in Nest, even a very small bit in this sort of Internet of Things.  But, you know, Nest follows your patterns, learns your patterns.  Also, they know when they understand sort of spikes and they automatically will do things for you that save you money.  You know, if there's no movement, it's got that that sensor in it that senses movement.  If there's no movement, you know, it drops the temperature.  It finds your patterns.  Honestly, when I got one, I was expecting it was like, OK, I'm going to have to sort of put some time into this thing and figure out and I can go into the software because you can set up the patterns yourself.  Say, OK, at nine o'clock, you know, move the temperature down or that kind of thing.  I never had to do it.  I never had to do it.  It figured it out within a week and I've never had to set anything with it.  Right. So I mean, that's like that's basically has a small amount of its own AI.  And it's just a beautifully executed product.  So kind of like Renee is saying, when you have the opportunity to work with or, you know, bring in a team that is doing these really smart things with this very next generation thing, which, you know, in the Internet of Things, then you do it.  I mean, the fact that that Google seemed to buy it when nobody else there didn't seem to be much of a bidding war for it is probably the biggest surprise.  Maybe Google just, you know, went to Defcon five and said, we're going to spend whatever we have to get it.  But I'm surprised others didn't try to get them, you know, not just Apple either.  GE, IBM, lots of other people, Cisco that are really interested in this kind of space.  The fact that Google got them is a little bit of a surprise to me.  And it's a it's a clearly a big win for Google to get those guys.

Transcript:  Now, here's an interesting story that's related.  In 1990, I'm sorry, in 2009, Carol Bartz, then CEO of Yahoo, said, we're not going to do search anymore.  We're going to do a deal with Microsoft, 10 year deal with Microsoft, the Yahoo and Microsoft Search Alliance and Bing will be Yahoo Search.  They got out of the search business.  But according to Kara Swisher writing and recode this week, there are two secret projects Marissa Meyer has started at Yahoo to bring back search.  One's called Fast Break and one's called Curveball.  They're committed to Microsoft to 2019.  But this is anybody know anything about what's going on behind closed doors at this sources?  According to Kara said, Myers put a priority priority on the projects, a three to four month time frame, which could eventually result in a full search engine, possibly more oriented to mobile than desktop.

Start time: 2523.17
End time: 2561.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And she would be shocked.  I'd be shocked if they do not make their own and long before 2019, if they do not break off from Bing and do their own thing in search.  I would be I would be shocked.  I think that they're destined.  Yahoo is destined to be Google's biggest competitor in search.  I think that's why they bought Marissa.  That's why they brought in Marissa Meyer.  I think that that's why you know, Mercer Ryre has been doing the aggressive thing she's been doing from product.  I mean, they are just trying to reinvent their product from the ground up and search has got to be at the center of it.  It's where so much of the big money is.  And she knows how to do it.

Start time: 2562.29
End time: 2590.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But, you know, I totally agree.  It's it's smart.  They they more or less have to do it.  Marissa has, you know, deep, obviously deep background in that.  But, you know, Yahoo has been such a train wreck for so many years.  Do they have anyone who's any good in search who stuck around or are they going to have to just go out and buy things and hire people?  Because they were nowhere.  They gave up.  I mean, if you were interested in search, you just quit and left.  Like, you can't just reinvent that stuff overnight.  No, I agree.

Transcript:  I mean, it's not going to happen overnight.  But I'm sure that that and then somebody sort of should go through the job listings and I'm sure probably, you know, Kara and others have.  But they are hiring people in search and get people, though.

Transcript:  I mean, I guess there are a lot of there are a lot of board engineers sitting around big companies like Google and Facebook who got hired because they wanted all the talent and have very little to do.  And these people don't like sitting around.  So if you can identify them and make them an offer that lets them think they'll be able to create a great new product, you probably have an in with them.

Transcript:  Well, there's I think there's a clue in here, too, because it says mobile.  And it's really clear that something that if you're going to succeed going forward, it's going to be on mobile.  People are just not using desktops.  The the future is in smartphones, is in tablets.  And it would be one way that perhaps you could scoop Google, although with Google now and the things Google's doing with Android, I don't know.  Intermediate search on mobile because mobile people go to on the desktop.

Transcript:  Those were the two I was thinking of just a minute ago when we were talking was, you know, those are the first two that came to my mind.  They do great stuff with that.  And you can it's almost like micro search.  It's kind of like the way social, you know, social was this big thing.  Like you go to Facebook and all your social stuff is there.  And now it's it's breaking out actually more.  So you do Instagram for photos.  You do, you know, different smaller apps in different ways.  It's not sort of the mammoth.  You know, search could very much go this way.  Right.  Is that, you know, you could break this into different pieces and you could be doing it in in smaller slices, you know, where it makes sense.  Things like searching for books, like searching for, you know, a service like you might do with Angie's List.  That's that's who you should buy next.  You know, things like that.

Transcript:  When you think about it, it's still a huge, huge I mean, even if if that is true, look at look at what Google has when it comes to Google.  Now, look at the massive amount of data and signals and information, you know, deep information that they have about me and my usage of the Web or my my interests or any of that stuff.  My email, all those things.  Who has nothing?  You know, they basically have zero.  Yeah, usually.

They don't have they don't have what Google has.  I mean, Google's clearly way ahead.  They don't have much on me either, honestly.  But but they do have lots of people who, you know, aren't techies that are, you know, into Yahoo or into, you know, pop culture, things like that.  I guess that's why people go to Yahoo.com.  It still is one of the it's you know, Yahoo has more traffic than Google if you count all their stuff together now.  I mean, they passed Google in 2013.  So they do have they do have people.  They do have data.  They don't have what Google has.  And certainly if they're going back into search, it's not going to be, I think, going head to head with where Google is strong.  Now it is going to be them figuring out what is next.  And probably it is more mobile.  It is more Internet of Things.  It is more targets.  Yeah, easy targets, wearables, maybe, you know, if they can power sort of search in that, whatever it is, they're going to they're going to go, I think, for what's next and not sort of where Google's strong today.  But that would be the obvious answer.

Transcript:  We're going to take a break when we come back.  Facebook's quarterly results bring it back to life.  I might have I might have been premature in declaring their death.  But first, a word from FreshBooks.  FreshBooks, are you still using Word or Excel to create your invoices?  Small businesses, freelancers.  It's tough.  I got to say I hated doing invoicing.  It was the worst part of my month.  In fact, many is the time I just forgot or just didn't get around to it.  And then I'd bill people six months later and then they'd be really mad at me.  And sometimes I wouldn't even get paid.  That's when Amber MacArthur told me about FreshBooks.  This was in 2004.  I've been using it ever since.  I don't need it anymore.  I have a department that does this.  But if you don't have a department that sends out the bills, if you're doing it in Word or Excel,  if you have a shoe box of receipts to keep track of your expenses, you got to get FreshBooks.  Get FreshBooks.com.  It's the simple cloud accounting solution that's helping thousands of new entrepreneurs  and small business owners just like you save time billing, get paid faster.  It's beautiful.  I love using it.  You can easily create invoices online, capture and track expenses on the go,  get real-time business reports with a few simple clicks.  You get paid faster.

Mention This Week in Tech.  And you could do it out of self-interest because they're giving a birthday cake every single day  to somebody who signs up for a new account and heard about it on this show.  You want a birthday cake?  Doesn't even have to be your birthday.  Every day could be your birthday.  Try it free for 30 days.  GetFreshBooks.com.  We love these guys.  I'm really glad to get them back on This Week in Tech.  GetFreshBooks.com.  Facebook record quarterly results.  Facebook turned 10 this week.  Mark Zuckerberg turned 30.  Revenue of $2.59 billion in the quarter, up 63%.  But most important in these numbers, mobile.  They turned it around.  And this was always to me the big question, Mark, about Facebook is can they make mobile pay?  Well, they have.  And it's pretty clear they're going great guns.  They just announced it's coming out tomorrow, paper for iOS, which they say is kind of a news app.  It's the next Facebook.  Don't you think?  I think Facebook has figured out mobile.  Now, paper does not have any ads.  Yeah.  Yet.  Have any of you?  It's interesting.  Go ahead.

Start time: 2993.94

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I looked at it because I wrote about it, but it's interesting that we were just talking about the sort of fragmentation that mobile can bring and how this is exactly what Mark Zuckerberg is talking about.  He talked about it on the earnings call.  And paper is a perfect example.  They're going to make a bunch of these bets where they take a specific type of activity or a use case and turn it into a separate app.  Instagram's a good example.  Messenger is to whether it's going to work.  I don't know, to be honest, whether there are going to be enough people who want to use paper.  I don't know.  But it's a smart strategy, I think, particularly for mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Isn't it amazing, Leo, that they're willing to let Mike Mattis and his team mess with their core experience?  I can't see Apple or even like the Google front page letting no matter how good the designer is just say you want to try something new.  You want chat heads.  Go ahead.  You want to make a flipbook interface for Facebook.  Go ahead.  We're willing to try that really well.

End time: 3080.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they do that really well.  And, you know, we make fun of them because poke flops or, you know, they try some new thing that's just terrible.  But they just keep trying and trying and trying.  You cannot stop them.  And some of that stuff works.

Start time: 3081.27
End time: 3095.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you've been playing with it, Matthew.  In your headline, you say Facebook heard you liked newspapers, so it decided to make a newspaper app out of your Facebook.  But it does strike me that if this succeeds, it is your is is this not going to be your Facebook feed plus?

Start time: 3095.68
End time: 3112.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I don't to be honest, I don't think that's what they're trying to do.  They're trying to put real news sources in with your feed.  They're trying to give you a sort of more curated version of your feed and other people's feed.  But they've been doing that all.  I mean, my news feed is completely curated at this point.

Start time: 3113.66

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 3115.02
End time: 3168.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And so this is a sort of extension of that diverted into a specific app.  And I think they're they're trying, you know, it's sort of a be testing right there.  They've got the existing seed and then they've got this thing.  And so they'll see, well, do people like that better?  Do they like this better? And what if and how does being on mobile change the way you interact with your feed?  I think the design of it is really interesting because it doesn't look like Facebook.  It's gorgeous.  There's none of the branding.  There's none of the sort of colors.  There's none of the look.  And so they're clearly trying to carve out a separate thing and but still use all the assets that they have within the Facebook feed.  And that's to me, that's smart.  They've probably seen they wouldn't admit this, but they've probably seen, you know, engagement decrease through the news feed.  And so they've got to figure out a way to fix that.

Start time: 3169.68

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And what Facebook has done in mobile over the past year is is what I kind of consider one of the best big company pivots that I've seen in the in sort of the digital age, since about 2005, 2006, when or maybe we call it like the social mobile kind of age.  It's tough. I mean, Facebook got really big, really fast.  And they actually were in some trouble as we we've all talked about over the past couple of years.  And they really did turn the corner last year and mobile is one of the you know, it's almost a mobile first Facebook thing now.  And and it's working.  I know people I have relatives that are on Facebook now and they use it solely on their phone.  They never use they never go to the site.  They only use it there.  They don't have all these other apps yet.  Those are the only apps that they use.  And you know, younger folks who are on their phones all the time anyway, that kind of thing.  But the fact that Facebook is serving both audiences and doing it pretty well and have pivoted is pretty big.  It is pretty amazing when you think about it.  They you know, not that long ago, their mobile revenues were zero.  You know, yeah, they were no literally.  Yeah, they saw that we're talking about over a billion.

Start time: 3238.64
End time: 3247.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

They created this thing called Creative Labs.  They isolated them, right?  And they said, you can do anything you want.  Do something completely different.  Although I suspect because Mark and Chris Cox have both said  they wanted to do a news focused thing.  They've been saying that for a little while.

Transcript:  Well, and this, of course, this is the problem with something like this.  And you go, boy, that's gorgeous.  And then you realize, oh, that's not my feed.  But that's kind of the point.  It could be one of the things they said.  And you mentioned this, Matthew, in your article that was a little shocking is  we can use any content we want.  We can use any status update, any Facebook feed we want.  It's all public.  Everything is now public.  The other thing that's built into this is that you can share from it.  And you're kind of I gathered I haven't used it, but you tell me, Matthew,  you're kind of encouraged to share images.  You're trying to you can do fonts and type it.  You're there trying to encourage you to make beautiful content.

Start time: 3360.42
End time: 3372.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Which is an interesting again, it's a little like what if Facebook didn't  exist already?  What would you do?  What would your app would look like?  How would it work?  It's funny because 10 years old, it looks very dated.

Start time: 3372.66

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Even make Flipboard or storehouse.  Well, even Flipboard now is responding, by the way, Flipboard is a little scared.  I think Mike McHugh said, oh, boy, and Flipboard's changing.  It's how it works a little bit.  Yeah, it's a fine balance.  People don't go to Facebook to read the Huffington Post, or do they?  No, no, no.  They want to see what their high school classmates are up to or their kids or  their grandkids.

Start time: 3395.83
End time: 3422.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think the risk, you know, for me, at least, is not just that  Flipboard already has, you know, 100 million users and it's it's a pretty  well designed app.  They've got a big kind of head start on the content reading recommendations  side.  For me, what has stopped me from using Facebook as much is that the newsfeed,  the utility of the newsfeed has gone down.  You know, it's it's still.  And so is this going to help with that?  I don't know.  The other direction.  Make it work.  Yeah.

Transcript:  Renee, you've talked a lot about the the the technology built into iOS seven  and the new A7 hardware, including this tilt capability, this parallax  capability, which you see on the desktop of iOS seven.  Facebook's using this tilt to explore vivid.  Let's see if I can refresh this page.  You can see it again.  Tilt to explore full screen vivid images.  And this is something that is iOS specific, I would guess.  They say they're going to do an Android version.  But, boy, I wonder if you can do this on Android.  I mean, it's interesting.

Start time: 3454.64
End time: 3495.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A lot of these people did come from Apple and a lot of them use iPhones as  their devices and they enjoy developing for the iPhone.  There was a story a while ago about them having be forced to use Android  devices when they were working on Facebook home and they did Android first.  Last time they're doing iPhone first this time.  So it's it's you know, it goes back and forth.  But that was the whole point of iOS seven was to make stuff come to life that  we'd had static screens and things that didn't really interact or respond with  the world around us.  And now when you start tying things into not necessarily M7, but the  accelerometers and gyroscopes and things like that, it just it makes it feel  like the phone is part of you.  It's not a book or something static that you're holding in your hand.  And it's very powerful as a interface mechanism.

I can't I actually I'm thinking I should get my iPhone out of the cabinet and  fire it up.  Yeah, do it.  Because I just this looks very I don't see it.  Android version coming too fast.  I mean, they have to pick what devices they target and what capabilities those

Who knew that their quarterly results would be so mobile forward?  Who knew that they had paper in there?  I mean, they surprised me.  And I'm very I'm actually surprised.

But but another part of me was thinking, you know, that's it's great that they're doing that.  It's great that they're they can devote the resources.  They can set up something like Facebook Labs.  There are not that many companies that can do that or are willing to do that.  Right.  They might start little kind of skunk works and to give people time to do something,  but they never take it seriously.  Facebook seems to be willing to be.  But they're not.  They're not.  They're not.  They're not willing to do anything, but they never take it seriously.  Facebook seems to be willing to bet, you know, large parts of the company on these new things.  And I find that refreshing.

Transcript:  Love that.  I think Facebook and Google actually are both really good at this.  They in there, they take R&D.  And they have any of those things out and let people try them.  And they let people they hold themselves up.  Let people get hold them up to ridicule, too.  Right.  And I think of Google Wave.  These things were ideas.  You think about what was that little round thing, the Google sphere, that they handed out a couple years ago?  The Q.  Yeah.  Like the really dumb stuff that they put out there.  But they're taking risks and they put their research projects out there and let the and then they let people here see them and poke holes in them.  And then they go out and do something different if it's not good and the market doesn't accept it.  Whereas if you look at the old way of doing research, you know, the way honestly, Microsoft and Apple more do it.  I mean, Apple does.  Apple's different because they take a completely different approach to it.  But even Microsoft spends a ton of research and most of it never comes to light.  Or maybe it might influence a product development cycle a little bit.  But they don't do the sort of crazy things where, you know, Apple or sorry, Facebook and Google.  I mean, these guys are still, you know, they're still throwing their throwing the ball deep to use a metaphor, a football metaphor for today.

Super Bowl U2 is giving away a song on iTunes called Invisible.  And for everybody who downloads Invisible, Bank of America will donate to product red a dollar up to a total of eight million dollars.  So that and that's a very interesting thing to do.  I'm not sure what it means for you to or Bank of America or Apple.  But in a way, that's an iTunes ad.  What are they?  Wow, I don't I don't know who benefits from this more.  Or if anybody benefits from it, really, the charity, the charity benefits, hopefully.  Yeah.  You to you to song invisible is free.  We will talk about Apple.  We'll also talk about Microsoft.  There's lots of news.  We've got a great panel to talk about it.  People who don't like football, apparently Jason Heiner, who's regretting his calendar error right now from CBS Interactive and the Tech Republic.  Always good to have you, Jason.  Renee Richie, a regular on Mac Break Weekly, doing double duty this week.  Thank you.  You can catch him at Imore.com.  We always love having you on, Renee.  And of course, we love Matthew Ingram, too, from Giga Ohm.  You've got three guys here where their fingers on the pulse of technology.  It's always nice to have some smart people on this show.  Our show today brought to you by LegalZoom, not a law firm, but LegalZoom helps you do the things you need to do to get your business started, to protect your family,  to protect your trademark.  When I first started Twitter, I'd never done a business before.  I asked my friend Kevin Rose, I said, Kevin, you've started a few companies.  What do you suggest?  Where do I start?  He said, oh, LLC, but don't get a lawyer.  Go to LegalZoom.  Do it yourself for $99 plus state filing fees.  It's easy.  It was so simple.  In fact, we're still using the operating agreement I generated back in 2005.  You can do a Chapter S or Chapter C corporation as well.  Over a million entrepreneurs have started their business at LegalZoom.com.  And you know what's great?  Over 90% of them would recommend LegalZoom to family and friends.  People love LegalZoom because, look, you've got to do the trademark registrations.  I registered Twit, the name, which didn't stop Twitter, but that's another story entirely.  Twit the name and Twit the logo, and that's $169.  That's a great deal.  You can do a will, $69, a living trust.  If you have a power of health attorney, if you don't have one, you really ought to make one right now.  It's under, yeah, right there.  Power of attorney for health.  There's the trust.  I'll tell you, LegalZoom is incredible.  Healthcare power of attorney.  One more down.  One more down, Chad.  There you go.  That is something everybody should have.  LegalZoom.com.  As a way of thanking you for watching Twit and for using LegalZoom, we're going to give you $10 off.  Just go to LegalZoom.com and use our discount code TWIT.  LegalZoom is not a law firm.  One of the things they do have, though, is they have attorneys.  They've pre-negotiated flat rate, very low fees with third-party attorneys in their LegalZoom legal plan system.  In almost every state, you can read the attorney's profile before you engage them.  You can also read unedited reviews so you know you're getting somebody who can help you.  They can answer questions.  It's very handy to have that.  And it's nothing.  It costs nothing.  Well, zero nothing, but it's very affordable.  LegalZoom.com.  Start your business right.  Protect your family.  Do all those things you've been putting off.  LegalZoom.com.  Use the offer code TWIT.  So Apple apparently met with the Food and Drug Administration.  This is something that's required.  If you're going to do an application that makes medical recommendations.  Nick Bilton and Brian X. Chen and the New York Times Bits blog caught this one.  It was on the public calendar from December 9th through 13th on the FDA.  Jeff Williams, Bud Tribble, Kathy Novelli, Michael O'Reilly, and Tim Powderly from Apple met with the FDA commissioner of food and drugs to discuss mobile medical applications.  This to me more than a lot of the rumor leaks gives me reason to believe they might be doing a watch, right, René?

Transcript:  They're all in on it.  So it's not just a watch.  They're all in on health.  And the problem with health is if you have, for example, a blood sugar sensor or a hydration sensor or a heart monitor, that in your phone has very limited utility.  But if you start to put sensors outside the phone, for example, on a wristband or a watch, then you can start taking that data, bringing it back to the phone.  And that makes the service, you know, and credit to Mark Gurman, because he had an amazing, amazingly good scoop on this, too.  That makes the service that they can provide so much better than just a phone technology.

This was discovered by an attorney, Mark McAndrew, with Taft, Setonis and Hollister.  He said in a phone interview with the Times, given the prominence of the people in the meeting from both the government and Apple's side, these were not run of the mill conversations.  He says they're either trying to get the lay of the land for regulatory pathways with medical devices and apps.  And this was an initial meeting or, and I believe the second, Apple's been trying to push something through the FDA for a while and they've had hang ups.

There's a few things that Apple as a company and the individuals in Apple care deeply, deeply about.  One of those is education. The other one is health.  Obviously, you know, textbooks much easier to get to the market.  Health has been a couple of years coming and, you know, this year looks like the year they go really big into offering health.  I don't know how, I mean, I don't know if people would be happier if an iPhone threw cheeseburgers at them or if they'll actually enjoy it.

I know Malik who started gig is diabetic, for example, has to take his blood sugar.  It's dozens of times a day.  So it's incredibly time consuming and painful.  Painful and irritating.  And if you could have a wristband or even a contact lens or something that would do that type of stuff automatically, it'd be a huge, huge time saver and sort of pain saver.

Transcript:  I mean, the thing I think would be really it's going to be really interesting here.  You know, Apple, that was my hope when the I watch thing started leaking out was that they were doing something like this, you know, with health.  Because if you think about the way that they created the iPod ecosystem and later iPhone, the iPod ecosystem eventually made it possible and paved the way for the iPhone in a lot of ways that are kind of forgotten now in terms of like docks and accessories and all of these things that all these third party  accessory makers that had, you know, plugged into the ecosystem because it had scale and because Apple had some of that product mojo behind it.  If you take that and you apply that to all of if they could do that same thing with health to where, you know, every time you go to the gym, your iPhone or by extension, if you have the I watch or whatever through Bluetooth or whatever the technology is, it makes it happen.  You know, you can you can scan that and you can it can pull in that information for whatever the machines you worked on.  You know, you keep same thing with, you know, all these health sensors, you know, that it can pull in that information and all of that ecosystem.  Obviously, Apple is is best positioned to to do that.  Microsoft and Google have tried this to a lesser extent.  They tried to do it more with software.  But if you can do that kind of thing and Apple has all of these devices, you know, these hundreds of million devices, hundreds of millions of devices already in circulation, it's going to be easier for somebody like Apple to do it.  And they have experience doing this kind of ecosystem play that all of a sudden it could become a really, really interesting thing to be able to, you know, use your Apple device.  I think it's I don't think it's going to be exclusive to the watch.  Honestly, I think the watch just might be a way that it could potentially make it easier without you having to pull your phone out of your pocket or make sure that it's connected.

Transcript:  If you look at how Apple does things, they have hero products, flagship products like the iPhone and the iPad.  And they also have things like the Apple TV, which are ecosystem enhancers.  You can plug your iPhone or iPad into a television and watch stuff.  But it's so much easier and it makes the product so much better if you get an Apple TV and the I watch is sound similar to that, where if you know you can get an iPhone, absolutely.  And do this kind of stuff.  But it'll be so much more convenient if you have that on your device on your wrist reporting directly.  And it always sounds like hyperbole when Tim Cook says we want to make great products that improve people's lives.  But when you break that down, it basically means Apple wants to make better products that make them more money and that enhance the value of their ecosystem.  And an I watch fixes fits all three of those criteria for their entire product line.

Transcript:  That, you know, that shortcut could help them.  I mean, there was, if you guys remember that phone, remember Ubuntu was going to do that phone?  Right.  Their big thing.  That was, they were going to use Sapphire Crystal for the whole face of the phone.  So it's not like it's out of bounds that you can't do it yet.  Or it's completely prohibitive.  But it is expensive.  But if these guys have made a breakthrough, then it's possible it could go on a phone.  I think it's probably more realistic that that's another year or so away.  But for a watch face where you don't have to use as much of this stuff, it makes sense.  I mean, I think Glass, we're going to look back in a few years.  I'm going to laugh at all these devices that used to have Glass and that we used to drop and break all the time.  You know, that's going to be a thing of the past, I think, within two to three, maybe three to five years at the most,  because there are a number of competitors that are going to go after this.  When I was in Israel last year looking at some technologies there, there was a professor and some students that had developed a polymer that is virtually indestructible.  They use it in Israel for windows that are missile proof.  If a missile hits that window, it does not break it.  And they're saying that they can take that and use that and they can potentially use it on smartphones, on touch screens.  They're trying to commercialize it.  So there's a number of ways that they're going after that.  And so I think it's only a matter of time before Gorilla Glass, the gig is up there.

Straight ahead, Macy's, fourth floor.  Get your tickets right here.  According to this article in New York Times, for now the alerts are mostly limited to practical news like the nearest entry gate or promoting in-store sales.  But already the technology has privacy advocates and legal experts brimming with concern.  When do they not brim with concern?  When they froth.  They're either frothing or brimming.  You never see a privacy advocate just sitting quietly on his hands.  So there are iBeacon's.

I just finished the Amazon book by Brad Stone, The Everything Store.  Leander Conney's new book about Johnny Ive is on Audible.com.  But what I like to do is do the nonfiction, fiction dance.  So one fiction, one nonfiction.  The new Carl Hiaasen is that I love Carl Hiaasen.  Dance of the Reptiles. I'm going to be listening to that, I'm sure.  Monuments menu, ready to go to the movie?

Now, according to the Times, the selection has not been completed,  but could be announced as early as next week.

Transcript:  The interesting thing for me though, Leo,  is that they said that Bill Gates might be stepping out of the way.  And one of the big problems that any would-be CEO would have  is the idea that was put forth that Bill Gates would be even more involved in Microsoft.  And that is not an attractive proposition for many would-be CEOs.

Start time: 5198.36

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's in fact what Businessweek and the Wall Street Journal have been saying all along,  is that what's holding this up is nobody wants to report to Bill Gates.  But the Bloomberg story said Gates might step down as chairman,  they put John Thompson, board member and head of the search committee,  in as chairman, but part of the reason Bill would step down,  and one of the things they're saying that Sacha Nadella wants,  is more Bill Gates involvement.  So what I'm reading this is, yeah, Bill won't be chairman of the board,  but he's going to be right there with Nadella.  Is that just PR fluff?  It could be.

Start time: 5235.03
End time: 5298.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It could be just kind of, you know, justifying power, right?  If Nadella is the guy and he's not well known outside of tech circles,  outside of tech insider circles, you know, Bill Gates could be useful,  those two sort of standing together announcing some things,  and as Nadella becomes more well known,  you know, Bill Gates has a lot of PR value to Microsoft still.  And even if Nadella's running the show, I could certainly see that.  I could certainly see that being the case where, you know,  Gates is stepping out even further of an involved role,  because it's tough to be chairman.  Chairman is still a very active role,  and Gates is obviously busy with other things,  but stepping back from an active role on the board,  but stepping into a little bit of a PR role to help Nadella, you know,  become more of a name, become well known, you know,  and be justified to have that kind of role.  It's a Bill Gates bump.
