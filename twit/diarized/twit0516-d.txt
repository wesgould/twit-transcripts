Transcript:  One of my favorite writers is Stephen Shanklin, and he's a CNET writer who's now in Paris and has such a different perspective on things.  So we are thrilled to have you, Jason.  And let's just jump into things.  It's a little bit of a recap because last week's big story was that Taylor Swift had written this letter to Apple saying she was not going to participate in their streaming service.  Because for the first three months, they were asking artists to they were telling artists that they weren't going to compensate them for any songs that were streamed during this trial period.  Well, since then, Apple has changed their mind.  That was the big news.  Taylor Swift has said yes, her 1989 album will be streamed.  And I would say, Jason, the question to you is, this has actually been a good thing for Apple because they have also locked a few years into the world.  They've locked a few indie labels.  They locked Beggars Group and Merlin.  We're talking about production labels that represent Adele, Radiohead.  Does Apple owe Taylor Swift a great big thank you?

Start time: 356.03
End time: 461.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, no doubt.  I mean, it's brought so much more attention to what Apple Music is doing than it would have otherwise.  And Taylor's Taylor Swift's letter to them, open letter, as it were, was very respectful and very well reasoned.  And she said, Look, I'm not doing this for me.  You know, I can pay my people just by, you know, doing gigs, doing live music, but that people who are doing their first record, doing their first album, putting their first song on there, you know, if they're going to lose out on all that money, you know, that could really, really hurt people.  And she basically was standing up for other people in the industry and Apple heard it loud and clear, changed their tune.  And it brought so much attention to what Apple was doing and what Apple is going to be releasing with Apple Music that, you know, and other artists, I think, like the fact that they were that they backed down and they changed their policy on it that, you know, they jumped on board.  And so I think for Apple, in one sense, you kind of can't buy publicity like that.  And it's also a good lesson, I think, in corporate in business and sort of corporate policies of, you know, you can you turn a negative into a positive, you know, sometimes you do dumb things and it's your reaction to it.  They can actually turn it around and show that, you know, you do listen or that you do have sort of the larger, you know, something larger in mind and aren't so set in your way.  So this turned into just a really interesting thing.  It also showed, as many people pointed out, the power that Taylor Swift has right now.

Start time: 462.08
End time: 502.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. And I think that's a really big question, because if Taylor Swift can jump in here and say, listen, the recording label sold us down the river by not negotiating on our behalf to get us those royalties and payments in the first three months, then she goes directly to Apple, circumvents the labels.  I think it begs the question, Georgia, do you think or Ian, do you think that this is us?  And this is why I think this is newsworthy, even though this is sort of last week, is that does this point to the question of what are the labels doing for the artists if they're not representing them with the streaming services in a way that really is to the artist's benefit?

Start time: 503.12
End time: 554.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that, I think that, you know, in time records are going to become more and more obsolete as they're again, now artists can reach directly to the people.  People can, you know, directly buy things from the artists.  They can speak to the artists, they can publicize themselves.  And I think that it showed a lot of power of what one artist, she's a huge artist in the field, but what one artist can do.  And my hats off to Apple for responding immediately, responding so quick.  They did it on Twitter, no less.  And it comes down to equity.  All of the indie labels that they got, like 20,000 because of this, they just wanted a small piece in return.  It's like 0.2 cents.  It's almost nothing, but it makes a difference.  It's just a little bit of equity for everyone and they just wanted it to be fair.  So I think it's wonderful.  But Becky, your point is great.  Yeah.  Do we really need the record labels and are they going to become obsolete sooner rather than later?

Start time: 554.92
End time: 590.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do think it does highlight a difference in the way that Apple deals with these things now.  If Steve Jobs has still been the head of the company, I suspect the reaction would not have been so quick nor so polite.  He would much prefer to go up against someone who was trying to challenge his power.  Apple did something very, very smart in backing down.  Basically, they turned what was a disastrous situation into a good one rather than turning it into a catastrophe.  Because when they announced they weren't going to pay for this music, everyone was just like,  You're the richest company in the world and you're not paying artists to promote your service.  It's insane.  It's 0.2 cents per stream.

Start time: 590.98
End time: 637.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So it's five.  Basically, five streams is a penny for the artist.  There's also a 0.047 for the record labels, actually.  Yeah, for the labels.  That's right.  Even less for the artist.  Right.  And there's 0.047 on top of that.  I read somewhere that's for the rights.  So we're talking about four streams is a penny.  I mean, it's ridiculous that they wouldn't pay.  And going back to the label question, I think it's just it's inexcusable that they didn't represent their artists.  And especially as the grounds are shifting, they should know by now.  You know, they've already been burned once by a disrupted industry.  Meanwhile, over at Tidal, Jay-Z's music streaming service, they booted their CEO.  They've got somewhere.  And a whole bunch of other stuff as well.

Start time: 638.16
End time: 638.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.

Start time: 639.38
End time: 669.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And they've only got about 800,000 subscribers.  Compare that to Spotify's 20 million.  They're trying to do the collective and the collective is the streaming company.  Meanwhile, Taylor Swift is basically advocating for artists directly, cutting the labels completely out.  Where do you think Apple will find in their streaming service?  Are they going to be able to work their way into this given how much of a shifting sands environment it is?

Start time: 669.48
End time: 716.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think if Apple is smart, they're going to go direct to the artists.  Labels are increasingly irrelevant these days.  I mean, it used to be that labels would find talent, bring it together, promote it, get it all out there.  Now artists can do that themselves.  So the labels have already seen the value of their back catalogs crash thanks to Napster and other things over the years.  And now artists, as you say, can appeal directly to their listeners.  It's coming to the point now where labels really have to do something to justify their position.  And as we saw with the Taylor Swift example and as we're seeing now with other examples, they're just not doing it.  So why do we need them?  I mean, at the moment, artists can reach their people directly and labels have a role to do if they're willing to do it.  But at the moment, they just seem to be luring themselves into contracts.

Start time: 716.80
End time: 822.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, as I understand it, the labels are the ones that cut that deal.  The labels are the ones that cut the deal that the artists were veiled against.  They're the ones who negotiated with Apple.  And so they were sort of party to this sort of bum deal that a lot of artists were going to get.  And so, yeah, I think they will be increasingly viewed.  They are increasingly viewed as an anachronism, something of a bygone era.  And also the costs of getting things to market are so much less than they used to be.  The skills to be able to market things yourself, to be able to reach audience are so much less than and the skills are so much more widespread.  So it's a different world.  And labels, I think large labels are certainly dinosaurs.  Smaller labels, I think, still have a shot for the artists that that do just want, you know, maybe to make music and need some help sort of doing it right and getting started.  You know, they certainly can benefit from some catalysts to kind of, you know, teach them some shortcuts and and get them to market and get them in the right places and book them to the right venues and that kind of thing.  But but big, big, you know, big labels certainly there, their days are numbered.  There's just no reason for them.  And in this case, they feel like they were sort of on the wrong side of the argument, not advocating on behalf of the artists that they should have been protecting.  They should not cut the deal that that did this and that, you know, artists had to step up and defend themselves.  They're cutting their own throats by not really putting the artists first.

Transcript:  And meanwhile, Google jumps into the fray.  And Ian, you wrote a great article.  I have to read this.  Google's new free music services.  Classic Google.  Take someone's idea and slap ads on it.  Yeah, well, I mean, it's it's the way Google operates.

Start time: 837.34
End time: 891.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the way a number of things operate.  And in a way, it's also the way Apple operates in that the people that actually create the music that people want to hear are getting done over badly by the whole system.  And Google is giving the stuff away.  And yes, they are paying their artists in the same way.  But the content creators that sell all this stuff are getting virtually nothing for it, whereas the people that provide the challenge to get it out there are trying to take all the money for it.  Now, Google's new streaming service, it's not bad.  You know, we look through it.  There's an awful lot of slightly tacky music for want of a want of a better phrase.  It's all organized into the radio system and they can sell some nice ads around it.  But at the end of the day, it's just another streaming service.  And we'll see what Google will what Google actually come up with and whether or not they can convert people into paying for it.  But I think it depends an awful lot on how they do it and whether the advertising is too intrusive or not intrusive enough.  Georgia, how do you get your music?

Start time: 892.40
End time: 941.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just use iTunes and listen to the radio.  I am so old school.  So, yeah, I get I want my own music.  I want to have the music that I want to listen to.  I want to listen to the problem with curated music is often it's a whole bunch of songs that I don't want.  And with Google's free service, you can only skip six songs per hour, which would probably be way underneath the amount of songs that I would need to skip.  So I will be listening when, you know, the Apple Music is launching.  I will take a peek at that and see.  But I'm not so sure I may just stick with iTunes and I just get my own songs.  I can play them as I want and I can make my own music list.  But I'm intrigued and having it be free.  And it's already set up on my phone.  I think that I'm going to take a listen and see if it's going to be different.  But ads I'm just done with and I need more skips than six.

Start time: 941.48
End time: 972.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I think for the average consumer, I always try and think of it that way as a consumer reporter.  And there's so many confusing aspects of all these new streaming services and the Wild West that is is is really streaming right now.  One of which is didn't Apple announced streaming a while ago?  Didn't Google announced streaming?  Why is this new as a consumer?  I'm just trying to sort of be like what?  Too much, too much change.  And they're all trying to differentiate themselves instead of just committing because they're trying to compete with Pandora and Spotify.  Right, Jason?

Start time: 973.54
End time: 1140.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, the devil's advocate position is that if Spotify and Pandora are easy to listen to, right?  I don't have to manage my library.  I can put in some songs that I like and I can kind of quickly get more stuff like what I like.  I can make a playlist out of on Spotify out of any music that I like pretty easily, pretty quickly and have 25, 50 songs and listen to that playlist a lot, which is kind of a behavior we know that people often do if they do like to manage their their music.  You know, same thing Pandora.  You can pick a few tracks you like or bands or albums and then just turn that into a station, which is essentially like a curiosity.  I'm not a very creative playlist, automated.  It's easy, right?  I don't have to manage a library.  I still do.  I'm sort of a tweener.  I kind of use all these things.  I try all of them.  I still have some music that I have on iTunes because, you know, there are CDs I ripped or things I bought on iTunes that were exclusive to iTunes or that kind of thing.  I'm also a subscriber to the premium version, the 999 version of Spotify, and I find myself increasingly listening to that because it's like something I can look up at a song that I hear and add it really quickly, you know, without having to decide, do I really want to buy that or not?  And so I do think that, you know, Apple made the right move in doing Apple music because I think increasingly people will, you know, the average consumer like you're talking about will find that it's it's much easier to do something like Spotify or Pandora and not have to manage a library.  One note about title, though.  I tried title for the 30 day sub and I actually really liked the quality.  It made me it made me remember what it was like to listen to CDs and I was like, wow, it really does sound good.  It makes me want to stop and not multitask like I usually do when I'm listening to music and just like listen, you know, the way you used to like sit and listen to music and because because I could hear so much of it, I could hear lyrics, you know, more fully.  I could pick up, you know, harmonies that I didn't really pick up and I was like, oh, yeah, you know, it really is good.  But what it made me do is actually, you know, maybe rip a few things I really like in like Apple lossless or actually turn up the quality in Spotify.  And then I let my month run out on on title, but it did make me more aware of the fact that, you know, good streaming music does really sound better.  And there is kind of a noticeable difference and it's worth sort of turning up the heat on on the quality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm going to have to give that a listen because I just it's hard to imagine once you you kind of go to a compressed format, you forget, you know, you just you forget.  And so, yeah, OK, put that on the to do list.  I think we've venerated Taylor Swift enough and and we've delved into the streaming wars to the end.  Google News this week, kind of interesting and unofficial feature of Gmail undo send is now official.  So, you know, God sent.  So the classic I don't know, what do you guys think is the worst send failure, like where you accidentally reply all the wrong person on the header?  So like you have five people named Joe and you send it to the wrong Joe.  But that moment when you realize you've hit send and somehow in that millisecond, you realize that's going to the wrong person, the wrong people, the wrong group.

Start time: 1200.09
End time: 1223.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sending it to the wrong person is a big is a big problem.  The the reason I enabled this absolutely immediately is because I was responding to a reader about six weeks ago and I apologize now in advance.  But he'd written a complaint.  I wrote a long answer back explaining why we did certain things.  And instead of putting regards at the bottom, I put retards and it's and it was just like, oh, no, no, no, no, no.

Start time: 1224.20
End time: 1238.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So to fully clarify in the sense of this Gmail feature, you would have up to 30 seconds.  I have it set for 30 seconds.  Yes, exactly.  So it's cashed, right?  That's what's going on.  Meaning that all that all of your communications are then on a 30 second minimum delay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I had to send another email saying I'm terribly, terribly sorry.  That was entirely misspell check completely.  And I got a rather rude response back, which I really can't go into on a live show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that this is one of those wonderful things.  I always talk to all of my clients and friends about how if you're ever feeling anxious or  upset, you should not write, text or call anyone.  But on the phone, things are ephemeral and they go away and no one has proof of what  you said or how angry or upset you might be.  But if you send an email when you're in the rash of the moment or if you send a rash email  about one person to the person you're talking about by mistake or add them in the reply  all, it's a really horrible thing.  So this is, I think, a lifesaver for everyone.  If you have not have not already said yes to this access it, put it on immediately  because we are just creatures of habit.  And so sometimes we're going to make these horrible mistakes and then you pay the  consequences for them.  So it's great.  I love this feature.

End time: 1363.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  One is turn your tech off.  It shouldn't beep buzz anything that you need it.  It should just send small notifications.  We are way too attached to our technology.  And I know this is a tech show, but we also need to have time to relax.  So I remember Rene Richie, who does Mac break and he has like every single he has like a  million computers and they'd all be being at the same time.  I'm like, I have to leave.  You have to turn these off because you're like a walking alarm clock every few seconds.  Minimize notifications.

Transcript:  Turn them off to don't use tech when you're really upset.  Don't send the email.  Don't send the technology.  Leave it.  And then the third one would be don't use tech before you go to sleep.  It is the wrong shade of light.  And so you're going to end up keeping yourself more awake and the rapid flashing of the screen  as well as that instant gratification of reading things that are really interesting are going  to keep you up for longer.  And I know I was going to be thinking she does this all the time.  Anyways, I break this rule.  But if I really need to sleep, I turn off my tech, do some relaxing breathing and then  let myself go to sleep.

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by Dropbox for Business.  We'll get right back to the panel in just a second.  But I wanted to tell you a little bit about Dropbox for Business, which we are now using  at Twit.  We've been using Dropbox literally since Twit began, I think.  I think Dropbox might be a little younger.  So literally since Dropbox began, I use Dropbox to share audio files, to share text files.  As I wander around the studio, I noticed everybody else is using it too, but they were all using  their personal account.  That's why we were really thrilled to find out about Dropbox for Business and very glad  to subscribe.  First of all, it's the right thing to do.  People are using their personal Dropbox for Business.  No, no, no.  They need to use the business account.  But it's also really important because it gives you control in ways that you really,  really want.  And the IT department will appreciate it.  And if you're the IT department at your business, as I was for many years, you will appreciate  it.  Dropbox for Business is already familiar to your employees.  It's exactly the same as they are already using, but it has some real advantages.  First of all, every user starts off with a terabyte and it's easy to expand.  That's awesome.  Your employees will love that.  Staff can collaborate with team members, securely invite and control access to outside partners  and clients and vendors.  That's great.  They only see what you share with them, nothing more.  And most importantly for your IT people, you get control.  Dropbox for Business has powerful admin controls.  Remote wipe.  Somebody leaves the company.  Don't worry.  You can wipe their account.  Intuitive sharing, permission controls, complete audit logs, and all of that.  You know who has access to data, when.  This way IT can make sure only the right people get access to that sensitive company data.  Dropbox for Business also integrates with third party security and administration solutions  like SIEM and DLP and eDiscovery.  That gives you even more control.  And of course, Dropbox for Business is secure.  It uses encryption for file data in transit and at rest.  Plus, and this is I think really great, the metadata also helps you to get access to data  and the metadata also contains information.  They use segmentation and hashing and that anonymizes files, makes it even more secure,  more private.  They also have additional security features like single sign on and two step verification.  Of course, I always turn that on immediately and recommend you do the same two step verification.  You're going to love it.

Transcript:  Yeah.  One story that really struck me this week.  Google is working on a health tracking wristband, but it's not what you think.  It's not a Fitbit.  It's not something that's going to track your steps.  It's a research tool that will aid those doing clinical trials to get rigorous data of your pulse,  your heart rhythm.  I don't really know the difference between those two things and skin temperature.  Also environmental information, light exposure, noise levels.  You know, in Google pushing the envelope, you're an Android guy.  Would you would you trust if they evolve this beyond clinical trials into something  that reported data back to your to your doctor about how you were taking your medication  or something in that in that vein?  Would you trust?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would trust Google up to a point.  I would say there would have to be some significant benefit to me in order to wear it.  I mean, Apple is doing this with its smartwatch.  They're making a big thing about the med kit that they've got on that.  Google are now getting in on the game.  If they're just looking to add this into, you know, my smartwatch or whatever else,  then no.  But if my doctor says put one of these on, we can monitor you 24 seven.  If you've got a serious condition, it may help improve your treatment.  Yeah, I'd be tempted to go along with that.  But at the same time, for general use, I can't see that this is something that anyone  wants to get involved with.  That said, it does.  These also things are prone to false positives.  I have a friend who has to wear one because he works in the oil industry and he has to go  through medical regular medical checks.  And so they put all this equipment on you and you forget that it's on there.  And then they got an alert because they were all watching a rather good film and  everyone's heart rates went up and they were just like, OK, we need to find out  what's going on on that front.  So, yes, it's an interesting prospect.  Would you wear one?

Transcript:  I think, you know, we've seen so many tests.  I've done some lots of people have done them where the deviation is anywhere from  10 to 25 percent in terms of accuracy around steps taken, miles, miles run or  walked.  So, you know, as with all this type of technology, I think if you started by  taking it with a grain of salt and then no pun intended, maybe it's tracking your  blood pressure.  But, you know, then it goes up in terms of your as its efficacy improves, then  trust improves and it's sort of hand in glove around that.  Similarly, from Google this week, they are testing new self-driving cars.  They've obviously been doing this for a long time.  These are really weird looking subsets of the Lexus cars they've been using.  They don't need steering wheels.

Transcript:  And while that was supposed to be the big news in self-driving cars this week,  there's been a bit of a fracas about whether or not two self-driving cars had  a close call.  So, a Delphi executive was in one of their self-driving vehicles and he said  that last week on San Antonio Road in Palo Alto that he was the car was  preparing to change lanes.  And then he said they were cut off by a Google self-driving car.  So, this sounded like, you know, self-driving car wars.  But then a few days later, Delphi was forced to rescind the comment and said  they were near each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we got pummeled by emails about this because we've been covering the  self-driving car thing a lot.  And it went from, you know, oh, nearly a road, a Mad Max style mashup on the  road to actually they were a lane away and one just approached one slightly  and that was it.  I don't know whether this is Delphi trying to get the edge on Google and  self-driving cars or whether it was just it's just a great story that two  self-driving cars crash into each other.  Who knows?  But yeah, I mean, like bumper cars without all the fun.

Transcript:  I was in Google is so crazy.  They're just like their core business.  Their core business throws off so much cash.  The you know, their core advertising business that they they're like the  world's first public facing research company.  They have all these things that they're doing and that's not news.  But it's still it's still it still amazes me every time that all of the  diverse things that they are doing and all the things that they're trying.  And, you know, kudos to them for the things that they're doing.  There are challenges to a lot of these things.  I mean, a lot of the self-driving car division at Google, I mean, they  basically gobbled up all of the world's best researchers on this topic.  Who you know, this used to be a lot more collaborative when it was back.  DARPA was running this and that kind of thing.  We've done some coverage on this.  Lindsay Gilpin, a tech Republic did a lot of coverage on the DARPA  robotics thing.  But one of the interesting insights was that, you know, Google Google  bought up a lot of the talent for that and it really kind of dried up  the research part of it because now, you know, it's all inside the inside  a private company.  So it's not public research with a lot of researchers sharing their  their knowledge and trying to help each other.  But isn't that a benefit?

Transcript:  I mean, at CES this year, it felt like it was the all autonomous car  show with BMW debuting stuff, Mercedes jumping into the fray.  I was in the back of the BMW car and it was so what really struck me  about it is it was actually really not very disturbing.  There was no driver in the front.  Granted, we were in this instance going really, you know, no more  than 10 miles an hour.  But it's amazing how fast you you really adjust to that.  But the point was, is that you have all these engineers from all these  other companies who are now taking this on.  And I think that's a benefit to the industry because you get original  thinking around it from companies that are being forced to apply those same  research techniques, maybe not in the same or at least research dollars,  maybe not in the same volume, but at least they're all going at it now.  I think that's it.

Transcript:  Innovate.  I mean, sorry, sorry.  Yeah, it's just I would say it's a trade off, right?  Like because competition is spurs on innovation and all the companies are  doing it and a lot of companies are trying to catch up with Google who, you  know, has a bit of a lead here.  But at the same time, there are, you know, so it works both.  It cuts both ways.  Like there are things that they will duplicate and problems that they will,  you know, have to recreate the wheel on their own, each in their own silos  as they are competing with each other.  So, you know, it's one of these things that, yeah, it just cuts both ways.  It's a natural trade off.  There's a couple of things that Google really haven't thought out about

Start time: 2085.10
End time: 2135.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  this, firstly, from a legal standpoint.  It's pretty clear that later in the year, the company will be able to  It's pretty clear that legislatures aren't going to allow people to just  basically dial in their destination, go and sit in the back seat and have a  pint while they're being driven to driven to and from work.  So, I mean, if you've got to be sitting there ready to put your hands on the  wheel and take control, there's no real point to an autonomous car because  you can't be doing other things.  And the second point on which nobody at Google has yet been able to answer  is supposing this works, supposing the laws do get passed to allow this to  work, you've got a large section of private industry that's going to be  a large section of private industry who now have no job.  There's no bus drivers, no lorry drivers, no taxi drivers.  What happens to those people?  I mean, they're not all going to be able to retrain to be software  engineers.  So there needs to be some thinking about how we introduce this in such a  way that doesn't cause mass disruption to the industry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's what really struck me about CES was that I noticed that the car  companies had such a different approach and their main goal was to  expose people to the idea of it in very small,  manageable situations.  You know, it's like in this environment you might do this.  And that's kind of what my takeaway was is that from being in the Google  car and realizing, oh my gosh, I could look down at my phone for 10  seconds to figure out whether I'm taking a left or right and feel  confident that I've got it on some sort of auto sensing.  You know, I don't know, do you guys have the auto sensing of a car  stopped in front of you?  I have that in my new minivan where if there's something in front of  you that's slowed dramatically, it'll start beeping at me.  Within the first hour of driving the thing, it snapped my head up while  I was looking for directions.  And I was so relieved and it was an amazing feature that I never even  knew I needed or would be comfortable with.  I'm not saying I rely on it, but just those incremental things like  lane assist and self park.  I never used the self park thing.  That just didn't seem like it.  I could actually do with that because my parallel parking is awful.  You're used to doing it on the other side of the road, that's why.  Well, this is true.  But when I came home from CES, I really had this feeling like I was  disappointed that I wasn't coming home to a car that was going to drive  me home because I'd been riding around a little bit enough to have had  that experience.  And it was amazing how quickly it was like, you know, when you got a  TiVo for the first time and then you had to go watch TV on where you  didn't have a TiVo, it was just sort of like, what?  This is crap.  You know, I felt that way coming home from CES.  I had to drive myself home.  This is ridiculous.  Now, I think that this is wonderful.

Transcript:  I think that for people that have accessibility issues, people that are  dealing with various physical disabilities, people that might be  blind, people that are the elderly, you know, this is going to be a  complete game changer.  And I think that, yes, it's going to change the complete infrastructure,  but it's going to do it at a very slow pace for people that trust it.  I think that for a lot of people, and I think Google might have to  change their idea of not having a brake and not having a steering wheel,  for those type A personalities that like to have control, they may  wish, if they want to, to be able to very quickly change the direction  of where they're going in a heartbeat.  But I think that this is just a wonderful thing to be able to have  for people that lose access to being able to drive and then they no  longer have their freedom of where they want to go and being able to  go visit people that they want and their friends and socialize.  So I'm really excited.  I'm waiting for my, I'll take a flying car, so I'm really waiting for  my self-driving car.  Oh, you are on it.

Transcript:  Following up on a story that's been kind of breaking over time.  So Dick Costolo out as CEO of Twitter.  Twitter announces this week that they've hired search firm Spencer Stewart  to help find the next CEO.  And they've said it will be a CEO who can devote his or her full time to Twitter.  Obviously ruling out Jack Dorsey, interim CEO, who's also CEO at Square.  And I mean, I think what's what what why I think this is interesting is what  makes a company what makes a CEO only able to focus on one thing.  I mean, you were just talking about Elon Musk, obviously SpaceX, Hyperloop,  Tesla, SolarCity.  I mean, I mean, there are there are precedents.  Steve Jobs at Pixar.  And I can't remember what his overlap was at Apple, but there was, you know,  there was interest certainly and and and fingers in the pies.  He was mostly at Apple.

Transcript:  Pixar was Pixar was run by, you know, Pixar had really good leaders, you know,  running it.  You know, his job at Pixar was was pretty much to negotiate with the studios  and and to, you know, say big, say big things at meetings.  So, you know, when Steve came to Apple, he was all Apple.  Elon Musk is like an alien.  I don't think that guy is unbelievable.  But he's not the only example.

Transcript:  Carlos Ghosn is at Nissan and Renault, and he's co-CEO of two Fortune 500  companies.  So, I mean, it's but you just made a really good point, Jason, which is his job  was to say really big things at meetings and who's going to have a bigger stick  to swing than Jack Dorsey when it comes to Twitter?  Maybe that's the wrong analogy.  Well, I think I think what Wall Street really wants from a Twitter CEO is

Start time: 2577.75
End time: 2628.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  someone who can make it profitable because at the moment it's still burning  money left, right and center.  And they can't seem to get over that.  And I think the old guard who would have been represented by Dorsey and the  others, I don't think are in the mind space to actually get that right.  What they're looking is someone with a single minded focus to actually turn  this company around and make what is a very influential, very important  company, something that shareholders can make money from.  And until that happens, I don't see how it's going to work.  I mean, yes, there are CEOs who can juggle both.  And with the Steve Jobs and Pixar thing, Jobs is, as you say, was to negotiate  with the studio and shout at the staff saying, make it better.  But I don't know.  Twitter is it's a very strange company.  I mean, you've had dealings with them as well.  They still seem locked into the startup mindset where it's all about getting  in more buyers and not about making a profit.

Start time: 2633.90
End time: 2737.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was going to say it needs somebody's full attention.  I think that's what they're saying.  And I think they're exactly right.  Twitter has some big issues to deal with.  I still think and I sort of treated this out last week of like, I still think of  Twitter is more of a platform than a product.  And ultimately, that's kind of its biggest challenge.  It's never really become a product, but it has so much.  It's raised so much money and it is a public company now.  And so it has to show massive growth and it has to show revenue and it has to  become a big business.  And I think it still feels more like a platform than a product.  It's more like a platform to me than a money machine sort of advertising  product, which is what they like it to be.  That's not to say that it can't be that, but I think they need a different kind  of leader to create that if that's what they want to become than what they've  had in the past.  And that's not a knock against Jack or Ev or Dick Costolo, who's done some  really good work.  I think may turn it into more of a grown up company.  But it needs something.  It needs to do something different if that's what it's going to be.  And if it's going to be something different, if it's going to be more of a  platform, then it needs somebody to sort of have the courage to take it in that  direction and to sort of take a risk in that way and see if it can do something  different and powerful there.  But I don't see it as a job that anybody could do part time because it has such  fundamental things to figure out about who it is and what it wants to be and  what its business model is.  Because those things are still, those are just all on the table right now, I  think.  One of the things that...

Transcript:  I think that Twitter gave that as the reason that they're going to be looking  for a new CEO.  But in the end, as long as someone makes Twitter profitable, they would be happy  with it.  Whether they be part time or not, they need someone that's going to be able to  really take a look into the inner workings of how Twitter goes through and how  they can make a profit from that.  And if it would be someone that would be part time and if they were already  starting to make money, I'm sure that he would still be the CEO and they would be  keeping him.  So I think that that was the reason they thought, you know what, maybe they're  not spending enough time thinking about Twitter because they have other  interesting ventures on their plate.  So let's try to find someone that can spend all their time trying to make sure  that Twitter will be profitable coming forward.

Transcript:  One of the stories that grabbed my attention this weekend was Amazon  filtering out bogus reviews.  And I wanted to ask you guys, what are your key indicators?  Well, first of all, the story is that Amazon's AI lab is going to bring in  algorithmic software that's basically combing through the reviews trying to  figure out which ones are BS.  The estimates are somewhere between 10 and 20 percent of all reviews online  are made up or written by someone who is not editorially...  As an interest in.  At least the ones they can detect.

Start time: 2828.93
End time: 2851.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You basically got to look at who's doing the reviewing and what reviews they've  done in the past.  That's a very good...  I mean, with stuff like Yelp, for example, you can easily see if someone's  got one review and one friend, you instantly discount that review.  I think Amazon's got the kind of compute energy to do this, but they're also  missing out on a rich vein of humor.  Since the Mad Max film came out.  I'm with you, Ian.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, remember the Mad Max film that just started where they spray, the  Warboys spray their face with silver spray paint?  You can now buy on Amazon sort of cake silver spray paint.  And the top review there is, what a spray, what a lovely spray.  And you read that, you can't help laughing.  It makes the review so much better.  I mean, yes, obviously they want to take out the financially tainted reviews  and people that are just there to screw over the particular company involved.  But it all depends on how it's done.  And based on AI systems so far, I think they could lose more than they  gain on this one.

Start time: 2891.64
End time: 2929.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I think what they said is it's going to be if it's verified.  So if they know that you bought the product from Amazon, which is kind of  something that you would think they would be doing already.  They have this red line, which I never noticed before covering the story  this week that says verified purchase.  Never noticed that ever in all the reviews I've read.  So just push.  But that will be a part of the ranking.  Then they're going to be allow other readers to thumbs up or thumbs down  the reviews.  That'll be part of it.  And then I'm just wondering if they're looking for keywords or if it's just  going to be something that's, you know, if it's totally over the top and  effusive, then maybe it's a giveaway.

Transcript:  Yeah, I always wonder the opposite, too.  I wonder how many companies are going in there to their competitors and  trying to spike their product by by doing negative reviews.  Because I see I see plenty of that where like a product will have it'll  have glowing reviews like seven, eight, nine glowing reviews and one sort of  really sort of nondescript negative review.  It's just like I'm never buying this product again.  It didn't do what it promised.  And, you know, worst thing I ever bought.  And I'm just kind of like, hmm, that sort of doesn't sound like this

Transcript:  explicitly say we will hire a whole bunch of people probably in the Far  East or India who will write good or bad reviews depending on what you  offer.  And this kind of fake astroturfing of review sites is a serious problem.  If Amazon can get the AI right, this could be a really big help.  But, you know, to where is human to really screw things up, you need  computers.  And also humans are still smarter than AI at this point.

I mean, humans are smart enough to get around it if they want.  And the Amazon system, I think, shows that is the Amazon reviews just so  much of it looks like fluff and doesn't look very real anymore.  I think 10 to 20 percent is being very generous.  That's 10 to 20 percent that they can maybe get around it.  That's 10 to 20 percent that they can maybe of what they've detected.  I think it's a lot higher than that.

And it's all going to be controlled by speech and this strangely produced  commercial, which is like attempting to be an episode of Modern Family and  creep me out.  I mean, it's a great idea in a way, but it's going to be always on listening.  It's got Siri like functionality where you can ask it questions.  It can turn the lights on, turn the heat up.

Transcript:  These people in this commercial are all writing fake reviews for the  things they practice and that's the biggest thing that it does when you  make a failure, mentor on a call.  Yeah.  Well, I cut that out the super-flualı bet eh Danny del Toro.  Look at him, look at him.  So the thing about the echo, though, is that is that the there's some  people who've written really great reviews about this people that I trust  that I think James gave it like an A plus.  I think Stacey said, like, if you're in the Amazon ecosystem, like, it's kind  of a must have really kind of surprising, interesting stuff.  And some of the things that they said worked really well.  I think Stacey talked about the fact that, you know, she it is connected to  like her Phillips Hue, you know, light.  So she says, you know, she's going upstairs.  She's like, you know, turn off the living room lights, turn off the kitchen  and then, you know, goes upstairs.  She she's got all of her playlists and stuff on there.  So so from her music uploaded to Amazon, so she, you know, it can play  playlists, it can play albums, you know, really easily.  And both of them have said and others have said, too, that the with the seven  microphone thing, the voice recognition is really good.  It it's very accurate.  Some of the most accurate that we've that we've seen so far.  And, you know, we've seen we've all had, I think, an experienced, interesting  anomalies of that and disappointments over the past couple of years from  Siri to Google Now and some of the things that those can and can't do.  So I'm interested in it from that perspective.  But remember, it is so there is a security kind of implication and, you  know, surveillance.  We had this long form piece on Tech Republic cover story last week.  On sort of the state of the state of security and privacy and encryption  and basically how to avoid a surveillance state.  And one of the things is just that there's this always on access that  governments and even private institutions have almost everything that we do.  And with the Internet of Things, we're giving them more and more.  Right.  And so this is another case.  This thing is like your Android phone or many of the Android phones is always  on.  It's always listening.  And it doesn't actually it's not actually sending stuff to the cloud, it says  until that light goes on.  So you say, hey, Alexa or whatever, that's what this thing is called.  And then it's listening and then it's sort of interacting with the cloud.  But I don't know.  It's still one of those things that, you know, you need to be careful of.  You need to think about the implications of it before you sort of jump in to a  product like this.  But there are people that are really have had good experiences with it.

Transcript:  I think we've just come up with a conspiracy.  A couple of years, I think it was 2014 CNET, one of CNET's best of show  products was the Revolve, which was supposed to be this hub for all your  Internet of Things devices in your home.  And I have to say this is a problem that needs a solution.  Sort of like the Harmony remote has solved the five remote issue in our  house.  I'm the only person who can figure out how to turn on the Sonos, how to dim the  lights, because we have the Hue lights and they don't work off the dimmer on  the on the wall anymore.  Any of the Wemo switches that have timers and, you know, it's it's God forbid  that anybody's cold because the nest goes on and off.  And it's who's overriding it with what phone?  And so I see that this is a problem that is in search of a solution, not the  opposite, which is so true of so many products these days.

I haven't actually tried the product myself.  But when looking through the tech specs and what it can do and what it can't  just for goodness sake, turn the bloody lights off yourself.  It's not that hard.  You know, we've been doing it for the last couple of hundred years.  I don't know.

Those Audible apps are great.  I put it on both my Android and my iOS phone because I have a 12 hour plane  trip to and from, and I've got a lot of time watching the scenery float by on  the boat.  And I want to have my audio books.  So I have about a dozen.  I know that's overkill, but I, you know, I love Audible books that are ready to  go.

Transcript:  Well, I think that the wonderful thing is that it actually tracks for you when you're travelling,  when you're doing something and then you get to see it.  Plus, I love the fact that it gamifies being able to work out.  So now it's not that you're walking and you get nothing for it,  though you're actually getting your health for it.  But most people just feel like if I jog, you know, three minutes one way,  I just have to jog back.  It just seems like a cost instead of a gain.  And I think that that's one of the wonderful things is that you can check your heart rate.  It makes it a little bit more fun.  You can change your music tracks to as you're going.  And so I love the fact that it can remind you to take your medication.  It can tell you what your heart rate is when you're going.  And you get to see your distance that you've covered, how much you're able to run further.  And we're not great with journaling things or writing down, which is good.  So this quantifies it for us.  And you can see fabulous graphs of, look, I've actually gotten better at this.

The type of cheese that you're eating in foods.  It can't deal as far with quantifying the amount to equal calories right now.  But it was pretty close to it and relatively accurate.

Transcript:  I remember because I was trying to figure out how to say the word.  God forbid I ever had to say it on TV.  A photo spectrometer.  And it was a handheld one.  And it was really interesting because they could they combined it with a scale.  And so by doing weight and then an analysis of the content of whatever it was, it could tell if it was a lipid or if it was a flower.  And it was all based on amazing science.  I think there have been a couple of companies I've seen that have tried to say, oh, yeah, we've got this.  Let's do a Kickstarter.  Hello, vaporware never happened.  But that's that's we're on the same page, Georgia.  We want that.  We want that to be happening.  Jason, what was that for me, though?  Jason, what was on your to do list this week?

Transcript:  Right. Plug it in. Plug it in.  Yes.  So that does bring you to an article that I wrote, an article in video I did this week that I published this past week on the only two reasons to buy an Apple watch for now.  And one of them was better activity and health tracking.  And the other was notifications.  Those are the only two things it does like really well and better than most of the things that are that are out there that is competing with.  Although I do like the notifications, the notifications for Google services, especially on Android, where I think are better if you're in the Google ecosystem.  Not surprisingly, but I think just the way that it handles notifications, but for everything else in the eye and iOS, because it has more apps plugging into the ecosystem, it has a lot more different types of notifications.  But the number one thing really is the better activity and health tracking.  So I talked about the fact that the glanceable notification of your sort of health status, the three the three metrics that Apple uses and the graphical display of that is really useful.  And actually, one of the things that I talked about was you can use an app that the power of this is actually some of the work that Apple's done in the background with with health kit and the health app, which is the way most people know it.  On their phone and because you can it serves as sort of the hub of all that activity.  And one of the things that I mentioned in my story was the app lose it, which has this great database of food.  If you're tracking your nutrition, tracking your intake, if that you can pull in stuff from other like Wi Fi scales and your workout data and your activity data from your iPhone.  And then it pulls it in.  So it tells you you've had this many calories today.  Here's how much you've done.  So either you can have that donut or you can't.  And that's pretty, pretty useful.  And it has a little iPhone app or Apple Watch app, I should say, that connects to the Apple Watch and sort of tells you what your sort of how many calories you have left for the day.  That's an element of the watch.  I always have the donut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, it's interesting point about notifications and about comparing it to other fitness devices, because I've always said that the limitation, obviously, of the Apple Watch is I.  Oh, you know, how are you going to input any of your data and what's the output in terms of the display?  But what is what is that small postage stamp beat in terms of screen size and input output mechanism?  Your Fitbit, which sucks.  You know, you got like three little things that are doing some cryptic buzzing and, you know, like a sequence of S.O.S. messages.  And I'm trying to figure out, does that mean that I did my ten thousand steps or that I'm woefully behind?  So in terms of I.O., I hadn't thought about it that it's definitely going to beat those devices.

Transcript:  Right.  I think that one of the I think one of the best things with the Apple Watch is just the change in social interactions.  So I'm sure that everyone on the panel has been to a tech conference and everyone's on their phone,  whether they're eating, whether they're sitting next to you.  I don't be on dates like that.  Oh, that's so bad.  Don't do that.  Put away the tech if you're on a date.  That's the wonderful thing is that you can just, you know, know if it's something that's important or not.  And you don't have to be glued constantly to your phone.  There's actually someone next to you.  Look at them and converse.  That's what you're supposed to be doing.  That's my favorite thing.

Transcript:  But as someone who's concentrating so much, who's such a specialist in terms of how this is handled socially,  there seems to be a fundamental problem with smartwatches that people can't get around.  You get a notification, your watch buzzes, and your first indication is to look at it.  It's just an instinctive reaction.  And if you're in a conversation with somebody and you're looking at your watch, it's incredibly rude.  So, I mean, how do you actually get around that?

Start time: 4177.88
End time: 4194.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Actually, that's even a worse social prompt, which says,  it's not, oh, I just got a notification my babysitter might be calling to say the house is on fire.  It's more like, oh, God, I've got to get out of here.  This is just going on and on and on.  That's the social cue you're sending.  Yeah, the social cue is you're boring me, right?

Start time: 4199.14
End time: 4270.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that, well, the other article was on like the problems with Google Glass in comparison to the  moving tech from the face and on to the rest, which, you know, there was just a whole bunch of issues with Google Glass.  Some funny, some not so funny, but you were always, if anyone even looked,  so when you really think about something that's either in the past or thinking of something that you want to say in the future,  you often look up into the side.  And whenever that would happen, when I was talking to someone that was wearing Google Glass,  I'd be like, are they like surfing the web or checking me out?  Like, what are they, are they doing something else than being in the conversation?  And so I think that it's better being on your wrist because it's outside of the social scape of where we actually have neurons  that fire just for faces.  That's how important facial interaction is for us.  And so that's why I think that it's better to have it on your wrist.  But no, don't look. Just wait.  Nothing is so important than waits.  And if you can't wait, turn off the fact that it, you know, taps you.  Just turn that off.  And then when you're ready, you're not supposed to be a slave to your tech.  Your tech is supposed to be there to make your life better.  So if it's an emergency, they'll call.  If it's not an emergency, then you can wait to be able to interact with it after.

Transcript:  Basically, a bunch of computer, a bunch of researchers found that Windows Update,  which automatically updates your PC with security and driver information,  was getting knocked off with Apple systems.  It was being automatically shut down.  And they found that Samsung's firmware had introduced an executable file called Disabled Windows Update.  They actually named it Disabled Windows Update.  Not at all.  Yeah, which would basically cut off Windows Update so that Samsung had control of the drivers in its own device,  but also disable all the security patching that went on as well.  And it's not only that an engineer did this,  but his manager looked at that and thought,  hmm, that's a really good idea.  This guy should be strung up by his goolies.  I mean, it just boggles the mind that somebody could be that dumb.  And they've now retracted and they've said,  will they show a software patch to make this right?  But who thought of this and why?

Transcript:  Well, I mean, it was something that we got a statement from Samsung saying,  we're going to fix it.  We asked Microsoft for a statement and they're usually very good at getting back to us  and we didn't get a thing,  which means I think lawyers have been arm twisting with Samsung quite considerably  saying, if you want to carry our software in the future,  you might want to fix this now.  But, you know, I mean, Microsoft is not going to accept this  because Windows 10 is coming down the line in July  and Windows 10 relies on automatic updates for consumers.  At least you don't get a choice.  They are automatically pushed down to you when they're ready.  If you're a business customer, you can choose when you get it.  So fixing something like this is absolutely key to Microsoft going forward.

Transcript:  My this week in my week was going to Facebook.  Went down to their new building down in Palo Alto and really interesting.  They have 10,000 employees at Facebook and they have a campus that's right at the end  of the Dunbarton Bridge on the Silicon Valley side or the peninsula side of the San Francisco  Bay.  And they've now built their 20th building across the street.  And it was designed by Frank Gehry, who designed the EMP Paul Allen Music Experience  up in Seattle.  That weird wavy looking thing, you know, with all the rock museum inside right at the base  of the of what's where I used to work.  What's the whole thing in Seattle?  The sky needle?  Yeah, the space needle.  That's it.  Brain fart.  So but so he designed this building and really interesting because the dictate from Facebook  and Mark Zuckerberg was that they wanted it to look unfinished inside.  So it's this long building.  It's a quarter of a mile from end to end.  Inside has the trademark weird graffiti art.  And there's not a single office in the entire building.  There are conference rooms and some people might HR department might reserve an entire  conference room for all the hiring and firing and whatever.  But even Cheryl and Mark sit in an open desk plan in the building.  The weird thing to me and they they won't let you photograph inside the workspace.  They do all the exterior areas right there is the the rooftop garden.  I think that's the roof.  So if you walk the path on the rooftop garden, it's a half mile loop just walking on the roof.  And the sort of the walking meeting thing that was really big.  Steve Jobs does it.  Did it.  Mark Zuckerberg does it.  That's really popular there.  Got to keep our Fitbits and our Apple Watches logging our steps.  But inside, this is the part that I don't quite get.  So there are these tubes hanging down.  The ceilings are, I don't know, 40 feet high in the building.  It looks completely unfinished.  Open beam.  All the heating and ventilation ducts are exposed.  And then hanging down every cluster of tables is this like big bulky thing of cat five cable and must be also power.  And I can't figure out why they didn't put it in the floor of the building.  So as you're looking at this amazing open space, it's just littered with what looks almost like, I don't know, IVs for the people on their computers.  But it's such a weird take on the modern office space.

Transcript:  Maybe they're trying to get back to that feel of being a startup and having literally having sort of cat five cable running from the ceiling because they had nowhere else to put it and get back to that raw feeling that, you know, this isn't a very expensive building that we had designed for us.  But yes, it's back to the good old days when we were making our way and getting everyone fired up that way.  But I do like the idea of a walking garden on top.  That could be rather nice.  That sounds awesome.

Transcript:  That it's open for everyone.  So that makes it accessible to everyone.  If you have a question, you don't have to worry about interrupting someone inside of their office.  You're always open to that.  Not great for your stress levels as well, though, because you can never have any privacy if you need a moment.  Someone's always watching you, which so there is a little bit of a detraction and having an open concept for your office building.  But no, I'm with you, Becky.  I'm like, it's I don't know, those good old days weren't that good old days.  You want to have the wires on the floor, really, like you can afford it now.  Have them popping up under the floor and then become seamless when you don't need them.  So you can put them away.  They could have shelled out for a little bit.  I think it does also seem a little bit like that vestige of all the graffiti art inside of it.

Transcript:  I remember the first time I went to their new headquarters when they moved off University Avenue and they went to this building,  buildings one through 19 on the other side of the street from this new one.  And there were these weird graffiti art elements on the wall.  And it was mostly otherwise a pretty standard office park type building.  And when I saw that episode of Silicon Valley where Ehrlich hired the guy to make the graffiti logo and it went horribly wrong,  it totally reminded me of Facebook.  Like, oh, we have similar.

Transcript:  It does remind me there.  Some of these are really common trends with, I think, architects in the Bay Area,  because we have something very similar with the cables in the CBSI, formerly CNET headquarters on Second Street in San Francisco.  And we also have the graffiti, too, except ours is chalk.  It's these giant chalkboards and there's graffiti with a lot of the different logos and brands sort of do their own, have done their own thing.  Or I think maybe even chalk artists did some of it.  But the weird thing is that cable thing is we're trying to get rid of it now because it just sort of gets annoying and looks unfinished.  And you're like, people come in and they're like, why are the cables, you know, open like that?  That seems so odd.  Dude, we were trying to make a statement.  We're young, we're hip, we're happening.

Transcript:  Hey, before you wrap the show up, can I get one more word in edgewise for our great sponsors?  They make Twit possible.  We're very grateful to them.  And one of our newest sponsors, not only on Twit, but on the whole network is Credit Karma.  Man, I love Credit Karma.  I actually found out about it a long time ago because I heard two of our employees talking about it and one of them told the other one, you got to try this.  And I, of course, listening in, I said, oh, I went off and tried it and I love it.  It's free.  You can't beat that.  Credit Karma dot com.  When you go there, you're going to learn about the most important number in your life.  Not your age, not your weight, not your IQ.  Those are important.  This is more important.  This is more important.  This is everything to do with your financial future.  It's your credit score.  That's going to impact what you pay when you get a loan, whether you can get a credit card, whether you can buy a house.  You need to manage that number.  You need to keep an eye on it.  It's good when it goes up, bad when it goes down, and you want to be notified when it goes down.  Figure out why Credit Karma will help you with that and fix it.  People often get stuck paying for this information, but never with Credit Karma.  Free credit scores, reports, monitoring, handy financial tools to help you make sense of your credit, to understand why your score is the way it is.  It was a boon for me.  It really helped me when I was buying a house to know and frankly, I had a problem.  My score was lower than it ought to be.  And thanks to the information I got from Credit Karma, I was able to call the credit card company and say, hey, let me pay that off and get rid of it.  And that made a big difference.  So get the Credit Karma app by going to your phone now and texting.  You can do it right now while I'm talking.  I won't mind.  Tweet to 89800.  Tweet.  They'll send you a link back with the app for your phone, the right one.  You'll also get suggestions to help you manage and monitor your credit.  You'll be alerted when your credit score changes and you do not have to give them a credit card.  It's free.  Credit Karma dot com.  Manage and monitor your credit for free with no credit card required.  Do get the app.  It's good because then you get the notification if your score changes.  You could celebrate when it goes up.  Credit Karma dot com.  Make sure you text TWIT to 89800.  That way you can monitor your credit on the go.  Speaking of going, let's get back to the panel on This Week in Tech.  Thanks, guys.

Also, Apple's Beats 1 worldwide radio station will also launch Tuesday at 9 a.m. Pacific.  Two major Chinese flagship smartphones launch Tuesday.  Meizu's MX5 and the Huawei Honor 7 will both be released that day.  Tuesday also gets an extra second.  A leap second will be added to the network time protocol to keep time synchronized with  the slowly lengthening solar day.  Some organizations will add an extra second at the end of the day, but Google uses  something called the Google Smear, which adds pieces of that extra second throughout the  day.  Needless to say, the Internet's clocks will not be synchronized on Tuesday.  And Microsoft's giant tablet for conference rooms called the Surface Hub becomes available  for preorder on Wednesday, July 1st.  Back to you, Becky.

Transcript:  Everything you ever wanted to know about the Twitter network, I'm Becky Worley, filling  in for Leo Laporte and joined by amazing guests in studio and in Skype.  And we now move on to my pet subject of the week.  An article that really grabbed my attention because I'm fascinated by batteries.  This was from Quartz.  It was a really interesting article about this guy, Yet-Ming Chang, a Taiwanese guy who  went to MIT and he's done a bunch of battery startups, new technology, trying to really  innovate the process of what the recipe is that goes into the battery slurry, if you  will.  And he's now started a new company and he's changed his approach completely saying, you  know, we're not going to move the battery process forward in the lab.  We're going to move it forward on the assembly line and in the factories as we make batteries.  Ian, you're skeptical about this just because we've seen so many battery stories about the  next innovation, the thing that's going to take lithium ion forward.  We're going to get to the moon.  We're going to replace fossil fuels.  It's all batteries.

Start time: 5098.98
End time: 5144.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I mean, I am a little bit skeptical simply because I've been burnt so many times over  the last 10 years.  But what interested me about this was there's a historical analogy to this, which works  quite well.  When mankind moved from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age, it was a very slow process because  iron doesn't offer that many advantages over bronze.  But if you chuck carbon into the mixture in the manufacturing process, you get steel,  which instantly does brass and bronze in pretty much every other way.  So taking it from the manufacturing standpoint, I think, is quite handy.  It all depends on rollout because I say I've written so many stories about this is going  to be the next big thing.  Lithium ion, lithium polymer, whatever.  I hope, I really hope because we need battery technology like nothing else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So if you can encapsulate, I mean, just to sort of put this in perspective, you know,  batteries are basically equivalent to gasoline.  It's a storage mechanism for energy.  And why in your I think we've all heard the smoothing out the grid argument and that we  need to be able to do this at sort of industrial scale.  Then we've got the Tesla battery for the home, batteries for cars, batteries for space exploration.  What is it that makes batteries the catalyst for moving us into the next age?  Or is that an overstatement?

Start time: 5180.62
End time: 5239.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, I don't think it is.  It's technology like this, which is going to get us to Mars and beyond.  It's the ability to store large amounts of power for long periods of time in a format  which people can use relatively easily.  We've lived in the electricity age for over 100 years now, and we still haven't cracked this one.  It's basically taking all the wonderful devices that we can build and being able to power them  from a simple, easy to use, cheap and powerful unit.  And if you can get that cracked, then an awful lot of technologies will just explode.  I mean, we've been willing to accept with smartphones that we only get a day long battery life out of them.  Whereas my old Nokia used to do a week.  You know, taking that forward, there's so many technologies that could be developed if you got a large reliable power supply.  And it's very exciting.  I would like to see something in the way of a finished product before I go total fanboy on it.  But it does look rather good.

Start time: 5239.98
End time: 5280.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So the idea here is that this is sort of innovation on the factory floor,  sort of the Kaizen model that Toyota did when they just said one thing better every day.  Let's get the manufacturing process.  That's the place that this is asserting we can make the biggest impact.  And I mean, some make the argument with batteries.  OK, let's say Moore's law, doubling your processing power every 18 months.  With batteries, we're looking at a 6% increase on capacity over a year.  That's what it's been historically in recent history with lithium ion.  And that's just not that impressive, some would say.  What's it going to take?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was just going to say, I think that I'm skeptical as well from the same point as Ian is that I've covered a lot of this.  And there have been so many promises about what it can do and will do.  And so I think that we do run up against the limits of physics and chemistry and ultimately science.  And so possibly the more promising direction is the fast charging.  So that is something that has made huge leaps forward and continues to,  to where you can get almost a full battery charged in now less than an hour.  Same thing with cars.  You can get Tesla's, the newest Tesla's, charged much, much faster.  In 20 minutes, I think you can get a lot more mileage from one of their charging stations.  It's the same process.  And then the other thing is also from a design standpoint,  the designers in the technology space understanding the limits of battery are now being a lot more disciplined  and a lot more focused in the way they design their products so that they don't use as much power.  So they aren't sloppy in the ways that they are just sucking as much power as they possibly can.  And that goes a long way.  And that has sort of made big leaps forward in recent years.  And I think there's still a headroom for that to get better and stronger.  And as we, you know, as these devices use less power by being more efficient and then the,  you know, fast charging enables them and wireless charging enables you just set it on your desk,  you know, set it down.  It's almost like it's charging without you even thinking about it in the moments when you aren't using it and don't need it.  It can, it can be, you know, a little bit more efficient.  It can be, you know, recharging itself.  I think those are some of the more promising and more likely things to give us to give us some benefits  and some leaps forward in this area, you know.

Transcript:  Korn Cobb in the chat room was asking how hydrogen is going to play in.  And it made me think, you know, you're talking about all the companies that have been hyped and then disappeared.  And it made me think of Bloom Energy, which was had this huge 60 minutes of, you know, expose.  We covered it on Good Morning America.  It was a hydrogen based energy solution that Google and eBay were putting in place and promised.  But everyone's so hyped up about it.  And the question that I think I have going back is, you know, what is going to be the game changer here?  I mean, I think Elon Musk getting involved is huge.  I'm waiting for the energy, the electricity companies to get involved.  I mean, they have, they're in, you know, everyone's talked about the renewable death spiral that they're in.  And only batteries are going to solve that.  But they're not innovating or banding together or creating financial models whereby they might be able to smooth out their grid.  I mean, I'd like to see an environment where they are subsidizing something like the power wall so that people are they control the algorithm  and they can then pull from those power walls when they're seeing dips of clouds or the wind going down.  But they're not they're just letting the industry take over and not playing a part.

Start time: 5481.80
End time: 5537.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think there there there is some movement on that front.  The power companies traditionally have been very anti all this stuff because it disrupts what has been an established business model for,  for, I'd say for 100 years.  But it's not going to work anymore.  I mean, you've seen in I think it's Arizona.  They got a legislation passed where solar powered owners had to pay a premium to the electricity company for generating their own power.  Not going to play that kind of short term thing.  Never going to work.  I think some power companies are starting to embrace and particularly with the Tesla battery,  you're seeing power companies getting on board with that.  Some people are starting to learn, but it comes back to what we were talking about at the start of the show.  The record labels fought against online music for so long and it nearly destroyed them.  The electricity companies will do the same, but hopefully humanity might have smartened up a bit and seen that, you know,  if a strong wind is coming, you build windmills, not windbreaks.  We'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, it hasn't been terribly inspirational, but once the death spiral starts for real and there's a tipping point in terms of the number of people  that are going with solar, certainly out here in the West where adoption rates are so high,  you'd think that they would smell the death knell of their own industry and get involved.

Start time: 5556.30
End time: 5586.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They are worried in the traditionally with the power generation industry.  As society has developed, there's been a steady increase in power use.  And now that's started to dip because people are using less power, but also generating their own power.  And that's, I think, set off a lot of warning signals in some areas of management of some electricity companies.  But there is enormous momentum of conservatism and conservative thought going on in there that says just stick with what we know.  It's what we know.  You know, it makes no sense.  You can't stand against technology like that.

Start time: 5587.16

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But what happens is that when a company starts seeing the end to their company and the way that they do business,  part of our brain that deals with protection, the limbic system goes into override and we become highly protectionistic.  And we end up going to old ways, old habits, which you can even see if I used to have a test, I would bite my nails.  It was just an old habit.  And so when you see the end of your company and you have to jump onto a new ship, change is really scary for people.  There's a lot more risk and change than doing things the old way.  And it's the same reason why people keep on doing things that don't work for them and they just continue with the same patterns or just pattern oriented naturally.  And so that's the same thing that happens with large companies.  They want to stick with the ways that work, tried and true.  And unfortunately, often when times get worse, they become more protectionistic, not more modern.  And so you end up seeing the same thing with like cable companies and other things.  They're holding on to old traditional values that no longer work because adaption is just such a scary thing.
