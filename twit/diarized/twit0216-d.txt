Transcript:  This is Tweet This Week in Tech.  I am Molly Wood filling in for Leo Laporte, who is in Dubai at the TEDx conference.  And I was just saying that as much as I am thrilled and honored to be hosting Tweet this  week, I frankly would kind of rather be in Dubai looking at the fabulous buildings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Except there's a problem with you being in Dubai.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There is.  Yeah.  They don't want me there.  Anyway, I'm very excited about today.  I'm here in the Tweet Cottage.  I'm joined by Brian Brushwood, the host of Scam School.  How are you, Captain Kirk?  Right here in the, yeah, I'm wearing Captain Kirk orange today.  Because you're the leader.  You're in charge.  You're running the show.  It was an accident, but I feel good about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm wearing a red shirt, which all of a sudden I regret it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Dude, take the red shirt off quickly.  I wasn't going to mention it, but yep, he's going down.  Also joining us on Skype, Gina Trapani, host, co-host of This Week in Google.  So you already know her, Tweet fans.  And everyone is so excited.  Hi, Gina.  Say hi.  Greetings, humans.  Hello.  This is what happened when we all heard that Gina was going to be on the show.  Patrick Norton, Colleen, who's totally in charge of the board and the switching and  everything today.  And everybody else was basically like, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's rock star time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  So no pressure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No pressure.  And you even have the Madonna microphone going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do.  I do.  I got the little Invisi mic thanks to Colleen.  I'm feeling very chic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Very fabulous.  And Tweet regular, because we need somebody to keep us in line around here.  Patrick Norton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think I'll be able to succeed keeping this crew in line.  I'm just trying to keep from getting run over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not remotely.  Like if he was here in studio, he'd have power, but he's too far away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's true.  He is far away.  He can't do anything.  And also we could probably ask Colleen to turn him off.  We'll see how that goes over.  Look out.  All right.  Well, then let's get this train rolling.  So it seems that the big story of the week and the weekend that just keeps getting hotter  and hotter is that evidently T-Mobile has lost all of the data of its sidekick users.  Or as Engadget puts it, one of the biggest disasters in the history of cloud computing  and certainly the largest blow to danger and the sidekick platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it looking like it's confirmed?  Like it's definitely gone?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  The last, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll say the last email I saw was apparently they were doing a SAN upgrade, a fairly standard  SAN upgrade that they didn't do a backup before the SAN upgrade and things went really,  really sideways.  And that they think they've pretty much lost everything that you didn't have backed up  locally, which on your phone.  So it's still on your phone.  You can probably put it back up on their servers again, assuming you haven't pitched your phone  at the wall and disgust and completely...  They're encouraging people to like not reboot their phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't turn your phone off.  See if you can make something happen.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is so ridiculous.  So you just have to plug in your phone and hope that things are going to come back or  that you can back up your phone to your computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Basically.  And that is essentially what they said to people.  Like we're really sorry, but your data has quote, almost certainly been lost.  Wow.  Can you imagine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can you imagine being the guy who has to write that email?  Like how do you sit down and start typing that one out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel bad for that guy, but not nearly as bad as I feel for everybody in level one tech  support who's dealing with people going berserk on the phone right now because the pictures  of their grandkids are gone.  Like the guy who screwed up the backups probably getting fired or beaten with a stick or whatever  they do to people who have an oopsie of that magnitude.  But I really feel bad for everybody that's basically, you know, hello, this is T-Nobel.  My name is, you know, Noanda, can I help you?  And then going through that whole process of we lost your stuff.  I'm really, really sorry.  And then getting screamed at and then having to do whatever comes next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can you imagine when is the last time that you've ever called tech support?  I mean, at least they usually pretend that they can give you an answer, even though they  almost certainly can't.  Like to call tech support and to basically, you know, and you know, every call is like  and then have them go, yeah, you're out of luck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We got a coupon for you.  We're really sorry about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're super sorry.  Make sure you don't power down kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now I tell you, I've never been happier to have an iPhone than right now because before  the iPhone, I never would have backed up the contacts and stuff on my phone number because  it's such a hassle.  It's such a huge pain in the butt.  But because it's integral to getting your updates on podcasts and all this and your  calendar and your other synchronization.  Finally, I have a backup for all my numbers.  I would have been one of those people screwed if I had a sidekick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a really good point.  I actually think that most smartphone owners who are not, like you said, iPhone owners  who are connecting to iTunes all the time for various reasons, usually 80 meg upgrades,  is that I don't think smartphone users do back up their data.  I know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They do if they've had a phone stolen.  They do if they've had a phone stolen.  Well, good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They should if they've had anything else stolen and they're still not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the tough thing.  It's easy to say, oh, you should, you should, you should.  But I'm saying realistically, never, never would have plugged it in, never would have  backed it up.  Would have been one of those people saying golly gee darn.  Right.  Only I don't think I would have used those words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The chat room is pointing out, by the way, if you have a sidekick, that the reason they  don't want you to power it off is that like a palm, the data is stored in RAM.  So that if it is powered off or if the battery runs out, then all that data is gone as if  it's not gone already.  That is definitely though, that is a huge cloud problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now how many people like to obviously none of us I'm saying obviously, but does anyone  here have a sidekick?  That seems like kind of a non techie kind of guy phone to have.  Like you don't have a sidekick, do you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no.  It's a second class smartphone or something.  Well, that's the other thing.  It is kind of right.  It's not an actual smartphone as the as the weird definitions go.  It's a messaging phone.  So it's definitely even less likely to be backed up.  But what does everybody what is everybody using?  I'm on a BlackBerry now because I broke up with my iPhone.  Yeah, it's got to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gina, what do you have?  I have an Android phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  G1.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not surprised.  Patrick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I had I was planning on breaking up with my iPhone.  Then then my hardware got repaired and AT&T went to 850 megahertz in San Francisco and  it saved our relationship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It won you back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They actually 850 megahertz made the iPhone functional because it basically had stopped  working in my house.  Does it work in the office now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because I know none of the iPhones seem to work at revision three headquarters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If I it depends on whether I'm in my cubicle, which is like dead center in the Faraday cage.  It's a little awkward.  You know, if it's on the right side of my cube, I get four bars.  And if it's on the left side of my cube, it gets a bar.  But I can actually stand up and use my cell phone in the office for the first time ever.  I think they can't roll out 850 megahertz nationwide and AT&T fast enough for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I broke up with my iPhone and then a week later got an email from AT&T saying that they'd  put up a new 3G tower a mile from my house, which sounds like it should have been a want  want kind of moment.  But then my friends came over with their iPhone 3GS.  Still didn't work.  No kidding.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  About living in a Faraday cage.  So you're screwed no matter what.  Sorry, sidekick.  Sorry, iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No matter what you do.  Actually, Gina, are you happy with your Android phone?  I love Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't love the handset.  I would love to upgrade to a new handset.  The G1 is kind of crappy, but Android is fantastic.  And I do love it.  And I'm actually wondering if syncing to Google, that doesn't really count as a local backup,  does it?  But I don't know.  I feel like Google's probably not going to lose all of my account data anytime soon.  Like this is just a ridiculous.  I mean, how do you not have a backup, even if it's a day old backup?  I don't understand that.  Yeah, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, most importantly, it is totally unacceptable to have a cloud service like that and have  that level of failure.  And apparently there's already a class action suit brewing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like anything will ever happen to the cloud again after this.  This is a one time deal.  I'm going to be fine forever.  It's going to be fine after that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's one really good thing about this is that everybody who has anything stored in  this manner, anybody who's doing cloud computing right now on a really serious basis is now  freaking out to make sure that they've done due diligence and have better backup systems  in place.  At least I hope.  Hopefully.  As I stare at Gmail and Google Docs and Dropbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I tell you what, at least it's just a one off isolated thing.  It's not like there's another story that's similar to this of somebody whose data is  in the cloud and all of a sudden they can't access it.  Like that would never happen twice in the same week.  No, never.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's no way that if you were, for example, a fan of Google Voice, you just couldn't make  calls in certain areas.  Well, maybe that's why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But certainly Facebook would be fine, right?  Oh yeah, Facebook would be fine.  There's no chance that...  No, no.  Always.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow, are there just like a bunch of different stories like this today?  Yeah, we'll get to the Facebook thing in a minute.  Although first, I want to talk a little bit about Google Voice because this is pretty  germane to our kind of mobile device discussion.  The FCC now says after AT&T accused Google of violating net neutrality laws by refusing  to provide calls to rural areas.  For free.  Even though they're not a phone service and we, I believe on my show, characterize that  as bald-faced lies from AT&T.  Nevertheless, the FCC has decided to investigate whether Google has in fact violated telecommunications  laws by refusing to connect some calls to rural areas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, I cracked the code on this one because you notice at the very end of the  article it says they asked how the service works and how Google sees the service fits  under the FCC's regulatory schemes.  It also asked the company to explain its invitation only policy for the trial service.  I think they're upset because they did not get Google Wave invites.  That's what this is all about.  That seems like the most likely possibility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, Gina, I feel confident that you have probably talked about this issue and exactly  how Google Voice works.  Is the FCC just misunderstanding the way that Google Voice works or do you think this is  a legitimate kind of thing to look into?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that the FCC does kind of misunderstand.  I think Google Voice is kind of a new product and I think that it's important to understand  that Google Voice is really kind of a complement to your existing phone service.  You can't make Google Voice calls without a phone to begin with.  It is not a phone service, just a sole phone service.  It's in addition to that.  It gives you number portability and it gives you voicemail transcription, but you still  need a phone to use it.  And they are providing it for free.  So I think Google's argument is valid.  And I think it's so funny that they title it, you know, like Google's official blog  posts are always like very kind of politically correct.  But this one was like sex call centers and Google Voice.  And they're making the argument that some of these rural areas that are really expensive  to route calls to have like sex call centers in them to pump traffic  into them. So I thought that was kind of an interesting point that they brought up.  But I think Google has I think that Google has a good point.  And it'd be really interesting to see.  I mean, this is totally one of these new technologies.  They're sort of breaking new ground.  And the FCC has got to figure out, well, are we going to treat these types of things  differently?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's reasonable in that sense for the FCC to at least look into it and say,  well, OK, there's no question that this is new technology.  And even if it's not strictly speaking, a phone service, is there a reason to check  this out? And then, I mean, I guess you do have to wonder, like, is it OK for Google  Voice to say we're just not going to provide service to those areas if if they're if  they want to play in the telecommunication space?  And I think what got AT&T so frustrated is that they were thinking, well, you're playing  in our sandbox, but you don't have to follow the same rules.  Although one could argue, should you have to follow the same rules if you're not actually  a phone service, which I guess I just keep coming back to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So did I hear right? Did you say that the app only works on the phone?  There's no way to use the same service from your desktop PC?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, from your desktop PC, you can initiate a call through Google Voice, through  Google Voice number, but it calls your phone.  Right. OK, so you can't receive incoming calls that way.  Gotcha. Yeah, exactly. Right. Right.  And I mean, cell phones, I don't know if this is comparable, but cell phones can't make  911 calls, right. Or from certain voice over IP.  I mean, there are restrictions with different types of phones that there are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. I mean, at this point, most of the voice over IP should be sorry.  All of a sudden, the Blue Angels are like roaring over the building.  If I start looking up and like hiding under a desk, you'll know why.  The but most of the voice over IP systems now have 911 call writing, the major ones.  And that's I mean, that's that's kind of been the classic fight between traditional  telecommunications and everything coming out of like Silicon Valley or technology or  whatever it is, is is all the people like AT&T is looking around like we have to comply  by all these rules. We have to do all these things.  Oh, yeah, Google, you call us out any time you feel annoyed by anything we do.  So I think there may be just a little bit of tit for tat going on here to try to make it  feel more competitive for AT&T or or maybe less annoying because they have to be looking  at Google and be like, what are you guys doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Scared to death that they can't tie people to a single number for a two year contract.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And that's the thing is that they're saying, look, here's this thing that has a  really good chance of taking away business from us.  And yet they don't have to follow the same rules that we do.  And they basically get to keep going around acting like big old jerks who everybody loves.  You know, I mean, I think they're just like, oh, we hate you, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Do you think do they think it'll really take away business or because it seems like  it's going to be a complement to any existing phone line, whether it's a landline or a cell  line, or are you thinking like people are just going to hop from from account to account  as soon as they have like a relatively guaranteed number through Google Voice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Question mark. Yeah, I mean, I think it's I think it's what Gina said is that people are  going to be less they're going to be you know, if this technology becomes widespread, let's  start that right. Because right now it is very tiny.  It's a very tiny number of people who are using it.  But if it becomes widespread, it's absolutely the kind of thing that could make people  significantly less interested in signing those long contracts with a given carrier.  They're going to be a lot more interested in buying unlocked phones, paying for a small,  you know, a much smaller and cheaper plan and then using something like Google Voice with  like or using a Verizon, my fine and iPod touch, you know, and and and Vonage or something.  I mean, I think it just it says it makes the whole sort of cell phone hegemony slightly  less necessary.  It's true.  But yeah, so let's move on to the cloud.  Let's get back to the cloud thing.  Now that we've got that boring Google Voice out of the way.  A minor story.  Rushwood was totally trying to skip that.  It's like, I don't want to talk about it.  It was related. It was a segue.  It is. It was a good segue.  I agree. I blew it.  It got slapped down.  Anyway, yeah.  So people are reporting.  So last week, about seven or eight days ago, there were all these outages on Facebook.  I saw one. It said that the accounts were down for maintenance.  And then apparently now reports are still rolling in like crazy that people cannot  access their accounts.  No word on whether those accounts are actually gone for good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But don't know if it's a psychic problem yet, but people are still shut out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I haven't seen I haven't seen super widespread reports, but it does sound like the  inaccessible the inaccessibility continues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not one of those guys that's totally like sucked into the Facebook vortex, but I  know people who are that way.  And I would imagine it would just explode their brains with frustration trying to  deal with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I can't.  It's well, Facebook outages.  I mean, forget Twitter outages, right?  A serious Facebook outage.  That is Ragnarok right there.  Not funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Took me a second to remember what Ragnarok was like, is that a band?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Disaster. It should be.  If it's not, Ragnarok is a great band name.  Speaking of, you know, sites without it, just Twitter is apparently this was so sad  for Twitter because there were reports that Twitter was having talks with Microsoft  and Google on all things about big data mining deals.  And then right in the middle of that last week, Twitter outage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, did they? I think I'm sensing a theme in all these stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know the cloud is not your friend.  Why does this feel like 1995 all over again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Twitter outage was it was particularly creepy, right, because it wasn't like  Twitter's down. Fail.  Well, it's like you can only see your own updates and no one else is saying anything  like you're alone in Twitter.  Like it was really scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it happened for all of us, whereas at that awkward moment where we made a joke,  we're like, right, guys, right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Guys, is this thing on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what's funny is I didn't even know there was a Twitter outage, but I had that  moment, the moment you described it, like, that's why nobody thought I was funny that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  day. I know I had it too and I didn't know.  And then it was like a day later that I read there was an outage and I was like, oh,  phew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, to go back to the Facebook thing, like really briefly, I think this is the  thing that scares me about cloud computing the most.  It's not that like we're going to have some giant server outage and everyone's data is  going to be gone. I mean, that's a possibility.  My greatest fear is that one day somebody is going to try and brute force my Gmail  login and Google is going to decide that to make my account inaccessible.  It's a free service and I can't contact them and they won't let me back in.  Just my account will be down.  So, you know, the whole Internet won't be up in arms.  I'll just be screwed.  You know, and, you know, if I wasn't doing this week in Google, no one would know about  it. You know what I mean?  I think that I think the account lockout is is a thing that I'm a little more concerned  about. It's absolutely true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's more the sort of the secret police threat than the, you know, actual apocalypse kind  of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, so I always like laugh about a certain ex eBay person who wants to be the governor  of the state of California.  I'm like, you're the person who's single handedly responsible for the worst customer service  I've ever received in my life.  You lock down fourteen hundred dollars of my cash in a PayPal account because of something  you refuse to explain and couldn't explain unless I faxed in a copy of my driver's license  and my Social Security number to a random number.  Like, and I'm sitting there and I'm like, you know, to me, like, you like and people  are like, you know, and you sit there and I completely understand where genius is coming  from, where it's just like looking at that.  Like, yeah, everything if everything's gone, it's really gone.  And if you can't call anyone, you are so beyond screwed.  And it's it's a little frightening.  I've had Google outages when I was, you know, Google was my has been my primary email forever.  And, you know, it almost never happens, you know, but I've had Google outages, Gmail outages  happen while I was on deadline, you know, and that's like yours.  You know, so you're calling people up, you're setting up an alternate account, you're  transferring stuff.  And that's that's a bad thing.  Especially when literally there's no one you can talk to to try to resolve the situation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And as the trend toward free cloud services increases, you know, it's like this total  inverse, right? The customer service accessibility decreases.  And I mean, Facebook is a perfect example of this.  This the most important site in the world to some people, the most important thing that  they do all day, all day long at six minute intervals.  Check Facebook. And then if you play Mafia Wars, go, can I just can we Farmville?  Can we put a stop to the Mafia Wars?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My mom got involved in Mafia Wars.  I couldn't believe it.  I was like, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The least likely people in the world to like people you would never expect are obsessed  with Mafia Wars.  So anyway, there it is really important.  And if you go to the Facebook customer services page, they have a list of most commonly  asked questions on Facebook.  And the number one question on their most commonly asked question page is how do I  contact Facebook?  Because you are the most important.  You don't.  You cannot find them.  You cannot get in touch with them.  And number two is how do I delete my account?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was kind of surprising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, on the Twitter thing outside of their fail this week, I actually am super excited  about the talking that they're doing because this is the light at the monetary tunnel for  Twitter. And I think none of us wants to see Twitter become wholly ad supported where all  of a sudden we get ad alerts on our phones.  But this is a way I'm sorry, Brian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you telling me Google and Microsoft will not monetize Twitter through advertising?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who knows what they're going to do.  But the talk is that they're looking at at aggregating all the results of what's happening  real time on Twitter and involving it in the search engines where there's some fabulous  data mining to be done.  This is literally the pulse of the world at any given time.  It's a giant open source, open conversation where all of a sudden, like there are  companies, you know, like Gallup organization that you have to pay a lot of money for poll  results to know whether people like something.  Nielsen, you know, people run these little studies to find out what's going to play well  for the public, what's not. And if they could find a way to mine all that.  In fact, before it got absorbed into the mothership, some eyes before it became search  dot Twitter dot com and got totally broke, had a really cool thing they were doing where  they were taking you could put in a search word and it would figure out how many positive  words were associated with that object versus negative words.  And it would actually give you a visualization with with red and green and and colors in  between, which I guess is just brown.  I think it was white in this. But but all of a sudden you could know, like I remember  typing in when Scam School launched to see that, OK, generally people are digging on  Scam School. They're mainly saying positive words associated with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I think that it doesn't that.  Well, frankly, the idea of being able to actually monetize anything like this effectively  through advertising, at least right now, is not really working out for anybody.  So I do assume that they're hoping to make money on data mining.  I mean, that alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought Facebook was making money or am I just completely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Facebook is cash flow positive.  They're not necessarily and that's you know, that's very different from profitable.  They may be able to like we don't know exactly what I mean.  They may be just covering their own expenses, but not paying back their investors.  But either way, they're getting some money.  And I think a lot of that money is coming from data mining.  If Twitter could cut those kind of deals, they would need what's interesting is they'll  need a lot more than the 54 million users that they have now.  I mean, it's not like they actually are aggregating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They write it's a useful service, but it's not valued at one billion dollars useful by  any stretch. But you got to remember also, not only do you know what all of America is  saying or whatever the segment of America that's using it, you know, by demographic,  you can know exactly what 14 to 16 year old girls are saying about any particular topic

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  at a given time. If they filled out their profile.  I think most of us do. I think most people do.  Yeah, I think so, because everybody's looking for dates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's a techie thing to do is to put in a bunch of bogus information.  That's something like I don't think most people like my mom wouldn't do that.  She'd be like, oh, well, they're asking. I got to give the truth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Absolutely. All right, let's take a little break since we've now annoyed everybody with  talking about Twitter. Leo has kindly pre-recorded some ad stuff for us, so I don't have to do it.  Take it away, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We sound like a crime fighting duo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We do. I know. I think maybe we should start a band.  Or at least a website.  All right. Let's talk a little bit about the moon bombing.  Yes. The best headline I've seen about no more moon, about the moon bombing this week was like  it was really exciting for scientists and then the public didn't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really? We love the headline, though.  Are you kidding? Yeah. Moon bombing.  We're blowing up the moon.  Did you ever see that Mr. Show sketch?  America blows up the moon.  That's a just a Robert Young over at WeirdThings.com.  That's how he pegged the whole thing.  He was like NASA's blowing up the room moon for reals.  But instead of the actual link, he linked to the Mr.  Show segment where it was all fake news footage of them actually blowing up the moon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But in this case, so aren't we basically just trying to see if we can go live there?  This is not the first time for water.  We've I know it's not the first time we've looked for water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, but but in that same spot, because was it there?  There was like an errant satellite that wasn't being used anymore.  There's they had to go down anyway.  So they went ahead and they pegged at it roughly the same area on the pole.  And they didn't really see anything because they said, I was a long shot.  We didn't know if we would actually see anything or not.  But this one was actually built for the purpose of finding out  if there's a lot of water on there.  Which even then, I think they were excited about like maybe two or three percent water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it sounds like they didn't they didn't get the plume of  of splashiness that they were hoping for.  They they got you know, it's too early to tell.  But they were like they when they break it down, they said, well,  we were looking for a really the plume ish.  They set up bad expectations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought the moon was going to be gone and I was going to correct them.  I was like, you should have gone when it was a full moon.  So you make sure you get the whole thing.  This is bogus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They should be playing that little that graphic.  It just sat expectations so high, like big animation of what would happen.  And then it was like the photos were just sort of this grainy black and white thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. What actually happened?  It's such a letdown that animations are so much cooler than  than real. But I just want to know, I want to have been in the meeting  where they said, like, let's just slam a rocket stage into it.  You know, you know how we should do this is just I mean, like,  I can see it. I was like, gentlemen, I feel like Armageddon, you know, like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but I mean, the guy who came up with ballistic reentry,  which is basically what we used for, you know, Mercury and Apollo and everything.  The guy was like, we're going to put a really cool fireproof  substance on the bottom of a can, and that's going to, you know,  slide through the Earth's atmosphere.  And then a parachutes come out, everybody gave like looked at him like Wiley  Coyote had come to life with a giant box of ACME.  You know what I mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's how I had to be totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Then he was like, no, seriously, it sounds slapstick, but I think it could work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Listen, guys, we got about 100 million dollars left in the budget.  What do you want to do?  I want to shoot a rocket to blow up the moon. Done. Done.  Actually, apparently, apparently the science, they're pretty excited about it.  The Wired article was very complimentary on how everything went.  Everything was real smooth.  And of course, that's the problem is that the devil's in the details  and you have to wait for all the analysis to find out what this really means  long term. But apparently it was a success.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes. Well, if you don't have to shoot water into space, then long term space  exploration starts becoming a lot more practical because you stuff more  non, you know what I mean?  It's like, you know, it's what it is to cost ten ten thousand dollars per pound

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to send stuff into space right now.  And so if you can find the water there, obviously, if you want to live off the land,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Evian was expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. Yeah.  To be fair, they're not probably really looking for ways for us to live there.  Although, let's be honest, we're going to need a new rock.  They are, in fact, hoping to make it like a little pit stop for space exploration.  And also we could live there.  So speaking of flashy technology, this, I thought the story was very exciting.  At news.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just realized that was a pun. Was that a pun?  Yeah. Oh, that was a good pun. Thanks. All right. Good catch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It sounds like so we heard, I think, last week about Lightpeak,  this idea of Intel's Lightpeak, which would be a universal connector  for computers and other devices, which just sounded like pie in the sky.  Water on the moon.  Well, at least one company is saying that they may actually be in mass production  on lightpeak technology by the beginning of next year. 2010.  Can you imagine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm a little bit nervous about I mean, first of all, I think it's a connector.  I think it's great that they're moving forward.  I'm a little bit nervous about replacing everything with fiber optic cable  because you'll notice it says in there like it was a big deal that you could curve it  to like you move the wire into a one inch diameter.  But it's like with copper, I mean, I don't think any of those wires  would survive travel on the road with me anyway for anywhere,  because it's like, you know, everything gets scratched up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No optical cables.  I mean, if you if you bend it at right angles and beat the hell out of optical  cables are actually pretty tough. Are they? I mean, I'm not going to say  they're as tough as copper.  You definitely don't want to be bending them at right angles and, you know,  tying them into knots and stuff. But let's be fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a there's a real big difference between Brian Brushwood  and the average consumer, because I don't know if you guys have seen his iPhone.  But I replaced it. It's fine. OK. Everything's fine. All right.  He's like he's like when you have like a son who's like five or six  and then he breaks everything and you don't even know how it happens

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  because everything's hard beating on a drum. I hear you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that's kind of like him.  But it does sound like these cables would be at least slightly.  But then the other thing, though, is if it was actually a universal connector,  like who cares? Because everywhere you go, boom, there'll be cables.  That's true. Because it's universal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And in fact, I'm in general a fan of people jumping the gun  and just not waiting for something to be a settled standard just to get out there  and start making it and getting it in people's hands.  And I know it's frustrating when you got to buy stuff all over again,  but I'm ready to see the technology progress.  Although it's supposed to be really damn fast, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, that's that's the really exciting thing, right?  I mean, I get the whole universal cable thing,  but it's supposed to be like super duper crazy fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ten gigabits per second.  Yeah. Fast enough for video, replace everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  I love the concept, but I was covering ultra wideband for a while.  And it's like, you know how all those wireless connections we have to our HDTVs right now?  Oh, wait. There's like, you know what I mean?  It's it's it's I think it's an awesome concept.  I will be delighted if it ships.  I will be delighted if it ships next year.  I will also be incredibly shocked because cable and wireless cable  and faster cable standards.  You know, it always takes forever to roll it out.  And then you have to like figure out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But there's a buzz factor to cash in on.  I mean, if a year from now, the technology is hyped a lot more  and somebody says, guess what, it's here, you're going to get a substantial  number of consumers running out and insisting that their new computer have,  you know, whatever just built into it, whether or not it actually works,  whether or not there's anything you can do with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there's no spoken like a very hopeful PR rep from a company  that's hoping to make a lot of money on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like a realist who understands that there's a financial benefit to  jumping on a bandwagon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  USB was I mean, USB was out for like six years and on tens of millions of PCs.  And it took the IMAQ, you know what I mean?  And and and Apple beating a bunch of vendors with a stick to come out  with USB printers and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Same thing happened with DVD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Apple did the same thing with Firewire.  I mean, look at Firewire, right?  Well, it never really got beyond that, which was a standard  that was practically dead in the water.  Or it was just kind of not.  It didn't have a ton of traction.  All of a sudden, Apple gets behind it in a huge way.  And Firewire, then they turn it into this big video standard  and then kill it, which was obnoxious.  But now they are getting behind lightpeak in the same way.  I mean, I think that there's vendor support in a way that that could make it.  I mean, granted, it's not going to be massively available in 2010.  This company's going to start shipping some cables, but it won't be a standard yet  because they're applying for a USB standard.  It won't be in all the hardware yet.  But by 2012, you don't think so?  We're at 12.  Gina, be positive. What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to go out there.  I want really fast cables that are plug and everything.  So I'm going to be hopeful.  I don't know. I honestly, I'm not being much of a gadget geek.  I haven't followed the history of like of USB.  I'm going to defer to Patrick and you on this.  But, you know, I mean, I would love to see it.  Hey, if it comes out and people start asking for it.  I mean, I'd love to see it. I hope it works out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, me too.  One thing it sounds like is not going to work out for much longer.  DVDs. Yes. Thank goodness.  Golf takes forever.  And you know that DVDs are, in fact, on the way out when it's not just like  tech forward streaming nerds like us who are talking about it.  It's Netflix CEO Reed Hastings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This was my favorite story of the week.  This is so exciting. I know me too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought this was phenomenal.  He said in an interview with Motley Fool that DVD would only be the primary  delivery format for Netflix for the next two years.  Like he basically said, DVD, at least for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's what we do.  Can I tell you, that's already like I subscribed to Netflix a long time ago.  And I said, like the physical media they sent first disc I got was Michael Clayton.  I sat on it for six months.  Now, keep in mind, I'm watching all the movies on the streaming.  I'm watching all the series.  You know, we just finished all of Weeds on the streaming service.  And meanwhile, that one disc sat there.  So finally we sent it back.  But now we've changed.  Now, instead of sitting on one disc for six months and then sending it back,  we get the disc, we sit on it for two days and then send it back.  Like I literally don't think I've watched a single movie.  We've gone through like 25 discs and I don't think I've bothered to.  I just can't be bothered.  You got to take the disc and you got to put it in the tray.  And it's like, oh, the freaking FBI warning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, and then it's scratch and you have to face on it or get the pledge out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Get all life hacker on us.  What now with the toothpaste and the pledge?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. The pledge, the pledge will help with the scratch DVD for sure.  You got to go to the mailbox and pick it up.  It's annoying. Yes.  So DVDs out and that's what I say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry, you got to go to the mailbox and pick it up.  It's so annoying. Oh, yes.  So 21st century.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sometimes I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to leave the couch to get a movie that's unacceptable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Come on. My mailbox is, you know, not at the house.  I've got a mailbox down the road.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I'm not with you, dude.  It's driving me nuts. I'm so over physical media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have the same the same annoyance with that.  I have to put the thing in the thing.  That's how lazy I have become as a human, where I'm just like,  I have to go all the way over there and open it.  And my DVD player is old and it takes a long time for the drawer to open.  And then I have to move it because it's a changer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Next day. And then the worst are the ads that you can't skip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But as you can't skip our little friends.  But so what so Hastings didn't specifically say,  and this is what is kind of interesting, what would take over for DVD?  What would supplant DVD?  I bet I think we are all assuming streaming.  Oh, streaming is gone so well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's so it's so good enough and it's so fast and it's so easy.  I mean, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Netflix is so everywhere.  Yeah. In every device now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. There was a fascinating article in Wired magazine  talking about that decision.  They were originally going to be another box on your shelf.  And instead, they last minute scrubbed it and said,  let's just be on everything and be a software platform.  And I think it's worked out great for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good decision on their part, for sure.  Kudos to them for being forward thinking and saying, you know,  this primary thing that we made money doing, you know,  ain't happening anymore and being forward thinking for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's. Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They originally said there was like almost 20, 20 originally for DVDs.  And Hastings is only he basically says they expect to keep handling DVDs  for another decade, at least.  I just I don't know if the bandwidth is going to cope to getting it.  I mean, I mean, I like streaming movies, but I also like extra features.  I also like the the resolution quality on Blu Ray.  Well, I think, yeah, you'll have better than 720p over over like stream compression.  I think I think streaming has to evolve.  Yeah. The good enough market is big, but it's going to be interesting  also to watch Hollywood still shaking out what it wants to do next.  And and, you know, the the availability, the availability on DVD  versus the availability on streaming.  There's still a great big wide chasm in between.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I tell you, it's been massively exploding in the last year  because you remember earlier this year, that's when he was saying  it's going to be 2018 till we stop handling physical media.  The DVD is still our primary mode of distribution.  And what I think is happening is I think we've seen a tipping point.  All of a sudden, people are jumping on board.  It's getting easier for them to go to developers and say, we want your content  and we want, you know, we have this distribution method that's secure.  That's probably not going to get ripped off.  And people are going on.  I think I think in the next year, you're going to see a massive,  massive explosion of the Netflix online library.  And I couldn't be happier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hope for that.  But it's also don't confuse Netflix's business model  with the entire business model for people that distribute video.  I mean, they're not the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're not the same thing.  But you have to admit that Netflix is at the forefront of a trend  that is increasingly important.  And it's important because the places that people consume media  are exploding themselves, right?  It's not about anymore just sitting in front of your TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I mean, on the nation, people are confused about like,  do we get a Blu-ray player?  Do we get a set top box?  Do I need to get a separate one?  Do we get a home theater PC?  You know, do I get, you know, do I buy do I buy an LG  so I can have integrated Netflix?  Well, I can't use a PS3, but I can use my Xbox 360.  And it's also still a real soupy mess for a lot of people having the Xbox.  Well, and still for the high end experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, the higher experience is definitely going to be Blu-ray  for the foreseeable future.  But meanwhile, the good enough market, it's going to be Netflix streaming, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think you're right.  I agree, Patrick, that I think that the hard thing is going to be bandwidth.  It's going to be hard for people to keep up with the bandwidth,  to do that kind of streaming, especially as the trend in ISPs  is to do more throttling and to say we don't and more caps and to do caps.  Exactly. We don't want to deal with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, because there's the five gigabyte and 40 gigabyte caps, you can.  I mean, a five gigabyte cap is three movies.  You know what I mean? The 40 gigabyte cap, if, you know,  if you've got a toddler that hits play a lot,  you can destroy a 40 gigabyte cap in like a week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Very true. But I think there's no to me, there's no question, though,  that that's where we're headed, that we are headed toward an on-demand  kind of all streaming world.  And it's going to take us a long time to get there.  But I think the idea that that Netflix realizes that it's not going to be  delivering the major, you know, DVDs as the majority for very much longer,  I think is really true.  And I think the Blu-ray is never going to be as big as the DVD  because it's going to be supplanted by by streaming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, in addition to my prediction that a year from now,  streaming will be way huger than it is now, I also predict  that we'll be having a tweet where we discuss the great Netflix outage of 2011.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was waiting for my favorite movie and they cut out on me.  Those bastards.  They lost this Facebook nonsense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's nothing compared to the fury compared to like I was right

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  in the middle of the true blood cliffhanger.  Disaster.  Well, there's no question that the whole trend is toward digital, including books.  And the Kindle. Very smooth.  I know, very smooth. You're on a roll.  You're out of control.  It's like tacky at this point.  It's just tacky to be so obvious.  Amazon cut the price of the Kindle this week, added a global version,  which everyone was very so the Kindle now, the Kindle 2 is $259.  And they added a GSM version  that will work internationally on AT&T's network and partner networks.  And then that was really everybody was really positive about that news,  except for me, because I have a Kindle 2 already and it's CDMA.  And I'm not going to get that.  And you're just shaking your head no matter what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm shaking my head because I mean, number one, very smart right direction,  because it's obvious that there's a market for this kind of device.  And whoever gets there first owns the market, at least in the public's mind.  So this is all very smart for Amazon.  Unfortunately, I don't think they're cutting the price nearly enough  to grab enough of the market.  It's got to be $99 for me to hop on board.  They got to take bigger losses on this if they want to actually own that market.  Because right now, like most like what I would be most excited about with the Kindle  would be to read my regular websites, you know, to actually treat it  like a daily newspaper kind of device.  But the problem is, I can already do that with my iPhone for the most part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but the reading experience is so much better on a Kindle compared to having  read novels on both platforms.  The Kindle was much more enjoyable and continues to be much more enjoyable  than reading on my iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I absolutely agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But also, you know, they're in a race if the rumors are true about the Apple  tablet device and if it's actually going to try to be a reader device,  then they have to own that market.  They have to say, nice try, Apple.  But we already, you know, we already own this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Although, yeah, I don't know what it, Gina, what do you think about the price?  The two fifty nine, I have argued for a long time that the Kindle was not too expensive,  but it is possible that as competition creeps up, there might be  that might be a problem. Two fifty nine.  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know. I think I kind of agree.  I'm with Brian on this one. I think it needs to go a little lower.  I mean, I love my Kindle.  So does all of us do all of us here have a Kindle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know I do not. You do not.  Patrick, yes. OK. And Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. Yeah, I do.  I do have one. But I got one, you know, when like Oprah did her big discount thing,  like I and I had to get certificates and stuff, you know, because I'm kind of cheap  and I wasn't wasn't sold on the idea.  So I do kind of think that the price needs to come down for people to really get on board.  And but the reading experience is definitely much, much better on the Kindle.  Although I don't use it to read websites, I use it to read books,  long form books, websites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm too far down the audible rabbit hole.  Like I just I mean, I love reading online.  I love reading books occasionally if I'm sitting on the beach or something.  But far and away, I'm chewing through a book a week, at least doing online audiobooks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you're not going to take the Kindle on the beach.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When I bought. Yeah, that's very true.  When I bought the Kindle, actually, I felt like I had this big dilemma  because I had this big pile of IRL books, like in real life books  that I felt like I was betraying because I had the Kindle thing and it was a little awkward.  But I actually think that what is coming out, what's coming out.  I don't know. I get weird.  I used to be that way about stuffed animals, too.  Like that bear is going to kill me in the night because I played with the other one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I was just laughing because it was like I thought I was the only person  who thought about it that way.  Like the books are looking at the Kindle and being really pissed off about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was like, sure that they felt kind of offended, you know,  the ones that, you know, like the like water for elephants was sitting there  on the shelf like, seriously, really?  You've been ignoring me for like a year and a half.  And now you got a Kindle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then how many books did you buy in the Kindle and not quite read  because it's a book buying machine as much as it is a book reading machine.  It is like a compulsive book buying machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now you know how all my DVDs feel.  Just sit there on the shelf.  The Netflix DVDs like streaming. Come on, dude.  You've had me for six. Come on.  I don't know. But you're my disk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're totally right.  Like I have gotten into a situation basically now where if my friends  get too many beers in me, I'll buy just about any book.  It's ludicrous. You just went, OK.  Oh, yeah, that's a good book. I'm buying it right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look at me. Look at me buying the book. Look.  I need like I need a probation period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I need for the Kindle to have a little probation period  where you have a grace period after you buy a book, after you make the ill  advised infinite just purchase to be able to just return it.  That's why I think you're downloading sample chapters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Instead of drunk dialing, it's the drunk kindling problem.  It is. Friends don't let friends kindle drunk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I know that makes me a giant nerd that I have drunk kindle bought,  but it happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That'll be interesting when somebody grabs your Kindle  and kind of peruses your library and he's like, really?  The Da Vinci Code, really?  You're like, ah, you're like, shh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did a video actually on how to hide embarrassing books on your Kindle  as a how to because it is such because you buy anything for one thing.  And then and then the Kindle, it turns out, is a huge vector for softcore porn.  That like there have been a couple of studies that basically say  that the bestselling titles on the Kindle are basically erotic fiction  because everyone's like, awesome.  Now I can read this on the bus and no one can see.  But the problem with the Kindle is that it's such a an attention magnet  that people grab it and pick it up and start looking through your light,  you know, and you're like, ha ha ha ha, put that down.  Anyway, oh, robot.  We got Robo Patrick. We'll call him back.  In the meantime, though, we will talk about some other competition  for the Kindle, which is Barnes and Noble planning to do an e-book reader.  The thing so far is that everybody who announces the plans  to do an e-book reader like like the IREC, they're still talking about $400.  Although I don't I don't think there's pricing yet on what Barnes and Noble might do.  I mean, don't you kind of feel like really Barnes and Noble reader? How cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I tell you, the difference between first place and second place.  That's that's it's a race.  And Amazon's just running away with it right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Is Sony in it? You guys think?  With the reader. I mean, it's like Sony was actually there first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They were first, but they weren't first in the mind of the customer.  And that's what really matters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true.  What Android involved with this new Barnes and Noble reader supposedly?  Is that the rumor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's expected to run the Android operating system.  And then if it ran that and then it had wireless downloads, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Interesting. Yeah, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do feel like the Kindle is the kind of the iPhone of the e-book market.  Oh, definitely. And the whole you get if you're good, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the parallels are so right.  It's it's first in the mind of the customer.  And it's also the way they're doing the 9.99 per book is modeling right off of iTunes.  Ninety nine cents.  Everyone griped about the 99 cents download to begin with.  But it was very effective to grabbing everyone's attention and  pinning it in their mind that, oh, I can get songs for a buck.  And now it's like, oh, I could get any book for 10 bucks. Right.  Plus, it's white. Yeah.  Wow. Racist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was no, that was that was really well thought out.  Market analysis.  It's also white like the other one and clean.  All right. I'm not going to dig myself any deeper.  Let's go ahead and take another break and listen to some Leo, shall we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Schwinn and Wood. Thank you, gang.  We're going to get back to you guys in just a bit.  But I want to mention, I know I'm in Dubai, but I can't help but dial in  via time machine and tell you about go to meeting.  Go to meeting from the great folks at Citrix.  It's a great way to meet online with clients and colleagues, a great way to collaborate.  According to American Express, and they ought to know,  the average cost of a business trip is ten thousand dollars for one trip.  And let me tell you something, if you're going to Dubai,  it's a heck of a lot more and a lot longer.  And there's such a better way to meet with clients and colleagues,  whether they're across town or around the world, with go to meeting.  Forget a thousand dollars.  How about forty nine dollars a month for unlimited meetings?  As long as you want, as many as you want.  You start your go to meeting with a single single click of the mouse.  In fact, you could send out Outlook invitations automatically,  or you could just start a meeting as you're on the phone.  It's so easy to just say, hey, look, I got to show you this PowerPoint.  I want to show you these drawings.  Go to go to meeting dot com.  This is what you tell your clients or your colleagues.  Go to go to meeting dot com.  Press the join a meeting button.  Here's the meeting ID. You give them a nine digit number.  Boom, they're seeing your computer on their screen.  It's beautiful. There's a chat on the side.  There's meeting attendees.  There's it's it's this is designed for online meeting.  It is slick. It's elegant because it's from Citrix.  They've had years to design this and make it the best very fast.  You're not sitting there waiting for the slides to change.  You keep they keep up with you.  I use it for I've used it for our shows.  A number of our shows use go to meeting when they have when we have remote hosts  like Ray Maxwell, he'll use go to meeting to show us his screens.  It's so great. I want you to try it right now.  Go to go to meeting dot com slash twit.  Geo Tio meeting dot com slash twit.  You could try it free for 30 days, a month of unlimited online meetings.  You get voice over IP.  You get phone conferencing free award winning.  And PC world keeps giving it their best in class award for online access.  I mean, there's nothing better for this.  For online meetings, nothing better for this.  I think this is just a must try application.  Will you try it right now?  Go to go to meeting dot com slash twit.  You've heard me talk about it. Why wait?  Give it a try today.  And we thank Citrix so much for supporting our shows.  Go to meeting dot com slash twit.  Now back, my friends, to Schwud and Wood, the crime fighting duo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's having a little too much fun with that.  Schwud and Wood business.  Wow. Me too, though, now that I said it fast like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's she saying now? OK, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right. Let's go to everybody's favorite topic.  Patent infringement lawsuit.  Hooray. Good times.  This is major, though, EOLOS, which is the company that won  five hundred and eighty five million dollars from Microsoft  when they sued them for. Yeah.  Floodgates are open now is feeling flushed with success.  Not surprisingly, that happened in 2003.  They have now sued 23 companies, including maybe you've heard of them.  Apple, Google, Adobe, Amazon, eBay, Playboy, Yahoo and YouTube,  among many others.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, there's one of those one of those kind of stuck out for the.  Could you go down that list again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's one of those just kind of popped out of me.  I don't know. eBay. Yeah.  Yeah, that might have been it.  That might have been for their use of the the plug ins.  That so. All right.  We're going off the rails.  They have sued these companies for implementing browser plug ins  in one form or another, you know, browser plug ins and then another patent.  They've they've sued over another patent that addresses the use of Ajax,  asynchronous JavaScript and XML.  So this. Feels like the kind of thing, since these patents  have actually been upheld a couple of times by the patent office,  that has the potential to change a lot about the way the web works,  at least in terms of, I don't know, websites having to pay high

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  licensing fees before they when I when I first I mean, it sounded to me  like it's a legitimate claim.  I mean, if if it was right against I mean, if anyone's going to put up  an active defense of this, it's going to be Microsoft.  And once Microsoft goes down and if they're in the right against Microsoft,  I'm thinking they're in the right against everyone else.  I'd be interested to hear what Patrick has to say about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mm hmm. This is Patrick Bate right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, is I didn't actually get a chance to read this one as EOLA's  a holding company that bought the technology patents  and has a whole flood of lawyers or they just one of those quiet  little companies that nobody knew about that that got a bunch of patents  back in the 80s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The story I heard was that they're the real deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They are the they are the patent holders.  EOLA's and the and the University of California.  OK, we're granted the patents themselves.  Yeah, they didn't. It's not like they bought it as part of a portfolio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, because there was there was some interesting stuff  actually going around JPEG and other places where companies were being acquired.  Basically, somebody, you know, did a round of funding,  gathered a bunch of lawyers and started combing through  IP that they bought to look for stuff that they could use to  to leverage for lawsuits to generate more capital as a business.  Man, you know, what I'm what I'm more scared of is that these guys claim  that they have a patent that that predates Ajax being implemented.  That's just sucks.  You know, like, you know, it's  it's I just I, you know, it's kind of like, you know, MPEG four is,  you know, MPEG four is actually completely tied up in  basically MPEG four is completely owned and completely patentable, chargeable.  And one of the interesting things is, you know, looking at like MPEG two  and MPEG four, which has been exempt from licensing fees for nonprofit  use, which essentially means consumer use and for businesses  that are basically doing short videos or online distribution.  And if this if the people patent holders wanted to,  they could essentially charge every single person that distributes video online  a fee for the use of that the way they do for people who create  blu rays or large corporate sites to distribute video.  So, you know, you know, it's like welcome to patent law.  You know, you you own a patent, you defend a patent, you collect cash,  and then you start collecting more and more cash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah, it does.  I mean, it definitely sounds like this is beyond patents as business plan,  although potentially even more scary.  Well, Gina, you look like you were biting your tongue there, too.  What do you think about what do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm kind of I'm confused about this.  So this patent is a claim that on on a program running inside of a web browser  specifically, like any plug in running inside of a web browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, essentially a program that runs within another program.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Any and it addresses it's actually even worse than that.  Gina, the the summary I'm reading here is the 906 path, five billion three,  eight hundred thirty eight thousand nine hundred and six and US patent  seven million five hundred ninety nine thousand nine hundred eighty five.  The 906 patent broadly covers any mechanism  that can be used to embed an object within a Web documents.  And we when the oldest says object, it means any applets or plugins.  So anything embedded within a Web document.  OK, quick time, active X controls, Windows Media player,  Sun's Java virtual machine and any web browser that automatically invokes  each applet and plug in when you click on an appropriate link  or in violation of Eola's patents.  This is from Computer World.  And so basically they're saying anything that's embedded in a web browser,  we we we own the rights to embed anything in a web browser  in any way, in any fashion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's a little vague.  Yeah, it's well, the thing is, it's so vague that it is utterly terrifying.  Right. Because potentially, yikes, what is not covered?  But then then the question that I have is why does this patent  keep getting upheld?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, this is like trying to patent like this design pattern,  like embedding a program to run within another program happen.  I mean, I guess you could say Web document is another program,  but it's like this is this is just weird.  It's like saying patenting like, I don't know, putting a paragraph in a document.  I mean, it just sounds it sounds crazy to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I own the patent on putting words inside a book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. What's what's looking at?  It's Stephen J.  Vaughn, actually Vaughn Nichols wrote this up for Computer World.  And what he's saying is that even Tim Berners-Lee has written  the United States Patent Office and said, look, there's there's preexisting art here.  They did not invent this.  And there's actually there's there people are listing previous browsers  that are doing this because these patents came fairly late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Hopefully that will help.  Yeah, I was I hope so.  This yeah, it was granted in 98.  So you figure if if Tim Berners-Lee says there was prior art, he probably made it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's certain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the whole Ajax thing makes no sense either.  Ajax is not a plug in JavaScript as a framework.  And it fetches data just the way that any Web document is fetched.  Like I don't I'm not I'm confused about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's an object that acts within a browser.  We we came up with the idea that you could put something inside of a web browser window.  The United States Patent Office gave us the approval for that.  Oh, yeah, exactly.  Right. Which you, I believe, have hit on the completely the most salient

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and germane point of all, which is that the US Patent Office not only granted a patent  on that, like the idea of a patenting a word inside a book, but then they have upheld it  three times since then.  They have said, no, that sounds totally reasonable.  Like you you have, in essence, if read properly by the right and most clever lawyer,  you you have patented almost everything about the way the web works today.  So go crazy.  Get your get your lawsuit boots on because you go and dance it.  Yeah, like it's unbelievable.  Oh, yeah, I just feel kind of at a loss.  I mean, I hope that I don't know that someone comes to their senses.  Otherwise, I guess everybody's just going to have to pay this guy and then invent a new Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Unless somebody wants to fight.  I mean, is Microsoft going to fight this all the way to the Supreme Court?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, Microsoft paid, I think, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because they they were fighting with the olas for like a decade, apparently.  Yeah. Which is a long time to be.  Well, I mean, obviously, Microsoft has money and a lot of in-house lawyers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the only the only ray of hope that we have is that the Supreme Court  is currently reviewing the issue of whether software should be patentable  altogether, altogether, because the idea of software of software patents is really.  Fuzzy, right?  I mean, there's so much prior art involved, there's so much it's  it's not like as much of a cut and dried invention.  A lot of them are so broad that that they lead to these kinds of problems.  Wow. Yeah.  So I guess there's some hope there.  Less hope for YouTube in its defense against Viacom,  an exclusive on News.com this billion dollar billion dollar loss.  There's a one billion dollar lawsuit.  And then it turns out some e-mails surfaced that showed  kind of not surprisingly, in my opinion, that YouTube employees knew  that there was unauthorized content on YouTube.  Yeah. And didn't take it down and then may have even uploaded that content themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, like it made it sound like individual employees  a YouTube may have uploaded the account.  And I don't know that that should really be a big factor.  But I don't know, actually, I don't know anything, first of all.  But that seems like less of the crime.  But the idea that if they totally did know that there was  that there was illegal content being uploaded and as an official policy,  they did not do anything about it.  That's that's a bummer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they left an email trail, which is even more horrifying.  Yeah, because that's that's a you know, I mean, lawsuits aren't about what's right  or what's wrong. It's about what you can prove in a court of law against this.  The standing, you know, I mean, it's just ouch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's it's pretty heavy duty because I mean, I think pretty clearly YouTube,  whatever YouTube has become now, it rose to prominence on the back of pirated content.  In my opinion, I know that that was the first time I ever heard of YouTube  was when I think it was some cartoon I wanted to watch.  And that was the first place that showed up, allegedly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think there's no question.  I mean, there's no question that back in the day and this is that's kind of the question, right?  It was back in the day when I don't when the everybody was still pretty fuzzy  on how much you could violate copyright and what was fair use and what wasn't.  And and YouTube obviously built its reputation on that kind of content  and knew about it and probably did upload its own stuff.  But you're right, Patrick.  The problem is that there are evidently emails about it.  And if the reason that it's such a problem is that it would mean that Google  YouTube now owned by Google couldn't qualify for safe harbor under the DMCA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, in the system they have now, where you wait for a takedown and then once  once it's brought to their attention by the owner, they take it down.  I think it's a pretty good system.  But obviously, that wasn't how it always was.  And certainly, if there's evidence clearly showing that their policy was,  let it ride, we're getting famous, then that's going to be a problem.  And maybe Viacom does deserve a chunk of change in compensation  for unwittingly being the engine that rose YouTube to prominence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Or maybe Viacom could just back off and admit that  that the Daily Show is where it is right now because of YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's and that's the two sides of the coin, right?  It's like on the one hand, clearly they derive a massive benefit from YouTube  and it works both ways.  So, I don't know, freaking lawsuits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, really, do you think that like, did Gina, do you think that it's possible  that that Viacom lost money because of YouTube?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely not. No way.  I don't think so. But, you know, I don't know anything either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no, I think you're right.  I don't think I don't think Viacom actually lost any money.  But whatever YouTube is valued at, I think you could definitely say  that some percentage of that value is derived from the Viacom content  that was on YouTube for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I would argue it was a mutually beneficial situation,  you know, regardless of the legal technicalities of it.  Shows got more viewers because of YouTube.  YouTube got more viewers because of shows.  And that's, you know, that's probably that's my opinion on how it went down.  Although, obviously, I have absolutely no numbers to support that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but yeah, I mean, my my gut tells me, you know, my fatherly  home gut tells me that's probably true.  And then and then, you know, by if you use the argument that that YouTube owes  Viacom some kickback because that was the content they used, then, you know,  Google would owe everybody on the web a lot of money.  I mean, yeah, that's the other problem.  Kind of. Yeah, I don't know.  And I understand like everybody should just give a little handshake and walk away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. That's what it seems like to me.  And I know that that with the lawsuit, it's game theory.  You got to ask for the moon, even if it's blown up.  But but in this case, I've been a billion dollars, a billion dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, come on.  That's a little RAA of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love that you just used RAA as a as a synonym  for a word I'm probably not going to say on this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, that's why I use that word instead of any other ones.  Bloggers are this was the other kind of big news of the week.  Bloggers are now under the watchful eye of the Federal Trade Commission.  This terrifies me.  Does it? How come?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really? Because because now I'm in that boat.  Like, Paola. Well, well, no, no.  But like I am compensated by my sponsors.  And now when I want to talk up how great Squarespace is, by the way,  Squarespace is a sponsor of Scam School, which pays Brian Brushwood.  You know, it's like it's like I'm affected by that.  Now I can't say necessarily what I love.  I have to go back in my mental Rolodex and say, well, I don't know.  Am I being compensated by them in any way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Even if you're being compensated by them, isn't there like an ad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there is an ad, there is an ad.  But like when I'm when I Twitter about Squarespace,  hey, everyone, check out my new Squarespace page.  Do you have to say every single time that you're by the letter of law,  you have to disclose.  Same thing with Audible.  I just said how much I love Audible, how I don't read many books  in physical media anymore because I'm too busy doing audiobooks.  Oh, wait, no, Audible is not a sponsor.  Yeah. So anyway, I love I love audio books.  I mean, they're not as possible to be personally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The there was a pretty good interview with the with with one of the principles  that the FTC is like, look, everybody's freaking out,  which is what the blogosphere does best. Right.  And he's you know, basically what he said is the scumbag rules in effect.  You know what I mean? If if this the law was applied to people who were like,  you know, people who go out of their people who are not, you know,  you know, the most amazing thing about the Ford is that it's so wonderful  and it's so this and it's so that and it's so, you know, I mean,  and they want the blogger to basically be like, yeah, Ford gave me this car.  You know, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I hate that defense because it's so it's it's the Patriot Act defense.  It's like, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, stop, stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  On you. This is not the Patriot Act.  The Patriot Act is one of the most scumbaggy, weasely,  sad and pathetic pieces of art.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's pick a different one.  It's the seatbelt law defense then.  Oh, we're not going to pull you over for not wearing your seatbelts.  We're just going to if we pull you over and we see that you don't have your seatbelt on.  Well, then we'll give you a ticket.  You know, it's only we're not going to pull you over for that one thing.  Whatever it is, whenever you use it, it's a slippery slope.  And especially when you deal with government, I really dislike anything  that has the little asterisk saying, but we're not really going to enforce it  the way it says we won't misuse this.  It's like this is how it begins. I don't like where I don't like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, so basically bloggers and people on the Internet should be able  and marketing, more importantly, marketing companies should be able  to take advantage of all of the online media out there to sell whatever they want,  however they want by pretending they are whoever they want to pretend  they are being honest on the interwebs.  And there should be no recourse for the protection of consumers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I'll not fool.  I'll not fall for your debate, Tom.  Foolery, my friends.  I'll avoid that trap.  The point is, is like by the letter of the law, what it says,  I don't have eleven thousand dollars laying around.  And I hate the idea that now that I'm, you know, my little tiny  square inch of the public spotlight, I have to be careful about what I say  as a result of this law. It's driving me nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that is totally reasonable.  It is totally reasonable to say, look, you have a duty at the minimum  to just be honest with people, that if you're talking about a product because  and it's not I, I really don't believe that it's going to come down to like  you mentioned Squarespace and you actually personally like them.  And they also happen to be a sponsor.  It's more like if if Squarespace gave you ten free accounts, right?  If there was not an ad for them on your page, if they just said,  here's ten free accounts.  No reason.  And then you talk about how you know, or flat out said, and some companies have  some companies have really said, here's a free car.  Please talk about it.  You know, I mean, I think I think that these are the kinds of rules  that could actually protect protect bloggers.  Like there was a big thing about mommy bloggers a couple years ago.  And it's it has been ongoing since where that became a really big lucrative  segment of the blogging population.  And all of a sudden, these mommy bloggers were getting inundated with free stuff.  And it was predatory.  I mean, they didn't know any better.  They're not journalists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think that they were a lot of journalists don't know any better, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A lot of journalists don't know any better either.  Exactly. But I think on the one hand, it can protect bloggers from being used  by companies who are saying, like, we want to use you for free publicity.  And then on the other hand, I don't think there's anything wrong with basically  saying you shouldn't be allowed to lie to the people who trust and like to read you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I totally agree. I don't have a problem with this at all.  I mean, this is a disclosure has always been, you know, something that I've tried  to do all the time. I don't think there's anything wrong with saying, you know,  I really like this thing.  And I know, by the way, they've paid me, you know, junkets, review units,  all these things. I don't know.  I think I think it's I think it's I think it's a good thing.  I don't I don't have a problem with it.  I think everybody should be doing it anyway.  And I don't I don't have any problem with it being laid out in the law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's a best effort kind of thing.  I don't think you have to be that scared.  Although Brian maybe should be terrified.  I was about to say he's he's the guy who's going to deliver our next ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everyone in the chat room has been wondering what this card I was handed  just says, and it says, should we'll do audible platinum ad,  as I was warned five minutes ago.  But it's true. You know, I mean, it's like I guess it goes back.  It ties the room together real nicely, not unlike a certain rug.  But the you know, I don't read a lot of physical books.  I'm glad you enjoy that.  And and I don't because I'm doing audio books all the time.  I'm on the road 200 days out of the road.  And I I chew through books because I do it all the time.  I do it while I'm doing chores around the house, while I'm waiting in line  for the TSA to to manhandle me, except I take it out for TSA because you have to  while I'm on the plane, while I'm driving.  It's this is all downtime.  This is when my brain would normally be in screensaver mode.  But instead, I'm able to experience all the best books out there.  And in fact, I'm like Leo because Leo talks about he makes it sound like,  you know, he's the only crazy guy that listens to so many books per month.  I'm right up there with them.  And that's why we're talking about the platinum edition, the platinum audible  at audible dot com slash twit to twit to you got to add the two in there.  And it looks like how many you get two free audio books to try it out  or one gigundo mega sized book as well.  And in fact, that's what I'm going to recommend because I am knee deep.  And I mentioned it earlier a little while ago.  I'm actually I'd never heard of Peter, Peter F.  Hamilton, but I started reading Pandora's Star, which takes place  300 years in the future, where in this it's this it's kind of like  I don't know, it's a really neat world to sink your eyes into or your your mental  your your picture to picture yourself in, because it's a world where every  60 or 70 years, people go and they get a tune up.  And essentially they reset their body back to 20 years old.  So as a result, you have this kind of epic tale that takes years and years.  I don't want to spoil too much about it.  It starts off so random and so bizarre.  But by the time it's over, you've experienced such an epic story  that I'm actually on to the second series that takes place a thousand years after that.  And it actually has some of the same characters from the first one.  Pandora's Star is the first one is called the Commonwealth Saga.  You can choose it at audible dot com slash twit to as one of your books  on the platinum plant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I sense a kindle impulse by in my my future personally.  It's big. It's a long one.  Maybe you can email me about that later.  All right, let's do the let's do the wrap up real quick so that we don't get  accused of doing an overlong twit, even though it's kind of short by twit standards.  It is kind of short.  I'm skipping ahead, though, because I just frankly I only want to talk about  Ralph Lauren going after Boing Boing because of the Photoshop model.  This is my favorite story of the entire week and possibly the year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it doesn't get really good until you see the picture because I read it  and I'm on a slow connection at this hotel.  And so I'm actually reading the story and then halfway through the story,  the picture shows up to my right and alone in my hotel room.  I burst out laughing because I could not believe I thought for sure this was a joke  that somebody had. I thought that the end of this was going to be that was a bogus  story because there's no way this cartoon stick figure could ever be thought to be  intended as a real person human.  But then apparently it was they copped to it.  They admitted, yeah, that's supposed to be a person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Did you guys that made it through its editorial process?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's yeah, it's. I was utterly dumbfounded and I think Zenni Jardin had maybe the  best headline of the year, too, when she originally wrote it up.  And she said something about like they're they're now selling they.  Oh, Ralph Lauren has opened up a new store in the uncanny valley.  Right. That's exactly what it is.  Like get that girl a Webby just for that, because it doesn't look like some sort of  terrifying Android creature.  And she just she said it showed up originally on what is a terrible Photoshop  dot com or the Photoshop disasters.  And it was this ad where they had retouched this woman to the point where, as  Zenni put it, dude, her head's bigger than her pelvis.  It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like somebody in the chat room described her as looking like the the alien at the  end of Close Encounters of the Third Kind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See, and then her one hand is like almost gone.  And then it is really just it couldn't look less natural.  But so then rather than cop to it originally, though, and this is where the  story gets super awesome.  Ralph Lauren came after Boing Boing and accused them of, oh, everybody's favorite  club for the stupid copyright infringement.  Yes. For reprinting the ad.  Yeah. They said you reprinted our intellectual property when you were making fun of  this terrible editorial work that we've done here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. And place that we placed in a public forum.  And now we're shocked, shocked that you're discussing it in a public forum.  The horror. The horror.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But they did eventually. What, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's such it's just such a great story.  It was just delicious. Everybody just kept getting better and better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I know. I agree.  And I do that. Frankly, I can't stop looking at the picture.  I want to move on and finish up, but I just can't.  It's hypnotic. Try to look away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They did that model. I'd be pissed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know, wouldn't you?  Well, I'm sorry. You know what?  I wonder how she felt before the controversy.  I wonder if she looked like that, looked at that and just kind of went, all right,  whatever. Or if and if she feels different now that it's sort of a big hubbub kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wonder, I wonder.  I want to meet her in person and just see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what? That's the real twist at the end of this story.  Ralph Lauren comes out like, sorry, that's no Photoshop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's funny, though, it's like, OK, her her pelvis  is at an angle to the camera.  It's probably about 30, 40 degrees long.  Her chest and her head is directly facing the camera.  She's probably like five, 10 and 120 pounds, which is I used to I used to work  in a part of Manhattan that was basically rife with modeling agencies and  photographers lofts up in the Flatiron district.  And it was kind of, you know, you know, being a squat little punk rock guy  wearing his dad's leather jacket and a pair of red Keds surrounded by people  wearing Armani suits back when Armani suits were a status symbol and not a punchline.  And in models like walking to agencies, you could really feel like  I'm small and squat and ugly and everyone else is wearing nice clothes.  And this is how you wanted to look at what you're saying.  I don't think I know. I've never really gone into the looking like a weird

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Brooke Shields. You want to be the meatball on a noodle.  That was your look you were going for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wanted to one of those beautiful suits in a pair of, you know,  two thousand dollar handcrafted shoes, or at least not to look, you know,  like the one guy in the neighborhood that couldn't afford a really expensive car.  You know, I have since obviously matured.  I now live in hoodies and shorts and and I am much happier for it.  But the I don't know, man, I don't know.  It's modeling in general is filled with people who are anatomically bizarre  compared to the most of the population.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Come on. True. There are limits.  I mean, that's totally true.  Although there are limits there.  I definitely seen the people that you're talking about where you question  how they could even exist, really. But this is like terrifying.  Anyway, Ralph Lauren did eventually cave to the fairly obvious argument  that, in fact, that was not copyright infringement.  And are you crazy? And then said, OK, you're right.  As it turns out, we have learned we have learned we have learned  that we are responsible for the poor imaging and retouching  that resulted in a very distorted image of a woman's body.  Not like not like I don't even think you need to worry about little girls  seeing this and feeling like they, you know, they need to lose weight.  I think you have to worry about them seeing this and having nightmares.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, what do they say?  Like they even went all the way around and said the very distorted image.  It wasn't even like, what? She's too thin for you guys.  You know, they acknowledge like, yeah, that's a that's a freak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have I've got a friend who is a counselor and a dietician  that works with children with eating disorders.  And, you know, when when you talk to somebody who deals day in and day out  with teenagers and younger who have completely destroyed  any normal relationship they have with their body image,  you know, because of, you know, them wanting to be the advertising  or some extreme distorted version of it as it gets filtered through their psyche.  You know what I mean? Like on one hand, like, you know, kiss my ass, Ralph.  And I mean, you know, yeah, it's more of a shopping  use of beating it. But it's but it's the entire industry.  It's it's Hollywood.  It's it's the expectations everybody has.  And it's it's brutal to anybody who doesn't exactly fit into that for a lot of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a bummer that it takes a case like this.  Like it's a bummer that Ralph Lauren actually did this on purpose,  because otherwise this is a great topic of discussion to bring about  about how ridiculous the imagery is that they're putting out there. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So three cheers for Dove Soap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that was the best viral video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's good stuff. I know. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm thinking of the print the print ads they did on all the bus stops  and stuff for around here.  And it was interesting to watch people react to that, like, you know,  though she's not very skinny and it's just like, well, yeah,  it's the whole point of the ad, dude.  It's like irony. And you're just living that.  No, that don't seem right to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That billboard. Not sure why.  All right. I think we're going to call it there.  And I am really excited about that. OK, well, first,  I promised that I would do this earlier.  And now here we go. It's pimping time. Yeah.  Brian Brushwood, what are you working on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What am I pimping? I'm pimping Scam School, the only show dedicated  to social engineering at the bar and on the street at ScamSchool.tv  and my little weekly train wreck at the BBLiveShow.com. Terrible, terrible show.  Nobody should watch it at BBLiveShow.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Your first elevator pitch is a lot better than your second.  I'm not telling lie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But my second is a lot more honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gina, you've had the whole show to prepare.  What are you pimping?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am pimping my other Twitch show that I co-host with Jeff Jarvis and Leo  when he gets back this week in Google.  It airs on Saturdays at 2.15 p.m. Pacific Time.  So you can catch it here.  And I'm also disclosing all of my sponsorships at SmarterWear.org  where I blog when I'm feeling when I'm feeling good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What do you do when you're feeling bad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I Twitter run for the dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't blog.  I accept gifts in exchange for positive blogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tekzilla.Tekzilla.com with the fabulous Veronica Belmont.  We're the Mickey Mouse Club for Geeks, except I didn't say Mickey Mouse  because then Disney would sue me.  So we're an enthusiast for technology. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's why you're so wedded to DVDs right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I'm wedded actually to something.  Something I double checked, right?  You know, Netflix has 12 million subscriptions  and there are something like 60, 70, 80 million households with DVD players out there.  You know what I mean? It wasn't until 2006 that that there were more homes  with DVD players in them than than than VCRs.  So wow.  Option curve, you guys got to remember the consumer adoption curve is very,  very slow for most of the most of the world, or at least the United States.  Anyhow, revision3.com.  Such a nation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nice. I was like, oh crap, I accidentally reopened a discussion.  What was I thinking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll never get out of here, Molly.  We're all going to die.

It's kind of like the daily show for technology news.  And I have a new show called CNET Conversations, because every time I'm on,  Leo goes, what are you doing that's new?  And it makes me feel like a loser.  This time I have a new show called CNET Conversations, where myself  and a colleague from News.com interview a really important person in technology.
