Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Christmas is interesting like a stick in your eye.  It's so freaking interesting that it might make you cry.  Mr. Hodgman.  Hello.  Hi, how are you, John?  Good, how are you, Lydia?  Very well.  Oh, I am so grateful for your gift.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, did it arrive?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, it did.  I thought we all thought it was going to be a book, a copy of your fine book, more information  than you ever thought.  You mean you don't have several copies already?  Well, as it turned out, I do.  So I was so grateful that you didn't send me yet another copy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, that would be garbage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like the picture on the cover though, the ferret.  Was that a real live ferret?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, obviously.  I didn't think I would fake something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It doesn't really look taxidermy since it's so relaxed in your hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, only the finest taxidermists can get that relaxed pose.  This was a real ferret.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You did not fear the nibble?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think I can handle it.  Don't they bite?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't they have sharp teeth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ferrets?  They were used to catch rats.  They're weasley creatures because they are members of the weasel family.  But this was a lovely animal, a lovely creature, very musky smelling.  It runs up and down your sleeve very easily.  It's a good way to warm yourself on a winter night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've heard there are people who actually put ferrets down their pants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was just going to say, I wasn't going to do that.  It used to be on a cold night, people would take 10 or 12 ferrets, just dump them into  their coat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, go ahead.  I know where you're going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I do too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I'll let you go there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, no.  It's all you, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the expression as you were about to say, a 10 ferret night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, exactly.  Boy, you read my mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Great minds.  Well, we both went to the same fine educational institution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As did Colton, who was calling me, but I'm going to call him.  And I called him earlier and he rejected me.  Let's see if he'll accept that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's a prickly fellow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You guys, were you roommates or just friends?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just friends.  He lived a few floors below me.  You were in the same?  Phelps Hall.  Oh my God, there he is.  You were in Phelps.  No, no, no, I wasn't saying anything about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was in Durfee.  Oh really?  Yeah.  Durfee Hall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh yeah, I remember that one.  Durfee is across from, yeah, it's on the other side.  Phelps Gate.  Right.  If I remember correctly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Phelps is where the women first stayed when they let women into Yale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I had a co-educational bathroom.  Yeah, see.  There were two suites and they were connected by a bathroom.  And our suite was a male suite and the other suite was a female suite.  And so we shared a bathroom, which was quite a progressive thing to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, think about it.  It was a scant 10 years before that women were allowed to actually go through the gate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And oh, the scrapes we got into.  It became the sitcom Three's Company, actually.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jonathan Colton is also on the line.  Also, are you both in Brooklyn?  Yes we are.  And you're probably within feet of each other and yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, Jonathan lives in the north part of Park Slope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do people still play stickball in Brooklyn?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not people like us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No heaven for fans.  What does that mean, Jonathan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I assume you're asking about poor people, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, my dad played stickball when he grew up in New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I don't see stickball particularly.  That is the great old game.  Jonathan Lethem in his book Fortress of Solitude talked about all sorts of old Brooklyn games  that they would play with pinky balls and ground up broken glass.  That was another game they played.  Pull a child down the street.  That sort of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we did not do any preparation for this and true to my tradition, I have no idea where  we're going with this or anything.  But I just thought it'd be kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just like the holidays themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it fits in, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so.  Did you get the eggnog?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have the requisite eggnog.  Do you have eggnog?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I do.  Jonathan, do you have eggnog?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have eggnog as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Fantastic.  That's all that matters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're all happily nogged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Suddenly it's a holiday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why drinking something that is thick and sweet would make this a holiday?  It's very strong.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Potion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, do you have alcoholic eggnog?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  Can you tell?  Sometimes you can't tell with eggnog.  It all tastes alcoholic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The trick is to use alcoholic eggs.  Those are the best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, I've saved this.  I deferred opening the gift.  Jonathan, you didn't send me a gift.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You haven't opened it yet.  I sent.  Yes, Jonathan, did you send Leo a gift?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is from both of us, Leo.  Oh, thank you.  It's not from both of us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it was so kind of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You shouldn't have.  I paid for most of it.  It was John's idea, but I paid for most of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  First of all, I have to observe that it is wrapped in butcher paper.  And tied with twine.  It's a steak.  It could be a steak.  I have to say it's a little bit given away by the sticker on the front.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which says what it is, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I scarce can believe my eyes that it's what it says it is.  So I guess I'll open this and we'll see if it really is what it says it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll give the listeners a hint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Aside from it saying what it is, it also says it is 100% acrylic.  And then it warns, do not eat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You might be tempted to because it is in fact a bacon scarf.  Yes.  Oh, so festive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not a scarf made of bacon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A scarf that resembles bacon.  Which is my preference because it's much less greasy on your neck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was going to say a scarf made of bacon doesn't have much warming effect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it depends.  If the bacon is hot, it does.  Yeah, exactly.  It also has horrible disfiguring burning effect too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, but you taste good for days.  Well, so we thought we'd do a kind of an unusual tweet.  Not really talk about tech news at all, but in fact celebrate the holiday season.  The days are getting shorter and the weather is getting a little nippy.  We've all got eggnog, so that can only mean one thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's holiday time.  It's that time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did I guess right?  You guessed very good.  Congratulations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I had a feeling that's where you were going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was trying to think of a joke, but actually I thought maybe sometimes if you don't have  a joke, the truth will out.  It's just a good way to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That is my policy typically.  Just tell the truth and usually it's hilarious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In fact, is how the books came about, I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you know that nog is part of the name for the word noggin, a Middle English phrase  used to describe a small wooden carved mug?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It describes the vessel as opposed to the drink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I suppose that's why a head was referred to as a noggin as well.  If you had an empty head, you had a noggin for a head.  How interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I found out probably from the same source that you're using right now, I suspect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm using the Encyclopedia Britannica 1922 edition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what I thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the only one you can trust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Subsequent editions were absolutely polluted by.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By vandalism because anyone could write in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And also by modernity.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Modernity is polluting.  The piggy bank also, interestingly enough, refers to the vessel, not the pig.  It was a...  A pig was a ceramic vessel that you...  PYGG.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that makes a lot of sense because that's a salt pig.  Do you know what a salt pig is?  It's a piece of crockery.  Oh, I've lost you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No you haven't.  Are you there?  I'm still here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can hear him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to tell you, Jonathan, this happens every time I talk to John on Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think he's making it up, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He thinks I'm gone.  But thank goodness you're here this time to prove that it isn't me, it's him, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hello, I'm back.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He is back.  What happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What were you saying about me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nothing.  What happened?  Why did you go away and why did you come back?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I'll tell you, I went to synchronize my cellular telephone and that caused some...  Caused my headphones to mute.  You did that in the middle of a twit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, he did.  Admit it.  It's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Admit it.  It's crazy.  You can't go syncing your iPhone right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, how do you know I have an iPhone?  Although I hear they are fantastic, by the way.  I hear they're wonderful products.  I might get one for Christmas for somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wouldn't that be nice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  What did you say while I was away?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Merely that this happened to you, it happened to me the last time I talked to you, you would  just every once in a while would say, are you there?  And would disappear.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's actually...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the problem is I'm being visited by ghosts while we speak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Also it's your habit to sync your iPhone every five minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, yes.  You never know what might be unsynced in real life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I confess to doing that as a matter of fact.  So I'm looking in the Oxford English Dictionary.  This is the 1928 edition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's acceptable.  Borderline, but acceptable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a little bit of modernity might have crept in, but not much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And what does it say on there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A pig is a type of orange clay used for making pottery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  So what I was saying before I went away is a salt pig is a kind of ceramic container  where you keep salt when you're cooking.  Perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  None of this having anything to do with the animal.  So it's just sort of, I guess that followed.  They said this is a piggy bank.  Hey, some marketing genius said, hey, let's make it shaped like a pig too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well get ready for this.  This could be an eerie coincidence or it could be proof that aliens in fact did cause evolution  to happen in the planet Earth.  Strangely enough, the Indonesian term, Selangong, is also used in the context of domestic banks  Selangong is a wild boar.  So the etymology of piggy bank in both English and Indonesian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, wow.  Completely separate linguistic development.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or alien invasion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's true.  You'd be the judge.  Obviously aliens.  But in Indonesia, they don't use the term piggy bank.  They use the term alien head bank because they keep their money in crystal skulls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ah, the crystal skull once again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Surprised you did not know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, do you have some crystal skull?  Did you get some?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I gave, you know, I gave in the spirit of the holidays, I gave my crystal head vodka  away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I had a few sips of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I remember your review on Boing Boing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was given to me.  It was given to me by my book editor, Mr. Sean McDonald, who had ordered it, I think  quasi legally from California.  It's not for sale in New York as of yet.  I don't believe.  Oh really?  I shipped to him quasi legally and I enjoyed it and I sipped some of it so that I might  do a taste test for it for Boing Boing.  I enjoyed it quite a bit.  But then I had lunch with my fond acquaintance, Mr. Christopher McCullough, also known as  Jackson Public, creator of the Venture Brothers cartoon, which features a lot of skulls in  it.  He was very excited about crystal head vodka and he told me he had been looking for it  and looking for it and looking for it.  I put it in my messenger bag and brought it to lunch and gave it to him.  So now I'm on the hunt for some more.  In California, when Jonathan and I performed together in Los Angeles last month, I put  on Twitter, please, if anyone can find some crystal head vodka, bring it to the show.  It is quite available in California apparently because I think we got four or five bottles

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In a way that was too much crystal head.  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It just enhanced the psychic resonance of the entire evening I was receiving.  I was receiving messages from all over the solar system at that point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Once you drain the head of vodka, do you keep the skull?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You smash it in the fireplace, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What you do is after you drain the crystal skull of vodka, you put it into a crate and  then you walk it down into a storehouse full of identical crates.  You slowly wheel it down and hide it among the other crates.  All your other rare artifacts and mystical items.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See there's a real flaw in that logic because it's so heavily magnetized.  That you just...  Exactly.  Exactly so.  It just doesn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's so heavily magnetized that you...  Oh boy, I really don't want to talk about that.  No, enough.  I would just get so upset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You guys...  One of the reasons I want to get you guys on is first of all, I think people who don't  realize that John Hodgman, who is very well known from his appearance in the fabulous  movie Baby Mama.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's correct.  Primarily well known for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think mostly that's where people might have seen you or maybe because of your fabulous  books, two of them now, the areas of my expertise followed by basically a clone, more information  than you require minus the hobo names.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I prefer the term an augmented continuation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dyr's sequel.  And by the way, in bookstores now and makes a fine holiday gift.  But you and Jonathan Coulton, best known for many wonderful songs such as Christmas on  Chiron Beta Prime and Code Monkey, were friends at college and have remained friends ever  since except for that period in the 90s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, the period in the 90s when we did not speak to one another because I grew a better  beard than Jonathan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's all about the whiskers.  It was a very nice beard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was an incredible beard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then it still makes me angry to think about how you grew that beard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know, I'm sorry.  But you know what, Jonathan?  Look, it's been a long time.  It's water under the bridge now.  It's the holidays.  I'm going to tell you something.  The beard was fake.  Are you kidding me?  That wasn't even a real beard?  No.  In fact, I'm kind of surprised that you thought it was a real beard because all I did was  just steal a beard off a New York City corner of Santa Claus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, was it long white, long white, white, bushy beard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was 100% acrylic.  I warn you, do not eat it.  And it didn't match my hair at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did think the color was unusual now that you mention it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I thought I thought it was a joke between us.  I thought that, you know, I came to go see you play at McGovern's that night at the open  mic night back when you were just starting out when you were, when no one would come  to see you except me and my crazy fake Santa beard.  And I wore that just to make you think that someone else was coming to hear you sing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He had two fans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  So you thought so one with a beard and one without.  Because I would sit there and I would listen and I would drink my, my nog, of course.  And then I would say, Oh, Jonathan, before you play this next song, I'm going to go to  the bathroom.  Go put on the fake Santa beard and come sit out.  This is going to be my big present to you, like to surprise you.  Like, oh, look, there's a guy with a with a great big beard.  And I just go back and forth like that.  But you realized it was me and you thought I was growing a beard in the bathroom every  time.  Then you got very angry about it.  And I didn't know how to explain to you it's fake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, now, now I feel bad for two reasons.  One, because I obviously misunderstood your intentions.  And two, because you're telling me that the falling out we had for several years in the  90s was based on a misunderstanding that you just never chose to clear up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just didn't know how to tell you until now.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I can see it is complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now I realize now I realize the best way to tell you was to simply explain what I had  done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  And see here we see again how hilarious the truth is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know it's another it's another lesson for the holidays.  This is a time when people come together and put aside old, old arguments and old fake  schemes and remind themselves why they like one another.  So I'm sorry, Jonathan.  Well, I'm sorry, too.  I'm actually I'm currently wearing a fake beard right now and I'm going to take it off.  I feel bad about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just this is exactly what I was hoping for in the spirit of the holiday we could have  in a special holiday edition of twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is.  There's going to be a lot of a lot of heartwarming grievances aired.  Yeah, a lot of a lot of warmth exchanged in a lot of survive.  Spirit gum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Spirit gum.  That's probably where the name came from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's the spirit come of the season.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you guys went out on book tour together when John's new book came out.  More information than you require.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Published by Dutton and for the previous book.  Oh, that's neat.  And it was when we were on book tour that I that I requested the Crystal Head vodka.  And not only did I get four or five or I guess I should say we get four or five bottles of  the Crystal Head vodka, one of them was signed by its creator, Mr. Dan Aykroyd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Someone had gone, you know, because it is Dan Aykroyd's private label of vodka, the  Crystal Head vodka.  And a fellow had had very kindly had brought it.  His brother owns a liquor store and Dan Aykroyd was signing bottles and he got one and he  brought it and he gave it to me, but I could not accept it.  I could not accept such a gift.  There are some gifts you cannot accept, which is another thing about about the holidays  you have to realize.  Some gifts are too generous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is well, should I do you want the bacon scarf back because a little bit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's kind of what I'm saying.  Yeah.  OK, I regret it.  I'll pack it right up and keep it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo, it's it's it's from both of us and I say that you keep it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll send a half to him and keep the other half.  It'll be a short bacon scarf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But if you were to do that, you would have to send me a little bit more than half because  I paid for most of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So now I know that Mr.  Colton appears on the audio recording of the areas of my expertise singing  furry old rock lobster and performing behind the 700 hobo names.  Yes. Does he have a will he have in the audio recording, which I'm sure is  imminent of more information than you require?  Will he have a place there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, certainly, I hope so.  But it depends on what his what his schedule allows, Jonathan.  Are you planning to between the tour of South Africa and then the Indonesian  Crystal Head Biggie Bank Tour 2009?  I think the 700 mole man names really will need a soundtrack, frankly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's the problem, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We haven't been able to figure out what soundtrack, you know, with the 700 hobo  names, it was obvious.  Big Rock Candy Mountain is the famous old hobo song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How many times did you have to play that over and over to match?  I have never counted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, however long I've been able to play that.  I don't know. I've never counted how many iterations there were, but there were  there were many. It was it was quite I have to say I did not expect it to be as  as physically taxing as it was.  But by the end of it, my you know that feeling when you come home from the grocery  store and you've been carrying heavy bags and your fingers are all.  Yeah. Notted up.  Now, I don't know that feeling.  Well, John doesn't know.  I know he has very soft hands because he's never done it.  Honest, I have work and I have my groceries delivered by orphans. Yeah.  But that's how I felt at the end of it.  I was all I had to like a claw on my left hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you did you scream at the end of the recording session?  I've got blisters on me fingers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I should have. That would have been good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Was it it was an opportunity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I actually I made that reference in a blog post.  I was just thinking of this the other day.  I made that reference in a blog post.  I was complaining about how I had been playing guitar a lot.  And then I did that.  I said that sentence with an exclamation point.  And I got a lot of comments that were like, oh, sorry to hear about your blisters.  Oh, jeez.  I feel like nobody.  Everybody takes me very seriously online.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're a jokester.  And it's time people finally realize that it should be clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. You know, without the context of the sound of your voice,  it may be hard that you're making a joke when you say, I've got blisters on me  fingers because people presume that you're you're maimed in some way  and you suddenly started talking like a sailor.  And I don't know. They don't know your whole life history.  They don't know that you grew up in Colchester, Connecticut,  and went to Yale with me and that we then moved to New York and worked,  you know, day jobs very near each other.  And we tried to convince one another to  quit our day jobs and do something more creative with our lives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You were a literary agent.  Jonathan was a programmer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's correct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you but were you both did you commiserate?  Did you gather and say, why are we doing these stupid things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would just say to Jonathan, why are you doing this?  Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that makes more sense, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I didn't. Yeah.  What I I'm a professional literary agent.  This is fantastic. You were doing quite well. Yeah.  Yes. I was doing well.  But I remember, you know, did you actually represent?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you actually represent anybody?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, I did.  I represented the novelist Darren Strauss, who wrote Chang and Eng,  the novel about the Siamese twins for whom the term Siamese twin was coined.  Right. I represented the the famous B movie actor, Bruce Campbell,  star of the Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2 and the third Evil Dead movie,  Army of Darkness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So so really, Jonathan also was commiserating with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I was I was working through my my my own dissatisfaction  and with my life that I was afraid to admit to myself  by telling Jonathan everything he was doing was wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John has John has to get to me.  Yeah, John frequently uses me as a he he he tells me to do the things  that he really wants himself to do.  That is that has happened many times in the past.  It was. Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You were earlier. It's a it's like you're my guinea pig.  That's all. Yeah. Yeah.  My friend and my guinea pig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But in those days, we would frequently we would frequently.  I feel like as our group of friends would always say to each other, why?  Why? We have a lot of talented people doing creative things.  Why don't we just do a thing altogether?  And then right.  And then we'd have another beer and it would be late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So who who did it first?  Who left the mainstream first?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, Jonathan. Yeah.  Jonathan would not take my advice and quit his job with no prospects.  So you had to.  I ended up leaving first and started writing for magazines.  I had already been writing for magazines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, this is where the bacon scarf comes in, because you you  at least one of your articles that I you said kindly sent me a clipping of  was about fried fair food.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes. Almost all of my articles were about fried fair food in one way or another.  Oh, interesting.  But my first job after being a professional literary agent  was to write a food, a food and drink  and non wine alcohol column for Men's Journal magazine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why not wine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I find wine to be very confusing.  Too hard to buy booze simple.  Too hard to. Well, it is comparatively simple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's either brown or clear.  Unless it's like you're talking like Paranoia and it's kind of slightly green.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then you add water to it and it becomes cloudy and murky  like it has a terrible secret it wants to hide.  Oh, are you are you are you pleased that absinthe has returned to the market?  Well, insofar as I am glad all hysteria finally  falls away and we return to reason and we realize that we're not all going  to cut off our ears just because we drink absinthe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wormwood. Wormwood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's just mass hysteria.  Yeah, it was mass hysteria.  It's the same reason that red M&Ms were banned for a while.  And also Nichols.  Really? Yeah.  Oh, you don't remember in 1978, everyone became convinced that Nichols were cursed.  And they outlawed them.  They didn't make them until 1984.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nichols. That's because George Washington said,  and I always thought this looked a little bit like a crystal skull.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You mean Thomas Jefferson's head, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Whoever, whatever. Yeah, that guy. Oh, boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I guess we know who's the numismatist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm just going to say we've got a closet numismatist in our midst.  And you try saying that three times fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I refuse to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you ever collect coins?  Either one of you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My uncle passed down a collection of pennies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A collection, maybe not a collection, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, no, they were in folders.  They were in folders and everything, including the wartime steel pennies.  Oh, because copper.  The thing I said about Nichols is obviously not true.  What? But the copper was apparently useful for the making of  bullets and airplanes and guns and so that and wire.  And so they they stopped making copper pennies for a while.  Instead, they made them out of steel.  Hmm. That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Instead, they made them out of Nichols.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They made them out of Nichols and they made dollars out of marble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hard to fold up in that in that money clip, but much more durable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was I'm sorry, hinged marble.  Oh, all right.  They were there. It was very handy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How many how many pennies did you have in that collection?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it wasn't it was just given to me by my uncle and I never know.  I know it was like a hundred pennies or.  Yeah, a hundred dollars worth.  It was dollars, dollars worth of dollars worth of pennies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had I had a coin collection that was passed  passed to me as well from my from my grandfather.  I don't think it was a particularly serious collector,  but there were was there were a few silver dollars in there  and some some rare Nichols and things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did they come to you in a paper bag?  Was that the hint that he wasn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  wasn't that serious?  No, they came in a purple velvet case.  They were all very carefully laid away.  Their cases, it was it was kind of I enjoyed it.  I never I never expanded the collection at all.  But I there was a book I used to look up what their value was  and sort of rubbed my hands gleefully over the 16 dollars  that I was going to collect when I finally decided to go to a coin  collecting convention and sell those suckers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're all now they're all now worth about a one millionth of a euro.  Yeah, exactly.  Well, isn't it where those things are?  Would you know where those coins are right now?  You know, I couldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I couldn't put my hands on them immediately.  My my best guess would be in the in the attic of my childhood home.  This is the holiday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, there's some some gifts become a kind of burden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. See holiday lesson number three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm glad someone's numbering them because I don't have time for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you've done enough numbering in your fine book.  More information than you require.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that was smooth.  Leo, thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jonathan, when you and and John go out on tour, by the way, have just  I want to get a little topical.  Twitter is an only very topical show.  Have you seen the video of President Bush dodging the shoe?  No, I don't think I have.  So it's on CNN.  They've been running it over and over all day.  Apparently, President Bush has visited Iraq as farewell to Iraq.  Somebody and gave a press conference, somebody in the press conference  took off both his shoes and shied them at the president's head.  But the thing that's most remarkable, first of all, the aim was excellent.  The president was very nimble and dodged both.  With a quick truck. Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, he's very physically fit. Very physically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was it was remarkable.  I don't think I can think of any president in living memory  who would have been able to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, shoe ducking is a big sport in Texas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, maybe that's why he had practice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you're isn't it duck shoeing?  Sorry, my mistake. You can't shoe a duck.  That's why it's a sport.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm watching the I'm watching the video now.  You see, see what I'm saying?  Right. So he's shaking a hand and here it comes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look at how fast, how quick his reflexes are.  Whoa, there's one. Yep.  Dramatic. Do you know something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't find this amusing at all. No.  I think that that probably had to have been one of the most frightening moments.  Imagine terrifying.  And I don't wish not my candidate for president in either election.  I do not I would not wish for him to feel that he was about to be killed  at any given moment. No, absolutely not.  That scared him to death. And in fact, I mean, a terrible thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, a terrible thing.  I don't even like it when they hit him with a pie.  But but but but I couldn't help but note his agility.  And I don't I'm serious.  I don't think there's any president in living memory  who could have done what he did today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you think that he was a youth?  He was bitten by a radioactive cobbler.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He was really he was like, whoa, it just I mean, you know,  if if if ever I were to field a dodgeball team of former presidents,  he would be my first pick or a dodge shoe team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What? That's so strange.  Isn't that weird?  They must have ended the press conference immediately. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, no, that's what the other thing I find interesting.  If you watch the video is he stays there.  They wrestled the guy to the ground.  And I don't and I think that in future press conferences,  reporters will not be allowed to wear shoes. But  well, I think for security reasons, that's right.  Only sensible.  But but President Bush, it's interesting, stays at the podium  and and watches with interest as they as they wrestle.  He does not. And the Secret Service does not.  You would think the first thing that's what I find surprising

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that he was not hustled away immediately.  Yeah, that's kind of weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And isn't there isn't the Secret Service supposed to take the bullet?  If they can't if they're fast enough to take the bullet,  why can't they be fast enough to take the shoe?  Aren't they supposed to get in the way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, this this video raises more questions than it answers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the Zapruder tape of our time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that I think you actually raise a very interesting point.  What that's that seems like you was maybe set up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you think that was intentional shoe flinging?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know. I'm just saying I would be I would have a long  talking to with those Secret Service agents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, I suppose I suppose that they when they're  when they're in a room like that, I would guess that the security measures  are involved with keeping, you know, making sure there are no guns in the room.  And once they do that, they sort of.  Well, that's right.  That was a step away from that.  But they're not they're not they're not there to jump in front of shoes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm told by our chat room that, in fact, in Iraq, it is considered  a great insult to throw your shoes.  I mean, that's that is OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So there is a there is some sort of cultural precedent. Yeah.  That explains a lot.  Explains why people have been throwing shoes at me at my readings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do not go to Iraq.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My Iraqi, all the Iraqis who come to your readings show their shoes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So describe to me what this the readings involved lately.  What have what have you two worked up together?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Aside from me scamming bottles of Crystal Head Vodka off of audience members,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  which is certainly not something, you know, I mean, that's a valuable thing to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not. Oh, yes, absolutely.  Yeah, I I would.  I well, let's see what else what else would we do, Jonathan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't think of anything else.  I think just the vodka, wasn't it? Do you say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, so let me let me imagine the scene.  The store is jammed, crowded with thousands of fans,  some of them wearing zombie makeup or carrying strangely mutilated  unicorns, others in talking about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right now, you're talking about a Jonathan Colton concert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I've been to one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My fans are much more civilized than Jonathan's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I was saying the other half, it's like it's like a wedding.  There's your one half of the aisle is that the other half of the aisle.  They're wearing suits and their hair is are brilliant teamed  and they're and they're very orderly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A lot of a lot of a lot of chunky glasses, a lot of blazers. Yeah.  A lot of briefcases.  So do you a lot of ironic briefcases, a lot of a lot of high school kids,  a lot of high school boys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do people is because you guys, I think you're very well.  You're very well known for the The Daily Show,  but I think that the probably best known for the switch ads, the Apple switch ads.  Do people is there like a catchphrase?  Do they say they look at you and say, I'm a PC or.  They say, hey, PC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's say you say, yeah, that's I wouldn't call that a catchphrase.  Exactly. More of a greeting.  Hey, PC, yo. Yeah.  You know, people will.  I was in I was in Philadelphia last night at a wedding  and we went out after and at the bar, a couple of people came up to me  and said, are you I'm I'm a Mac or are you a Mac or a PC?  That's funny.  They make they make conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you watch their eyes glaze a little bit as they try to think of a clever  you know, way to say that and make some joke out of it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't look into their eyes because I'm afraid they're going to steal my brains.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Always a mistake. Always a mistake.  My father taught me that he said that's what I'm primarily concerned about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When people approach me on the street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, the two things my father taught me that I will never forget is  rummies have no wind.  So don't worry, you can outrun them.  I'm not kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Rummy's a big problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess apparently he had spent much time thinking about this.  So don't worry about rummies.  They have no wind.  And he also said never catch the eye of a hobo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What was?  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What is wrong?  Did your father? No, no, no.  I just mean to say, first of all, rummies have no wind.  And your father said, I got to give Leo some advice.  What's the most weird and poetic way I can put this?  Drunks can't run fast.  No, no, no. That's not good.  Rummy's rummies have no wind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's it.  And, you know, I've really carried this with me.  I'm not joking. This is something I've carried with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have a hobo and never during the Great Depression.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Leo. Well, he may not have called them hobos.  I don't know what they what do you call them nowadays?  You know, bums, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, a hobo is a very specific sort of subculture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's important. I think that's important.  People understand that they're hobo.  A bum is not all bums are hobos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I'm not when I refer to the hobos in in my previous book,  The Areas of My Expertise and talk about their attempt,  successful attempt to take over the United States government  for a brief period of time in the 30s.  I'm talking about a specific subculture of people  during the Great Depression who self-identified as hobos  and chose a life of wandering and drinking  and wearing the same pants all the time.  Not talking about the contemporary urban homeless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you at any point when you gave up the literary career  or the or John Jonathan, the programing career,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  consider life as a hobo? No, no, it doesn't sound very nice,  actually. Not anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's extremely dangerous, actually.  The train. I remember I remember when I was working  as a literary agent there, a lot of news came out  because there are still people who do ride the rail.  So it's much, much smaller community than it ever has been.  And someone was killing hobos.  I mean, there was a hobo serial. Wow.  So it's and you know, you fall off trains and then the bulls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The bulls. That's the name of the word I was looking for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The railroad police getcha. Yeah, the bulls.  I really, you know, and there's a new movement of sort of young  anarchist kids who, you know, self-identify as hobos  and will ride the rails.  And I'm talking like young teenagers and into their late teens.  And they're there, you know, I don't advise that to anybody.  Yeah, I think it's dangerous stuff. Yeah.  So that's my holiday gift to the youth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I think CNN is actually listening to this show  because now on CNN, they're discussing why the Secret Service  did not, in fact, block the shoe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And what is the what is the answer that is given?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They were in the back room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's not acceptable.  Oh, OK. Not an acceptable answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes. You know, and they and they and they're using a telestrator.  They're actually now we see we're chasing people off on the live version.  They're the numbers.  The audience numbers actually plummeting as people run to watch CNN.  But they're using a telestrator to show where the Secret Service was at the time.  And they all emerge from the back room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm going to watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. More eggnog while you while we while we consume this video.  And by the way, I would like a count of how many times  they've shown this on CNN because it seems to be in a continuous loop  for the last six hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have a little drinking game every time someone throws a press  shoe at a president, I drink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't drink much, do you?  Oh, but I guess if you were watching today, you'd be very.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know. You know, it's I devised that game,  so I would never have to drink.  And it's really, really bit me on the behind today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's so do you, Jonathan, do you sing songs when you do the book tour  or are you just there for moral support or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We still haven't answered your question.  I have a terrible. I don't mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't mind because we're known on all of these shows.  And I know you've never heard them, but if you'd ever have heard  any of our shows for digressions, we Merlin Man likes to call them rat holes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, you, unlike a rummy, have plenty of wind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You've been preparing that for some time, haven't you?  Did you not? Did you write it down?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, he wrote it down on parchment and calligraphy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have I have here I have here a piece of paper next to my computer  and it says possible callback.  Question marks under there, I've written rummy equals no wind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, in the chat room, they're telling me that these are bromides.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Bromides, bromides, these aphorisms, bromide after this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they're like aphorism.  A bromide is is a kind of a it kind of implies kind of an old chestnut,  you know, something that's been said many times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But are they saying it's bromide, such as look at us, we know the word bromide.  Or are they saying these are bromides that we have all heard before.  Your father, Leo, was not particularly original.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I think, in fact, that's not what they're saying.  I think let me let me scroll back and see as if they're just showing off

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that they know the word bromide.  I have to take issue with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's it's it's veremia.  He says, Leo, are you sure your father wasn't himself a rummy hobo  when he told you these bromides means a robo robo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'd be curious to know what other strategies your dad's father was.  Right. I was rummied.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He was terrified that there were  Leo, were there rummies and hobos in your neighborhood?  There must have been.  I don't think so.  I think your dad had a complex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I grew up in Providence, Rhode Island, which is not known for rummies or hobos.  There were quite a few mafia dons, maybe quite a few stuffies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Stuffies. What's that?  What you have stuffed clams in Rhode Island?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stuffies. We probably have another word for him,  because another thing about Rhode Island is that they have a different word  for everything than the rest of New England.  For instance, you know, you might call it a milkshake in Brooklyn.  A cabinet. It's a cabinet in Rhode Island.  How did you know that? You're absolutely right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know things. You're very smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You could call him a clam. We call him a quahog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What a terrible word.  It's no wonder we in Massachusetts conquered you people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you? Was there a was there a 100 year war between Massachusetts  and Rhode Island in which Rhode Island lost?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Rhode Island was formed, of course, by Roger Williams, who was chased  chased off by the Puritans for daring to want to treat Indians.  He was hit and compensate them for the land that was taken from them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to say, we do.  When I was growing up in Rhode Island in school, they make a point  of saying we're here because Massachusetts was intolerant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's true.  And child intolerant of Rhode Islanders, and we remain so.  So did you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you walk up now, would you would you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tiny microscopic state.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's small, but good when you walk up.  So you're Connecticut, Jonathan and John, you're Massachusetts.  Yes, right. And I'm Rhode Island.  So I don't believe Connecticut and Massachusetts have any.  You're winning winning winning for the most letters in the name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What? I don't know. In the New England Derby.  And the Northward State just best best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Most S's M.A.S.S.A.C.H.U.S.E.T.S.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, come on, guys.  Look, first of all, we all know Rhode Island is not going to win  the New England Derby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What? It's it's a it's a mascot.  Sidekick.  It's a mascot state. It's a sidekick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly. It's number two.  Is Rhode Island the state that has the actually has a super long name?  That is yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Rhode Island and Providence Plantations.  Is that official name?  The official name is the state.  I'm not sure the I'll have to Wikipedia it, but I know Providence  Plantations is in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's something like coffee milk growing up.  A lot of coffee milk. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How do you know about that?  Do you must have come over the border?  You must have once in a while snuck over the border.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was a spy.  I was a spy for the Massachusetts anti Rhode Island militia.  And I posed I posed for many years as a Rhode Islander.  And I came in  by slightly adjusting my cap to the left.  I looked like a Rhode Islander.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No beard involved or bacon scarf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I lived among you. No, no beard, no bacon scarf.  Just a just a nice coffee milk made with autocrat coffee syrup.  Wow. The only coffee syrup named for a dictatorial position.  Oh, but I used to I always I always I always preferred.  I always preferred dictator or benign despot coffee syrup.  But autocrat is the one that has become most popular.  We used to drink hegemony soda as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was hegemony soda.  Very fine brew.  Let me mention, since we are in the middle of a show  and one of these days, you guys are going to tell me  what you did at the book signings.  While you while you think about that and come up with that,  I do want to mention our fine sponsors, audible.com.  Do either of you listen to audio books at any time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, constantly. Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't have to say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If they're fine, I'm like all of the audible audio books.  Oh, you're mad.  Audible first released my the audio, my first audio.

And it's really if you if you're interested,  well, the one we're going to give away,  one of the greatest albums all time, Bob Dylan's Highway 61 Revisited.  I'm sure, Jonathan, you, given your songwriting style  and abilities, must have spent some time listening to Dylan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not on purpose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You neither of you like Bob Dylan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I don't want to start a whole thing here. Yeah.  I know that I should like Bob Dylan.  He's never he's never he's never really excited me that much.  Now I'm going to be in trouble with a lot of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know. But I know girls don't like Bob Dylan.  Well, maybe that's why.  You have a beard and everything. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Could be fake.  We've established that it's pretty easy to fool someone with a fake beard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is what this is what Harold Bloom,  the literary critic, Harold Bloom, would call the anxiety of influence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, my goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Yale literary critic, Harold Bloom.  Jonathan wouldn't know that because he was too busy smoking dope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What was your what was your what was your major in college, Jonathan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was I was a music major. Oh, good.  Yeah. And I minored in dope.  You know what that means, don't you? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A lot of this. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Rummy windings, we call it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Rummy, rummy windings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He was breathing the old rummy wind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you, Mr. Mr. Hodgman, what was your major?  Martini drinking.  It's there's the right there's the dichotomy right there.  So the left hand of the aisle is your is your marijuana users  on the right hand of your aisle is all gin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just just a bunch of dick cabots as we like to call them.  No, I think it's an awful lot of overlap among our fans.  Probably.  And they all get along just fine.  They all like each other very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I was going to say, whether they're high on marijuana or drunk  on martinis, really guaranteed to enjoy our show makes a little difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, Harold Bloom's How to Read and Why is Unonable.  That might be a good one for you, John or Jonathan, as you're trying to catch up  with John. Yeah, you might want to check that out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe I'll start there. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Harold brought that right around

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Highway 61.  I think you should listen to this, one of the great records of all time.  These books kind of go into it in great detail. Listen here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We tried out various locations and stopped at a clothes store  and bought outfits for Bob.  But the ones he wears on the cover are his own.  So they're talking about the famous cover shoot him in the picture to give it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  song by song. They dissected. This is yours free.  You know, it's a good way to try audibles for hours and 26 minutes.  If you like that, they have Neil Young's Harvest, the Kinks,  Village Green Preservation Society.  I know, I know, I know. I got one for you.  I bet you're a Nick Drake fan, aren't you, Jonathan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's all right.  God, gosh. God.  I'm a huge, huge Nick Drake fan.  Yeah, I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You've lost me. I'd be honest with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let me ask you, Leo, did Billy Joel ever write a book?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, don't say it.  Since Jonathan loves Billy Joel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, there's no way he's ever written a book.  I guarantee it. Billy Joel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So these books are written by experts on the albums, not by Dylan,  for instance, or Neil Young.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  33 and a third is what you're saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the 33 and a third series.  We're going to give you one free.  And this is actually a great listen.  Highly recommended if you're a fan of Dylan.  If you're not, forget it.  Get it free.  Now, wait a minute. Now, for that one, you have to go to audible.com  slash twit 33.  See, the number is different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. That's that's where they make it easy for you.  I really like this one on Paul's boutique.  Beastie Boys, Paul's boutique. That looks good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There you go. You like Beastie Boys.  I'm forgetting you guys are younger than me.  We're youth. You're youth.  You're the youth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're merely 37 years old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're the youth.  Youth of today.  The youth of today.  Come on, old man. Get out of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Paul's boutique from 1991, man.  That's when it was happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do they really have that Paul's boutique?  33 and a third? That's awesome.  OK, so there you go. So there's a huge variety.  These are this is a really great series.  The one that's free, though, is the Dylan.  We've we've we kind of maybe overshot our audience on this one,  but we'll give it a try.  Bob Dylan's Highway 61 Revisited.  All you do is you go to audible.com slash twit 33.  So now, if this is not too confusing, there are two links.  If you want to sign up for Audible, and I do encourage that,  you can get your first three books for first three months of books  at half price by going to audible.com slash twit seven four nine.  If you want the 33 and a third series, Bob Dylan's Highway 61 Revisited free.  No sign up required.  Now, I think now I have to say this is U.S. for sure.  It may not be available in other countries.  That is not Audible's fault.  That has to do with the publishers and the deals they have in each nation.  As John Hodgman well knows, every country has a whole different system for publishers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's true. Yeah.  And only one of them includes me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So listen, are you published in but one nation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In but one nation, the United States of America, including Rhode Island.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's nice of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We just got into Rhode Island.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's very generous of you.  Congratulations.  My real question is when are you going to have this new one?  More information than you require on Audible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  As soon as Colton and I can get in together into a studio and record it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's nice. That's real loyalty.  You won't do it without him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, and believe me, I've been asked specifically to do it without him.  But I saw it. But, you know, we had a very special guest on the last audiobook.  Paul Rudd.  I love him. Very funny guy.  Cameo on the last audiobook and I saw I ran into him  and he and he I hope that he'll do another cameo.  I'd love to get a cameo from Bruce Campbell.  We'll see. I'll have to email him.  He's in the habit of saying no to me.  So that's because you used to be his agent.  Yes, this is the reason I don't have to do what you say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He has no respect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But while while the folks are waiting for that,  may I make an audible recommendation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Please do, Mr. Hodgman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I am quite thrilled.  I consider this, frankly, a holiday miracle.  I'm quite thrilled that Audible offers a book called Don't Point That Thing At Me,  which is not as hilarious as it sounds.  It's actually an extremely funny British mystery from the 70s.  It is one of my absolute favorite books.  Jonathan David Guillaume recommended it to me at first.  It sounds like it is not easy to find,  but it is really, really wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a Charlie Mordecai mystery, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is a Charlie Mordecai mystery.  Do you know the book?  Not at all.  Oh, OK. Are you looking online?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Written by Kirill Bonfiglioli.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, very nicely pronounced and narrated by Simon Pribli.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's listen to a little bit of the Don't Point That Thing At Me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let me explain.  This is the story of a dissolute art dealer who accidentally becomes a detective.  He's an art dealer, an art thief.  And he has got a sort of gigantic Jeeves-like butler named Jock Strap.  They get involved in scrapes.  I bet they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And if you like this, you'll love the sequel.  It isn't it nice out.  Now, why don't you put it away?  So this is Don't Point That Thing At Me, a Charlie Mordecai mystery.  Here's a little bit of Simon Pribli.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, you're not a dollar.  It's very British.  Very British.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think that that...  First of all, the performance by Simon Pribli, I think we can all agree.  Virtuoso.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, he's brilliant.  I love his stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, but I don't think that that quite gets you the flavor of the book.  This is about a crazed, drunken jerk.  Who's the most wonderful character in the world.  And it's very saucy, I dare say.  So if you're under 13, have your father read it to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They also have Something Nasty in the Woodshed, which is another...  That is the sequel, yes.  So I'm going to add both of those to my cart because I just happened as an audible  platinum subscriber to have two, yes, two books.  I'm getting on a long plane flight on Tuesday.  This is going to be fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I hope you enjoy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm putting it in my cart right now based on your recommendation.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The only person I ever knew...  This is a holiday miracle.  The only person I ever knew who liked this book as much as I do, besides the guy who  told me about it, is a crazy and wonderful eccentric cook named Kenny Schopson.  And indeed, the bacon scarf comes from his store and restaurant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I knew I knew that name.  It's right on the cover there.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  And so this scarf is designed by his incredibly talented daughter, Mara Schopson.  And they run this...  Do you know the store?  Schopson's General Store.  Have you been there before?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where is it?  No, I haven't been there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it was for a long time in the West Village and now it's in the Essex Street Market in  New York City.  And it's an extremely eccentric family restaurant run by an extremely eccentric family,  led by the gigantic, sweetums-like, sort of id-powered cook named Kenny Schopson,  who's got a very foul mouth and a very sweet nature.  And he has five children, many of whom still work with him every day in the store.  And he just put out the most remarkable book that unfortunately is not on Audible because  it is primarily a cookbook and I don't think that would work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They have some cookbooks on there, but you're right.  It's not a good idea.  Well, they should put this one on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And this book is called Eat Me, the Food and Philosophy of Kenny Schopson.  And that is going to be my big holiday gift this year.  Eat Me.  Eat Me.  So if you want a bacon scarf or you want some philosophy about cooking crazy foods in a very  small kitchen while yelling at people, Schopson's is the one-stop shop for you.  You can go online, I think, schoppsons.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's fantastic.  We'll send them a bill for the advertisement if you don't mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's that?  Nothing.  Oh, that's okay.  They're already paying me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, good.  As long as someone's getting something, I don't care.  A lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Man, I didn't even know we were supposed to bring our sponsors tonight.  I didn't bring one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's worth it for the bacon scarf.  I didn't mean to be rude, but it's just all these things suddenly clicked.  I'm like, oh.  No, no, no.  That's wonderful.  Don't play that thing at me and the bacon scarf and my favorite books this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does his daughter do other bacon accoutrement or is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, the scarf is the only bacon item there.  She does a lot of other very cool items that you can see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The nice thing about the bacon scarf, and I will say this, is that it's just a nice festive scarf.  It doesn't necessarily say bacon loudly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  You have to unwrap it from your neck and show it off.  Yeah.  And then it looks like a particularly large.  Otherwise, it's just a nice red and white scarf.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or I think if you push the button, it will say bacon loudly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I didn't put the batteries in.  That's why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got to put the batteries in and then push the button.  Bacon.  Bacon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or does it just go...  Every once in a while.  That'd be sufficient.  So on the left, people using marijuana dressed as zombies with strangely mutilated monkeys.  On the right, people in fine brown suits with brown shoes and brillanteened hair holding martinis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A cast of madmen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And up, did you come up the middle aisle?  Do you go around the side?  How does this work exactly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We generally come from backstage.  Oh, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or next to the Sudoku books if we're in a bookstore.  We're in a bookstore, yeah.  We'll be hiding behind the Sudoku books typically and then we'll jump out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I got a Sudoku book at Book Passage.  The first three were half filled out and I think it was you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Book Passage and Cordae Madera?  Yes.  Yeah, well we did a show there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know you did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And for that one, for example, we came out and we...  Jonathan sang my theme song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And what is your theme song?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the John Hodgman theme song.  I don't think it has a title beyond that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I guess it doesn't have a title.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you have a guitar there, Jonathan?  You could play it for us.  I don't know if it'd come through the Skype headset exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a good question.  I don't know if I have the tech to make that happen.  We'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Didn't Hodgman tell you that you would have to play his theme song?  Was that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I assume.  I always assume that I have to play the theme song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My holiday present to Jonathan was that he didn't have to play my theme song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, hum it then.  How does it go?  Are there lyrics?  Here he comes.  There are lyrics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's basically...  It's about how John is saving the world with his books, essentially.  Oh, wow.  That's, you know...  These are very important books written by a very important man  who has very important things to say.  That's essentially the gist of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do we have it on...  It's an adaptation of the Areas of My Expertise theme song too.  So if we have that, if you have that on audiobook handy, you can probably hear...

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I do have that.  I don't know.  Let me see.  Because of course, I did purchase your book, Areas of My Expertise.  Or maybe someone has it.  Is it at the very beginning of Areas of My Expertise?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is.  I think it opens with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sorry.  I've deleted it.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's embarrassing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, we threw it right back on you.  Another holiday miracle.  You caught us up short.  What?  Play a music song?  What?  I don't...  How can we do such a thing?  We don't have the technology.  Why don't you do this?  Oh, I can't find it.  It's like an O'Henry story.  It is.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And by the way, I...  I just handed the embarrassment right by you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do have some Colton Christmas music, and one of which does in fact make a veiled reference  to an O'Henry story.  Can you name that song?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sure Jonathan can.  I certainly can.  Christmas is Interesting by Jonathan Colton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is there a Christmas is Interesting song?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right.  That's what it's called.  Christmas is Interesting.  Yeah.  That's right.  I...  Yeah.  I allude to it in a vague sort of crazy way.  I like it.  Look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here we go.  It's on YouTube.  Jonathan singing the Hodgman theme song at Book Passage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh my God.  Right here.  Oh my God.  Let's find it.  Now I have...  I do have access to YouTube here.  Can you hear it if I play it?  I don't know how this works.  No, don't you play it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would be very bad.  Sync your iPhone though.  That would...  Yeah.  Sync your...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sync is in progress by the way, just so you know.  All of my calendars are updating.  Let's see.  Minor adjustments to my contacts since the last time I synced five minutes ago.  Corrected some zip codes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have a lot of songs on YouTube.  You have 10 pages of songs on YouTube.  I do, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A lot of people take video at shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you don't mind if people do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, are you kidding me?  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When's that DVD coming out that I'm on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That DVD...  I'm glad you asked.  That DVD is going to come out in February.  Can't wait.  I know.  I'm very excited about it.  It turned out great.  The show itself was a really good one and there's a lot of great footage from fans who  brought their cameras and of course there's you and Merlin and Veronica playing rock band with me.  It's a very cool thing.  I'm glad it exists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is anybody going to play my theme song?  I thought we were going to play my theme song and all of you talking about blah blah blah  DVD stuff I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's short.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a very short song.  There were technical problems.  That's right.  It's like three bars.  I'm glad this is on YouTube.  I think we're just going to have to live with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we can live through an actual book reading here.  Why in heaven's name did somebody upload that to YouTube?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a lot of material from this particular appearance.  I see here they have me beatboxing.  Someone asked me to beatbox after they heard me on Twitter beatboxing last time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're now famous for your beatboxing.  I played that by the way several times again.  I feel that that is now kind of a part of Twitter history.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So right there in Corte Madera that was a good example of a bookstore appearance.  People who are looking at it now they could see me at a podium  wearing a tuxedo naturally because I'm not a monster.  Then you see Jonathan wearing dungarees and his beard and everything.  Some kind of hair shirt or something.  I can't really tell.  I'm playing his little strum stick there.  He's off to my right without a podium because he keeps it all in his head.  He sings a theme song and I announce the book.  Then he stands there awkwardly while I read portions of the book.  Then occasionally I will accuse him of being a feral mountain man and he will deny it.  Then I had a piece in the new book about how I had become a famous minor television  personality accidentally.  We had talked about that on the twit last time.  How I had ended up making a cameo appearance in an upcoming episode of Battlestar Galactica.  Then Jonathan sang his own version of the Battlestar Galactica theme song.  Then we take some questions and answers.  Then Jonathan sings some songs.  Then we go out to dinner.  We put on our bacon scarves and go out to dinner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, that chapter, How to be Famous, was a revelation to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Was it?  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'm ready to go.  I feel it's almost an instruction book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think I've learned more from you than you from me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I particularly enjoyed the line that was my introduction to Los Angeles,  a traumatic homosexual silent comedy date rape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That line really should be put in context.  I think that it would make a lot more sense if he perhaps jumped less inflammatory.  People understood that that referred to a time when I was visiting Universal Studios Tour  as a 12-year-old child with long hair and was approached by a man dressed up as Charlie  Chaplin who thought I was a girl and thus wanted me to kiss him on the cheek.  And I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All I can say is, Rummy's have no wind.  Rummy's have no wind.  You know what I really like about this is the humility with which John Hodgman stands  and listens to the song that is his theme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wasn't listening, actually.  You were thinking of other things.  I was thinking about where we were going to have dinner that night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, you're just standing there just taking it all in.  You're not even looking at Jonathan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He doesn't like to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's not even looking at you.  I'll leave you to play more than what you need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Good evening.  My name is John Hodgman.  As you heard in my theme song, some years ago I wrote a book entitled  The Areas of My Expertise, a compendium of complete world knowledge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, this is on YouTube, so I'll leave it to our intrepid listeners to figure out how  to find that clip and listen to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But people do ask quite a bit about the audiobook.  And the reality is that Jonathan and I, I very much wanted to go out and tour the book  around and perform it a little bit so that I could hear how the book sounded and also  so that we could get recordings of some of the material so we could perhaps include some  live material in the audiobook.  Oh, that would be great.  And maybe you'd record a voice in it, Leo.  Anything you'd like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anything you'd like.  I could be the announcer.  I could be red shirt number two.  Whatever you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe you should do the whole thing.  Maybe that would make it a lot easier for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's true.  That would make it a lot easier.  Do you get along with Paul Rudd okay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've never met the man, but I'm sure I would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it sounds like it'll work.  Jonathan, I think we got a deal.  So great.  We can go on vacation.  Fantastic.  Thank you, Leo, for agreeing to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would love to, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You will have to do the 700 mole man names by yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That could be a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Bring a Ricola.  That's all I have to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to say that the areas of my expertise is much better listened to than read because  you do such a good job of delivering it.  I just don't think that I could do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's very convenient because under a special arrangement with the publisher,  if you buy my book, you are no longer obligated to read it.  That's nice.  That's good.  That way you can get out of the whole thing.  Buy the copy of the book and then buy the audiobook and then you don't have to read  the one that is on the list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Would you like to just, before we go, because we're going to wrap this up,  and I do want to thank you so much for making my holiday extra special.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Consider this your gift to us, Leo.  Oh, thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Would you like to read a little portion of the book?  Is there one that you, a little snippet to give people some idea of how  wonderful this book, more information than you require is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Speaking of Christmas, while I am personally not a religious man,  I am nonetheless induced by the trappings of the season.  Even as I write this, I am enjoying my famous eggnog, secret ingredient, alcoholic eggs.  I've lit a merry little yule log here at my feet where I'm roasting chestnuts to give the  inevitable carolers and Persian magi and crippled English children who come to my door this time of  year.  I've decked my study with boughs of holly and of course poinsettia, or some say poinsettia,  though actually it was pronounced pon-see-ah.  Did you know that it is a Mexican plant?  It is.  Named for the renowned ambassador to Mexico, James Poinsettia was brought to our country in 1828  and quickly became favored over its predecessor, the Christodendron,  which was a very similar plant to the pon-see-ah.  It's subject to spontaneous stigmata and thus considered overly dramatic for the holiday table.  Did you know, Leo, that much of our nation's early Christmas was somber and austere occasion?  Both Oliver Cromwell in England and Governor William Bradford in the Plymouth Colony forbade  any observance or revelry other than a literal mass for Christ, hence the name Christ Mass.  And so for many decades, the sole Christmas decoration in most American homes was a child  made to stand silently in the corner to contemplate damnation while holding a burning log.  That is all. That's a little segment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Beautiful. That's really touching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mr. Colton, I know you're not actually technically able to  perform in any way your label prohibits it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I'm sure he would beatbox for you though, Leo, if you ask me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is this where you gained your beatboxing chops, Mr. Hoffman?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jonathan, can't beatbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've got no beatbox in me.  What?  I have very little funk in my body or my brain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, beatbox chops is actually the name of his style of beard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Box chops, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  1880s, I believe, right?  That's exactly right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what? If you don't mind, I do have something I can plug aside from the DVD.  Please.  Because I know that's what you were fishing for.  You were like, please, please, will you plug something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it is that time of year.  When we sit back, a lot of people think that Christmas is about presents and tinsel and  Christmas trees.  I think we all know that it's really about something deeper, something bigger,  something more important.  It's about products.  Products, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Speaking of gifts, what a lovely gift this would make.  Just imagine.  There's a CD out now called JoCo Looks Back, which is my greatest hits CD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't that a little premature, Jonathan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, it is.  It felt wrong.  It felt wrong.  I've only been a professional musician for three years.  You gotta retire first.  I know, I know.  But the problem is that when I sell CDs at shows, you either have Smoking Monkey,  which is the CD that's several years old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That features the fine Christmas is interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.  Or you have this Thing-A-Week box set, which is four CDs and 52 songs.  That's a little much for somebody who's just starting out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jonathan, you're forgetting the extended play CD.  With the 700 hobo names.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's actually not in print anymore.  You're talking about Where Tradition Meets Tomorrow.  Where Tradition Meets Tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not in print anymore?  That's not in print.  That's only available digitally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Would your burner break?  What?  Not in print.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, it's a five-song CD.  You could burn a copy for somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They could.  You know what?  You should do what I did.  If you go to Jonathan's site, JonathanColton,  Jonathan is not spelled with any odd letters.  You can download, it's still $70, right?  The entire Irv.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The whole set.  Am I saying that right?  All of his work?  All of his work.  All of my work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did that.  That's what I did.  So I would have the complete set.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The entire French egg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not oof.  Not oof.  Irv.  Is it an alcoholic French egg?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, the entire French bacon scarf.  Maybe wrapped around your neck of holiday need and desire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is a total of 88 songs, I believe.  Something like that.  Unless I've deleted some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I think you only deleted my audiobook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the only thing.  That would be crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Music you can listen to over and over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, and I think that people should download that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  But the CD, where can we get that, Mr. Colton?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The CD is available from CDbaby.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, good.  That means it's also on iTunes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's not on iTunes, but the songs, there's no new songs on it.  I thought CD Baby, shh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is your retrospective of your life's work.  Yeah, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's another holiday miracle.  Several old songs become a new CD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  With no new material on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a beautiful package, though.  And I think it's a perfect gift for somebody who is just becoming introduced to Jonathan  Colton and perhaps maybe someone who does not know to download songs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, this hurts.  It's out of stock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, it just says that.  I know.  It's a long story.  There are more coming.  The burners back.  Probably on Monday.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that's a perfect holiday gift.  It's a perfect stocking stuffer.  Yeah.  And out of stock.  Yeah, out of stock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you order it today, will you get it in time for Christmas?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I believe so, yeah.  You'd have to ask CD Baby to be sure, but I would imagine so.  They ship pretty quickly.  If not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And if not, Jonathan will come and deliver it personally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, just let me know and I will bring it to wherever you are.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Old St. Beatbox Chops himself will drop it down the chimney.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Offer only good in the Tri-State area.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Offer only good in Rhode Island.  Offer not an offer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not an offer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Offer not available anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Voidware unavailable.  Well, good.  Yeah, this is great.  I highly recommend Jonathan's music and I'm going to end with a song that you did for  podcasters very generously some years back with podcasters.  Right?  Did they actually record their parts or did you make it all up?  No, they didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Those are all that's all me saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, too bad because I thought it was really Adam.  Adam Curry making a mess of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I wish.  I wish it was.  No, I wasn't.  I wasn't famous enough to actually to even get podcasters to participate with me.  That's so sad.  But the idea came from podcasters.  I think it was I don't know if it was Len Peralta or C.C.  Chapman whose idea it was to do this a pod safe Christmas song.  Yeah.  Which I decided should be in the style of the Cheap Monks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, enjoy your eggnog, gentlemen.  I'm so glad we could talk and I thank you so much for making this special  twit holiday special so so good.  I dressed as Perry Como for the event in my red sweater and my bacon scarf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I dressed as a druid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Very appropriate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have a Christmas tree costume on.  It's very hard to move around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was a little rustling.  I heard earlier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're also incredibly flammable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really hot in here, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's so festive.  And I hope you've enjoyed the synthetic sounds of Yule log burning in the  background during the whole show.  We've added that in sweetening and post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, fantastic.  I was wondering what that was.  I thought there was a horrible fire in your house.  Crackle, crackle.  I'm so glad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Crackle, crackle.  Thank you, guys.  John Hodgman's newest is more information than you require available everywhere.  It is not too late to get it for Christmas.  And if you if the loved one in your life loves to laugh, it's a must.  I would get both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or your child or your child at college, for example.  The college students would come to my readings and say I'm poor.  Oftentimes they would walk like Tiny Tim.  They were on a crutch and they would say, please, sir, I want some more.  But they could not buy it for themselves.  So parents, please think of your poor Tiny Tim crippled children in college  who require a Christmas goose and my book for the holidays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And when he mentions Christmas goose, he means nothing like the date rape  experience at Universal Studios.  That was something completely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I appreciate you bringing that up again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jonathan Colton, Joe Coe looks back is on CD, baby.  Go to JonathanColton.com for the entire French egg.  Another twit is in the can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, guys, everyone ready to sing the song?  Yeah, we're all ready.  Great. Now, remember, it's almost Christmas and nobody has any pod safe Christmas music.  So that's your motivation here.  C.C. Chapman, you ready?  Ready as I'll ever be.  And Lenonora from Jawbone, good to go?
