Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And we're live at Podcast Expo.  I should say Netcast Expo, right?  Doug Kay is here from IT Conversations.  He's going to hand his tiara off to me a little later on.  Absolutely.  And if you should fail, it could succeed in your duties.  You'll be, I'll be runner up.  Yes.  Okay.  Thank you.  Yes.  Actually, Doug has some big announcements.  We'll get to that in just a second.  Also with me, Steve Gibson, another TWiT from Security Now and GRC.com.  Sitting next to Steve Gibson, the great Scott Bourne from MacBreak Weekly and the iLife  Sony is also a great aperture expert, ApertureTricks.com and PodcastingTricks.com.  What we're going to do today, before you give it off, keep the microphone.  What we're going to do today is talk to a lot of podcasters, as many as we can in half  an hour before they take this stage away from us.  Podcast Expo is the gathering of the tribes for podcasting.  The second year we've done it, about 2,500 people.  We've taken over a small part of the Ontario Convention Center.  A lot of booths showing podcast software, podcast hardware.  Broadcasters General Store is here.  Thanks to them, we've got audio on this podcast.  Which is really handy for a podcast.  It certainly makes a difference.  They lent us their Alyssa's Multimix 8 Firewire.  What would you say, Doug Kay, you've been podcasting longer than anybody on this panel,  longer than anybody except Christopher Lydon.  What would you say is different this year about podcasting from years past?

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  I think last year it was still new to everybody.  I think those of us who have been in it.  I think what I'm seeing today is people who are podcasters and have been podcasters and  can be considered veteran podcasters.  A whole year!  Some of us are here for the second time.  Wow!  So I think it's, I think at least for our little club of 2,500 people, we are mainstream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It does feel like a club though, because you see the same faces.  In fact, one of the things that kind of surprises me about this is a lot of people here promoting  their podcast to other podcasters.  And really what we need to do is promote it to people who don't know about podcasting,  right?  Right, right.  It's great and you want to get the word out, but these are the last people that you'd probably  say, hey, I have a podcast to.  Scott Bourne, you also a long time audio guy.  In fact, you come from, as I do and I think Doug too, from Real Radio.  Scott was...  He's got that voice.  He does.  That radio voice.  Do the thing you were doing, he's Scott Allen.  Al Scott.  He was a DJ.  Go ahead.  Let's just hear a little bit of the Al Scott.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're going to go back in time to the days of AOR Radio.  And this is the Al Scott Show.  We've got a brand new one coming at you on WNAP Stereo 93.  It's the Deep Purple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Anybody from Indianapolis recognize that?  Yeah.  A couple of fans there, including Elvis Poultry.  You're from Indy, huh?  That would be your only excuse for dressing in a chicken suit and singing Elvis songs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I got to tell you, I never met anybody in a chicken suit in Indianapolis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, you just have to go back.  Apparently it's very big now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Things have changed since the days of Radio Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You were doing streaming radio before anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  In 1994, we launched a company called NetRadio.  We used real audio 1.0.  We delivered music to folks on 1200 baud modems and it sounded like your Aunt Edna singing  in a toilet.  But we had an IPO and made a lot of money and got away with it.  But we wanted to do what's going on now, Leo.  We didn't have the bandwidth.  We didn't have anything like RSS.  We did deliver information on demand through a company called Pointcast, as you and I discussed  You did Pointcast?  We did Pointcast.  We took NetRadio, attached it to Pointcast.  So technically, that was the first podcast if your criteria is audio delivered on demand.  And that was done in 1994.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And if you don't use the word pod?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you can't use the word pod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that's one of the issues.  I certainly raised that in my keynote.  And if you go to the Twitch site, you see I don't say the word pod anymore.  I say netcasts you love from people you trust and that says netcasts everywhere.  Am I crazy?  Is this a quixotic attempt?  Scott and I are kind of thinking, Scott and I have actually talked about maybe we should  trademark this, maybe we should pursue this, maybe we should get an industry group to own  it, to protect it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you want to prevent anybody else from grabbing it and using it and then doing an  end run.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Russell is here.  We'll talk to him in just a little bit from a podcast ready.  They're one of the sponsors of the show, but they're also one of the people Apple sent  that famous cease and desist letter to.  Now did you get one?  Oh wait, yeah.  Ray Slakinski is he.  Ray is actually the guy who created iPod or X, which was the first really good podcast  client which got put out of business by iTunes economically.  Pretty much.  But then they went after you the name too, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  Well, we got a cease and desist order, well, almost a year ago.  And what they did within the letters, we had an iPod pretty much on the logo.  It was changed a little bit to look like a transistor radio.  They forced us to remove that.  The iPod as part of the name had to be removed.  But also we couldn't just drop the I and make it Potter X.  Oh, that's interesting.  We had to remove pod from the name.  So this is nothing new to me.  This is something well over a year ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now people say to me, well, they're not going to go after podcasters.  In fact, Apple in its letter to podcast ready said, we're not going to go after podcasters.  And yet I was talking to Russell from podcast ready yesterday and he said, well, in fact,  they do go after podcasters.  There was a podcast called pod golf fit podcast only.  They weren't selling services.  They weren't selling hardware.  I got the letter from Apple said you got to drop the name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Here's what I think happened with podcast ready podcast.  Ready.  My understanding is they filed a trademark application.  Now when you do that, you're attracting attention and you're forcing Apple's hand.  They must defend their trademark.  So you're really not giving them much choice in that case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, but what the issue is, are they trying to trademark pod?  And they apparently are.  The word pod itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  I think I think simply in a situation that they are forced in order to maintain any trademark,  they must continue to pursue it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, what I think is what they're doing is using the cease and desist and going after  something like my Potter or iPod or that sounds like iPod, but in the same letter, also trying  to get you to remove pod.  I'm not sure if they have much legal ground to actually get you to remove pod, but they  have it to remove my pod and iPod from the point is they have to ask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Right.  They have to put that in the demand letter and nobody by the way, and nobody has caved

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  except for you.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But a lot of people not the only ones, a few of K iPodder, which is now called lemon lemon.  It used to be iPod or lemon now called juice.  Got the same letter.  So let me ask the podcasters here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Should we find a new name or do we stick with podcast stick with podcasts?  No raise your hands.  It's audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to teach these people say, should we stick with podcast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Should we change to something else?  Should we use netcast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can't win.  I think it's going to be podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think it's staying podcast.  I doubt that in the least.  And as I said, I'm not trying.  My changing unilaterally, I know nobody's going to.  I'm like Audie Murphy charging over hamburger hill saying, come on guys.  And nobody's following you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Well, you started off by asking, am I crazy?  Yeah, I guess you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I just feel like it doesn't serve us.  Anyway, that's, that's, that's certainly one of the things we're talking about here.  Another thing that everybody's talking about is monetizing podcasts.  We are, as you say, a mature industry now.  People are taking ads.  They're looking at ways of monetizing.  That's certainly one of the things.  And there's a lot of new services.  Now you've got one, Doug K.  Giga Vox, which is the company that you've formed.  It's kind of the umbrella company around IT conversations.  You haven't asked something really cool.  A lot of podcast is to be interested in level later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  That's right.  Starting.  When are we going live with this show?  You're looking at me now?  Yeah. When is this show launched?  I'm going to get it out as soon as I can.  Okay.  Probably Saturday.  Starting, starting sometime, hopefully Saturday morning at gigavox.com.  By the time you hear this.  By the time you hear this, otherwise I'm in deep trouble,  at gigavox.com you will be able to download for free a copy of the Levelator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Levelator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  The Levelator, I guarantee, will make all your podcasts sound better.  And it's free.  And I guarantee that on a double your money back guarantee.  If you don't like it, I'll give you back double what you paid for.  But what it does is it goes in to your show and it levels out all the long term variations,  such as we're talking here and we have different people at different levels  because of the mixing situation.  It'll smooth all that out.  If you've ever done an interview with uneven speaker levels,  if you've done a phone interview, it'll solve all those things.  We've had this problem in our production department for many years.  We've had some internal tools.  We finally decided to publish those tools and make them available to all podcasters.  It levelates them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm going to tell you that I know that your Levelator will be out before this podcast is out  because I'm going to use it on this podcast.  All right.  Now, my initial reaction, I looked at it and said, it's compression.  It's not compression.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  No.  Yeah.  Leveling is very, I'm sorry, limiting is very short term.  You know, get the spikes out with a limiter.  Compression is moderately short term.  It acts within a few seconds.  The Levelator works over periods of many seconds.  What we're doing in there, we're going in and making a loudness map of the entire wave or AIFF file  and deciding where the changes are and then going back in  and doing individual RMS normalization for each segment.  It's smart normalization.  Smart normalization.  I think that's something we need.  And we can do it because we can do look ahead and we can build that map.  We can do things that you cannot do in hardware because we have infinite look ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're also going to offer a service that you're using right now to build IT conversations.  That's coming a few months from now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Yeah.  We have a new, our real business is the content management system that will be available for all  serious and large podcasters, you know, anybody who has a little bit of a budget to pay for it.  And that is a complete...  Why are you looking at me?  Yeah, really.  Don't look at me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And this is a perfect example of a change that's happened between this year and last year.  Now we're talking about perfecting the podcasts that we're making.  I remember last year people were saying, how do I do one?  We haven't been a very good example of the answer to that question here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What people at home don't know is it took us about four hours to set up.  Questions have been answered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  People are able to make the podcast now.  And so now they want them levelized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right.  So this is the new Gigavox, a services business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Yeah, we've always been a technology company, but because we've had some strong content,  IT conversations, people thought of us as a content company.  So giving out the level later, and I see the author of it, Bruce just sat down there.  We're giving it out there to try and get the message across that we really are a,  if I may say so, one of the premier podcast technology companies.  You may say so.  Thank you.  Say that, Doug.  I just said that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Also here, I noticed it's not podcurrent.com.  Ray Slakinski's a little gun shy.  He's calling it popcurrent.com.  Tell us about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Popcurrent is a site to solve actually the problem of promotion of your podcasts.  Hallelujah.  What you were talking about before is that podcasters are currently promoting to other  podcasters, or at least the people that know about podcasts.  So the iTunes podcast directory, you already have to know sort of what a podcast is in  order to start checking those out.  So we're trying to reach out to the rest of the world.  And by doing so, we have a site very much like Dig,  uses the same model of where you either pop or flop a particular episode.  So podcasters can submit an episode up to the site and people rate it.  And it goes up to the best of page or to the hot nail page if it's new and popular.  And people can see it that way.  But the interesting thing is that we don't say it's just podcasts.  We have categories like talk and video and books even.  So we have some cross-pollination in between people from MySpace,  people from YouTube that are coming to the site that have no clue what a podcast is,  but are coming for a band, but see their podcast just below that entry.  And they click it, like it, and then possibly subscribe to it.  And now they know what a podcast is.  So we're trying to reach out to that other group.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's a lot of people here, I think, who are recognizing  that's the next step for podcasting.  We've got to get people to see it, to find it, to know it exists.  New markets.  New markets.  I think we're plateauing a little bit, frankly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that we're hitting that where 300, 500,000 is our max.  All the early adopters have already adopted.  So what we're trying to reach out to is all those people that are on MySpace  that are using the system to find bands.  But now we're kind of bringing that out from MySpace and getting people over into podcasts,  see the YouTube video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's a great idea.  Well, we'll be on it.  I know most of you guys will want to be on it, too.  I think that's really important.  Thank you, Ray.  Thank you.  And thanks for iPod or X, which was equally important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, just one quick thing about iPod or X.  I've been promised by August we will release something, Transistor.  It will come out soon, I hope by the end of the year.  Good.  Just to satisfy all the fans that still use the software,  you've made some great strides in supporting new file types,  OPML type subscriptions, so you can subscribe to the Leo channel that has all the feeds.  It's got some great features that iTunes can never match.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that's another issue I raised is that we are so iTunes dependent.  That is, in the long run, not healthy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We are going to release it with just, you know,  software bugs for like Microsoft and Vista.  Eventually, we will come out with a software package that you might want to use.  Nobody's like Microsoft.  Thank you, Ray Slickinski.  You're welcome. Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hey, hand the microphone over to this other guy,  because here's a face I haven't seen in so long.  Martin Sargent.  Oh my gosh.  It's so great to see you.  His podcast is Infected, and that's actually the name, not the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe PooCast would be a better name for what I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And you're part of the new Revision 3, too.  Yeah, I am part of Revision 3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Infected is part of Revision 3.  So is a new show that I got up there called Web Drifter,  Martin Sargent Web Drifter, which is actually a pilot  that was commissioned by Comedy Central, which got turned down.  Thank you.  Who needs Comedy Central?  Who needs it?  Because we got Revision 3 now.  So you guys can all go up there right now and watch the first episode of Web Drifter.  What's that about?  Web Drifter is the premise is I've been, me, Martin Sargent,  I've been surfing the internet doing nothing else since the Clinton administration.  And I finally finished it.  And I don't know what to do with my life anymore.  So now I'm going to retrace my steps.  Only this time I'm going to do it for real.  I'm going to go to the physical locus of every website and go behind the website.  That's a great idea.  The first episode, we go to AlexChu.com.  Behind that, he's the guy who invented the immortality rings, of course.  And which is the secret to Martin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The fact that Martin has not aged one day since the Clinton administration.  Seriously, look at this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I feel so youthful.  Compared to me.  Why are you pointing at me?  I thought this was supposed to be new media.  You know, it's more like ARP.  We are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We are the old guys, aren't we?  That's fine.  I don't mind.  It's great to see you, Marty.  Marty came here last week and turned out there wasn't an expo here.  So he decided to come back.  But the parking was free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm an early adopter.  What can I say?  I've never left.  I've been living in the parking lot for a whole week waiting for this thing to start.  Marty, it's so great to see you.  Things are going well.  Things are going real well.  Things are going great.  I'm very excited about this new medium, as I'm sure everyone here is.  It's just great, you know, having tried to work in the Hollywood machine for a while now.  I'm doing okay.  I'm making it a little bit.  But to be able to sit at my kitchen table with my friends with less than $300 worth of equipment  and still reach a huge audience, that's the future, man.  It's great to be here with you guys.  So thank you very much for the opportunity.  Martin, sorry.  Check out WebDripper and Infected on revision3.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hey, Russell, come up here, Russell, for a second.  I want to talk to Russell in just a second.  But I do want to mention while Comedy Central sucks, Showtime isn't so bad.  This podcast is brought to you by Showtime.  You're excited about Dexter, aren't you?  Dexter, yes.  It really looks good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have you seen the ads for this?  Actually, I haven't.  And you know what I really liked was the fact that they had the ladies from the L word saying that,  you know, if I would be interested in a guy, it would be Dexter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's a psychopathic dysfunctional serial killer who happens to work for Miami Homicide.  He's a forensic investigator.  I thought he used to work for Tech TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's a serial killer and he only kills bad guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He kills other bad guys.  Yeah.  The guy...  It's a black comedy, I think.  But you know what I like?  It's the guy from Six Feet Under.  Yeah, the guy who played David on Six Feet Under.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So the premiere is Sunday, October 1st at 10 p.m.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Nine Central replays all week or watch it on Denman at any time.  To subscribe, call 1-800-SHOWTIME or go to sho.com.  We thank Showtime for the support of this podcast.  Now, let's say hi to the folks from Podcast Ready.  Russell...  And how do you say your last name?  Holloman?  Holloman.  Holloman is the guy who got the Apple letter.  Congratulations, Russell.  Well, thanks.  You're a cause celeb here.  I noticed that you're still calling yourself Podcast Ready,  that you haven't taken the pod out of your name yet.  No, no, we haven't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  What's your plan?  Plan is just keep doing what we're doing.  We've had a lot of success in the last couple of months.  You're a sponsor, the major sponsor of this show.  We have a lot of Podcast Ready enabled devices out there on store shelves right now,  trying to introduce a whole new group of people to podcasting.  So it's a hardware device?  Well, no, it's a software package that can be added to a hardware device.  I see.  And MP3 manufacturers are preloading it on their devices  so that when a new device is sold, a new potential audience member is born.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And what do you get?  Does it automatically download podcasts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  What it does, when you first connect your device,  it contacts our server, it gets an initial subscription list of podcasts.  Is Twitter on that list?  It will be.  That was the deal.  It wasn't the deal, I want to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You absolutely do not have to.  In fact, you probably shouldn't because people who listen to Twitter  can figure out how to get it.  You should have mommycasts, stuff that people who are not technically literate might want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Reality, it's actually a mix of half and half.  Half of it is mainstream and half of it is not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Are you able to change that actively so it's a constant change?  Alex Lindsay is here, by the way, for the Pixelboard.  Go ahead, Alex.  So you can decide what that...  Is it just checking into the server and then getting whatever the server tells it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  The list is actually dynamically built based on the device or the source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now, one of the things we are going to do, you do have a software program.  It's written in Java, runs on Mac and Windows.  You've said it'll go on Linux.  Right, they're pointing it to Linux right now.  And so we've made it...  One of the things we did, yes, last night when we were talking, I said,  can I please have a customized Twitter version I can put on the website.  People can click a link.  Again, I don't have anything against iTunes.  iTunes is the best thing that happened to podcasting,  but also now in some ways the worst thing because it's so dominant.  I want people to come to my site and simply say, click this button,  download this software.  It'll automatically download all our podcasts  and you can listen on your computer or put it on mp3 play.  So we are going to start doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Right, and the way it works is when that software gets activated,  it will get your initial subscription.  So later on you can change it if you change your feed or if you add a show.  That's cool.  Then the very next download...  And it'll be free, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Absolutely free.  Okay, so I think that's neat.  And it is actually an issue for Linux users.  Is that not true that it's a little...  Well, you're a Mac user too.  Randall Schwartz is here.  He's like a geek and a hacker and a podcaster.  He does the geek cruises news.  But you see, I think Linux is a little tough to get podcasts downloaded on.  So it'll be nice to have a Linux client.  So work on that, would you, Russell?  Absolutely.  And what can we do to help you in your fight against the evil empire?  Never thought I'd say that, did you, Alex?  That's sacrilege.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  You're going straight to Apple Hill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Well, I mean, you know, what can you do?  I don't know.  You've got lawyers.  As far as that's concerned, I just think it's really important that people understand that  it's not just because we filed for a trademark in the device space.  It's anybody who's filed a trademark.  Whether it's content or anything else.  We were talking to Denise Howell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Denise Howell is the lawyer, IP specialist, who is the host of our next podcast this week in law.  We were talking to her yesterday and she both agreed that in all likelihood,  Apple has retained a law firm just kind of independently sifting through all the filings.  Whenever one shows up, they press a button and out comes a letter and they send it to you.  Probably so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Because I've seen other letters.  They're all the same.  They're pretty much the same.  They just changed the category titles and that sort of stuff.  So, you know, we'll see how it goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Thank you very much, Russell.  We really appreciate it.  Scott, Warren, you know a lot about trademark law.  You have an opinion on that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I do, but I want to jump in here real quick about one thing I think is remarkable.  Now, if you look at the Twit podcast, if you look at all the tech podcasts that,  the top 25 or 30, like half of them are Twit podcasts.  And yet you're still a guy saying, even though I'm in all these podcast directories on top,  I still think we got to get out of this.  I just think that's pretty remarkable because that shows that  your message is not because you're hurt, it's because they're hurt.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  In fact, Apple, I ought to thank Apple.  We have a Twit artist page.  They've been very good.  Scott and Peter here somewhere.  I asked them to be on the podcast, but of course it's hard for them  corporately to come on.  They can't say anything.  They can't say anything.  I have the deepest respect for them.  I think the iTunes people have been very good to us all around.  It isn't for me I'm saying this, because you're exactly right, Scott.  It's for everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because all the Twit podcasts are on the top of the directory.  It's a statement against interest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If I were competing, but I'm not competing with all these people,  and that's the point is that we're all in this together.  I think Leo deserves a hand.  Please, no.  I think one of the things that we should be lobbying to do is get Microsoft to step up.  Obviously, and this may even be the intent,  by being active in this space,  Apple has in effect said to Microsoft and any device maker,  better not use the word pod.  And if you buy a Zoom, we played with a Zoom yesterday.  And you know what?  It was pretty nice.  Yeah, it's pretty cool.  But guess what?  It doesn't say podcasts on it.  It can't.  They would be foolish to do that because you know  Apple's lawyers would be on them right away.  If Brown wasn't Brown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If only it wasn't Brown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I bet the Brown looks good.  But anyway, I just want to say that.  So I understand Apple's point of view,  but we got to get Microsoft to put an aggregator into Vista.  Zoom's got to have great podcast support.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It doesn't yet.  The bottom line is, one of the reasons we got into podcasting was so that we had a lot of ways to get to viewers,  and get to viewers or listeners and so on and so forth.  And the problem that we have now is it's suddenly gotten back to one outlet again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And people perceive it as Apple, they perceive it as an iPod,  and that's great for those who have an iTunes and an iPod,  but it's not so good if you don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  And I think that Apple has to be almost overly careful about making sure  that they really take care of making sure that smaller podcasts are really well positioned and pushed.  Because then you don't get this kind of backlash, or as much of one.  There's much worry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right.  Let's talk to some more podcasters.  There's so many podcasters here.  And of course, as I'm walking around the show floor, everybody I see, I say, come on over.  And we only have about, I don't know, they're going to throw us out soon.  Only a few more minutes, but let's say hi.  Yeah, I'll get you, Robbie.  Calm down.  Calm down.  Poor Robbie.  He's looking at me because last year, he didn't make it either.  He's been waiting a whole year to be on the podcast.  But I want to talk about Neophyte.  Ben is here.  Ben, introduce your partner for Neophyte.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Ben Friedman and Tiffany Young.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hi, Tiffany.  Nice to meet you.  So it's kind of, it's another tech podcast, but an interesting twist on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a tech show for beginners, and it's a debate show.  I'm kind of the geek.  And, you know, if it's got LEDs and blinks, I like it generally.  Tiffany's more of the realist, so she'll tell you if it's actually worth money or not.  Every day, five days a week, we record a new show, and it's a new gadget, whether it's an iPod or whether it's,  can I say that?  Sorry.  Whether it's a media player or whether it's a, you know, a coffee maker or a new vacuum or anything,  any new bit of technology, you know, we'll talk about it and see if something's worth the money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I kind of like the consumer reports of the podcast.  That's a great idea.  Well, do we still use podcasts?  You can use anywhere you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Internet TV.  So what we try to do is we try to reach the general media that's not over the top techie.  So we're able to talk about things such as vacuums, like Ben said.  And I can say, Ben, you know, he's like, oh, it's so cool.  It's got this real cool suction.  And you've got the real world point of view.  And I'm like, are you kidding me?  This is a joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you know, it's all your fault, Leo, because six months ago I called your show and said,  hey, I love your podcast.  You know, what should I do if I start one?  And you said, start one right now.  You'll be rich in six months.  Oh, sorry.  Where's my money, Leo?  Where's my money?  That's what I want to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Don't forget to watch Dexter on Showtime, 10 o'clock.  Hey, good luck.  It's great to see you.  Thanks for coming by.  Appreciate it.  And come on up here.  We got Craig Severson.  Why don't you come up here?  Robbie, you come up.  Come on, Robbie.  Don't be shy.  Robbie is the youngest podcaster here.  Am I wrong?  No, wait a minute.  I met a five-year-old podcaster earlier.  Podcasts with his family, though.  Robbie, how old are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm 14.  15 in November.  How exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And you're part of the Teen Podcast Network?  Yeah.  What's that called?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  TeenPodcasters.com

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  TeenPodcasters.com.  How many of you are there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We started with 75, and we recently renewed membership,  and now, unfortunately, we're down to 30.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But they're all doing podcasts?  Yes.  I think that's great.  That's very cool.  Isn't that exciting?  That is really cool.  You see all the time teenagers are doing web pages.  Isn't that great?  Yeah.  But it's really neat to see that also media,  rich media like video and audio.  This is your natural tongue.  You're completely comfortable with it, right?  Yeah.  Now, the last time we talked, you were kind of  taking time off from the podcast.  Have you gotten back?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, I still am a little.  I'm just trying to, I'm working my way into TPN,  starting to do new projects, stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's neat.  So if you're a teen podcaster,  TeenPodcasters.net or com?  Net.  No, com.  Com.  Com, not net.  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, Robbie, I got you on.  Hand the mic over to the video, the video grunt.  Craig Severson is grunt media.  Yes, sir.  And you're doing, have you ever seen,  isn't this the best video podcast ever?  This guy is so great.  Really inventive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got to pay another 20 bucks if you keep doing that.  No, no, no.  But I bet, Doug,  Twit doesn't own me, but I do look forward to  watching some Showtime programming on my new Dell laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, while we're mentioning that,  you might want to visit dell.com slash twit.  This is ridiculous.  This is ridiculous.  I don't want to sell out that big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We'll put a commercial in later.  How about that?  My next show is going to be This Week in Grunt.  Is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Twig would be good.  Hey, why not?  You do have a podcast grunt.  You're starting to do audio as well as video.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And this teaches people how to do it, right?  Right.  I'm trying to explain with Podgrunt.  My attempt was to explain what a podcast is to my mother-in-law.  And she got it.  So it works.  I don't use any scary abbreviations in this explanation,  but my whole point is to explain complex things very simply  in video files that are less than five minutes long.  Excellent.  It's a beautiful podcast.  Thank you.  Highly recommended.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hand the mic over, speaking beautiful, to my newest twit,  ladies and gentlemen.  I'd like to introduce Denise Howell,  who is a very well-known legal blogger  and the host of the new Twill, which is done.  But if Leo would just get off his duff and put it out,  it would be out there.  Welcome, Denise.  It's nice to meet you.  It's great to be here.  Yeah.  We're excited.  Tell us what Twill is going to be all about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Twill, this week in law, is going to examine issues,  much like you often discuss on Twitter,  legal issues that relate to the technology world.  We're going to have a semi-irregular panel of folks  who are going to join me, including Ernie Svensson,  who writes the Ernie the Attorney blog,  Kathy Kirkman, who writes the Silicon Valley Media Law blog  and is a partner at Wilson-Sansini and Palo Alto,  and John Palfrey, who's a professor at Harvard Law School  and the executive director of the Berkman Center  for Internet and Society there.  So we've got some really great folks  that are going to weigh in on this stuff,  who know a whole lot about it.  And there's me kind of wrangling them all.  And our first guest, once that show gets edited and posted,  is Hank Berry of Hammer Windblad,  who's a venture capitalist and also the former CEO  of a little company you may have heard of called Napster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, Hank is fascinating.  It's a really good interview, a really good panel.  I look forward to getting that out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, we're real excited about the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  As soon as I get home, Denise.  Yeah.  It's great to have you on board the Twitter army.  Are we allowed to continue?  Is Bonnie around?  Bonnie, I have how much more?  Ten minutes?  Ten minutes.  Five minutes?  Ten seconds.  Ten.  Ten.  Twenty.  Twenty.  Thank you.  Thank you, Bonnie.  And thank you to Tim Berkwin and the Podcast Brothers.  Tim has a podcast of his own, which is really great,  with his brother, Emil, and then of course,  is the organizer of this event.  Very kindly, they're letting us occupy the stage  a little bit longer because we had quite a bit  of a technical snafu.  Franklin Harris, why don't you come up here,  since he was the guy who helped us.  Help you to untangle.  You can hand off the microphone, Denise.  Thank you.  Frank is with techfile.ca, and we're recording  on your Edderall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Let's hope it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, you're in trouble if it doesn't.  Well, actually you won't because nobody will know.  No one will know this existed.  The amazing Twitch 71.  There'll be 10,000 people who are here who saw it happen.  You won't believe it, but it's lost forever to the ages.  You know, that's a good...  It happens.  I'm thinking maybe that's not a bad idea.  We could lose all the episodes.  An urban myth.  Yeah.  An urban myth, Twitch.  Yeah.  So tell us about techfile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Well, we're still producing, doing our interview.  We're still alive.  We're still alive.  We made it this far.  We worked on a little bit of a hiatus for a while.  A slight pod fade.  That's right.  I had some family commitments I had to take care of,  but they're back and I'm still doing my thing,  interviewing podcasters and trendsetters  in IPTV and podcasting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a great show.  I've been on it many times.  Numerous times.  In fact, Steve and I in our hotel room.  Wait a minute.  Never mind.  Twice.  Twice in a hotel room.  Yeah.  Hey, Chuck Tomasi is here too.  Chuck Chat.  Come on up, Chuck.  Because I'm trying to get all the great tech podcasters on too.  Chuck Chat is another one of those podcasts  that's been around for a very long time.  How long have you been doing Chuck Chat now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  December 2004.  Some Friends in Tech lapel pins for you gentlemen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Tell us about Friends in Tech.  It's a network of tech podcasts, yeah?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Friends in Tech is a loose knit network of friends  just out to have a good time, cooperation, camaraderie,  and work together without any real strong commitment of  got to have a show out every week,  got to have postings on the blog,  but it just comes naturally, organically.  We're having a good time and we enjoy it.  So say we all.  Ronald DeMore this morning.  They're all over there.  Did you see them?  You see the Sea of Black shirts over there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  As Vince Gulley would say, a sea of black.  One of the things I talked about this morning in the keynote was  we are all in cooperation with each other.  We're not yet at the stage where we have to say,  boy, Chuck's success is our detriment or anything like it.  There's a vast sea of listeners.  None of us have reached yet in anything we can do  to reach that sea of listeners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although I do have a story to share with you, Leo.  I was doing an audio tour at EAA in Oshkosh, Wisconsin,  the great fly in they do every year.  And I was interviewing the pilot of the B1B bomber  that was part there.  And he said, could I interview you for an internet radio show?  He goes, podcast?  He knew what a podcast was, which is a good step.  So the word is getting out there.  Just a quick show of a clap of hands,  applause for armed forces people that are out there.  Yes, you bet.  Working hard.  And he said, do you listen to twit?  And I said, listen to it.  I've been on it.  I've been on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know what really scares me is the number of air pilots  who listen to twit.  I get email all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  You realize they listen to twit while they're flying.  Some of them are listening right now in the air,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  flying a plane.  Please pay attention.  Yeah.  Look, look, look, look.  No, there's I get an email from a Qantas pilot the other day  because we were talking about whether you could bring  laptops on it.  So we've eased those restrictions.  In fact, I got a number of messages from pilots who said,  you know, it's okay now or we have some limitations.  At the time, Qantas wasn't letting you plug in a Dell  or a Mac because of the exploding batteries.  And I think they've eased that a little bit now.  It's not quite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It's not that enforceable anyway.  I mean, Virgin told me I couldn't and then I did anyway.  And how would they know?  They don't even know whether I was what kind of computer  I was using.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exploding batteries.  How many exploding batteries did you hear about a year ago?  All of a sudden, they're all blowing up.  What's the deal?  What are they using?  Organic animal parts from China in these things?  Is the electrolyte?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a fat driven battery.  Well, thank you, Chuck.  Appreciate your support.  Hey, can I get Matt up here real quickly?  Chuckchat.com  Chuckchat.com  Chuckchat.com  Chuckchat.com  We owe a lot to Cashfly who provides bandwidth  for some of the Twitch podcasts,  including the variations of a Twitch.  The not AOL provides a bandwidth for the MP3 version of Twitch  and has since day one.  But when we started doing originally we're doing  AAC and low bit rate MP3s via BitTorrent.  And that proved to be real.  I mean, if podcasting is hard, BitTorrent's worse.  But Cashfly stepped forward and said, you know,  you can use our service and we're very grateful.  In fact, many of the new podcasts we're launching,  including this week in law, will be launching on Cashfly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I appreciate it.  I mean, it's weird because you guys are definitely  one of our more popular netcasts.  I mean, we do Dignation, all the Revision 3 shows.  And it's weird, every show you add,  your traffic just goes tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes.  Yeah, and actually you're hosting the new Windows podcast  with Paul Therotte, Windows Weekly.  You told me the other day it was half a gig,

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  half a gig of it a second.  Yeah, about 550 megabits a second or so you're pushing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know how we do that.  That's amazing.  I don't know how you do that.  That's really amazing.  So we thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Really appreciate Cashfly.  Cashfly is one of the really great organizations.  They stepped forward when Revision 3  didn't have enough bandwidth to get its system.  The new system came out and everything crashed.  And Matt and Cashfly came forward right away.  And so we really appreciate the help.  Who else?  I promised this guy, Craig, push him up here.  I promised other people a chance to get up here.  And I can't remember who I invited up.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Podcast 411.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, podcast.  It's Robert Walsh.  Oh my God, I don't know what you look like.  So I didn't know it was you.  This is one of the great podcasters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I've only heard your voice, Rob.  It's nice to meet you.  You don't look anything like I suspected.  And then they make a really weird face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, that's something radio people put up with  with the year for years, right, Scott?  It's a really depressing thing.  We meet people and they go, oh, gosh,  your voice sounds so much better than you.  Look, it's a depressing thing.  How long have you been doing Podcast 411?  December 2004.  Long time.  And you've interviewed pretty much everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  All the keynotes here, plus all the podcasters of the year  and quite a few other podcasters  that people probably never have heard of.  And that's the best part is the ones  that people have never heard of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Did you do Rob Moore, who did the keynote  of Battlestar Galactica keynote?  I had Ronald on in May.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  He was really fun to talk to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wasn't that a great keynote?  I've become a fan of Battlestar Galactica.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And for Eureka people, I just had Colin Ferguson on  from Eureka, who does a podcast for Eureka.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So they're starting to get the message  that this is a great way to market, to get the word out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And especially to that sort of audience.  The geeks.  Yes.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, they know, don't they?  Yeah. And Colin, he was actually going  to create the podcast on his own.  The Sci-Fi Channel found out about it  and said, oh, no, no, no, we'll help you.  We'll send you the same recorder they send Ron Moore.  Neat.  You're kidding.  That's neat.  That's really neat.  But he gives a lot of good behind the scenes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's fun.  Well, what Ron does basically is what you would get on the DVD.  But the day of, right?  The director's commentary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And probably more authentic and real too.  I mean, if he's got a cigarette in one hand  and booze in the other.  I may tell you, those silons.  And I hate them.  You're not going to hear anyone really criticize  their certain scene in a DVD movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  He mentioned he was smoking.  But what he didn't mention when he mentioned my interview  was that people were sending emails wondering  what he was smoking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And it is cigarettes for the record.  I'm sure it was.  Not that we would encourage that behavior  That would be Nate and Die if you want to hear that other.  Nate and Die, they promote it heavily.  A little bit.  So what's next for a podcast 411?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oh, I want to have Denise on.  Good.  Now that she's got a podcast.  I've been waiting for her to do a podcast.  I've been Denise for over a year.  Have you?  Really?  Oh, that's great.  That's good.  Yeah, matter of fact, when I did the interview with you,  I recommended.  That's how I found Denise.  One of many.  One of many.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  A lot of people suggested Denise Howell.  And yeah, we're really glad to have her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I actually have another podcast at IT Conversations  that's called Sound Policy.  So you could have interviewed me before, Robert.  But that's OK.  I forgot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, you were on IT Conversations.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But actually, your name just came up in the legal panel  here at the Expo.  Dun dun dun.  No, in a very good way.  That you're actually putting release agreements  for your guests and things up as an online form.  Is that right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  What I do, every interview, I do an audio release.  At the start of the interview, and I say,  I'm now recording.  We're not yet in the show.  When I say, welcome to the show, we start.  I edit heavy.  At any point you want to take something out, you tell me.  Otherwise, everything's fair game.  Feel free to start over.  And that's the beauty of audio editing.  Right.  And that it's not live.  Because sometimes I do interview companies.  I've had Pachow on.  I've had Yahoo on.  I'm trying to get Apple on.  And you want to make sure that they feel comfortable  when they're on the show.  And when you do the editing, that you don't get sued at the end  for making it not what it was.  Right.  Which would be Bob Parsons from GoDaddy.  They definitely took advantage of that opportunity  to ask me to take things out.  Oh, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  So now, Denise scared the pants off.  Well, no.  She gave me the willies.  I'm sorry.  I didn't want to be...  Because I was at her lecture yesterday  about all the legal ramifications of stuff we do.  And we haven't done it.  We haven't protected ourselves in any form or fashion.  I didn't ask you for a release before I put you on here.  I don't edit a thing.  Whatever you say goes out.  And so if anybody has a problem, please call Denise Howell  because she's our new counsel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And just remember, we have no money.  We have no money.  We have no money.  Don't bother suing anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Speaking of which, I'd like to remind you  this podcast brought to you by Visa.  If you are...  Actually, it isn't.  I think we're done with the Visa thing.  So forget I said that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  MasterCard.  No, don't say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But it is brought to you by Dell.  And we do want to thank the folks at Dell  for providing us with support for the podcast.  And remind everybody, we've got some great picks  on our website at twit.tv slash Dell.  That's the Leo's Picks page.  And if you're buying at Dell, visit there first.  And then go through there  and then everybody will be happy, including me.  Especially me.  Especially me.  twit.tv slash Dell.  We thank them for their support of this podcast.  I think we're going to wrap things up.  We're running out of time.  It's been really great.  Thank you, Rob.  We'll look forward to the next podcast, 411.  Podcast, the number four, number one, number one.  .com  .com  .com.  .com.  .com.  .com.  .com.  .com.  .com.  .com.  .com.  .com.  .com.  That's not easy, ladies and gentlemen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And it's going to stay podcast, 411.  Although I did register blogcast 411.  Oh, did you?  When Microsoft was going around about blogcast.  And then there was what, NanoCast?  Yeah.  Yeah, so every six months, people want to change the name.  And then GoDaddy has this big spike in domain name registrations.  And at the end of the day, the only one that gets happy about the name change is Bob Parsons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's all a conspiracy on Bob Parsons' part to get the names changed.  Well, I didn't register net anything.  So you don't have to either.  If you want to read Denise's blog, it's a really great legal blog.  What's the URL for that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's at bagandbaggage.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And you have a Vox blog.  It was so, it was great.  I was watching, I was looking over Denise's shoulder at the podcast academy yesterday  and she's blogging.  It's really great.  It's really neat that you can just.  Yeah, it's fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I use that basically just to throw up YouTube clips and things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We saw a great clip.  Tim from French Maids TV showed that was hysterical clip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was, it was an NBC promo.  From YouTube.  From YouTube that NBC is uploading intentionally to YouTube to promo its shows.  And it's so funny and it's so great.  And, you know, a model for anybody in the corporate world who wants to see  what a good, funny, compelling promo looks like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, self-mocking.  And that was what was great about it.  It wasn't self-serious.  It mocked itself.  And that's really important.  I think that's kind of part of the culture here is we don't,  we don't take ourselves that seriously.  And when that big network executive comes on,  it takes itself seriously.  That's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And Tim will be a guest on it.  I just interviewed him.  So he'll be coming up on the podcast for one in about two weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's really great podcast to listen to.  It's like kind of the actor's studio where you really get to hear the behind the scenes.  Scott Bourne is at.  We actually, let's make a little announcement.  What do you say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm very happy to announce that the iLife Zone, which you've maybe heard of or not,  is now formally part of the twit podcast.  Very happy to have you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's the podcast time warp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And we really want to thank everybody who sat through all of the technical difficulties  getting this running.  There would be no podcasting without all of you as podcasters.
