So if yep, and usually they file that yeah  Yeah, they file the story about the first thing they saw coming in the door  That's why you saw the vibrating haptic fork three years ago because it was the first thing  And it never became a product by the way. Nobody wanted  Last when we went in 2020 the last one before kovat  It was a toilet roll robot at the front door everybody caught remember that one right? Yeah, and it never comes out  it's not a real product, but they spent ten grand and  Claude pepper got his or whatever his name is got his money  they have chocolate fountains and food because journalists are whores for food and  And it's I think it's kind of scammy to be honest

I believe the other stuff also like they have a whole suite  Okay  So this is this idea of smart things getting built into your home like into the home infrastructure  I saw lots of people this is less sexy  But everybody and their dog now has what like a fin or a water home monitoring and shutoff thing  Which actually is hugely valuable. Those are cool because they detect leaks without knowing where the leak is  It's amazing how that they detect leaks. Yeah, I saw that a couple of years ago many of them have  Auto shut off what we saw at ces this year was tons of companies now offering it not to consumers but to home builders  And so smart. Yep  It's smart, but it's also a little weird because you're like hey  Um, if your builder's gonna offer this, how do you get the app? How do you resell it? What is the what is the it's?

Start time: 2097.70
End time: 2121.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And it's unfortunate because a lot of these are quite like I actually my my fin water thing fin is brilliant plugged in  Yeah  Well, these are these are actually I the things here are actually easier because you don't have to install them yourself  They already come with your house. So you have the app but you do have to connect it  But when you like I don't know how long that's going to work right now  I've had my fin for three years in two or three it might go out, you know

End time: 2270.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I wouldn't so you will see  So and there were tons of things like this  We've actually seen smart breaker boxes at cd and some other places in the last few years  What's coming to a head is the it's a trifecta. It's climate change  Causing us to need like resilience with like power outages and everything else  Um, it is electrification. So as climate change worsens, we're all buying more electric and we're putting more  We're requiring more amps employing more electricity from our homes and things like that. Yeah heat pumps. Yes and evs  And whatever else that's right. And then the unreliable  unreliability the non  The dynamic dynamic dynamism. This is why I don't do video. This is why i'm a writer  The dynamic the dynamic nature of renewable energy means we're going to have to store and use the load  At times when it's convenient for us, even though the sun may not be shining or the wind blowing  So all those three trends are coming together and what's happened and what has really hit the ground running this year  Is we're seeing a lot of solutions to store the energy  To manage the load either at the breaker box or with samsung's talking about their smart things like energy ai platform  and we also saw  The home connectivity alliance, which is a group of appliance companies getting together  to pitch ways to  Interoperate in the cloud  Like have your washing machine  Talk to your water pump and then be able to control  For a utility to control all of the washing machines or dryers out there to lower their temperature during oh interesting.

I've used them. They work fantastically  Very common in europe.

So this thing is smart enough to know that someone's sleeping  And it'll do the other thing is smart enough to know is that if someone moves but it's not a big enough move to turn on the  The panic light it won't turn it on so it won't get tricked by breathing or the cat walking in stuff according to sure

Support that you need to do to actually run them. I suspect people are going to basically pick the devices they want  Just stick with those and a lot of these are going to get left, you know in in the garbage

No, I don't so  So that's where I think we'll see more value a lot of that and there is value in downloading the app  You know setting it up so you can talk to it like voice is great in the kitchen  I tell my oven to preheat, you know if I told my mixer to like, you know

I mean, yes, and you get used to them and you will keep them  but so I think  People will add them ad hoc which is why interoperability is so important. And if it's useful they'll keep using it. Otherwise  Right the first time it falls off like my dryer fell off line like  After the second or third time my dryer fell off line.

It looks nice and green when we send it up your way  Our show today brought to you by i'm happy to say our great friends at express vpn when lisa and I  Were in mexico this past week  We really wanted to watch thursday night football on on amazon  and uh  And I said, oh  I know what to do  Express vpn fired that sucker up. I said, I think we're in miami tonight  We were able to watch the football game  Express vpn is the best vpn service out there for a number of reasons first of all  They are absolutely pure as the driven snow  They do not collect they do not log they do not collect any information about you and they go the extra mile to make sure your privacy is  100 percent they use a custom debian distribution on all their servers all over the world  That refreshes itself every day wipes the drive and starts over when you go to an express vpn server  When we went to that server in miami press the connect button on the express vpn app  It spun up in an entirely new instance of their trusted server software runs in ram and it is completely  Isolated from the rest of the system. It's it's it's uh,  Firewalled off so that it cannot write to the disk. It's sandboxed. So it cannot write to the disk  Uh, and then when you're done you close the express vpn  And poof it's gone and there's no trace  Of your presence now, that's what you need in the vpn server virtual private network  They do three things one  Of course they improve your security on open wi-fi actually we kept express vpn open the whole time at the hotel  Because we're on hotel wi-fi, but I knew I felt secure  And the nice thing about leaving express vpn on is they invest in their servers they invest in their bandwidth  So they you never feel like you're sluggish. You're slow. We're able to watch hd video  just fine  And and and you do it also to protect your privacy because even your internet service provider is collecting data and selling it on to data  Brokers those data brokers are one of the most vile things that has happened in this internet era  They collect information about you from all sorts of sources your browsing history your online searches your location data then sell it off  to the highest bidder

It's the only one I use express vpn  100 of your traffic is encrypted, of course  And your privacy is guaranteed make sure your online activity and data is protected with the best vpn money can buy. It's not expensive  less than seven bucks a month  When you get our special offer  And I think that's well worth it to have that kind of privacy security  And occasionally to watch a you know, maybe watch a little anime from netflix japan  Express vpn.com slash twit if you go there right now three extra months through our special link  exp ress vpn.com slash  Twit please use that address so that they know you saw it here.

He tied the leaving last pass  Earlier today on ask the tech guy. We we talked about how to export your data from last pass, but also the risks  um, I don't there is a a lawsuit  which the uh  Plaintiff hopes to turn into a class action lawsuit. I don't think he's got class status yet  He claims he lost I think fifty three thousand dollars because of the last the last pass breach  We don't know much about what happened because last pass hasn't been super forthcoming  um, but

End time: 4859.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean they have to crack those vaults. They are encrypted using uh  AES-256. Yeah, although uh, steve talked about this early on when last pass first started  Years ago and when we first started talking about them, they were using  A hashing function called pbkdf2 to hash the passwords  to hash the passwords or the master password and  Only 500 iterations or maybe it was 5 000, but it was far. It was fine  Then 5 000 was fine then but 5 000 today is way too low  It really does open you up to brute forcing last pass advanced that to 100  100 a couple of years ago, but not everybody got automatically advanced and we and we don't know the last pass vault that was  The vaults that were exfiltrated. We don't know when they were backed up or how many of them had  The the higher number of hashes  You need at least 100 000 these days. In fact, OWASP recommends 300 000 iterations  Uh of pbkdf2  To protect your master password. So there is some real concern legitimate. I think real concern that  What's going to happen now that this we don't know when it happened. We don't know how much they got  Steve I said crown jewels it's the one thing that they have to protect

Start time: 4874.78
End time: 4902.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's the same with last pass same with last pass. The problem is there are a couple problems here  Uh, once you have the vault you can apply every bit of brute force you wish right  Now if it's well, if you had a good master password  That was really long  And if it was properly hashed probably you're okay  but  There are going to be people out there who's master password because you have to remember it  Remember is monkey one two three.

Transcript:  Once you're using a password manager, the good news is from now on you use  Each password is a new fresh password just for that site and it's long and strong and non-memorable  But you do still have to have that master password and you still have to remember that and you enter it all the time  um  I asked steve. I said look I use a yubikey. I've used a yubikey for years to for two two factor  If people use two factor, are they safer? And he said no, unfortunately  He said the the person who has these vaults  Doesn't need the two factor to un to get your master password and open the vault  That's only for you when you're logging in or if a bad guy's logging in on your machine  Then the two factor is handy. So we're pretty vulnerable  I I don't know what's going to happen  But I I wonder if we're going to start to see over the next few months more and more people say oh  i've you know my  Somebody's got my passwords

Transcript:  Um, well wait now I thought okay, so this may be me being confused. I thought the thing about  For instance for one password  Even if you know the master password when you first put it on a machine before you could do anything  You got to get through the secret key. Yeah, that's because actually stored there. That's that's because

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, you're not alone in fact, one of the reasons we've been talking about it on all the shows is because I want people to understand  the risks here  If they have your vault  If you had a last pass account and by the way because they haven't been forthcoming on  Okay, they said somebody got our vault backups  Okay, but when were they backed up from were they from a year ago two years ago last month?  They didn't say I had a last pass account for years. I deleted my vault about two years ago  But if the backup predated that then they have my vault, right?

Start time: 5076.64
End time: 5080.78

Start time: 5081.02
End time: 5118.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, now i'm hoping I deleted my vault and it wasn't in the backup this guy got  But for many people who are using last pass now or whoever used last pass at this point  You're just crossing your fingers or you do what i've told everybody by the way, we use last pass enterprise here  So we're we're still last pass users  Uh, my wife uses it. I said lisa what you have to do at this point is change  All your passwords the most important passwords start with the ones that don't have two factor  Those have to be changed and then if you are using two factor  Well, that's good news because the bad guy would still have to use two factor to get into your bank or whatever  But you should eventually change that as well

Start time: 5120.38
End time: 5134.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, that's a lot of work. You gotta remember to change them change them like in a time basis as well  Because if you're okay, like for instance if you're using all the password managers tell you like every couple of months that you should change  These passwords that's wrong by the way. No, and I think that's wrong

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but but that's what I was thinking. I was thinking the backup would be old right?  So that even if they got the password, they're still wrong, right?  But yeah, most people don't change it unless you have but i'm certain let me point this out

Transcript:  Whatever the master password was when that vault was backed up. That's still the master password no matter what you do  You're not changing that vault. You're only changing your current vault the one the bad the vault the bad guys brought home  It's whatever the password was then it's whatever the pbk df2 iterations were then  It's however weak it was then nothing you do today will make that go away  Except changing all the passwords in that old vault so that if they do break into it, they can't break into your stuff  It's kind of a mess  Um, it's a huge mess.

Transcript:  I've got to say this really sort of brings back the the importance of occasionally analog password stuff  Absolutely. Yeah, really important passwords. I don't put them in a password manager  I write them down and I hide them somewhere in the house  In a way that in somewhere that thieves would never look i.e books  So, you know if there's a book in there and it's got your passwords in it and then just update them at the time  And you don't have to put those key passwords out there

Start time: 5248.80

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll never forget going to target and looking in the notebook section and there's a notebook nice tall one that says passwords on it  It didn't know  Leaf but honestly  The the old folks like my mom who've been writing down their passwords. They're safer because you'd have to break into your house  As long as she didn't reuse them and made good ones. They're actually safer  So and that's one reason a number of people and i'm going back and forth on this  Uh, our sponsor bitwarden lets you host your own vault so that it's not in the bitwarden

Start time: 5283.46
End time: 5290.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Start time: 5290.86
End time: 5300.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That yeah, that's why i've always let last pass and now bitwarden host it because I figure well  They're security gurus, but that didn't work out so well for last pass users

Start time: 5300.98
End time: 5304.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I mean yes for something like that. It's a one-time thing

Start time: 5305.92
End time: 5350.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Also, the thing that the risk is that last pass is a cent is a single point of failure, right?  They have them all right  If it's you and it's on dropbox somebody has to be going after your drop box and getting your vault there and they still have  To go through the decryption process. So  I've changed my tune. I used to say let them host it because they're experts  I'm not and I could do something stupid  But now i'm thinking maybe you have an advantage of a little bit of security through obscurity by not having your vault  In a central location you'd have to run a last unless you're someone like a journalist  Yeah, what do you do? Like what do you do if you're vulnerable?  There you're gonna be really you have a higher risk. Well, that's what I mean  Yeah, what if yeah, what if you're you know, it depends on what your your threat profile is  But if you're a dissident or a journalist or you live somewhere where it's not okay to be you

Transcript:  But then what do you do?  Well, I mean I was part of the google's advanced  Uh protection system that they introduced for journalists when they first brought it out  So you've got a ubiqui and you've got a bluetooth thing and you have to log in, you know if you're coming in  To your existing account on a new computer. You've got to have this with you. Otherwise you're locked out  It's a bit of a pain in the ass if you actually lose the key  but  It's actually a pretty good security system  but  you know for mass market  People just don't do this. I mean  Google introduced two-factor authentication for gmail, for example  And 10 years later less than 20 percent of people were actually using it. They actually started forcing people didn't they?  Yeah, they had to because as I say  This is not that people want convenience not security  Um, and this is part of the problem I have with password managers  In that it sounds like a great solution until the last pass thing happens  And then it all goes to hell so

Start time: 5414.44
End time: 5425.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I I have to say even if you're using last pass, you're still better off  In most cases because most users reuse passwords  Yep  And that's the worst case. It's true, right?

Transcript:  It's true. Yeah, there's this thing on netflix right now  It's called kaleidoscope and it's an interesting show premise because you could jump in at any one of the I think 12 episodes  You can watch them in any order but it tells like, you know the story of a heist  From like multiple angles and one of the things they had in there  Which was really funny is that the guy who they're trying to break into his vault. He had a gate detection  So the vault is down the hallway and as you're walking down the hallway  It knows it's not him because everybody has a unique gate. Oh gate like g-a-i-t like how you walk

End time: 5691.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're just sitting I find one of the strangest things to me and this is maybe it's not the problem where you live  But here locally many of the state or local services that I have to log in to do something  They still have like eight to sixteen character password limits  And i'm like really crazy and i'm like, yo  You're the city like tax office right or the conveyance office and I can't make a complicated password  so those ones  are  probably some of the first level that these people who are into this kind of like, uh,  IT sec stuff get into is going through  Everybody has to deal with their state local entities at some point and a lot of them still have weak password requirements and it's super obnoxious  So I would hope that somewhere on a federal level after enough people get in trouble  Uh, maybe they should fix that sort of thing, you know, and they're still yelling at the big tech which I get but  They gotta look at their own.

They often show up as the top of search results  They can look identical to the brands. They're impersonating  You know all of these this ad sales stuff is automated, right? There's no person saying  Oh, let me see. Would you like to buy an ad at the top of the search?  All right, it'll be fifty dollars. It's all completely automated. So that means bad guys can take advantage of it  Malicious ads are also used to trick victims into stalling malware designed disguised as genuine apps  the FBI's  recommendation  Install an ad blocker  So I agree install an ad blocker don't block our ads

So this is going to be a big issue.

That's exactly right  Remember the camera used to get in and you shut the door and it goes like this. Oh god, I thought they got rid of that  Yeah, they had to because it was like you was choking me  So it's funny because the idea is great  But can we ever just think it all the way through so we have a way so that it works and it works

And that's that's the  I mean, yeah  Jeff does this a lot on this week in google and he's he's constantly like we can't make laws because it'll hurt these people  it might and we have to like we have to stop thinking about laws as like a universal good and start thinking of them as  trade-offs between yes different  Competing factions.

What do you get?  No ads to start with ad free versions of every one of our shows plus shows you can't get  uh  Elsewhere like our hands on macintosh show with micah sergeant hands on windows with paul therot the untitled linux show the giz fizz is  now in the club  Uh, we use the club to launch shows too this week in space launched so to speak  Out of club twit that twit plus feed has material that you can't get anywhere else including stuff before and after shows  And then of course, there's our wonderful club twit discord, which is a social network in its own right a wonderful  place to hang out  Marmite not included.

It's of course completely optional every question is optional as well  Go to twit tv slash survey 23 it runs through the rest of the month  But if you would do that sooner than later, that would be great because I know it's easy to forget and put these things off  twit.tv slash survey  Hey everybody leo laporte here. I'm the founder and one of the hosts at the twit podcast  Network.

They're part of the shows  In fact often they're such a part of our shows that our other hosts will chime in on the ad saying yeah  I love that or just the other day  One of our hosts said man. I really gotta buy that  That's an additional benefit to you because you're hearing people our audience trusts saying yeah, that sounds great  We deliver always over deliver on impressions.
