Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pretty quiet last night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Got partners put together.  This is twit this week at tech episode 84 for January 14th, 2007 on I'm home.  They're back from Vegas. Our protocols have returned and now it's time to talk CES on TWIT.  Let's start with somebody who's never been on twit before but is an old friend from the tech TV days, Han Choi.  Hey Han, it's good to talk to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's been a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's been ages.  It's been ages, yeah.  And you're doing in digital now, I know, which is really great.  That's a video podcast on revision three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yep, yep, keeping busy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you guys do stuff from CES for that show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, we actually did two episodes.  We were there for four days, like the full four days at CES.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then later I want to talk about your, the home entertainment contest because that's a great contest.  Yeah, that was fun.  And I agreed with your choices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, well, yeah.  Well, you got to watch the show to get the results, but I was a little disappointed with the results.  You were?  Yeah.  Well, you know, maybe I'll reveal a little bit of it.  I was a little disappointed.  Yeah, because when Prager comes on, he never reveals anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I know. He doesn't tell you.  He's pretty closed mouth.  Anyway, it's great to have you on and we'll talk about, I think mostly this show is going to be about CES.  We did so much coverage on the twit network for Macworld.  I mean, at last count, we've posted 19 podcasts about Macworld in four days.  And I think there are about five or six more.  So we have enough about the iPhone already.  Okay.  Joining us also, Corey Doctorow.  Great to have you there.  Thanks for joining us from Boing Boing dot net and also the author of a new short story collection called Overclocked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Overclocked stories, the future present.  So is it the present or the future?  Stories of the future present.  I my my my new writerly gimmick is predicting the present.  So it makes being a science fiction writer a lot easier.  You take something in the news like, you know, someone announcing that they're that they're using Mexican sweatshops to  produce labor for gold farming and multiplayer worlds.  And you write a story about it.  And then as that phenomenon grows, every time there's a new story about it, someone writes to you and says,  you predicted this, man, you totally predicted this.  Except that it was going on.  You started it.  That's right. I predicted it after it started.  It was it was tough, but I did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you think about it, I mean, that things like that are so futuristic in science fiction that they make perfect premises for sci fi.  I mean, people people actually working to make gold for people in World of Warcraft.  And there's and this is a booming economy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Absolutely. And you know, whether or not the stories that surround this are a mixture of truth and fiction.  And the nice thing about writing science fiction about that is that you don't have to worry about which they are because, you know,  this is sort of this kind of dark artists around is swirling with rumors and so on.  So they say that, you know, in parts of China, the rice harvest didn't come in this time because rice farmers had figured out that  they could make more money farming gold. I don't even care whether that's true.  It's so cool. Right. So as a science fiction writer, I don't have to care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just a great premise. I love it. Yeah. Yeah.  I love it. John C. Dvorak is also here like Hanshoy.  John was in Las Vegas for the Consumer Electronics Show.  Did you go to Macworld when you got back on Thursday at all, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, for a few minutes, I didn't find the show that entertaining.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. I mean, of all of the stuff that went on, certainly CES, of course,  has always had, you know, thousands of product announcements and a lot to do with high-def TV.  And in fact, I'm hoping, you know, we were going to have Robert Heron on because he's our high-def TV expert.  And apparently, Patrick and Roger Chang just pulled up in the van from CES about 10 minutes ago.  And so he's he's helping them offload and we'll get him on as soon as he's done doing that.  Maybe all three of them. But I have to say to me, if you take all of the announcements put together from CES,  none of them got as much press or interest as the iPhone announcement from Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that's you know, I've written about this.  It's always going to be the case because of the number of mavens out there who just whatever Apple does,  they fall over themselves like a bunch of maniacs, you know, just to promote whatever Steve does.  He's got a bunch of people hypnotized. It's pretty obvious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The the absolutely the reality distortion field was on in full force in San Francisco on Tuesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not that the phone wasn't interesting or that the phone got more attention at CES.  In fact, that was kind of the running gag, which is the biggest announcement at CES was Apple's announcement in San Francisco of the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm wondering if Apple should start thinking of it as itself as a consumer electronics company and just go to CES,  you know, give give it up and go to CES next year and the year after both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, I think that'd be crazy, man. You think so?  They've dropped. Well, they dropped the word computer from the name of the company.  They're just Apple now. But but why would they go to CES where they just be one part of the show?  They get to be the whole show and they get all the publicity at CES because the entire like,  you know, electronics reporting universes has got their ears on that week anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I think a lot of people would rather see Steve talk than Bill Gates talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe that's well, you know, the other thing is, is Apple is, you know, that's more of a I mean, it's a trade show.  CES and then Mac World Expo is a consumer show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you have a. Did you go to any keynotes, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I never go to keynotes, never.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Will you go next year when it'll be Bill Gates last CES keynote?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what? I'm wondering whether he's going to even do it next year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So maybe this was the last one. This one should have been the last one.  Boy, what a snooze. I didn't go, of course, but I watched it on TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you can watch these things on the web and they're crowded.  They have a whole bunch of these, you know, fanboys, you know, that show up to these keynotes.  They listen to these guys drone on and on.  It just amazes me that these the people put up with it.  It's usually a big giant advertisement for the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hon, did you go to the Bill Gates?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I feel the same way, John.  I don't go to keynotes because it's whenever they are any kind of major press conference like that,  I just find it well, you're not really showing anything.  You know, they just hide all the stuff that we're going to uncover anyway.  So why bother?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're a couple of things interesting, I thought about what I mean, trying to read tea leaves.  But one thing I mean, they mentioned the Zune, but very briefly.  And what was really surprising is that they said and place for sure is alive and well.  I remember the Zune doesn't support Microsoft's place for sure.  DRM. It looks like Microsoft now has two DRM platforms competing with one another.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think I think Microsoft made a big mistake by not allowing the Zune to support it  because they're pissing off a lot of users and companies are making the hardware that does work for play for sure.  Now you don't have the marketing dollars really pushing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wonder. I got the feeling that Microsoft was saying to these companies, don't worry.  The Zune is just a little experiment.  I mean, Bill's been downplaying the Zune since before it came out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it was a big risk.  Was there a lot of Zune stuff at the show?  The funny thing is I walked by the Microsoft booth and they did have a big corner of the Zune.  They have a bunch of partners lined up to show that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Microsoft had a huge booth that was the size of one of its old Comdex booths.  Huge with all these strategic partners.  I didn't notice any Zune stuff. I suppose there was stuff in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it was in the corner, but no one was there.  The empty corner of the booth was where Zune was.  Yeah, it was pretty. It was funny because it was actually on the busier side of the hall, but it was empty.  I think I saw two people listening to Zune.  Does this surprise anyone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, should we be shocked that we discovered once again that no one out there is looking for a device that will let them do less with their music?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's so hobbled. It's hard to believe that they even...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm totally stunned, Corey, that this would happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And maybe Playz for sure is alive and well.  That is to say it's no more dead than it was before they launched the Zune.  It wasn't particularly a success beforehand.  The thing that gets me is the CE companies that are like...  If Microsoft is Lucy and the football, the CE companies like Toshiba, they're the Charlie Browns who keep running for it.  And Microsoft keeps yanking it away.  They fool them every time.  I've actually got a theory about DRM, which is that it's basically impossible to get people to accept something more restrictive than what they've got.  So if you've got a stake in what happens to the device or the platform, you can't afford to make it super, super restrictive,  because you might make it so restrictive that no one wants it and then you're just out, right?  On the other hand, if you can get someone else to take all the risk,  then your optimal strategy is to take the most restrictive platform and add one quantum of liberty to it.  See if the market will take it if they won't add one more.  This only works if you can get someone else to take all the risk for it.  So you have like the recording industry looking at say DVD and going, well, there's a platform, you know, we couldn't sell it by the viewing.  We couldn't rent it.  We couldn't charge you extra if you were watching it on two players instead of one.  We couldn't make it no loan and then charge more for one that you were allowed to loan and all that stuff.  Maybe we can add those features to music, but we're going to have to do it like one drop at a time.  And we don't want to be down or out when the market says, no, we don't want that.  So we'll just get everyone else like Microsoft and Toshiba to take the risk.  And so we keep seeing these like crumbs of liberty being added to DRM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it an opportunity for Apple at this point to say, hey, we'll take the lead and back off a little bit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, Apple doesn't want, Apple doesn't care about DRM.  Well, the thing Apple likes about DRM isn't that it keeps you from copying music,  it's that it raises the cost of switching to a competitor's product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the most valuable asset.  If you buy tunes for the iPod, you're stuck with the iPod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, if you buy 10 tunes a year for 10 years,  that's a hundred bucks that it costs you when you throw away your iPod and buy a competitor's product.  I mean, that's all they care about.  You got the head of Apple's iTunes project saying that they would keep DRM even if the labels didn't want it.  And when musicians show up and say, like, I'm an indie artist, I don't want any DRM on my music.  Can you sell it through the iTunes music store without the DRM?  Apple says no.  Even when record labels like Warner's show up, you know, Bronfman turns up and says, you know,  we want you to open this up for interoperability.  Apple rebuffs them.  Apple's doing DRM because it's good for Apple.  It has nothing to do with the music.  Good point, Han.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Were there other I mean, was there is there a flourishing mp3 player market minus the iPod?  I mean, there must have been Irover and Sansa and all of these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, it's really the second biggest player.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like the sand is stuff.  I'll be honest with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I like this one myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, well, it's affordable, too.  That's the big thing.  I think they've done the affordable with the capability.  They have lost features and it comes at a good price.  But the real thing is when I was walking around looking at mp3 players, I was like,  I feel like mp3s are like sold 10 years ago.  That's what it feels like.  It's like, oh, you add a new feature, but it still plays mp3, you know?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, there wasn't at that show, there wasn't a lot of you know, in a few years ago,  there was a lot more mp3 stuff.  I think SanDisc and a couple of these other guys who brought out these pretty remarkable  players for very low prices maybe killed the market off.  I saw a lot of what I did see was a lot of whack job USB devices.  You know, they have I have a pen that's an actual pen that has a USB device in it.  It's like something that the spies in the 40s would love.  And there's all kinds of weird stuff like that I noticed.  And you know, this the one thing about CES that we probably should mention right off  at the top is that the show sucks.  It's a huge, miserable show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's unmanageable, you mean?  It's unmanageable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The town is deteriorated and it's terrible and its traffic is ridiculous.  And they're building more now ever since Wynn put up his new building and filled it up.  They all these other wanted or I'd say followers that you know, whatever Steve Wynn does,  let's do that after he succeeds or fails.  And then now so the whole town is being built up again like never before.  There's a thing being built across from the Aladdin Hotel called Project City Center,  which is a which is a city, a literal city they're going to build with condos, its own  fire department, its own police department, nine billion dollar project.  I mean, it's just completely out of control.  And what has to happen at CES more than anything else is they've got to spin off the computer  stuff and make a second show because this show is completely useless as it exists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  From the point of view of a computer trade show or just as a consumer show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, no, as a why spin off the computers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That seems like the smallest part of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Computer stuff out of there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it is.  It is on wheel.  But this year, I must admit they did the one thing they did, which was they moved to the  high end audio stuff.  It used to be a hotel called Lexus Park and it was really far away.  And I never I in five years, I never made it there because it's just too far.  But they should because the other convention was starting later in the week, I guess they  took the Venetian.  So it's a little bit more convenient.  So we managed to cover some of that.  Did you go to the high end?  I didn't make it, but my team made it over there.  They had some pretty you know, they always have insane stuff over there.  You know, two hundred thousand dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's so it always blows me away.  Who is buying two hundred thousand dollars speakers?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the problem with the reason I'm glad I didn't go is because when I leave those  places, I want to destroy my own stereo equipment because it sounds so bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It spoils you.  Yeah.  If you look at what the trend is, I mean, the very real trend now is thanks to the iPod  and MP3s is towards crappy audio.  I mean, we know most people aren't listening to high fidelity anymore.  They're listening MP3s.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I had a couple of years ago.  In fact, I had a meeting with Mission Electronics about this exact same issue and they were  like moaning and groaning about, you know, they have to make their money selling speakers  for computer systems because their normal high end stuff, the regular big speakers that  we used to like to, you know, we kind of lusted after when we were in college.  Nobody's using those things anymore.  These kids are listening to crap and to make it worse is there's all these little devices  that you can plug an iPod into which have two crappy speakers hooked to it.  Sounds like just some like somebody killing a duck.  It's unbelievable.  Nobody cares.  They're happy with it.  They're deaf.  That's why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you think that demographics have anything to do with this?  I hear that, you know, now more than half the world lives in cities and we're all living  in tighter quarters.  I know that when someone asked me, would you like somewhere to actually I'm doing a talk  for a hardware manufacturer and they asked me if they could pay me in hardware and you  know, they make big rack mounted servers.  I don't have anywhere to put a big rack mounted server.  You know, hey, they're cheap.  We'll pay you rack mounts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but I mean, but when you say, oh, listen, if Clipsh offered to give you a big pair of  Clipsh horns, you couldn't use those either.  Where the hell would I put them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can use them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you live in a mansion.  You live in a state.  You own the island of Port Angeles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I live in London most of the time, right?  And you know, when I left, there were three of us living in three adults living in about  480 square feet.  We all listen to headphones now, really.  Yeah, exactly.  I'm a nomad, man.  I don't even buy three and a half inch hard drives anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was at CES, I understand, a subwoofer that was so strong that it actually had to  be bolted to the floor.  Otherwise it would start to walk across the floor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, you're I mean, that's not a new thing.  Years ago, they used to have these things.  In fact, they did again this year.  The Butt Kicker or whatever they call it.  Well, no, yeah, but they have these car speakers that they bring in.  You know, Fosgate, one of these companies, they got like 30,000 watts in a car and they  turn off and blows the windows out of the car and the car's jumping around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and you can hear these guys coming down the street when they use those.  What is the appeal of that?  I don't understand it.  Doesn't it deafen you?  They're deaf.  Isn't there internal organ damage that would be caused by something like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know.  I put a subwoofer in my car and I don't like it.  But I wouldn't put it in my car.  Do you drive down the street going,  Well, no, I try to be good about it.  They are the freeway.  I will, but not in like residential neighborhoods.  Just to keep it nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it might be the Atkins diet, right?  Like if you eat a very, very high meat diet and you really got to keep your colon moving  and you need a technical assist, you need the bowel loosener.  That'll do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait, let me write that down.  I got to trademark that.  Bowel loosener.  That's a good name for a speaker.  It is a good name for a speaker.  You thought the butt kicker was tougher.  You need the bowel loosener.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've had friends throw up from that.  Have you really?  Yeah, the subwoofer was against the back seat and he was sitting in the back rumbling his  stomach all day for a few hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is just awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a little much.  It must have made it a little much, the amount of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One of the big stories at the Big Car, in fact maybe the bigger story at CES this year,  is HD, particularly HD DVD versus Blu-ray.  LG Electronics announced a dual format player, one the best to show from CES.  Was that the most important device there, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think most people would think so.  The one thing I saw-  Did you see it?  Did they have one?  Oh yeah, no, it was there.  It looked like it was, but who knows?  We've been to these shows before and you never know what's really going on.  It seemed to be working and they had a huge, it was just a big, basically it was a showcase  piece at the LG booth, which is a large booth.  The thing is, I'm still skeptical.  I'm not seeing, until I actually see one in my hands, I'm not going to make any, I'm not  going to believe it because I still think there's licensing issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did they announce a price, Han?  Did they say how much it was going to be?  It was $1,200.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay.  Basically, you can buy both.  You can buy the Blu-ray and the HD DVD separately and they'd be the same price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you think it will come down or is that kind of the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, it will eventually come down, but it's just-  Is that right?  I hate the two formats.  I just think it's stupid.  I think they've been, we've been down this road before and they should get rid of it.  But then on the flip, Warner Brothers I heard was working on making a disc that plays in  both.  What's going to happen when that comes out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to declare a winner.  Remember earlier I declared that HD DVD was going to pull ahead this year.  That was my prediction for the year.  And now, boy, here we are 12 days in and I am right because the porn industry has just  announced that it's going to use HD DVD, that they don't feel welcome on the Sony platform.  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a huge platform.  That's all over, baby.  Warner Brothers.  Wasn't that Atomax 2?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wasn't Atomax not licensed to porn companies?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And interestingly, Sony tried to recoup real quickly the Blu-ray, whatever they are, industry  groups said, no, no, no, anyone who makes films, they didn't want to say porn is welcome,  but they said anyone who makes films is more than welcome on the Blu-ray platform.  That wasn't enough.  It was too little, too late.  I think that, that to me, I mean that one stroke, so to speak, could do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, here's what the problem is though.  We need some new device for our computers and Blu-ray is more appropriate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm reluctant to bring this up because I know Cory will start steaming out of his ears,  but that's what you're seeing with these Vista.  We just talked about it on Windows Weekly and Security Now, the Peter Gutman article  about what they've done to Vista to make it capable of playing back premium content.  I presume everybody's going to end up having to do this.  Just really crippled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think you've nailed it there.  I think that it doesn't, that the thing to remember about both of these is that implementing  either of them requires that you go and get a license from the folks who run AACS.  Those people don't want computers that can do anything their owners ask them to do.  They want computers that only do things within some realm of permitted activities.  They want to be sure that you can't modify your computer.  As a result, they're raising the cost of computers astronomically, introducing lots  of new failure modes, sucking up huge amounts of CPU cycles just to make sure that you're  not doing anything naughty with your own computer and making them harder and harder to use in  connection with free and open source software.  Which one will people pick?  I sincerely hope that they pick YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The swing box is getting a lot of traction.  YouTube gets crazy traffic.  A lot of people are still okay with watching lower quality, in a way lower quality than  broadcast.  Apple TV supports high def.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you're going to see devices that support high def.  Of course, that's through Apple's DRM and through Apple's own iTunes, so you're not  really getting away from the content protection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We just got through having this discussion about how people are more than willing to  accept lower quality MP3s for higher flexibility.  I was at conferences 10 years ago, or 8 years ago, where every music executive in the room  said exactly the same thing.  MP3 will die because the music quality isn't high enough.  They were 100% wrong.  It turns out that freedom is more valuable than bit density.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People may go out and buy an HD DVD player, but right now I have an HD DVD player, but  it's 1 in 100th of the content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait, hold on a second on this debate.  They did say that, and there was a bunch of people, but there were also a lot of audiophiles  saying this too.  But from the get-go, especially if you went to a bit rate that was just a little bit higher  than 96, the quality wasn't that bad on MP3s.  I think that from the get-go, the quality of MP3s was surprisingly good.  In fact, especially when you consider the fact that most of the source material people  would be playing would be stuff like a Rolling Stones album, which has crappy quality anyway.  The music is impressed.  It sounds like garbage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The current state of DVD, if you have good upscaling, looks pretty good on a high-def  set.  HD looks better, but is it enough better for people to...  Yeah, I think it is.  It is enough better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it depends on the movie because Sony's favorite demo of Blu-ray is always House of  Flying Daggers.  The way it's shot, most of the background is out of focus anyway.  It's a sharper blurriness.  Who cares?  Exactly.  The way the movie is made, I think...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I use a projector, so when you blow it up to 100 inches, you can see the difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How many people are blowing it up that big?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there's enough of them.  The fact is that you can blow it up pretty big.  I'm not even running 1920 stuff.  It's just a 720p kind of a thing, and it looks really good at 100 inches, but I suppose  if it did 200 inches, it wouldn't look as good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess the question is, are the manufacturers selling lots more tiny screens or lots more  giant screens?  I think the answer is lots more tiny screens.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think they're selling a lot.  I think big ones because rear projection and all that stuff, they're huge and the prices  are pretty affordable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All you have to do is to see the real trend in the country is to go to Costco.  I mean, that's pretty much it.  They don't even have any, except for some small LCDs that are like 27 inches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would also say people are buying all kinds.  They're watching video on their phones.  They're watching video on their computers.  Yeah, that's what I mean.  They're watching video everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But who's sitting down and watching...  Well, there's different experiences.  My name is Earl on their phone.  I don't think it's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they're not, but that's just bad news for people who make feature films because what  they are doing, it's kind of like the debate about eBooks.  People say, well, no one reads off of screens.  Well, that's empirically untrue.  You, me and everyone we know spend every hour God sends sitting in front of a screen in  which there are 10 more in the day.  That's right.  We read shorter form works and it's not that all those works are factual or none of them  are entertaining, but a medium that is as multipurpose as a computer demands things  that require shorter attention spans to consume in the same way that a handheld device does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Speaking at the iPhone and if Apple comes out with a, and I'm sure they will, an iPod  in the same form factor, that looks pretty good.  I'd watch a movie on that in a lot of situations, not at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But Leo, I think you're making a mistake.  You're mistaking the screen quality for the thing that affects your viewing experience  and it's not.  It's the context.  So when you've got a room or a TV, by definition, you have a room with a table on it, in it  with the TV on top of it and a sofa and people don't walk into that room and just start talking  to you.  Right?  It's something you hold in your hand while you move through the world.  Right.  So, yeah, maybe you would, but if you were in a place where you could just sit down and  watch a screen apart from an airplane or the occasional hotel room, chances are you're  at home.  You already have a room where you can watch on a screen.  That's where I'd watch.  So, you know, in the same way that people say, oh, well, I'm merely pointing out that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  we want, we all want a palette of screens.  We don't want just one screen.  We want the screen that fits what we're doing right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And sometimes we already have the palette of screens, but I'm not going to be watching  movies on some little handheld device unless it's an emergency.  Well, I will.  I, and I think you're right.  You say that, but you won't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I do all the time.  I just bought two more movies in the iTunes movie store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I believe that you won't, John, but I don't think that that's to say that you  won't be watching video on little screens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I watch quite a bit of TV and so forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, no, you're right, Corey.  I do, and in fact I do occasionally watch a clip where something on a little screen is  always kind of fascinating, it's kind of cool, but I'm not going to sit there for two hours.  And in fact, here's an example.  I think I've told this anecdote before on the show here, which is I was on an airplane  recently and there's everybody, you know, up and down the aisle is one of those people.  Everybody had a laptop and they're all, a lot of them are watching movies.  A lot of them are playing solitaire, but you know, you could just go up and down.  It's amazing the number of people who still play solitaire, but you're absolutely right.  Yeah, he knows, especially the lousy solitaire.  But anyway, so I saw all these people and there was some dweeb in the back holding a  little bitty video iPod watching a movie and he looked like an idiot.  He was a pathetic.  That was probably me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I'm talking about a newer large screen iPod.  It still looks stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If I were in the entertainment industry, the thing that I'd be worried about now is not  whether or not people are ripping off movies to watch them on iPods.  It's whether or not in a world where most of the screens that we interact with are that  small, there's any room for a feature film anymore, right?  It's not that people don't watch a lot of video.  I mean, I figured out when I got a TiVo that most of the stuff I've been watching, I've  been watching because nothing else was on.  So now I got to just good stuff.  And then after a few years with a TiVo, I realized I didn't even want to watch TV anymore.  Now nine out of the ten video moments I have are in front of a computer and they're tiny  little clips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think there's lots of people want to see feature films.  Look how many big screen TVs are selling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, that's the point I think we have to get.  Corey has to answer.  Yeah, if you're stuck in an apartment with 400 square feet, three people.  But if you have like, and which makes me wonder what you're doing with all your money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Living in London.  London.  Oh, yeah, nevermind.  Nevermind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, it costs four pounds to ride the subway in London now.  Can you believe that?  No, we call it the tube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Four pounds to ride the tube?  Yes.  What is that, like a couple hundred bucks?  What is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you know, they throw in about 70 free portrait photos while you're on it with all those CCTVs.  So it's kind of a deal if you think about like deducting the cost of going to the Sears  Portrait Studio.  It's unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh my God.  But anyway, so everything's really a jip over there.  But the point is that if you do have a big room that you could put a projector in or  a large screen TV, you will watch movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I watch them all the time.  I love it.  It looks great on a big screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe it's just because I got too much on my plate.  But I find that like the 90 minute uninterrupted time blocks are times that I don't usually  have in the house.  Like, even if I sat 90 minutes aside, the phone's ringing.  There's always, you know, the sense that there's some email coming in and I should go attend  to it.  I love going to the cinema, you know, now that I'm spending a year in Los Angeles and  this is the land of giant movie palaces and going to Grauman's Chinese and seeing a movie  on that giant screen is totally awesome.  Even crummy movies are awesome on that screen, but not in the house anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Better screens in London, but they have big giant screens there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but yeah, but John, here's the question.  Do you ever like bring your laptop into the living room while you're watching TV?  Never.  What?  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I live with my laptop in my lap.  No.  I don't know anyone who doesn't anymore pretty much except you.  I'm the guy.  I was in Florida seeing my grandparents at Christmas and my grandmother's boyfriend watches  TV with his laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's replaced the TV tray now.  You just have the laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, it's not that I've never had the laptop in the family room watching TV.  It's just that I generally don't.  In fact, I usually don't even use my laptop.  I mean, I've got big machines all over the house and if I come up to the office for where  the computers are, I'm going to be doing work on these computers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're geeks.  I mean, I don't know if we are a bellwether for what America is going to be doing.  I mean, maybe your grandparents are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You don't think shortened attention spans are like a trend in America?  I kind of think about, you know, the ring cycle, right?  People going to a three-day opera.  That's not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, I'm with you on that.  There's no doubt about it that the shorter attention spans are a big trend.  Well, I don't think that means I have to have a laptop in the TV set.  It's good for YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So speaking of big screens, Sharp got a lot of attention with the world's largest LCD.  I've seen reports it was 100 inches and 108 inches.  How big was it?  It's 108.  That's huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was huge.  I stood next to it.  I stood next to it.  It was huge.  It was massive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got a sunburn on my left arm right standing next to the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's literally priceless.  I mean, they didn't come up with a price for it.  It's $70,000 there.  Oh, you could buy it.  All right.  Hey, let me add Robert Heron since we're going to start talking about TVs.  I mean, there's nobody knows better than Robert Heron about this stuff.  And I know he was probably covering it.  But the point is that now they can do LCD screens that are much.  I mean, I know for a long time we thought you couldn't make them that big.  Hey, Robert Heron, welcome to Twitter.  Hey, can you guys hear me?  We can hear you.  Great.  Cory Doctorow is here, John C. Dvorak and Han Choi from Indigital.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And since we got Robert Heron here, because I remember him being on Cranky Geeks once and  we came up with this little argument about the SED television.  What happened?  Supposedly going to be shipping any man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now somebody sent me an email and said it's a lawsuit.  It's not dead, but that it can and the Toshiba are being sued by somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  And John probably knows something about the company that has a patent related to the either  the carbon nanotube technology or the field emissive technology.  There's something there's a company I believe in the Midwest that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So isn't that why the SED wasn't at CES?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, right.  It could very well be, but in my opinion, after what I've seen in terms of what the  plasma guys are doing and in terms of the LED or the LCD guys, it's too late.  It's simply too late at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a nano proprietary, a perfect name for a company that's suing over nanotube technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It sounds more like a licensing issue.  Sure does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you name a company, hi, we're nano proprietary.  That's pretty much there to be to sue people, don't you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are they patent trolls?  They're just people with bi patents?  No, no, they're real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have technologies actually, believe it or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It has something to do with Canon having, Canon and Toshiba, they split the SED incorporated  59% or 49% and 51%.  And it turned out that the party that had the 49% had licensing agreement with this  company.  And because of the way the agreement worked out, they just didn't feel like it was a legit  use of their patent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Canon wasn't supposed to share it with Toshiba.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly.  Right, right, right.  Something weird like that.  Yeah, they have a deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't sound like a deal killer, but I'll be honest, like I was saying though, some  of the new TV technologies I saw, in particular the Plasma guys, Pioneer in particular was  just doing wonderful things and they were showing off technology that literally, when  it's released this summer, it'll come as close as it needs to.  You know why that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know why that is, because I just bought a Pioneer Plasma TV.  That's exactly why that is.  They were waiting for you, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They say, hey, by the way, Leo, you got to buy more stuff so we can move technology along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't believe.  What did you buy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just bought the, what is it, 46 inch Sharp 1080p and I just saw the new 120 Hertz models  and the next two generations after that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's no longer how many P's it is, it's how many Hertz it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep.  And for the LCD guys, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't win.  We were talking about the Sharp 108 inch LCD.  I mean obviously that's outrageous, but does it mean that they've gotten better at making  big panels?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's really the showcase piece for their new eighth generation plant in Japan right now.  It's remarkable.  They actually had a good comparison showing the quote unquote mother glass of their eighth  generation plant where they can cut, I believe it's six 52 inch panels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did they say how many they had to throw out to get 108 inch that works?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They had three of them there.  I don't think they had, compared to the plasma guys in terms of shipping and logistics of  moving a panel like that, they were able to have three there.  Whereas with Panasonic and their launch of the 103 inch plasma had a single panel at  the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah, you know, I was at the, they had a dog and pony show in San Francisco with Panasonic  with one of those big, they had a hundred inch plasma.  And you know, it's beautiful.  It's not really that much better than a projector, but it has its moments in the bright light,  that's for sure.  But I asked the guys about this, I just thought, you know, how do you install one of these  things?  You have to have, if you don't have access, a forklift access for starters, you can't  install it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why Bill Gates' house has that special double door in the back.  You drive a forklift right in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You say, cause these things weigh a ton, they have to be professionally installed.  Actually, you know, anything over 50 inches becomes a problem.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Panasonic kind of told me a story about how one famous basketball player who had put on,  was put on the pre-list and ordered one ahead of time.  They were trying to figure out the exact weight of the 103 inch panel so they could figure  out how they were going to, they were going to basically mount it in the ceiling so it  would come down on a motorized lift.  And that has to be at least four or 500 pounds of weight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you know what the precursor to all of this stuff is?  The haunted mansion in Disneyland, there's that ballroom scene where there are all the  ghosts dancing in the middle of the ballroom.  That's accomplished with a thing called Pepper's Ghost.  And they have a sheet of glass that you can't see, very polished glass, that divides the  ballroom horizontally right in front of you and the ghosts are reflected in it.  And they had to build the haunted mansion around it.  So that's like the world's biggest LCD.  And someone shot a BB through it in the seventies and there's a spiderweb there now.  They put a spiderweb over the cracks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They couldn't put a new one in.  No, they would have had to open the roof.  Oh man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They shot a BB.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So if you look at the OLED technology though that Sony was showing off.  That was beautiful.  That was a million to one contrast ratio or something crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well that just means the black was unmeasurable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought OLED faded over time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, over a few months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well that remains to be seen.  It was blue that would wear out before all the other colors, or red, blue, and green.  The blue would wear out soonest.  Sony had no information in terms of exactly what they were showing off or in terms of  when it would be available or if it would be available this year even.  But they did show off a 27 inch panel that was 1080p and arguably one of the most delicious  looking displays there.  Full motion video, very well saturated colors.  That black level gives a million to one contrast ratio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Say again, Han?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was a centimeter thick or something crazy.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A centimeter thick the whole thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  A 22 or 27 inch display was a centimeter thick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How big can they get OLEDs?  I'd only seen little ones up to now.  I swear Samsung.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've only seen them in cell phones.  They should be able to get as big as anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's no reason they can't make them huge.  As big as anything.  Well, not as big as the Ritz Hotel, but you could make them pretty big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought Samsung had a prototype at 40 inches already, but that wasn't at the show, but  Sony's was just delicious.  It was really one of the neatest looking displays there.  Then they had a dozen of the smaller 11 inch displays surrounding that 27 inch version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I always liked OLED.  Before the show, last week on Twitter, Bill McCrone was singing the praises of Elcos.  He said he really liked the JVC DILA Elcos.  What's the state of Elcos at the show, Robert?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No signs of slowing down.  That and DLP are the two prominent micro display technologies that are used in projection systems,  either rear projection or front projection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When you're talking about OLED and LCD and plasma, it's really right now, it's DLP, Elcos,  LCD and plasma that are kind of the dominant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly.  Well, the two main display types, as far as flat panels go, the only two really are the  LCD and the plasma.  Then for your rear projection stuff, LCD rear projection isn't nearly as strong as DLP.  DLP has that market pretty much cornered.  With Elcos coming up behind.  From the studies I've seen and from my own eyes, I would say that Elcos has an advantage  in terms of cinema quality, but DLP is able to hit great pricing right now.  Neither side is slowing down in terms of innovation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My local movie theater just put in DLP projectors and they look fantastic even on giant movie  screens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I had a chance to see that final Star Wars movie in 1080p or the new 2K DLP projectors  and that was arguably one of the most beautiful looking screens I've ever seen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've heard with Star Wars movies, the best thing is to turn the audio over to Italian  and pretend they're opera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or just start playing the Wizard of Oz at the same time and see if it syncs up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So your local movie theater, are they doing that thing where they're adjusting what is  on which screen dynamically now that they've got digital projectors?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because that's kind of the big promise, right?  People like you just keep a couple of screens as floaters.  You don't schedule anything in them.  Then if you oversell Police Academy 17, you stick it on screen seven and you just suddenly  have another cinema that can do it or you change the reels.  You do a showing at one of movie one.  This is all digital.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't have to carry these big film reels around.  Just change what reel you're showing.  It's easy to do.  I haven't gone enough to notice whether they're moving the theaters, hopping the theaters  around but I guess they could.  And of course as with all cineplexes now, they have some little ones, some big ones,  but almost all of them are DLP screens now.  That's something brand new they just started doing.  So for any...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go ahead.  I mean just to say that's probably the screens was probably the main thing going on at that  show.  I mean there was some interesting junk that was in the back of the stands.  Like USBs.  Tell me about some of these USB devices.  No, I mean there's just a bunch of USB and you know sushi that looks like USB.  Yeah, yeah, we've seen that before.  But they had a bunch.  There was some weird trend.  There was at least three of these things I saw and some people saw some other ones.  There were a slew and I guess there's a new circuit out or there must be some new chip  or there might be a mem or something of breathalyzers for drunk drivers.  There was a combination iPod player breathalyzer.  There was a coin operated breathalyzer that you could put at your bar.  There's just a bunch of them.  I was just going what did they give you?  I don't know how accurate these handheld breathalyzers are though.  I don't know but that seemed like one of the weird little things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How about GPS?  Was there a lot of GPS stuff there?  Anything new in GPS?  I didn't see anything new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I saw a couple things there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love this.  We talked about the Nuvi.  David Prager got the 680.  Yeah.  Yeah, and that's pretty slick.  It's pretty slick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a new one from Dash Navigation has one that's got a GPRS and Wi-Fi built in.  So you can actually search Yahoo.  They have Yahoo search built into it.  And then it communicates both ways.  So if your car slows down, apparently they locked out any kind of way to identify who's  doing what.  But if your traffic slows down, send it to the network so that other people will know  that there's traffic.  So you're screwed, you're stuck in traffic, but the people behind you will be okay.  Or they know there's something going on.  So it's kind of an interesting way of using two-way communication.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So all you need to do if you want to reserve highway 101 down Silicon Valley for your own  personal use is to set up a beacon at one end that says my speed is five miles per hour  and then everyone else is directed away from the road.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  That's a good idea.  Send someone ahead of you to go really slow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hack them.  Hack the system.  If there's a system, it will be hacked.  We talked already about SED, Robert, and the conclusion was that the fact that SED wasn't  at CES didn't have much to do with the lawsuit.  It had more to do with the fact that the tech...  Oh, we just lost Robert.  Shoot.  Just as I was asking him a question too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's such an SED promoter that he had to hang up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe that was it.  I was going to put him on the spot while I'm trying to reconnect with him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we're taking a break.  I'd like to thank a few people out there for sending me some Appalachian...  Did you get some stuff?  Yeah, I got it.  I got...  I wanted Greg Guffey sent me one, a really good one.  One of the better ones actually.  It has the back-to-back stuff on it.  He's at sentpoint.com.  And then Brad Cochran who wanted me to promote his site.  He's pushing a French singer named Alize and he's got Alizeusa.com as a website.  He says if I plug that, he'll send me a shirt.  He sent me the classic Appalachian state one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, so you already got a shirt.  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  I was going to say...  Yeah.  and also there's maybe one more that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Corey, you missed all this, but John has a new scam now where he's basically getting  all his clothing from listeners.  Yes, free clothing.  Free clothing.  We can't take free equipment.  We can't take one of those Acer laptops from Microsoft.  Did Boing Boing get offered an Acer laptop?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, well, not as far as I know.  I didn't.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you, John?  No, I never...  Nobody even mentioned him.  That was a big scandal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although I don't know if it is a scandal.  I mean...  It was for bloggers.  Wasn't it for like bloggers?  Yeah.  Well, you got a blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't that...  Don't you have a blog?  He needs it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thanks.  Boy, John, you must be liking this stuff because you missed a completely great opportunity to  say dvorak.org slash blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you mean I didn't say dvorak.org slash blog?  I was plugging somebody else's blog?  Yes.  That's unusual.  I don't know.  I'm sick.  I've been catching something.  Well, I'll tell you, two days in Las Vegas and you get chapped lips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I tell you, I am so glad not to go to Las Vegas.  I used to get sick every single day.  Amen, brother.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, hallelujah.  Did you used to go, Cory, to cover that?  Oh, yeah.  I used to go for EFF.  And we still have a booth there.  Oh, yeah.  I used to go for EFF.  God, it was brutal.  And of course, when you go for...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there's nothing worse than booth duty.  I mean, that's the worst.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  And you end up staying at places like that.  What was it called?  Like the concrete bunker motel near the circus circus that was just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The one interesting thing in Vegas is the Stardust is boarded up now.  What?  They said thanks for 45 years and they're going to blow it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they've got to find a Hollywood movie that needs a casino blown up.  Once they make Ocean's 14, they'll be...  They can blow it up.  Unbelievable.  We got Robert back.  Welcome back, Robert.  I was going to put you on the spot here.  Thank you.  Please do.  John, you're a big supporter of SED televisions.  SED conspicuously absent from CES this year.  Is it the lawsuit or is it the fact that, as John avers, that SED is dead?  DED?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In my opinion, after what I've seen this year, I agree with John.  It's simply too late.  I don't believe that they'll ever be able to catch up at this point with what the plasma  folks are doing or the LCD guys are doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's one of the things.  But I have not seen one of these displays, but everyone who's seen them, they go on and  on about how great they were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought it was like a painting on the wall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I find that hard to believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It really was.  But after seeing...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's the best picture out there right now?  Any technology.  Just the best looking picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tough to say.  For general, all around, do everything right, it would be Lcos in terms of the big screens  at high performance.  Second would be plasma in terms of the...  How about these OLEDs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do they look as good as Lcos?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OLEDs are a whole other class.  That was amazing.  It was like perfect black, which is the big advantage that LCD has in terms of extremely  high contrast ratios, very well saturated color.  But there's just too many unknowns.  We don't even know how much they're going to cost and when they'll be available.  It would be nice if Sony could give us a hint.  As John pointed out earlier, it was the longevity issue with certain colors involved in the  panel, and in particular, blue.  If blue wears out after a thousand hours, nobody's going for that.  I imagine that was like a year ago when they're having this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have heard nothing that the...  This is a chemistry issue that these guys have with these OLEDs.  I have heard nothing in the case that they've solved this problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The ooze and oz, and it was a solid crowd at the Sony booth just to stare at those 13  displays they had on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's yet another reason not to go the CES is because they show off stuff that they either  can't make or can't make at a reasonable cost and everybody ooze and oz, but you're seeing  stuff that's just not going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's true, but they also showed off some...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's true.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A fairly impressive 70 inch Bravia LCD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You go to a car show and you see stuff that never is going to go into question.  People ooze and oz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But yet I went to Macworld Expo and boy, there it was, the iPhone.  Man, that is incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which will come out in June if the FCC approves it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to say the funniest thing, and they had two iPhones in bell jars, right?  That's it.  You can't touch it.  To see the geeks lined around in a circle with literally with their mouths open just  gaping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you think it was Einstein's brain or Lenin's tomb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe that's a more apt description.  Paul Thurado of Windows Weekly said it was like when he stood behind the Venus de Milo  and took a picture of the tourists looking at that.  It's that same kind of slack jawed appreciation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is there any truth to that story I saw briefly?  It was either through Associated Press or Newsvine where they were saying Apple was  forced to rename the iPhone to the iTouch Mobile.  Is that just complete BS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I saw a number of stories which were then yanked about that.  Of course, Cisco is suing them.  I have to say I don't see any reason why they can't rename it to something else like the  Apple phone.  Look, they took the ITV and made it the Apple TV.  Why not take the iPhone and make it the Apple phone?  The J-Phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The J-Phone?  Why J?  J-Phone because it's what comes after I.  It's one more than I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I thought it had something to do with jerking off.  Ew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now I'm going to have to bleep that.  John, come on now.  I think somebody actually owns J-Phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Probably do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Probably every letter in the alphabet is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Olif phone.  Switch alphabets, man.  The Omega phone.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We got to go Greek.  Olif, the first phone in the alphabet.  I don't know.  It is a Memosophy phone.  It is a Memosophy phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did anybody see the PowerCast technology that they were showing off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John, you said that was one of the things in our last week's episode that you said you  wanted to look at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What was it again?  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The power, the HD power technology.  I don't remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Powerline networking.  Oh yeah.  I saw nothing.  I couldn't find it.  So what were you talking about then, Han?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, this is the ability to send power over RF.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah, there is that technology out there.  Did you get to see somebody doing it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I actually went to the Mandalay Bay.  They're working with Phillips on it, but they didn't have any space for me to see it.  So I went to Mandalay Bay and saw it in one of their suites.  Unbelievable technology.  I couldn't believe it.  It's 900 megahertz frequency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This guy named Nikolai Tesla was demonstrating it.  His hair was standing on end.  It was amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A number of years ago at the Telluride Technology Festival, there was somebody using Tesla's  old technique for doing that.  And it was in the street.  And they had a guy across the street and they had this light bulb sitting there on one side  of the street.  And then it would light up for some, you know, it wasn't hooked to anything.  And it wasn't a magic trick that I could tell.  That's witchcraft, man.  And they had this guy beaming over the Jews from across the street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there must be some, you know, killer problem with this though, that's keeping it from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, Tom Edison didn't like it.  Really?  Well, supposedly that's it, right?  Supposedly it was all like Tom Edison arranged to burn down a lab.  That was AC versus DC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Edison's been dead for a while.  Maybe we can revisit this.  So, Han, it worked?  Did it look like it was working?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, basically.  It's not like, say, your cell phone.  It won't charge your phone necessarily.  But what it'll do is it'll stop it from draining.  So if you have it charged, it'll just maintain it at that level type of thing.  There are FCC regulations on how much power they can send.  But they're basically harvesting the 900 MHz spectrum.  They have a receiver and transmitter and they convert 50% of the waves into energy.  And the idea is to integrate this stuff into mobile devices.  And things like wireless keyboards, you know, you just have a transmitter right next to  your desk and it'll just charge it.  And you know, the FCC rules apparently are kind of strange.  It's like one milliwatt up to a meter.  But if you shield it, as in like put it in a desk, you can put more power out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you can have like a metal desk and have a lot of power rolling around in the drawer  and you just put stuff in there and slam the door closed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, well, they're thinking of one example with an electronic toy box for like little kids' toys.  They just open up the box, drop their toys and they'll charge it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think, Cory, this is a premise for another short story, Cory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's right.  Except that people have been predicting this for too long.  Oh yeah.  It's like flying cars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The demo, the demonstration was impressive.  You know, they just, they turned on, they had a lamp with a transmitter in it and a  bunch of LEDs around it with their receiver chip.  And basically you turn on the lamp and these things light up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, if it turns out that these things jam RFIDs, that would be a great science fiction story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Suddenly, yeah, if you have two competing technologies in different camps that really  want this to succeed and both equally powerful in Congress, now you've got something.  I tell you, I...  Sorry, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was going to say, I did manage to get my hands on a company's product called Wild Charge,  or a company called Wild Charge and they were doing wire-free power delivery into, their  demo was with cell phones and basically it's a pad you just lay your devices on and it  connects to that without any hard connection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I had electric toothbrushes that do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This was not using, yeah, this wasn't using a field or anything like that, like my toothbrush  is the same thing, but this was actually just, it was a kind of proprietary connection, but  it wasn't actually using a wire per se.  And it was working, I actually saw that running just fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they had to embed like something, a chip or something in the battery and then  you just dropped on the mat.  But you know, we'd seen, I'd seen something like that like a few years ago and it never  came to market.  But this thing was no mat, nothing else.  It's like, wow.  Like one of the examples they should show is a Christmas tree.  You just put the Christmas tree.  Just put it in the field.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it'll scramble your eggs too if you just put a little plate of eggs right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was amazing.  And the spectrum they're using is 900.  So technically if you're on, say on a cordless phone, you would actually add energy to the  field.  It's kind of weird.  So bizarre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there's a lot of new battery, there's some battery technologies that were kind of interesting.  There was, I saw a hybrid nickel metal hydride that would actually hold the charge so you  could actually sell batteries and you could actually sell them at the store.  Charge, because you know they normally drain.  That's been a big problem with nickel metal hydride.  They leak.  Yeah, they drain real fast and this seems to protect against that.  And then the other one, which I couldn't get much information out of because I went to  the Chinese pavilions.  There was a couple of them there.  There was one from Taiwan and there was the PRC pavilions and nobody spoke any English.  I mean to an extreme.  It's almost as though, I know they speak good.  There's a lot of Chinese that speak really good English in China, but they didn't ship  any of those people over here because it's a boondoggle apparently.  And so you didn't get any information.  So they got party hacks that came out.  These guys could say yes, okay, and best price.  And then they could say many patents.  That was it for their vocabulary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's funny.  Tom said too, many patents.  Many patents.  But anyway, it was an important tagline to his keynote speech was, and we've got 200  patents so stay away from the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They had a water battery.  Somehow it was like a AA battery that you put water into it and it would activate.  Wow.  Wow.  But it did many patents.  I didn't know how it worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I couldn't find it.  Many patents.  Yes, we sell it cheap.  Any other?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They have a translation service at the front entrance of the North Hall.  I think there's actually a translation booth.  We have to hire somebody and take them over there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It wouldn't help.  How on a scale of one to five in terms of excitement and stuff you learned, how was  this CES, Robert Heron, was it a big five or was it kind of a half?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'd say it was a four.  It also just, it seemed awfully crowded though this year.  Even though I guess attendance wasn't quite as big as predicted, but it sure felt that  way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Even though they had 35 football fields worth of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, the amount of stuff.  I questioned the attendance figures.  You thought it was bigger than they were saying?  Yeah, I don't know why.  Why would they undersell it?  That's strange.  I suspect that they're lying on the low side for their attendance figures because I totally  agree with Robert.  This place was jammed and I've seen big shows before and they're telling us 140,000.  This had to be at least 200,000, 300,000 even.  I think it's for either because of the unions or there's something that we don't know about  that they're giving these low numbers.  I really don't believe these numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think every blogger on the planet was there as far as I could tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's because this year they loosened up their requirements.  Anyone who wanted to get a press pass, in fact I wanted to get my press pass, I showed  no ID whatsoever.  If you showed up, you would have gotten in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's complete opposite of Macworld, which was hardly crowded at all and you could  and many, many people were turned away.  Many bloggers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  On Sunday there happened to be a series of press conferences that were being held by  some of the high definition folks and in particular the Toshiba conference was the one that just  went ballistic.  I estimated just to get into the meeting room for this public show there was at least a  thousand people in line for this room that might have held half that many.  I never saw so many upset people and just almost bordering on chaos.  It's really getting to the point where any company that's going to plan on doing that  in the future really has to consider doing it by invitation only because it was too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, give me some picks for unusual and cool things that you saw there.  Han Choi, what was your favorite thing that you saw?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My favorite thing?  You don't have to pick one.  There was a PC for your car and usually people make these boxes that sit in the trunk.  This thing was a built in, like self enclosed unit that fits into your dashboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did it have a little kit keyboard that would come out so you could be like Knight Rider?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's touchscreen but it has Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and all that so you can use it with  the Bluetooth keyboard but it all gets locked out if you're going over three miles per hour  which makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Were you impressed by the Ford announcement that Microsoft was going to sync with Ford's  or something like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, the syncs, the technologies that voice recognition stuff, right, and control navigation  and all that and Microsoft's been talking about it for a long time and personally I've  never had much success with voice recognition.  The speech recognition stuff just doesn't work for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You talk funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I do talk funny and things got to learn.  Maybe I'm just by a Ford and not people talk to my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I understand you.  I don't know about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think a lot of it has to do with the range where your frequencies are in your voice.  People that are tenors that have a lot of mid-range and high-end in their voices, the  voice recognition works great.  Jerry Pornell, he's got like kind of a high pitched voice and he has no problem.  I have a kind of a bassy voice that has funny overtones and I have nothing but trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jerry told us that the reason the handwriting recognition works so well on tablet PC is  it's based on his handwriting.  I did the same thing with the voice recognition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh yeah, tablet PC never worked for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Terry, they literally used his handwriting as a template and he says, it recognizes me,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  great.  I think there might be a generation gap thing too because I basically was typing around  the time I was learning to write cursively.  We had a terminal, a teletype terminal in the house in 77.  I was like six and so I was typing and writing cursively and I just stopped writing cursively  and went back to typing and I can't read my own handwriting.  Whereas Jerry probably got to start writing manuscripts longhand.  You're right, exactly.  Like Neil Stevenson.  With one of those birds, right?  Hammering the thing into the stone tablet, looking up going, that's a living.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very Flintstones.  How about you, John?  What would you say was the coolest thing you saw at CESA?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A lot of stuff, but the water battery was kind of cool.  The breathalyzer MP3 player was kind of funny.  There was a very unique, I thought it was kind of an interesting guy who had set up  for a disc jockey.  I'm going to probably write this up.  I don't have the company name handy, but it's another one of these things from Taiwan.  It was an Apple iPod that you could slip into this little box and on the box there was all  these scratch pads and all these things that DJs use at discos that you could use the  iPod to run the disco music and then you could have all this ancillary stuff and sliders  and all these weird things that these guys use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  DJs would love to bring a couple of iPods instead of 800 pounds of records, I'm sure.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, most people, yeah.  A lot of guys are bringing hard disk stuff.  Robert, you got a pick?  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This might sound kind of odd, but I'd have to say it's part of the spec of HDMI.  It started with version 1.2 and it's called Consumer Electronic Control, CEC, and you're  going to see this on a lot of new TVs and set-top devices.  Pretty much if you can connect the TV to a CEC enabled, say, DVD player and your CEC  enabled set-top box, be it cable or satellite, you need one remote control that can then  communicate through those connections and control all of those devices at once rather  than having to program a universal remote to do that.  That was just one little usability thing that just struck me as finally seeing products  that are taking advantage of the features of that spec.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Would it be in a TV, you think, or where do they put it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's part of the spec, and as long as the device supports that, they can then communicate  with each other.  Then that way, if your remote already has those controls for other devices on there,  it's literally an open standard.  It doesn't require direct support, although the manufacturers would tell you that last.  It's like, well, of course it'll work with our brand X player and brand X TV, but it  will also work with brand Y as well.  That was just nice.  It was something coming up that it'll just make it easier for everyone to say, hey, you  know what, I hooked up my DVD player and my TV, and I don't need two remotes to control  them both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How about you, Han?  Anything you'd like to end with?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I want to say something because I'm going to add this as one of my favorite products  because John hated it.  I was on Cranky Geeks, and I brought it on.  He hated it.  It was a karaoke thing for your iPod.  I thought it was cool.  Oh, so you could sing along to the iPod.  Sure.  Yeah.  Cheap microphone, cheap amplifier.  Yeah, it's kind of cool.  I don't know.  You actually could use the CD, like the karaoke disc that you buy, but it actually also acts  as a pass through so you can pass your video and your audio onto the screen.  So you dock it, and that way it serves two purposes.  I don't know.  I enjoyed it.  I had a lot of fun with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Corey, you and I were blessedly away from Las Vegas, so I'm not going to put you on  the spot unless you saw something in the news that you thought was worth checking out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no.  I had my great technology moment last year when I got to Singapore, and I went to Sinlum  Square and found all this great stuff that wasn't actually for sale anywhere.  I couldn't find it on the web later.  It was just stuff that I guess little outfits were trying out in the stalls markets there,  and that stuff was really badass, all these crazy MP3 players that were never going to  go anywhere.  Forget CES.  Let's all go to Singapore next year.  Let's go to Sinlum Square.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sounds good to me.  I agree.  That area's got all kinds of cool stuff.  Actually, Malaysia and all those areas have these kinds of places with all this weird  stuff that's made in the Southeast Asia and Taiwan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought a big announcement, although I wonder if you guys saw anything, was Sling Media's  announcement of the Sling Catcher, which sounded like a very cool box, a $200 box that basically  took any kind of media.  It's kind of the reverse of a Sling Box.  Instead of the Sling Box takes your media and puts it out on the net so you can see  it wherever you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can take the media off the net and put it on your TV locally.  I thought that was really cool.  Apparently, you can take that box and travel with it too, so you go to the hotel and plug  it in.  You get to have the best without the PC.  I thought that was pretty cool.  The other thing I saw, I really liked, was this company called the MoGo Mouse.  It's a PC card.  It's a little tiny mouse that fits into your PC card slot and charges.  Bluetooth mouse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's cool.  Then you pull it out and you use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a little stand.  Obviously, it's so flat that it's uncomfortable, but they have a little stand to prop it up  and make it feel like a mouse.  But if you're not into touchpads and stuff like using it constantly, especially if you're  doing spreadsheets and stuff, it's kind of complicated.  I like external mice for that.  I saw that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I liked that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It had a spring-loaded mechanism, didn't it, to give it a little height?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Nice.  To give it a little height in your palm.  On the PC, the Express card version, it's a scroll pad in the middle and left and right.  I really liked it.  That was a really cool use of an ink, I guess, against the old technology in a way.  It's just a mouse, let's face it.  I liked it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was one cultural thing I should report.  Yes.  There was a press room and there was also a thing called the blog house.  The blog house was for bloggers and the press room was for obviously normal press.  There was a mixture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who did you hang out with, Mr. Dvorak?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In PC Magazine, we had our own room, so I hung out with them.  But I did visit both of these things.  Which ones smell better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the real question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what?  The blog house probably didn't stink.  See, this all...  No, that's actually...  It was interesting because you had a...  Let's just put it this way.  The energy in the blog house compared to the energy in the press room was a lot more dynamic.  It was better.  Because they were just happy to be out of the house.  It was open 24-7.  The press room was only open until 6 o'clock.  There was a very interesting cultural difference.  At the blog room, even though a lot of them were just goofing around, it just seemed like  a much more energetic group.  Very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there's one other story that wasn't a CES or Macworld story, but I have to bring it up.  Pirate Bay is trying to buy an island so they can be a sovereign nation.  And I have to worry about the RIAA.  Corey, I saw this in boingboing.net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they're offering citizenship too.  Oh, cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's move, baby.  Well, first you have to donate to them and then you can be a citizen.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I kicked in some money.  I think that's a hilarious idea.  I don't know.  I mean, ultimately, other nations have discovered that no nation is an island.  You know, Somalia, at one point at the urging of the State Department, their entire internet  connection was just switched off one day because they wanted to do something to do with terrorists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I remember the Bahamas were putting in a fiber line from the mainland because they wanted  to be a data haven, much the way they were a pirate haven in the last century or the  last two centuries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, lots of people tried this.  I guess SEALAND would have the advantage that it wouldn't have any exports except for bits,  right?  So the big issue right now with nations is that if you have any exports, chances are  you're a member of the World Trade Organization.  And if you're a member of the WTO and you don't adopt American-style copyright rules,  they can block your exports of everything else.  So if you're a Burundi, you've got to pay market price for pharmaceuticals and not make  your own AIDS drugs or you won't be able to export your sorghum.  So that's more or less the kind of world as it is today.  And I think the thing that as a science fiction writer, this holds out the possibility of  is a country that just exports bits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is actually a platform.  It's not even an island.  It's a gunning platform, gunnery platform out in the middle of the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Although, you know, there's tons of islands, like they're evacuating all these islands  in the South Pacific that are disappearing because of the rising oceans, because of global  warming.  And if all you need is a patch of sovereign dirt, I mean, you know, like those islands,  they kind of have two assets now.  They have their top-level domains.  So you know, like tuvalu.tv.  And then they have their sovereignty, which I guess, you know, someone might want to buy  and use for this kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  .sea, I'm liking it.  I love the idea.  Yeah, buysealand.com if you'd like to help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It would have to be two letters though.  So I don't know if SL is taken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  SLSD.  SE we know is taken.  Is taken, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is FU taken?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  FU, that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  Or .pb for Pirate Bay.  There you go.  All right.  I like it.  This is, you know, it's like those old pirate radio stations that floated around like Radio  Caroline on ships off the coast of England.  I like the idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hope they do it.  Cut off their connection.  There's no way that they can manage.  I mean, even if these guys have got.  They just take an axe to the fiber, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they don't need to actually have to come from there, right?  Is that what they have to actually put their servers on the platform?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's the idea is to just is to have physical jurisdiction questions that are hard.  I mean, as I understand it right now, after the Pirate Bay servers got taken down, when  the MPAA had a member of parliament in Sweden illegally intervene to have their servers  taken down, they relocated mirrored servers in three jurisdictions.  I think one is in the former Soviet Union.  One is somewhere in the European lowlands and one is in Scandinavia.  And they can just change the DNS.  And so the idea is to have hard jurisdictional questions that would confront anyone trying  to effect a takedown notice.  But if you can effect a takedown notice on the ISP, then you know, you've got another  question entirely.  Well, you know what?  The other thing is what they can target their advertisers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What I would expect to see is a big giant gunboat with the Sony logo on the side just  sitting off the shore.  They're blasting away at these guys and declaring war and putting people that have the passports  on this operation like yourself in an internment camp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That would be an interesting turn of events, wouldn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now I see a story coming on.  This might be part of the next collection, Cory Doctorow's new short story collection  just out, Overclocked Stories of the Future Present.  You're going to be doing a book tour, a little mini book tour.  It's starting in Toronto, February 1st.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's right, at Baca Books, the science fiction bookstore on Queen Street.  And then I'm going to be doing one at Borderlands in San Francisco on the eighth.  And also, you know, Details TBD, Vancouver, San Diego, Duke University.  And I'm leaving one out, but that's okay.  So yeah, a bunch of places that I'm going to be anyways.  And so I've got local booksellers who are going to run a little launch for me.  And so that's going to be really fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love Borderlands.  I'm not Borderlands.  Well, actually, I love Borderlands.  Baca too.  I go to Baca every time I'm in Toronto.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, and so many science fiction writers have worked there over the years.  There's me and Tanya Huff and Michelle Sagara and many other SF writers, Nala Hopkinson,  who worked there over the years.  So it's really cool to be able to continue doing stuff with them.  There's actually a great photo of me at 12 with a little 12 year old Mohawk and giant  cheeks at the book signing for Charles DeLint and Steve Sterling in like 1983.  Where's that picture?  I want to see that.  It's hanging on the wall at Baca.  Oh, I'm going to go in next week.  Ask them to show it to you next time you're there.  I will.  I'm going to be there next week.  And of course, the book is free for download as always.  And the stories, you know, have won lots of awards and up for more awards.  One was up for the Hugo Award last year.  One just got picked for the year's best science fiction.  So I think they're good stories.  I podcast all of them so you can download the audio too.  It's Multimedia Extravaganza over there at Crafhound.com slash overclock slash what's  your URL again, John?  It's dvorak.org slash blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't wait to see the book and I wish you luck with the launch.  I'm going to head over to revision3.com because that's where the home theater showdown is  going on within digital.  Jessica and Will Wheaton and of course, Han Choi fighting it out over there.  They had what you had $5,000 right Han to make the ideal home theater.  Yeah, $5,000 each.  And you went with plasma, I think, yes?  No, I went with the LCD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The only reason is 1080D plasmas are so expensive compared to LCDs.  So that's why I went that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The results are in?  Yes.  But he's not happy about them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.  Yeah, I'm not happy with it.  So, clearly you know where I am now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Was Patrick Meyers' decision the one that won?  Did we pick the winner?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you'll have to watch the show to see but all I know is it's unfair.  I demanded a recount.  There was definitely a hanging chat issue here, I'm telling you.  I love the cross-pollination here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, Robert, you and Patrick were judges in this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we selected a winner but I'm not sure if that's the final winner or if there were  additional judges involved.  We'll have to see, I guess.  We'll just have to watch and see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, yeah, so Patrick and Robert said what they thought were the best and the viewers  got to vote and also entered the window system.  And so those tallies came in.  And the person that won my system, the thing that bothered me was the fact that we gave  all these three systems away and the people that voted, not one of them or the runner-ups  had voted for me.  Oh, I voted for you.  And I'm like, that's not fair.  I liked your setup.  Yeah, I thought it looked spectacular.  It was genius but no, evidently I wasn't.  It wasn't you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, all I can say is that just shows you what you can do with $8 million in venture  funding.  Revision 3.  I think that's more than we ever gave away on Tech TV.  If you want to watch Robert and Patrick at work, dl.tv, that's where you'll find Robert  Herron.  It's great to get you back on Twitter, Robert.  It's good to hear from you again.  It's good to be back.  Thanks for joining us.  John C. Dvorak.org slash blog, of course, to read John's postings.  And if you want to see him on camera, crankygeeks.com is his...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm also on CNBC on Wednesday, about quarter to 12.  Oh, good.  Is that a new thing?  I've been doing it for about two or three months.  They put me on as a regular now.  I'm just kind of making an analysis.  I'm on for like a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm going to call you, Robert, because I'm doing Regis and Kelly at the end of the  month and I'm going to show them big screen TVs.  I want to see if I can get that sharp 108-inch LCD.  Make Regis really look short.  You need someone to move it?  Yeah, we need a forklift, right?  It's too massive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's so big for you, Reg.  It's literally bigger than a queen-size bed.  It's nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to get that one and then get the giant plasma and we'll just take up the whole set.  There'll be no room for anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The plasma guys are really making 1080p displays that the largest size is affordable and that's  what's really coming up here in the next six months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, when I bought that Pioneer, it's 1080i.  Did I make a big mistake?  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pioneer makes the best looking plasma displays in the world right now.  They don't make the biggest and they don't make the cheapest.  They just simply make the best and they've been doing it longer than anyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like how it looks, I got to say.  I didn't get the elite edition because I don't feel elite.  I got the plebeian edition.  It's still great.  Thank you everybody.  We'll see you guys.  See you guys next week.  Another twit is in the can.
