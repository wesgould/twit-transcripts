Transcript:  Good to see you.  I love that story you told yesterday or Friday on TNT about your husband sharing a viral video with you and you saying,  Yeah, that we've taped that at the Mashable offices.  I was there.  That's a sign though that your video viral videos are working.  They're fooling even your husband.  This is true.

Transcript:  This is true.  It also is a sign that dig removes the YouTube branding that you put on.  Thanks.  So if you put your own custom bug on those videos and it goes on dig.com, then the bug is no longer there.  That's terrible.  How do they do that?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I guess I guess there's something with the embed code or something they do to get the overlays turned off.  But he had no idea.  And it was really funny to me.  I was like, yeah, that's Mashable video.  Grant, thanks for sharing that with me.  Appreciate it.

Transcript:  But if you take it, then you have to write it off on your taxes.  That became a rule about a decade ago.  You used to not have to count that as income.  It's about 50-50 the people that will take them and the people that won't because they'd  add so much to your income.  People are like, I don't know what a tax sum is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Remember, these stars are probably in almost the 50% tax bracket if they're in California.  So they're going to be spending a lot of money on taxes on things like, for instance,  non-invasive LED light therapy stick for like $10,000, custom furniture for $25,000, $4,000  worth of LiPo.  But you're going to pay half of that.  $1,200 bicycle, a $12,000 glamping vacation, a train trip across the Rockies, a nine-night  Italian vacation package, free Audi rentals for a year with Silver Car.  Of course, the whole reason people give this stuff to these stars is exactly what we're  doing.

Start time: 311.14
End time: 321.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yes.  I was going to say you're promoting all these companies.  The exact reason that they do this.  The same thing for the gift suites.  So you're feeding into it, Leo.  You're giving them the advertising.  I saw the gift suites on Entourage.

Start time: 325.79
End time: 338.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's how I know about Hollywood.  I watched Entourage.  Everything I know about law I got from The Good Wife, everything about Hollywood from  Entourage.  I'm a simple man.  But the gift suite, like you go in this room and there's all this crap and you could take  anything you want.

Start time: 340.00
End time: 376.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Basically.  I mean, usually in exchange for that, then you need to do like a photo op.  So it's funny because you can see that way, you know, the gift suite things, they'll take  a photo of you in the gift suite and then that'll get sold around and whatnot.  And some celebrities are very careful not to be seen in the gift suite because it damages  their brand.  And then some celebrities don't care.  They just want the free crap.  And then some celebrities, especially the reality people, they're like all about it.  They're like, oh yeah.  You know, like you see the Jersey Shore people and the two mom people.  You can bet.  They're like give it to me.  Give it to me.  Suki is going to be in the gift suite.  Suki is definitely going to be in the gift suite.  She does not care.  She's like, give it all to me.

Transcript:  Now, last year at the Oscars, remember Ellen DeGeneres hosted and it was a Samsung Oscar  particularly, and boy, you cannot pay for advertising.  Well, actually you can.  They did.  They did.  The selfie, which apparently Ellen doesn't use a Samsung phone.  She uses an iPhone because she tweeted about it later off her iPhone.  But the Ellen DeGeneres selfie blew up on Twitter.  She said, let's make this the most tweeted selfie in history.  And I think it was.  I think it still is.  You've even besting the Obama record, the president's Twitter record.  There you go.  You got Bradley Cooper.  You got Ellen.  But I think Samsung, which paid for this selfie, forgot that the selfie will not actually include  a picture of the camera.  It's kind of a flaw in the old selfie thing.  Will there be, will Samsung be back this year or will it be Apple?  If I'm an Apple, I'm looking at this thinking, boy, we blew it.  We should have, we should own the Oscars this year.

Start time: 438.80
End time: 489.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, they always buy advertising time during the Oscars.  And if you recall during, in 2010 when the iPad came out, I think it was Steve Carell  who actually came out, not Steve Carell, Stephen Colbert who actually came out with the iPad  in his hand.  And that was, you know, was he paid for that?  Yes.  Apple definitely paid for that.  And Steve Jobs was honored, I think, that year.  He was on the red carpet.  So, but Apple usually buys advertising.  And, you know, obviously they have a really strong relationship with ABC who airs the Oscars.  But in terms of actually sponsoring something like that, I don't think Apple would be that overt.  They tend to like to be a little more subversive behind the scenes, you know, doing in kind  sponsorships for certain TV shows, certain movies.  But they definitely buy it.  But they buy advertising for the Oscars and most major award shows.

Transcript:  Apple's going to, I presume, pay for the Modern Family episode, right?

Start time: 493.80
End time: 510.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, without a doubt, without a doubt.  No, I mean, I'm sure that that was absolutely scripted into something, an arrangement that  they made with.  I can't remember what studio does Modern Family.  I think that that's actually might be ABC who does that.  And in which case it's even more synergy because again, you know, they share so many shareholders.

Start time: 510.80
End time: 530.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's coming up this week.  It's a half hour that will take place entirely inside a MacBook Pro screen, including FaceTime  calls and other video.  It's actually an intriguing idea.  So Apple paid for that, you think?  Oh, absolutely.

Start time: 531.00
End time: 538.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I mean, the same way they did when Modern Family had the episode that aired the day that the  iPad came out and they had the whole episode was about getting him the iPad.  Wow.

Start time: 539.80
End time: 552.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I think it's really I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  I'm I'm curious where you where you heard they're paid for, Christina, just because I  said for years they won't pay for this stuff, right?  Yeah, no, exactly.

Start time: 573.36
End time: 581.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I don't know if they paid for the inclusion.  It's probably more like they had the idea.  They approached Apple and Apple was like, oh, we'll give you all this stuff.  Here's the article.

Start time: 582.08
End time: 643.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is the article I'm reading, which came from Associated Press says that Apple did  not.  In fact, pay for it.  Levitan, who is the creator of the show and the author of this episode, said that it  was inspired by his own experience.  Steve Levitan, it was captured entirely on iPhone 6s and iPads.  Steve Levitan said the upcoming episode involved no product placement compensation to Apple  and resolved from an epiphany he had during an online experience involving one of his  college age daughters.  I had emails open some websites that my daughter showed up on FaceTime.  I could not only see her, but I could see me.  And there was something going on behind me.  My wife or somebody.  I realized on screen you could tell so much about my life, which is why, by the way, we  warned Ben Thompson that we could see his whiteboard before we went on the air.  It occurred to him the format would be fitting for Modern Family.  So he said now, you know, I remember we've heard these things.

Start time: 643.98
End time: 658.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He has said that Apple gave all the equipment like they have lots of iPhones and MacBooks.  So, I mean, it's one of those things where it depends.  I mean, if you look at the dollar value, they gave them tens of thousands of dollars worth  of phones and stuff like that.  So, I mean, how do you want to call paying for it or not?

Start time: 658.80
End time: 688.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Totally. And they agreed to let them do this without Apple being paid or without any sort  of permission being needed or whatnot.  You know, they cleared all the logo usage and probably provided them expertise with  shooting stuff.  And they might not have paid per se.  But, I mean, they're certainly getting a humongous amount, especially when you consider  syndication, a humongous amount of advertising.  Oh my God.  So this is, I mean, there's a quid quo pro happening here on some level.  I mean, even if it's not a direct payment exchange, I mean, it's ridiculous to think  that there wasn't any sort of conversation had about this.

Start time: 689.30
End time: 694.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The AP says Apple was informed about the episode and quote, loved the idea.

Start time: 695.12
End time: 696.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Really? You loved it.

Start time: 698.99
End time: 726.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple has, I don't know, I think she might have retired, but Apple had a very well-known  executive that was focused on these sort of placements.  Again, not no direct payment, but certainly it's something that Apple is cognizant of the benefit  of and has worked to cultivate the relationships.  And I'm sure they're very free with equipment and expertise and things along those lines.  Even if there's no direct payment.  So many companies like Samsung are willing to pay cash hard dollars.

Start time: 726.80
End time: 734.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It makes it hard for Apple, doesn't it?  They hold the line?  No, no.  It makes it that much more attractive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.

Start time: 735.86
End time: 773.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  All right.  I mean, you can even look at what was the movie, Sex Tape with Jason Stiegel that came out last year.  This was revealed in the Sony emails.  The Sony executives wanted to make a script change because so much of that movie had to do with  iPads and Macs.  And they said, can we replace the iPad stuff in the script?  Can we replace it with Sony products?  And the screenwriters were like, no, it needs to be Apple products.  We use Macs.  We use Macs.  We thought about this from the idea of an iPad.  Apple cleared it.  But even though it was a movie made by Sony that Sony was putting the money into, Sony could not get their own  products placed in a movie that they completely produced and distributed.

Start time: 773.92
End time: 787.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You did used to see a lot of Vios in Sony pictures.  Yes.  You won't anymore because they're spinning it.  They killed the Vio.  Yeah.  Right.  Somebody saying that movie was Argo.  Was it Argo that had all the pictures of?  I mean, Argo had some of that too.

Start time: 787.82
End time: 793.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This was actually a case of Sex Tape, though.  Sex Tape, you said.  It was revealed in the Sony email.  I missed Sex Tape.

Transcript:  I don't know how.

Start time: 794.92
End time: 797.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yes.  It was not a big hit at all.

Start time: 798.26
End time: 817.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That was, I remember now.  I remember seeing the poster for that.  So this is, so this, you know, what cracks me up is when you see, sometimes you'll see a production where they  obviously have Macs, but they'll cover up the Apple.  You see that a lot.  Yeah.  Because Apple won't pay money.

Start time: 817.80
End time: 850.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Because Apple won't pay them.  That's what they have to do on Two and a Half Men and some of those shows.  Any of the CBS shows, they have to cover up the logo.  And the guy that creates Chuck Lorre, who creates, you know, he does a Big Bang Theory and Two and a Half Men and Mike and Molly and a couple of the other ones.  He always bitches in his credit notes.  Well, he does these like, he does these little blog postings at the end of his credit reels and he complains sometimes about how Apple won't buy advertising or pay for sponsorship or whatever on their shows.  He's like, Oh, and I give them so much free press.  And I was just like, Yeah, we don't care.  We're not going to.  We're not going to pay you to show our logo.

Start time: 852.25
End time: 856.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is it fair to say Apple only pays with promotional consideration?  They give product.

Start time: 856.92
End time: 896.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I think that's probably it.  They used to do other things.  And I would be, I mean, look, we don't know how deep this goes.  I would not be surprised if somehow, you know, Apple didn't have an ad buy during this Modern Family episode.  Maybe they wouldn't have an ad buy otherwise.  You know what I mean?  So that's that's this is where it gets tricky because Apple can say, Oh, no, we didn't pay anything for this.  But we bought a 30 second ad during this this show that we usually don't buy 30 second ad story.  So that's where it's that.  I mean, who knows?  They can say whatever they want.  I think there's probably more going on behind the scenes.  It certainly doesn't hurt the marketing, the sales teams relationship with Apple to do to have this sort of thing happening on the creative side.

Start time: 896.80
End time: 987.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What were you going to say then?  No, I just agree.  I agree.  There's when it comes to these deals, there's all there's there's all kinds of levers that can be pulled.  Where that be in kind advertising on the TV show itself.  It could be on any of the any of the network's properties or magazines or anything like there's there's a lot of places where you can do deals that that you're not paying for placement or you're not paying for anything.  You're not paying for apps or whatever it might be.  But there's there's a wide ranging business agreement, I think is the term or something like that.  And that that's certainly the case.  The other thing I would add is the the whole product placement thing is is much more advanced and much more common in Asia.  You'll see and particularly when it's really interesting to track along the rise with Samsung generally has been the general track in the rise of of kind of Korean culture,  whether it be music or particularly TV shows which are massively popular all over Asia in particular.  And and you wonder like, well, how these you know, they're on these free streaming networks and they're easily accessible.  And it's like, man, why are they getting fired?  Well, the turn if you watch the shows, there's always almost always Samsung products featured very prominently.  And that's where a lot of their money comes from is is through is through product placement.  And it's not just phones. It's also like makeup products.  It's very the chat apps that have had, you know, thing going on.

Start time: 987.82
End time: 992.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And and it like line might have product placement stickers, things like that.

Start time: 993.50
End time: 1017.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly. There is really popular Korean TV show that you know, that I saw a few episodes of.  But it was funny because about halfway through, they suddenly started using line to chat, which they had at the beginning of the show.  And basically got popular. Then they signed this deal and suddenly they were using wine.  So it is very featured every time they they started.  They didn't just go in the app. It was it was the the the the screen at the beginning.

Start time: 1018.20
End time: 1035.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The camera, what it's called. It's interesting because that's a way also get in the American market line, which is very popular in Asia is not really penetrated America.  But the chat is my bleak in the chat room saying line is all over America's next model.  So what a clever way to kind of get raise awareness of a product in the in the US.

Start time: 1035.94
End time: 1069.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're very interested. Yeah, no, that's definitely a common tactic over here.  And there's I mean, there is there was but it's even little stuff, too.  Like in this show, I remember reading that was hugely popular, like My Love from the Stars or something like that.  It's about it's about an alien that is actually I don't know, is it was actually pretty good, I have to admit.  But the main character used some makeup product that was relatively new and like the product like doubled its sales in China.  And so I mean, like it's super effective and it's it's really common.  And I would expect we're pricing more of it in the US rather than less.

Start time: 1070.48
End time: 1099.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's a long precedent for this. I remember.  In fact, it was kind of a model for when we first started Twit 10 years ago, by the way, our 10th anniversary is coming up in April.  I told this anecdote and said we need to find advertisers like this.  When MTV first started in the United States, when was that 80s?  81. You remember that, Christina, because you were four.  I was not alive. OK, never mind.  What was I thinking? I'm so sorry. It was August. It was August something.

Start time: 1099.96
End time: 1103.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  81. I just know that. She knows he wasn't alive, but she knows.

Start time: 1103.88
End time: 1131.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Anyway, there was this candy that was grandma's candy.  Nobody ate it called Mentos.  And they bought a huge campaign and with the launch of MTV and advertised for years in MTV.  Remember, Mentos, the fresh maker, which was like the weirdest ad ever.  But it made Mentos a hip candy in the US and it exploded their sales.  So there's a precedent for this. The other precedent I'm thinking about is Kit Kat.  Remember when Android 4.4 came out, Kit Kat, Google said, but no money exchanged hands with Hershey's.

So they had to put tape over the Beats logos.  And I was talking to someone from Beats and she joked, she was like, yeah, we should sell our own tape to cover stuff.  The logos. I was like, that's actually a really good idea.  You should have to sell Beats tape to cover up the logo on the network.  That would actually be genius.

And of course, there's a podcast there exponent as well.  We'll be back with more with all three in just a bit.  But first a word from Shutterstock dot com.  We love our Shutterstock subscription. We use the heck out of it.  We bought the business subscription. That's 25 images a day.  Everybody in the in the brick house has access to it.  You use Shutterstock. We use it in video. We use it in audio.  Shutterstock has audio. We will use it, of course, a lot on our blog.  Nowadays, visual is everything.  And if you don't have a visual component to your blog post, you're kind of missing out.  I think Shutterstock is the place to get over 40 million stock photos, vectors, videos, music, tracks, everything you need for your creative project.  I even see now that I'm kind of aware of Shutterstock, I see Shutterstock in film credits all the time.  Even major Hollywood motion pictures use Shutterstock footage.  Why not? Why hire a helicopter to fly over Hong Kong when you go to Shutterstock, get a beautiful HD video, pop it in.  Shutterstock has the best royalty free images for your website, a publication advertisement.  Forty eight million. Oops, I was you know, I have to go have to go to the Shutterstock site every once in a while to see the numbers.  Two point four million really free video clips with sixteen thousand added this week alone.  Let's see the image. Forty nine million, four hundred sixty nine thousand six hundred two royalty free stock images.  They added three hundred eighty four thousand this week alone.  Now, the key with Shutterstock is to understand the brilliant search on Shutterstock.  Their search will allow you to browse your images not only by topic, but to narrow it down by color so it can match the palette of your blog, by people having people in it or not having people in it, how many people are in it.  It's gender emotions expressed.  Then once you find the image you want, you can share it or save it with a lightbox and share it with others that you're working with.  Keep it for yourself for inspiration.  Take a look at the iPad app. Man, it is something else.  It's talk about inspiration. And now they have it on Android.  I'm very happy to say Webby Award winning.  It's an international company.  They have customer service in more than a dozen countries, full time customer support throughout the week.  I just I'm a big fan. If you're looking for royalty free images, Shutterstock.com, go there, sign up for the free account.  You don't need a credit card. Just start the account.  Start using it. Start searching.  Use it for inspiration, for ideas, save favorite images to a lightbox.  But if you do decide to buy all image subscription packages, you can get 20 percent off your new subscription, 20 percent off the image subscription packages when you use the offer code TWIT 215.  That's for February 2015. What are those helicopters? Drones?  Shutterstock.com 20 percent off the image subscription package on new accounts.  But you have to use the offer code TWIT 215.  Oh, there's the drones. Quadcopters.  Are they big in Taiwan, Ben? Are people using quadcopters in Taiwan?

A couple more Apple stories. I'm actually very curious what you guys think of the Apple car story, which some say is hard to believe.  I think Jean-Louis Gosset wrote in his Monday note on Monday. He didn't believe it for a minute.  And yet when we talked about it on Tuesday on MacBreak Weekly, the consensus from Andy Anaka, Renee Ritchie was, no, Apple's doing it.  They've got at least 100 people working on it.  Doesn't mean you'll see it anytime soon. It might be five years.  In fact, Apple even is saying I think five years before they could sell an electric car, maybe autonomous even.  And part of the reason that we that people believe this is that they're hiring people and they were in these fields.  Ben, is it reasonable that Apple's doing a car?  That's crazy.

Start time: 1758.10
End time: 1949.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, absolutely. I think what's really I was writing about this on Monday in my update.  And while I was writing it, I kind of started out with like a standard line of mine, which is which is that Apple is a personal computer company.  That's all they've ever made. And you can trace, you know, going from the the the Mac to the Apple to to be to be specific, but to the from the Mac to the iPhone and the iPad.  Like they're all these are all personal computers are just getting ever more personal and ever more, you know, is the watch.  Does that watch fit in that?  I think so. I think I think the watch right now is an accessory. But in the long run, I think, you know, the goal is that that's, you know, that's the hub.  You know, right now, the phone is clearly the hub.  But in the long run, it kind of makes sense to have something on your person that that is the hub.  But the thing is, is that that fit with I mean, Jobs was passionate about the computer like his famous, you know, the bicycle of the mind sort of thing that the computer enables human creativity.  It's it's this tool for people. And while I was kind of writing this at the same time that that fascinating New Yorker profile Johnny I've dropped and which which not beyond being super long and divulging a lot about Apple that we didn't know was was that made it unique.  But it was also a piece where I've is very much become kind of the public face of Apple over the last six to 12 months.  And and what's interesting is you don't get the sense of passion for computing from from Ive. You get a real passion for design fashion and thinking was in being very thoughtful about how you make things and how you create things.  And it sounds like a very subtle difference. But Apple under Steve Jobs was about computers and great design. And it's different to say you're about great design and computers like it matters which one is first and it matters in a way that before I would have dismissed this room out of hand because just well, cars are becoming computers like an electric car is a fun like the industry is undergoing a fundamental shift.  So if there was ever a time to enter the industry, it's right now because when industries undergo fundamental shifts, the incumbents don't usually do very well. And so I suspect that in 15 to 20 years, the who's who of the car market would be very different than the who's who of the car market today.  And so it's a great time to get in and there's no question electric cars basically a computer on wheels. And so it there's lots of that makes sense, but it's not it's different than a personal computer that that you live with. But if that's no longer like the North Star for Apple, and I think it's fair to say that it's not that instead is design and making great things that people that are thoughtful and people appreciate and and are willing to pay for.  Well, then that sort of Apple, you can very much see it making making a car. And and then of course, you get the details will be self driving, well, this sort of stuff. But it to me, it comes back to like, what is the nature of the company? I think it's fair to say the nature of the company has has changed. And again, that's not a bad thing. It's not a good thing. It's just just an observation.

Start time: 1962.04
End time: 1975.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But and Andy Anacote kind of implied this he was reluctant to talk at all about this story, but he implied this and he's right. The Wall Street Journal, which is where this emerged is Apple's Journal of Records, the place Apple goes to leak stuff.

Start time: 1975.80
End time: 1977.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yes, the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg both.

Start time: 1978.63
End time: 1981.80

Start time: 1983.22
End time: 1994.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not just that, but the Financial Times has had a remarkable record as of late and they were actually before the Journal. And I don't know if they're these are these are manipulations. These are controlled leaks. Why is Apple leaking this story now?

Start time: 1997.08
End time: 2005.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, probably a couple of things. One, you know, the big question everybody's having in advance of the Apple Watch launch is what's next. And so I think they're getting ahead of that story. I think the secondary.

Start time: 2005.84
End time: 2007.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Holy cow, they haven't even released the watch.

Start time: 2007.86
End time: 2010.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, they haven't. But they've got to kind of. So I think you're getting ahead of that.

Start time: 2011.18
End time: 2012.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, fine. But what are you going to do next?

Start time: 2013.97
End time: 2067.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, you know that that's well, because that's exactly what happens.  I mean, everybody's already going to be asking. That's exactly what happened. So that's getting ahead of that. I think the secondary thing is kind of, you know, what a lot of people are making big bets on auto testing.  Tesla is in the news a lot. Google is really kind of own this space and that they're really serious about doing this.  And if they're really serious about getting something out, whether it's a car or whether it's, you know, just working with somebody else or whatever in five years, starting to tell the story now, the sooner the better.  It works in their favor. It probably also doesn't hurt that it's going to put, you know, companies like Tesla under the gun a little bit because now they're going to have to start to defend their business a little bit because the mere width of Apple being involved puts pressure on them.  In a way that no other company would pressure would have any pressure on them.  Even another car maker. Nobody would be really that worried. You mentioned Apple and all of a sudden it's like, oh, well, what about Tesla? Are they going to be okay?  So I think it's a good strategic move.

Start time: 2068.88
End time: 2073.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm racking my brain because I think it's absolutely clear that these are planted leaks.  Absolutely.

Start time: 2074.21
End time: 2130.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely.  Going back to earlier what we were talking about Apple being a personal computing company, they always have been.  If you think about the direction that cars, especially electric cars are going, I mean, like Ben said earlier, an electric car basically is a computer on wheels.  And like, you know what? How can a computer be even more personal than something that you're sitting in or wearing?  So I definitely think that if Apple feels like they can make the electric car better than Tesla and make a better experience, then they'll totally go for it.  But it definitely seems kind of strange and especially strange that it's coming up.  Not strange that it's coming now, but I guess somewhat sudden.  But I mean, you're right. We've been seeing all of these seemingly controlled leaks in the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg.  And they've always been extremely accurate in the past.  So I definitely think there's a chance that Apple is at least considering this or in the very early stages of it.

Start time: 2131.50
End time: 2133.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there's a more cynical take, too.

Start time: 2134.10
End time: 2136.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what I'm I want to hear the more cynical take.

Start time: 2137.04
End time: 2188.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, which I think has to be has to be considered.  Number one is actually this story started with the story in Bloomberg that Tesla was poaching a ton of Apple employees.  And so it's very possible. And this and I'm kind of inclined to believe this again.  I'm open to the possibility, but I'm instinctually suspicious of this, that this was a a counterweak that ran amok.  That's the kind of thing Steve Jobs would do. I'll show you Tesla.  Well, they got just you know, and so that's a definitely possibility.  I think it actually started with Business Insider, you know, whether it's saying that, you know, we're giving we're giving it was a response.  So Bloomberg posted story business that reported on the Bloomberg story.  And then someone wrote in to Business Insider saying, oh, you should see what we're working on.  I'll tell you what's really going on. Right. Exactly.

Start time: 2188.82
End time: 2236.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then I'll tell you what's really I'm even more cynical.  Well, I'll tell you what's going on. Apple did not want to do a watch.  Johnny Ive wanted to do a watch. It's all Johnny Ive and Mark Newsome watches.  Apple did not want to do a watch. We saw the story, which is preparing you for the truth.  The story, which was leaked to the journal saying the Apple watch was going to be so much better,  but we couldn't put the sensors in without killing the battery life and getting FDA approval.  So we didn't. So it's really not really that great.  Fact, this article even said we were racking our brain.  What could we do with the watch to make it compelling?  The Apple watch is going to be a flop.  Apple knows it's going to be a flop and they are preparing the world with something else to look at.  Here, look at don't pay attention to that watch. What about a car?  Here's a car. Look, a car.

Start time: 2236.80
End time: 2238.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was number two. That was number two on the cynical tape.

Start time: 2238.80
End time: 2304.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, it's definitely going to be a... Oh, sorry.  No, I was just saying.  I was going to say it's definitely...  Jump in, Lisa.  I mean, it's definitely going to be a first generation product for sure,  which means it's not going to be as great as some people have probably expected it to be.  And I mean, especially for the smartwatch category, I think people were looking to Apple to kind of show like what,  you know, kind of provide an example of what a good smartwatch is and what it could be useful for because we've seen tons.  I mean, you know, Samsung's launched like what, six smartwatches in a year and almost every major tech company has one,  but you don't really see people wearing them that often because, you know, a lot of people think,  why should I pay $300 for something that does exactly what my phone does on my wrist?  It just doesn't seem like something people really want or need right now.  And there's also a lot of just in the ways that smartwatches are made, there's a lot of obstacles to overcome.  Like, you know, battery life is one.  Nobody wants to have to charge a watch all the time.  So I think even just technically there are still barriers that even companies like Apple are going to have to overcome.  And that'll definitely be obvious in the first generation product.

Start time: 2305.42
End time: 2348.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'd never bet against Apple selling a lot of product because there are so many Apple...  What's the word?  I don't want to insult anybody.  No, you can't.  Devotees.  Devotees, thank you, Tessa.  Who will buy anything that Apple poops.  So this will sell a lot of units.  But I think fundamentally this is not the watch Apple hopes to make.  It is not a watch anybody needs to buy.  And except for Apple Devotees, I think this, I think, you know, we're seeing the story that they're making five million watches, which would be huge.  That would be a big number of watches to sell.  Now that we've seen that story from the Wall Street Journal, I guess that was also...  Was that also planted?  How does that fit in this?

Start time: 2349.49
End time: 2357.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  See, that's a weird one to me.  I don't know.  What was your take on that, Ben?  Because I still question the idea of leaking that figure.  Are they trying to gin up lines?

Start time: 2359.18
End time: 2362.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Like trying to create, you know, pent up demand even though there is none?

Start time: 2362.92
End time: 2391.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  To me, that sets an unfair expectation because five million is more than Samsung or than any of the Android Wear ones have done today.  It's more than Pepple's done.  And you're saying that that's going to be how many of these you make.  If you don't do that many, does that then mean that we look at the watch as a failure?  So I question why they would want that number to come out.  But I'm curious to hear Ben's take because that to me doesn't feel like that came from Apple at all.  That seems like a supply chain leak, but I really don't know.  I don't know.

Start time: 2391.82
End time: 2409.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was actually. That makes sense.  Yeah, it probably was a supply chain leak.  You can say that that was also potentially a response to the day previous article about the watch functionality.  So the watch functionality article came out and then a day later the how many Apple's going to produce article came out.

Start time: 2409.94
End time: 2415.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The functionality article is the one I was referring to where it said they had hoped to do so much more, but that did not.

Start time: 2416.33
End time: 2474.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, exactly.  And I think the end.  So we my second cynical take was exactly what you said.  That's even more cynical.  That's like really.  Well, it's that the car rumor is to is intended to overturn the watch.  I my position on the watch, which again, you know, obviously no one has used is.  I believe in broad strokes that the watch makes sense.  I think that people in tech serially underestimate small conveniences that.  And so I given the fact that I think the watch makes sense and I think Apple deserves the benefit of the doubt.  Quite frankly, given the last 15 years, I'm inclined to assume it's going to be it is what they intended.  It's going to be successful until I'm proven otherwise.  And I'm open to being proven otherwise.  That's a safe bet.

Start time: 2474.80
End time: 2478.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've learned not to bet against Apple.  I think it's going to be a hit.

Start time: 2478.80
End time: 2588.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think it's going to be a hit.  I don't think it's obviously going to be as big as the iPhone or the iPad, but I think it's going to be successful.  And I think that the fact that they are approaching it the same way you would approach jewelry is a really smart move.  Because to me, that's been the fundamental area where all the other smartwatches have failed.  We're all going to watch.  Let's we are all going to.  Well, of course we are.  But I also think that by going after you know, but the thing is, is that I think the problem that the other smartwatches have made is they've basically just targeted the tech user and then tried to kind of force other people in.  And everybody's like, well, but this is ugly.  And is this community really worth it?  You make something that's attractive.  You make something that feels like a luxury item.  You make something that's accessorizable and extensible with the different bands and you can pull in a different class of user.  And then at that point, I don't think that having all those sensors even matters.  I think if it does enough and if it doesn't impact the battery, people will like it.  You can always save more stuff for future iterations.  I actually kind of looked at the story that, oh, you know, this doesn't do everything we want.  That to me didn't even strike me as being internally.  That seemed almost like an opposite story to me.  It was almost like, well, maybe at one point an early iteration on the drawing table said we would like to do all these things.  But Apple realized correctly that this would be too much for a first gen product.  I mean, I think everybody who buys this thing is going to know either they're going to be a watch person who is buying it for the fashion aspect or they're going to be kind of a techie Apple person who realizes, yeah, it's a first gen Apple product.  You're better off.  I don't care.  You're right, but I don't care because I want it because it's now a status symbol.  And especially in Asia, I mean, I know Ben can talk to this more, but especially in Asia, it's going to become, I think, so much of a status symbol and so much of that sort of piece of fashion and fashion accessory, both the fashion and tech accessory that they can, you know, sell, you know, millions of them potentially just on the cachet alone.

Transcript:  Yeah, and Apple is also really the only company that's kind of marketing it as more of a watch than like a piece of technology like Christina was saying.  Because I mean, if you think about it, like even all the different models and types that they offer, you know, stainless steel sport like rose gold, like all of these different editions, that's the kind of customization you would see if you were buying watches.  You know, meanwhile, other competitors are maybe offering like two or three different colors, but, you know, not really different materials and like the class is like uncomfortable.

Transcript:  That's a really, it's a really good insight, Lisa.  The fact that, you know, it seems so weird at the time in the presentation that Apple started out by talking about it, you know, it's super precise and especially, I mean, I have watches are precise now.  What?  No, the nicer the watch, the less precise it is in my experience.  That's a good point.  If you have to wind it, it's not precise.  But it's a good point is it is absolutely being sold first and foremost as a watch.  And I don't have much to add on the fact that that's a really interesting way to look at it.

Transcript:  That's my prediction, folks.  And thank God we'll never actually know our show today.  I showed a brought to you by Gazelle.  If you've got an old Apple watch you want to get rid of, it'll be Gazelle's the place  you'll go to get rid of it right now.  They buy iPhones, iPads, even broken iPhones and iPads, other Apple products.  They buy Samsung phones.  They'll even buy your old Blackberry.  They'll buy your Surface Pro tablet.  They they'll give you cash on the barrel head.  So if you've been taking your old gadgets, when you get that new phone, you just throw the old one in a drawer or whatever.  Say, oh, someday I'll, you know, give it to cousin Ernie.  He'll he'll want it.  And meanwhile, it's just gathering dust.  You wouldn't throw 100 dollar bills in that drawer, would you?  Let him just.  Oh, someday I'll I'll give it to cousin Ernie.  No, you would you would take that money.  You would use it for something fun.  You would buy your next phone.  That's what Gazelle's all about.  You they will buy your old stuff and give you a great price.  And the best part is you get that that quote from Gazelle dot com fast and easy and guaranteed for 30 days.  So you don't even have to decide right now.  Get the quote. Find out.  In fact, pile a bunch of stuff in.  Once you decide to sell, they'll send you a box prepaid with a postage already done.  And then they'll send you a check, a PayPal credit or for an extra five percent, get an Amazon gift card.  You buy a lot of stuff on Amazon.  That's that's a good idea.  G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.  And now you may ask, OK, so they'll buy all this old stuff.  What do they do with it?  Well, the best of the stuff they sell back to you.  If you need a new gadget, you can get Gazelle's certified pre-owned gadgets.  They have two qualities certified like new, which is basically something brand new that somebody opened and said, I don't want it and sold it to Gazelle and then certified good.  That's where you can get the best price.  They show some gentle signs of wear, but they work.  So and probably it's going to be better shaped than the iPhone you broke or lost.  All devices. In fact, for my I wish they'd done this when my kids were losing iPhones every few months.  All devices were put through a rigorous 30 point inspection to ensure they're fully functional.  Certified pre-owned devices are backed by a 30 day risk free return policy.  So you're going to get a great price, a great product and no risk.  Gazelle, you got to try it to sell or to buy G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.  Just find out what your old iPhone is worth.  You might be amazed.  You've been throwing hundred dollar bills in that drawer.  Well, I'm glad Ben's here because he can represent the voice of China.  Why are you laughing?  He's gone. The chair is empty.  He must have known I was going to the Lenovo story, right?  So I'll tell the story and then when Ben gets back, you know what?  He's a three year old woke up, I bet.  That must be.  Yeah. Well, we'll come back in a moment.  Ben Thompson for Strotecary is not here, but good news.  Lisa Edichico is here.  She's from Business Insider and of course, Christina Warren from Mashable.  This infuriated me.  Lenovo, they were caught in September and didn't do anything about it till January  and now say, oh, we messed up.  We made a mistake. So sorry.  Here's a fix it tool.  What did they do?  They put software.  Now, remember, there's a huge price pressure on PC manufacturers.  Their margin on consumer grade PCs, the low end of the market, is practically nothing.  You're buying an HP stream for 200 bucks.  That bill of goods is probably 200 bucks.  So companies make up the difference.  They make some profit by putting trialware on your system.  We've all seen how junked up Windows computers can get with McAfee antivirus.  I've even had Windows PCs with two antiviruses on them.  You know, all sorts of crap.  But this takes the cake.  Lenovo, we don't know when, but apparently started putting something called Superfish on their consumer grade laptops.  What does Superfish do?  Well, first of all, what it does is incredibly annoying.  It puts ads on sites you're visiting from the Lenovo put there that Lenovo makes money on.  So you go to visit Twit and you'll see ads that aren't on the Twit page because Lenovo has put Superfish on its laptop.  That's bad enough.  But the thing that's really infuriating is in order to do this, Superfish creates a man in the middle attack.  They actually break secure socket layers.  They break SSL.  And so they intercept not only normal web traffic, but secure web traffic using a self-signed security certificate, by the way, easily spoofed by attackers.  So it opens a massive security hole on your system.  And if you think when you've been using your Lenovo Y50, which is one of the devices that this was on, if you think that your conversation with your bank was encrypted and safe,  or your conversation with Amazon, your credit card information encrypted safe, it wasn't.  It wasn't.  Lenovo put software on it that broke SSL.  Lenovo said their benefit from this was minor.  So that's even stupider.  They should have made millions out of this.  This is appalling.  Security researchers have already demonstrated how attackers could use Superfish to create an attack.  Lenovo says they're not yet aware of any attacks targeting customers.  Doesn't matter.  Doesn't matter.  Now, Lenovo has responded in January.  They took down the server that was doing this intermediation.  And they have posted on the Lenovo website information about which products are affected.  It's not, by the way, the business products.  ThinkPad, ThinkCenter, Lenovo Desktop, ThinkStation, ThinkServer, SystemX, according to Lenovo, are not impacted.  I'm not sure I would trust Lenovo at this point in anything.  And they do give you removal tools.  And if you follow the link on their site, a long list of affected notebooks.  E-Series, Flex Series, G Series, M Series, S Series, U Series, Y Series, Yoga Series, and Z Series.  Many of the machines are all affected by this.  A self-signed root certificate breaks SSL.  It is offensive in the highest degree.  And it is appalling that any company would do this with full knowledge of what they were doing.  And I don't care if they've apologized and stopped it.  They stopped it because they were caught.  Benny, are you back? Yeah, good.  I'm back. I'm back.  Am I crazy to be? My take on this is never again will I buy a Lenovo product or will I recommend it?  It hurts me because I've recommended Lenovo's ThinkPads for a long time.  I always thought they were great computers.  This is a... What happened?

Start time: 3275.80
End time: 3364.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But actually, you nailed it right at the beginning, Leo.  And that was when you talked about the profit margins.  You're exactly right. The average PC maker does not make a single cent on their PC.  They make all their money on the pre-install software and stuff like that.  And so that's why to get the...  To buy... Some of them do sell PCs without anything on there.  They cost more and they cost more because they need to make money somewhere.  And so indirectly, if anyone is to...  I mean, obviously, Lenovo is to blame, to be clear.  But Microsoft shares blame here.  And the reason they share blame is this...  The PC market is the way Microsoft drove it to look in that...  Really?  There's tons of people competing to basically on price because they've been totally commoditized.  All the value was pulled out by Microsoft in the OS layer.  And so Microsoft captures all the value leaving basically the OEM makers to...  But Microsoft didn't make them charge less for their computers.  No, well, they did though.  Technically, we did. We demanded cheap computers.  Right. Well, that's the second point is even then, who really bears the blame is consumers because we buy based on price.  And if you look at it, yes, Lenovo was wrong.  And they deserve to be excruciated for it.

Start time: 3371.12
End time: 3438.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But at the same time, we're all depending...  Basically, the market came to be that we depended on the good graces of these companies to not cross the line and go to the dark side.  When in reality, all the incentives were for them to do just that.  And we should be outraged that this happened.  I don't think we should be surprised.  And quite frankly, we shouldn't be surprised the same thing happens on Android because it's the exact same dynamic going on.  Google is trying to extract all the value from the ecosystem, leaving all their OEMs to compete on price.  And that's why there's lots of pre-installed crap on there as well.  And again, there's enough consumers that only buy based on price that this works.  But there are consequences.  And it's the same thing with any ad-based company that we all need to be cognizant of, is that the incentives are pointing in the wrong direction.  And sure, it's fun to get great stuff for free, but you're playing with fire.  And this is a very real example of the sort of fire that you're playing with.

Start time: 3439.86

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think it's fair to blame Microsoft for decisions they made 10 and 15 years ago that have driven the market to this place.  But I do think that it's worth noting that basically, Microsoft's been kind of in a position,  last few years, where they've known that the cesspool of adware and pre-installed software junk that really makes the Windows experience terrible.  And to a certain extent, they've actually been kind of barred from doing a lot about it.  I'm not defending Microsoft at all, but they've been kind of, their hands have been tied a little bit because of the various restrictions put in place by the EU  and other things with their Department of Justice trial way back, where they have a difficult time limiting the things that OEMs can do  without breaking, without people saying, oh no, now you're stifling what the manufacturers can do to these machines.  There was even a period of time, I think they still do this, at the Microsoft stores where they sell machines that basically just have Windows on them.  They don't have the adware.  Signature.

Start time: 3492.80
End time: 3508.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Microsoft understood that people were getting a crap experience in Windows, thanks to all this adware being installed by HP and others.  So they created this signature program.  And in fact, Lenovo does sell computers at the Microsoft store under the signature program.  And it's plain Windows.  You pay more for it.

Start time: 3509.39
End time: 3556.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right.  And I mean, it's absolutely, you know, to Ben's point, he's right.  This is kind of the world that we live in, and both consumers, you know, it is what it is.  But I'm not ready at all to give Lenovo, or frankly, Superfish, I think that a lot of the blame has been put on Lenovo without talking about the company that actually is doing this.  And the fact that they wrote this program that would be install a root certificate on Windows that would break HTTPS and that company has not said anything, will not talk, kicked one of our reporters out of their office on Friday who tried to talk to them.  And I think it's worth looking into how many deals do they have with other OEMs.  But it opens up to me a broader question of, you know, Lenovo should not be off the hook and shouldn't be just because the game doesn't mean that you don't pay for the consequences.  You know, the whole point is everybody's doping.  Just don't get caught.  And if you get caught, you're going to do time for it is basically how it works.

Start time: 3557.52
End time: 3576.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that's why I think we should boycott Lenovo.  We should put them out of business as a very strong message, not to Lenovo, too late to every other manufacturer that this is the price you pay.  You know, Sony got away with this, putting a root kit on games for DRM.  And they kind of...  It was music CDs.  Music CDs.  That's right.  It was music CDs.

By the way, the only statement came to ours, Technica's Dan Gooden, the only statement from Superfish attributed to the CEO, Adi Pinha.  Superfish, by the way, although they have an office in Palo Alto, is an Israeli company.  And the statement said that Superfish is not a vulnerability.  It is.  There has been significant misinformation.  This is his statement.  Circulating about Superfish software pre-install on certain Lenovo laptops.  Software shipped on a limited number of computers in 2014.  Get this mealy-mouthed adware.  In an effort to...  Well, I think there was an interesting point here, Leo.

Start time: 3656.34

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Despite the false and misleading statements, this is Superfish CEO made by some media commentators, me and bloggers, the Superfish software, he says, does not present a security risk.  And this is what he interprets as a security risk.  Hey, in no way does Superfish store personal data or share such data with anyone.  Unfortunately, in this situation, a vulnerability was introduced unintentionally by a third party.  Now they're blaming someone else.  Both Lenovo and Superfish did extensive testing of the solution, but it wasn't identified.  This is by the way, this is really reprehensible.  This guy is now hiding behind some unnamed third party.  We didn't do this.  We didn't do this.

Transcript:  The worst part is I bet most people that own Lenovo computers, people outside of the tech world that aren't like us, don't even understand what's going on.  I mean, how many people really even understand what encryption means or any of this?  And it's like it's really putting the consumer in a super vulnerable position.  Because I mean, when you think about the types of connections that are being broken, those are banking sites.  Those are online shopping sites.  And it's just really terrible.  And it's hard to understand how and why Lenovo would even kind of let something like this happen.  Because like you mentioned, it's not even like they benefited that much from using Superfish.  Like I understand that the profits on PCs are extremely small and a lot of PC makers aren't really making that much off of just sales alone.  But it's not even like they're making that much money off of Superfish being on their computers.

Quote, we have thoroughly investigated this technology and do not find any evidence to substantiate security concerns.  Within hours, Lenovo yanked that sentence.  And their CTO said, oops, we blew it.  We're sorry.  It is a security problem.  It is whenever you this is a man in the middle attack.  It is perpetrated on every Lenovo user.

Transcript:  I think I think there's I think, though, there's there's an Occam's razor explanation here.  So I'm trying to get to you.  And that is like I suspect that and this is why the incentive stuff matters like incentives don't matter because I'm incentivized to go robbing banks.  I rob a bank. Of course, I know robbing a bank is wrong.  And and I suspect that Lenovo CEO and CTO knows that doing this is wrong.  I don't think they were they were sandbagging.  I actually suspect that they just did another preinstalled deal.  And that's exactly what it was.  They didn't really appreciate what was happening.  And that's why I drew the connection to the to the David Cameron podcast.  Like even among people who should know, there's not really an appreciation for what what security means and what and how security can be compromised.  It's just something that people don't know about.  And and so I actually suspect that it was just another deal.  Someone made it. Maybe someone in Lenovo knew.  I actually honestly doubt it was someone that high up because as as as as Lisa just said, like it doesn't make any sense to do this.  It's it's way too high risk.  And for the cost, I mean, we have, you know, nationally acclaimed podcast, really the port calling for.  Wait a minute. Hell, how about that?

And I can quote from from that interview and our reporter, our intern, he did a great job really pressing the guy to.  And he was saying, OK, but realistically, do you think there are customers out there who would want superficial on their computer?  And this is the jackass's answer.  I think there are many customers out there who are interested in having tools that help them shop tools that help them do what they're doing better, whether that's specific to one user or not.  That's a different story.  He's there. They're still like trying to play.  You know, I mean, their answer, their pat line, which is we thought people would love this product is such a complete BS.

Like, that's the issue here.  That's the underlying issue.  That's why this is on there.  Forget all the stuff that happened in the meantime.  The issue is that people go into Best Buy or whatever and they buy the cheapest computer.  And guess what?  You get what you pay for.

American Airlines try to do bigger seat with they advertise on it.  No one no one want to pay for it.  Continental advertise on better service.  They went out of business like this like or they got they merged with United.  Like the reality is is that we have no one to blame but ourselves.  And it's it's it's very gratifying to get our soapbox and say gosh darn you, Lenovo.  You should have done a better job.  But the truth of the matter is we brought ourselves in the like and all this stuff is on us.  The loss of privacy on us.  All this stuff on us because we don't care or not willing to pay for it.  And quite frankly, if I sound upset, it's because I am because when you get to things like this,  this is an issue where where the majority kind of rules like take something like Google.  Google is an unbelievable, fantastic, amazing resource or Facebook.  Everyone is on Facebook.  Like I don't have a vote.  Like if I want to use these services and even if I were willing to pay for them,  I know that I could never do so because the reality is the vast majority of people don't care and don't want to pay.  And and the this stuff is it.

Transcript:  But here's my question, Ben. I could I could buy your argument a little bit.  And I understand it. Yes, it is easy to go after Lenovo here.  And I think we should because frankly, to me, the problem is not so much that I did this.  It's been their response after the fact.  It's been the fact that even in our interview with the CTO, he still was trying to claim, oh, well, just because you could theoretically take advantage of this doesn't mean anybody has.  And so it's really not a security issue.  They're still trying to skirt the issue, which is completely and totally to me the wrong way to do it and is absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But my question is, I mean, I could understand a little bit if this was something that they were doing this particular program.  They weren't investigating what these things were doing, if it were even some of their lower end products.  But this is basically on all their machines, except for the ThinkPad line.  So we're we're talking about yoga, too.  We're not talking about cheap computers.  We're talking about, in some cases, ultrabooks that sell for as much as MacBooks.  So we're not talking about something where, you know, to me, it seems clear that this is even something we can blame just on them trying to keep their prices low.  They were doing this across the line.  But beyond that, even if you are going to do these things, don't you think that there is a responsibility, especially by the companies involved, to look into what are they doing and how is this stuff working on the on the operating systems they're installing it on?  I mean, even if you let's say that they did want to install this, that's fine, provided it's not going to break HTTPS.  To me, the question what scares me is that a company like Lenovo is not doing any due diligence at all to make sure that the software is preinstalling is not breaking fundamental parts of security.  And if Lenovo is doing it and they've done good things, then how can we trust no name OEMs to not be doing things that are 10 times worse?  And what does that mean for the average consumer who goes to the store and buys something and doesn't have any, you know, a guess sense of security whatsoever to know that what I'm buying is not immediately going to be unsafe as soon as I plug it in?  I completely agree.

Start time: 4256.88
End time: 4311.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I said at the beginning and perhaps my verbosity clouded that fact.  Like Lenovo deserves the blame here.  Like they screwed up.  They screwed up royally.  They should have cop to it immediately.  I mean, and so I completely agree with you, Christina.  I'm more making a broader point that we shouldn't be surprised that this happened.  One.  And two, I think this is a great example.  I suspect this is a great example of the general ignorance about security and what security entails.  And so if Lenovo's CEO and CTO, if we give them the method out and said that they didn't really appreciate what Superfish meant, why on earth should we expect our politicians to have any idea what it means to ask for a backdoor in our software?  So I think we're actually more on the same page.  I'm just kind of pointing out an alternative thing.

Start time: 4311.96
End time: 4329.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I got to say, if you're a technology company and you don't understand why putting a secure, you know, doing a man in the middle on SSL and putting a self-signed certificate on your computer is a bad thing, maybe you shouldn't be selling computers.  Maybe you should be selling something else.

Start time: 4329.82
End time: 4400.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. The bottom line is that regardless of whether or not the experience is worse because you have this, you know, bloatware or whatever on your computer, there's still an expectation that it's going to be safe.  Like Christina was saying, like regardless of whether or not I think, you know, both Lenovo and Microsoft, you know, it's the responsibility of the PC makers and the people behind the software to, you know, make sure that things are safe because people don't know.  It's not like somebody went to like a bad website that they shouldn't like a really sketchy website that maybe they shouldn't have.  And they caught something like this is something that came with the computers out of the box that consumers had no choice in and no saying whatsoever.  So, I mean, I absolutely they have a responsibility to make sure that things are going to be safe.  And that whole response that like, oh, yeah, someone could take advantage of it, but they, you know, maybe they have it.  So it's not technically a security flaw.  Like, I mean, that that's a terrible response to me because you're the one making the computer and putting the software on there.  If somebody does take advantage of it, like that it's going to be too late by that point.  Why would you want to wait until something bad happens or even put your consumers at that risk to begin with Lenovo, by the way, is the number one PC manufacturer.

And, you know, I think it was actually earlier in the week to that it was on the flip side, the story that the U.S.  government was breaking into products on like the firmware level.  That's a that's a it's a really interesting question and certainly one worth worth asking.  I think and I think there's going to be a lot more questions on this line going in both directions.  It's one of those things where both countries are super suspicious of each other and both are completely justified.

They are the largest vendor of smartphones in mainland China.  Remember, they just bought Motorola from Google last year.  I'm looking on Wikipedia just to see who who owns them.  But I think you make a good point that it's even we don't know.

Transcript:  I mean, it's one of those things where I mean, I'm I mean, just maybe because of my context of where I'm at is the reality is is we might sound paranoid saying this on the flip side.  There were lots of people trying to be paranoid about the US stuff.  We're doing it infiltrated and it actually turned out the paranoid.  According to the Snowden documents, the people were paranoid were right.

Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's I think it's tragic in a way.  I mean, like the reality is, is I don't think you can trust just about any computing device at this point, to be perfectly frank.  And and I think China is justified to be suspicious of US technology in the US is very justified to be suspicious of Chinese technology.  And it's too bad because I think this suspicion hurts the US more than hurts anyone else because most of the value in technology is still in the United States.  And these revelations and the fact that the US is is is getting into this stuff is going going has hurt business is going to hurt business even more in the future.  And I think that's to the long run detriment of the of the United States.  And I get why it happens.  I think that we're paying a much greater cost than we than we might appreciate.  We being the United States.

And even with the Mac Pro, most of the components are made in China.  So if you were worried about China, forget it.  That that's long over.  I don't I just have to say I think that I think that regardless of the incentive that Lenovo had to do this cheating is still cheating.  Doing this is still wrong.  Whether they knew or not is not to the issue.  I think this is unacceptable.  And I just I will no longer recommend Lenovo products.  That's all I can say.  I have to think about Motorola.  I really like Motorola products.  I agree.

Transcript:  Well, I made what we may learn and we seem to be learning a little bit is that this is not the only product doing this.  There's a product that's beginning a lot of attention called Commodia.  And I think we don't know fully what's going on with Commodia.  Commodia is the third party, I believe, that Superfish was referring to.  And KOMODIA.  It proudly markets HTTPS decrypting and interception software that's used by more than 100 clients, including Fortune 500 companies.  So what we may be finding is that you're right, Ben.  And this is not only this is not restricted to Lenovo.  This is very widespread.

Start time: 4708.45
End time: 4749.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, I think that's that's a guarantee.  I think it'll just depend on how deep it goes.  But I mean, kind of to use my sports knowledge, I said earlier, I mean, I think the fact matter is that it's not just about the product.  I think the fact matter is that even if everybody dopes, you know, it's the person that gets caught that becomes the example.  Right. And and that's just how it is with everything.  And I just hope I mean, I hope frankly, all of us as journalists, you know, take a harder line into looking into this stuff.  And I hope that companies start to realize, hey, you know, when we make these deals, we need to do a good job actually investigating what this stuff does,  because it's no longer good enough to say, oh, we thought that this would be something customers would love if you're actually impacting aspects of the security stack.

Start time: 4750.78
End time: 4802.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And quite frankly, I mean, I think you kind of made this point indirectly, Leo, is that I mean, this this is works hugely in Apple's favor.  I mean, there's no there's, you know, every time when these stories comes out and it's it's and it's not a Mac and you see Tim Cook making this point much more explicitly recently,  including a week ago at the Cyber Security Summit, like the fact that Apple doesn't make money this way makes their incentives more consumer friendly in this regard.  And yeah, I get that there's an access that some people can't afford it and to have free stuff is great.  And that's absolutely true. But there still is this incentive challenge.  And, you know, as as things do get more personal, more of our life is lived on and through computers.  I don't think it's any surprise that you see Apple pushing this angle more recently.

Transcript:  I think this is damaging to the reputation of personal computing in general.  It will it will further undermine people's trust of the Web of SSL of computers.  And I worry very much about the millions of people who bought Lenovo computers who don't listen to this show or my radio show, who will never know that they're running computers that have been compromised.  And by the way, and thanks to Mark Rogers, who is the chief researcher over at Cloudflare and has done the research on the Commodia certificates.  There's Commodia is in keep my family secure parental control software custodial parental control software web filter from Cura Pira staff cop easy hide IP classic the Lava soft ad aware web companions something people install to fight adware hide my IP.  The certificates are always weak. The private key is always bundled with them and the password is always Commodia SSL interception has never been so easy hackers have added.  Terrible. So there's this is we're just this is the tip of the iceberg. We haven't heard of the end of this one.  And yeah, buy I guess or buy a signature PC. But just you know, you might want to check the firmware on your hard drive in case the NSA is compromised.  There you go. It's hope. You know, I almost I feel like you can't stop government intrusion because they're just too good at this.  But at least we can have SSL work. If our computer companies don't break it. At least I should be able to talk to my bank.  Or is it just forget it? Just forget it. All right. You know what?  Academy Awards coming up. Red carpet. They started the red carpet two hours ago.

And quite frankly, there's a systematic issue when it comes to company security as well. Like the the the problem with security is it's very hard and it's very expensive. And the benefits, the benefits of a good security policy is that nothing can be done.  Nothing happens. And that's really hard to get on the flip side, though, the money you pay for security goes right to the bottom line, as in it decreases the bottom line. You get nothing for it. And that's what you wanted. Right. Exactly. So the incentives for an executive who needs to make a certain number is to de-prioritize security.  And so really, we should be glad that she's being held to account and we should we should cheer for that.

Transcript:  We'll see. She'll be home to us. Here's the thing. Ironically, I mean, Ben is sort of right. But the truth of the matter is, is that if Sony had had a better year and if their films had done better, that would have been secure.  So, I mean, honestly, that's really what it comes down to. The fact of the matter is, is that the Spider-Man, Amazing Spider-Man 2 was a flop. The studio had lost money quarter after quarter, even before the debacle with the interview.  That wasn't looking like that was going to be the hit that it needed to be. Her job was frankly already in jeopardy when it was going to come up for her renewal. I think in June, they decided to to canter early and she could take the fall.  The big question will be, does Michael Linton, who's actually in charge, does he get fired or not? I think at this point, Yaz, the CEO of Sony is probably a little bit reticent to get rid of everybody who's running things.  But as people in the chat said, she fell upward. She and is taking it quite well. She's an adult. This is Hollywood. This sort of thing happens.  And this is not the first time that studio executives have had these sort of issues. She held the post for a really long time. She knew, absolutely. As soon as the Rudin emails were leaked, she knew that she was going to become the fall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, no, no. That's Scott Rudin who works with them but does not work for Sony was the one who wrote that. And then she actually defended Angelina a little bit. But that was, you know, she and Scott Rudin have had a long friendship.  And as I can attest, having gone through all those emails, it's, you know, I mean, it's kind of-  It's what you write. It's what people write in their email.  I have to say. And even that one, to be fair, that one got back to Michael Lenton and even he emailed both of them and said, I cannot believe that you two would put this email. What is wrong with you?  Even he was like, and this is before the hack, even Michael Lenton was like, both of you should be ashamed that any of this was ever an email ever. Because even he was like, this goes too far.

They say they want to, and I think it's a good goal, increase their profit 25 times in three years.  So that's a goal. I would like to do the same. The strategy, well, there are two things in the whole Sony world that are doing well. What do you think those two things are? You guys know.

They already killed computing, right? They're probably going to spin off Sony Pictures Entertainment?  Probably not.  They're going to keep entertainment.  They're going to keep that.

Transcript:  The TV example is interesting per our prior conversation. There was a story this week or last week where Samsung's inserting ads on their TVs.  Yeah.  And it's the same dynamics. It's like there's no, it's very difficult to differentiate a TV, which means it's a race to the bottom.  And once you get to the bottom, that's when the bad stuff starts happening.

Start time: 5782.94
End time: 5872.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's very frustrating. I bought a Panasonic Viera television for thousands of dollars.  And I go to the, you know, the hub, the smart apps, and I get ads all over it. Not just static ads, video ads.  It's extremely annoying. I paid a lot of money for you. Why are you giving me ads?  And you cannot, you can turn some off, but you can't turn them all off.  Now, Sony's been getting a lot of heat. Was it Sony? No, Samsung's been getting a lot of heat.  Samsung for the voice TV.  Now to me, I'm curious what you guys think. So Samsung published a disclaimer in their documentation, which you get when you buy the TV, saying,  Hey, you've got voice control. You should know that whenever you use it, the voice recording has to be sent to our servers for interpretation.  Maybe a third party nuance, because Sony, I mean Samsung, unlike Apple, doesn't have its, or Google, doesn't have its own internal voice recognition system.  Nuance is a big one that's used by a lot of companies, including Samsung phones.  So it'll go to nuance where it'll be recognized and sent back. If you don't like this, you should turn it off.  To me, this seems completely reasonable. And anybody who uses Siri or Google Now, Samsung's voice or Cortana should know that the phone's not doing the recognition.  It's always going to a server. So it seemed to me that people were upset about that.  We're just like, what? Of course. And they disclosed it and there's a way to turn it off. Or am I wrong? Is this a terrible, horrible? Are they listening to us and spying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You know what my concern is? It's not so much that they're doing any of the processing server side, because obviously I think that's fine.  Of course they are.  And then that's how this all works. My bigger question is where are they storing this stuff? How long are they storing it? And what are the security measures behind wherever they're storing it?  That's my bigger question. Not so much what are they doing with it? Because I don't actually think they're competent enough to go through all of my voice transactions and do anything with it.  Hell no.  Exactly. My bigger question is, is my voice some place tied to an identifier that is then tied to my name or my address on a server some place?

Start time: 5908.06

I don't actually think the companies have the time or the resources to go through everything I say or that they even care that much.  I'm more concerned, I guess, from any...the only threat I would see would be, okay, if someone hacks into their S3 account or whatever, they're storing this stuff and accesses everything I've said.  That might be problematic, or at least creepy.  But otherwise, I mean, the Echo to me is the perfect example of why that sort of tech works really well.  Because when it works, which is most of the time, it's almost instantaneous and it feels like the future.

I feel like most of the time, if I want to look something up, I don't mind typing it in.  I do think Cortana is pretty interesting, though.  I remember I used it a while ago around the time that it was initially launching, and I'm sure it's better now.  But I mean, I kind of like in Cortana that you can also, you know, you're not forced to use your voice.  You can type if you want to, which I guess is really the same as Google now also.  But yeah, I don't know.  Other than like setting reminders, maybe or setting alarms, I don't really use voice commands for too much.

Or if you're not in the United States, you don't deserve any protection.  You're a foreigner, so we don't care.  Well, if you got no rights.  Yeah, it's not just a personal thing.  It's more a maybe it's just a factor of living abroad.  And, you know, my wife's not a US citizen.  I the whole like you can differentiate how you should treat people based on where they were born.

Lots of rumors that the Snapdragon 810 overheats.  We had an LG G Flex 2 here Miriam Jouir reviewed.  It did not get hot.

But yeah, I mean, that's what Qualcomm basically said on the earnings call was that they had one customer, one large customer reporting that there were heat issues, but that none of the other customers had it.  But that was the reason that Samsung ended up dropping it from the S6, which is why Qualcomm ended up having to drop down their yearly, I guess, projected earnings because of losing that.

For the past couple of years, they've definitely been among my favorite Android phones.  But I mean, I think Samsung kind of, you know, I don't think the S5 really went as well as they kind of expected it to.  And I think they're changing a lot in order to get people kind of excited about their Galaxy phones again.  And I mean, based on the rumors I've been reading, it sounds like it's going to be an awesome phone.  I mean, it sounds like they're going to go with metal instead of like, you know, that glossy kind of plastic they used to use and that like dimples back that kind of looked a little bit like a bandaid.  Yeah.  They had for the S5.  And we've also been kind of hearing rumors about it running like an almost stock version of Android, which would be great too.

Careful.  No, I mean, it is culturally.  In many respects, it is actually very, one of the cool things of living here is because  there wasn't the Cultural Revolution, which sadly destroyed a lot of the old bits of China.  The intellectuals.  You get almost more of a traditional experience here in some respects than you might in some  places in China.  But I mean, China is a big country.  China, people forget it's as big as the United States.  Everyone knows that people in California are totally different than people in the South,  say, or in the Northeast or in the Midwest.

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by Harry's.  I love Harry's.  Harry's is the place to get amazing deals on the best razors you have ever used.  I live by Harry's these days.  Let's face it, guys.  Shaving is one of those things.  You see a lot of beards these days.  It ain't because it's hip or fashionable.  Sure, they'll tell you that.  It's because they don't want to shave.  It's one of those things you just don't want to do every morning, especially if you're  using cheap razors.  I see guys go, I almost want to stop them in the drugstore.  They're buying the disposable blades.  I'm going, oh, God, don't do that to yourself.  But then I understand why, because you walk over to the Gillette section and it's all  locked up because it's so valuable.  It's $4 a blade.  Harry's gives you better blades than Gillette or any of the other big name brands for about  half the cost.  That's because Harry's bought the factory.  They literally bought their own razor blade factory in Germany, one of the best.  They said there was two that knew how to make blades, and they bought one of them.  Their engineer, because Harry sells direct to you, they can say to the engineers, they  can say, look, don't stint.  Don't make those cheap disposable.  We want the best steel, the best blades.  They last a long time.  They're super sharp.  They perform beautifully.  And then Harry's ships them free to your doorstep.  I get my Harry's subscription every month with new blades.  Start with a kit from Harry's.  Now, this kit is the Truman kit, but they also have the Winston, the Winston's engraved  metal handle.  I have Winston's, about eight Winston's in the house.  I get buying them.  The kit comes with the handle, three blades, which is a great deal, and the Harry's incredible  foaming shave gel, which is really key to the experience.  It softens your beard, smooths your skin.  In every kit, you get the razor handle, the three razor blades, the foaming shave gel,  and let's not forget the travel, the little travel holder, which I think is really, they  downplay this.  This is worth its weight in gold because you put that in your Dopp kit, you're not going  to cut yourself when you reach in.  All of this for $15, and then you get the blades every month, you're going to be very  happy.  It costs half as much as the Fusion you're buying in the store, and it works twice as  well.  It also is a new aftershave moisturizer that smells so good and protects and hydrates.  You got to try it.  Get $5 off your first purchase.  That means $10 for the Truman set.  Wow, that's a great, oh, I guess the Truman says 20, but you take $5 as 15.  Is that right?  Does that say, it's 25 for the Winston.  All right, 15 for the Truman.  So you take, that's 10 bucks now after you use the offer code TWIT5 at checkout.  $5 off your first purchase.  That'll let them know you heard about it on Twitter, and you'll get a great deal.  Harry's, do not dread shaving in the morning anymore.  Harrys.com, H-A-R-R-Y-S.com, and the offer code is TWIT.  It's a new one.  It's TWIT and the number five.  I think we're done.  I'm just looking to see if there's anything else you guys thought was a big deal.  How about this one?  Wall Street Journal says Trivia Crack, which I've been playing with my mom.  You play it too?

Start time: 7303.74
End time: 7415.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can't help it.  It's too successful, according to the Wall Street Journal.  Trivia Crack has been downloaded 130 million times.  It's free.  There's actually a free version and a paid version, and then they have in-app purchases  and they do have advertising in it.  The most popular free download on Apple's App Store for 66 straight days.  I have to say, one of the things I don't like about it is the questions are user submitted,  so they're wildly wide ranging.  Some of them are really hard, some are easy.  The app's founder is 29, Maximo Cavazzani.  They get submitted one million new questions every day in the question factory.  Only about 1,500 are added to the game each day.  But I have to say, unlike other trivia games that I've played on Android and iPhone, I  never get a question repeat.  But the entrepreneur says it's a problem to get a million submissions a day.  He says, like building a house and a million people come to help you, we only need one  house.  And also there's a constant lot of questions that are basically the same but posed in different  ways.  How old is Justin Bieber?  They get that question like 200,000 times a day.  You can stop submitting that one.  I wouldn't even know the answer to that.  Now it's multiple choice.  That's one of the nice things.  You can always do well.  I can't believe the Wall Street Journal is doing an article on trivia crack.  I can't believe I'm mentioning it, but you know what?  It's fun.  Anything else to say about it?  No.  It's so successful, that's a problem.  Which I would like to know how much money the guy has made on this thing.

Start time: 7416.56
End time: 7437.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I can only imagine because they've got the paid version, they've got the free version,  they've got the ads.  It's a hit on both platforms.  And if they're getting a million submissions a day, that's showing super high engagement.  So yeah, I mean, the question is probably not how much is he making off of it.  What is he leaving on the table by not monetizing it as well as he could?
