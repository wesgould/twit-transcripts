Transcript:  Me too.  Also here Owen JJ Stone.  Oh, doctor from Owen JJ Stone dot com.  And he's got this for you.  This is for you Uncle Leo.  He's got some shaving cream.  Actually, you're on for well, you're on because we love you because you're great.  But you're also on to give me some advice because so we did it.  You may know we did a 24 hour broadcast.  Great success on New Year's Eve to we call it the 24 hours of 2015.  Second year in a row, we've done it in which we say Happy New Year in every time zone.  All 27 time zones in those 24 hours.  In fact, we had callers for many of the time zones.  It was great fun.  And but what we did differently this year was we were raising money for UNICEF.  I think a really great cause.  The United Nations Children's Fund helps kids all over the world who need inexpensive  things like mosquito nets, more elaborate things like education, helps kids be safe  from violence and exploitation.  Really a great cause.  Charity Navigator ranks among its highest charities.  We wanted to use it because it was global.  So everybody who's watching all over the world can get behind it and because it is such a  really well run charity.  But we and we had planned we thought we'd raise 20,000.  That was our goal in the 24 hours because you know, I just I thought well, this first  time we've done we have really no idea but let's say 20,000.  Jeff Jarvis, who's, you know, of course, the wonderful host of This Week in Google,  very kindly said, well, let me get things started.  I will I will shave for the first time in 42 years.  I will shave my beard if you raise twenty thousand dollars.  Amazingly, we raised twenty thousand dollars before noon.  So so Jeff kindly let me shave him.  His beard, which I did a terrible job.  He had to go back and fix it up.  But then that and this is my I'm saying this is an excuse because then I got swept away.  And I said, well, if we make first then Sarah Lane pitched in, she said, if we get to  thirty thousand dollars, I'll sing I'll sing my the song I hate more than any other  song with a passion.  Bare naked ladies one week.  And she did we we did and she did.  And that was great. So I got I said I have to I have to end up I have to pony up, I  have to participate. So I said if we make forty thousand dollars, I'll shave my head.  And if we make fifty thousand dollars, I'll miss.  I thought it's never going to happen.  This is safe. I will get a tattoo.  And you see those of you watching a video, I'm padding, you know, padded part of my  anatomy area.  That's where the tattoo went.  So, yeah, we got forty thousand dollars.  And ladies and gentlemen, there's nothing left up top.  And and we also got fifteen thousand fifty thousand dollars.  In fact, we ended up in fact, you can still you can put us over.  I think we're well over 70 now.  If you go to UNICEF USA dot org slash twit, we're at sixty one thousand.  But there's more than ten thousand from our auction.  So we're well over 70.  I'd love to get even higher.  We're going to keep that site open if you'd like to help out.  UNICEF USA dot org slash twit.  So I had to actually initially we had my head clipped and a number of people said,  you know, that's not shaving.

Well, then I'll be you.  I'll just grow. I'll grow used to it.  I did. I was freezing last night.  I realized that you need a cap.  Do you wear a night cap?  Yeah, I have hats.  I have to wear a hat.  Yeah. And when you go outside.  I don't wear a night cap.  I'm going to wear a night cap, dude.  And I think frankly now this is for the first time ever this pork pie hat looks good.  This was this was you know, this is the Breaking Bad look.  I need to grow goatee.  So now I decided I'm not going to shave either.  I'm just as long as I'm scritchy.  I'm going to let it all be.  I'm going to let it all grow out.  See, we'll have a race.  See what grows faster.

Transcript:  Anyway, props to those of you who do this every day because I did actually go down to the Boulevard Barbours and they are very good.  They knew exactly what to do.  The barber there, Sarah, used a straight razor on me.  Have you ever used a straight razor?  I've had it done.

Start time: 473.82
End time: 488.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've never used one myself.  I am terrified.  I wouldn't do it myself.  I have a very, very eloquent old gentleman that opens his barber shop like 3 o'clock in the morning and I go to him and he does it.  I'm scared when I'm sitting there, but it feels amazing.  It is the best kind of shave.  It was great.

Transcript:  At the end of the show, I'm going to give thanks because, boy, you know, we don't, I'm the one in front of the camera and of course we had lots of guests, but it's really the people behind the scenes who worked the hardest like John Salinino who worked 48 hours, not 24 hours, getting this thing ready, getting the ball drop going and everything.  So I'm going to, I have a list of a lot of people to thank.  We'll roll those credits at the end of the show.  I won't use up the time now.  You're not going to see ESO and JJ Stone?

Start time: 535.38
End time: 552.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I haven't gone to see ESO in like four years.  I really find it pointless.  They push so much stuff at you.  Half of it's crap.  And it never ships.  Yeah, that's what I mean.  So you go there and you're like, I need that in my life.  And it's like, oh, we're never going to make that.  We just brought it here and put it on the table for you to not touch and want.

Transcript:  I was saying on Twitter earlier today that I am totally qualified to talk about CES today on  Twitter because I'm available.  I'm not in Vegas.  That qualifies me.

Start time: 582.30
End time: 598.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Almost everybody who goes says it's great.  Almost everybody who's not going says, thank God I don't have to go.  Those of us who've been more than 10 times, and if you've been more than 10 times, then you have  the right to say, you know, I'm done.

Start time: 599.10
End time: 611.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what's great about things is other people are there with you.  It's not great that it's there.  It's great because a massive amount of people that you know in your industry are there and you can  pick and needle and choose and talk about a subject.  That's the awesome part of it.  Otherwise, it's pointless.

Start time: 612.66
End time: 655.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's totally true.  I would even throw in there.  It's not valueless.  There are lots of interesting things to see.  The problem is there's so much there that the interesting things are this tiny fraction and you've  got to get through a million people to get there.  And you know, it is not a pleasure to go to CES, I would say, for me.  I never liked it.  I don't really like going to Vegas.  Vegas, when it's completely at capacity with tech people, is kind of insane.  It's so hard to get around.  It's not as if there isn't interesting stuff there.  And in fact, some of the best stuff at CES is the weird stuff.  It's not the like press releases about things that are, you know, new TVs that are kind of boring.  It's the totally crazy stuff that you end up stumbling into and being like, why does this exist?  Why is this here?  And often there isn't a good answer to that.

Start time: 655.68
End time: 664.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I want to break it down a little bit because there are some categories.  There are categories you won't see at CES this year.  Some categories that have been big in the past.

Start time: 664.96
End time: 676.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The smartphone industry, the phone industry in general has gone to Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.  And so as a phone show, CES now is actually kind of terrible.  It's not for phones anymore like it used to be.  Right.

Start time: 677.04
End time: 680.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It used to be a lot of cars went to CES, less so this year, although...

Start time: 680.66
End time: 686.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They used to have a huge one of those conferences or convention center buildings was just full of cars and car stereos.

Start time: 686.80
End time: 709.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Although I have to say the one category that might be interesting, I would love to see more of,  we've seen it in past years, but I think this is going to be the big year is autonomous vehicles.  Look what Audi posted on their Instagram.  This is an A7 that's designed to be driverless.  And they say you're pilot to CES today.  And I'm wondering if they might even use that to pilot some journalists around CES.  Wouldn't surprise me.

Start time: 709.66
End time: 710.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wouldn't that be cool?

Start time: 710.78
End time: 726.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google is supposedly also going to have some stuff there.  I remember a couple of years ago, Chevrolet had some autonomous urban vehicles.  They were very small capsules that just had two seats.  But the Google car is done.  I have a feeling it'll be there.  It's sort of a small car too.

Start time: 727.76
End time: 737.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Nevada is essentially lawless, right?  Nevada actually autonomous vehicles, as I remember, are legal.  I know, it's one of the states where I think it is legal.  I think they do a lot of testing there.

Start time: 737.68
End time: 824.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So that's going to be kind of interesting.  There will be TVs there.  So we are going to send three reporters.  Robert Ballester, Father Robert will be there.  Dickey Bartolo, who always goes and does the junky stuff, the bottom floor Chinese pavilion.  That is the greatest.  He always looks for the weird and interesting stuff.  So he'll be doing that.  He also is doing showstoppers tonight.  They have, I'll explain that in a little bit.  And Scott Wilkinson, our home theater guy, is going to be there and talk to the TV things.  Now, in the past it's always been Sony, Panasonic, LG, Sharp and Samsung.  The Korean and Japanese companies.  LG is what I'm excited about.  Well, we'll talk about that in a second because there are some new stuff like Tuanum.technology and 4K that those companies are bringing out.  But I'm also hoping he'll go over, and I know he will.  We're going to send him to TCL and Hisense.  The Chinese companies, just as the Korean companies took over from the Japanese companies,  when Samsung and Lucky Gold Star said, you know what, we want the premier business, the profit business,  and took over and really have put great pain to the Japanese TV manufacturers.  They're all losing money on TVs in Japan.  In that same way, I think China is hoping to supplant Korea.  And Hisense and TCL, both are Chinese companies, and both are doing some really interesting stuff.  So we're going to get Scott to...  So we will have coverage.  We just won't have the big booth.  But you know, Mobile Nations, Renee Richie's company is doing a big booth with GeekBeat TV and Tom's Hardware.  They're actually taking our old location in the South Hall.

Transcript:  Yeah, I was talking to Serenity Caldwell.  Serenity be down for that.  She's going to be on their area.  So they'll do that.

Start time: 830.76
End time: 874.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It cost us hundreds of thousand dollars.  And I didn't feel like...  I felt like you actually can get a better look at CES by staying at home and letting everybody feed you the stuff.  The Internet makes CES frankly not that useful if what you're going to do is find out the new stuff.  If what you're going to do is to hang out with Owen and Jason, that's different.  Live the dream. It's different.  Yeah.  If it's a party, it's not...  You know, expense accounts aren't what they used to be.  I remember going with Gina Smith on the Ziff Davis expense account.  That was living.  Sweet.  You could...  Didn't matter what you bought.  As long as it was for a client, it was okay.  Okay. So autonomous vehicles.  We're expecting some interesting TV stuff like Quantum Dot.

Start time: 875.08
End time: 901.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The story of TV is at CES in the last five or ten years.  I mean, it really has been what do we do now that HD...  The HD conversion has happened because that was the big thing was HD conversion.  We're going to do that.  And now it's sort of the quest for what else can we do to sell TVs because everybody just bought a TV.  So what do we do?  And so...  3D. They tried 3D. Flop.  Kind of a flop.  They done the curved screen thing.  There's some OLED stuff that is early but is kind of interesting.  I have an OLED.  That is to replace the plasmas because they don't make plasmas anymore.

Start time: 901.76
End time: 911.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I got the very expensive Samsung curved OLED a year ago, more than a year ago.  And it's still my best TV. I love it.  But it's only $55. It's not giant.  It was very expensive.

Start time: 911.68
End time: 916.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Sina just did an OLED TV review and said that it was the best picture they'd seen that wasn't a plasma.  It is.

Start time: 917.94
End time: 955.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I have the old Vieras, which were the great Panasonic plasmas, and they've discontinued those.  Now, some are saying...  So what's out there really right now is OLED and LCD, and OLED is prohibitively expensive still.  It's coming down, but it's... yeah.  LCD is kind of the technology that they're really pushing.  They're pushing 4K.  And then there's quantum dot.  Now, I'm going to read you...  This is what Wikipedia says quantum dot is.  It's a nanocrystal made of semiconductor material, small enough to exhibit quantum mechanical properties.  Its excitons are confined in all three spatial dimensions.  I wish my excitons were confined.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the Marvel Universe of television.  Like, you just start coming in and telling me about quantum phasons and protons.  I don't care about... the only TV that I even care about, which I don't know why I do because I hate Sony TVs anymore,  but I want a Sony TV because now I can put my PlayStation on my Sony without having to...  Well, good news.  ...playstation in the room with the PlayStation.

Start time: 979.78
End time: 983.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sony made the first quantum dot TVs, the XPR in 2013.

Start time: 985.27
End time: 1008.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because that's why I don't buy Sony anymore.  Sony's always first with this, oh, this space-edge magical martial arts ninja turtle thing.  And guess what?  The quality of the image that you put to the TV is the same quality of the image you put to TV.  So unless I got quantum physics DVDs or Blu-rays, what's the difference going to be for this television?  What's it going to do for me with my crappy Verizon Fios cable that's pushing out 720p on 80% of the channels?  I can't take it.

Start time: 1008.72
End time: 1017.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the problem with the 4K stuff. It's the same thing.  It's like, yeah, it's a 4K TV. What can I put on it?  Nothing.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Nothing.

Start time: 1017.74
End time: 1038.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So the upshot of quantum dots, according to Scott Wilkinson, is blacker blacks, better contrast ratios, more even lighting.  But the truth, the proof will be in the pudding when we see the quantum dot TVs this year, and he'll have the reviews of that.  We also expect more OLEDs and lower priced OLEDs.  But that's it. I think those are the two technologies that are survivors.

Start time: 1039.66
End time: 1049.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the way the quantum dot technology works is that every show that's possibly on your screen is on your screen in a parallel universe.  And then one of them is the one you see.

Start time: 1049.80
End time: 1056.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's good. I'll take that.  It's all parallel universe now.  It does sound, you're right, Owen, a little bit like a marketing term.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're trying so hard to find a way to get everybody bought an HDTV in the last 10 years, and those don't turn over.  TVs don't turn over very fast. And all those companies are like, God, what do we do now to sell new TVs?  And they still haven't really figured it out.

Start time: 1070.34
End time: 1101.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The best thing they could do to sell new TVs is say, hey, we sold you a crappy TV last year. Trade it in with us.  We'll give you this new TV for three quarters of the price.  Wouldn't that be nice?  That's something that even makes me think.  I'm like, I have three 55 inch TVs in my house. My daughter's got a 47 inch in her room.  What do you have to do to get me to take it out of her room?  You've got to have you got to take this TV from me because I'm not going to sell it to my friends for $200 after I spent $1,215 on it.  Like, what do you do with all these TVs? You keep them because they're still good.  So buyback program people. That's how you get me to buy a new TV.

Transcript:  We'll wait with interest to see what those look like.  Autonomous vehicles. Wearables probably will be big.  They were big last year, but they were all horrible.  Maybe now we're in the second or third generation of wearables.  I think Android wear has come a long way.  But just like previous CES is Apple's not there except in spirit.  In 2010 at CES, all they could talk about was the iPad.  In 2007 at CES, all they could talk about was the iPhone.  This year, it's going to be iWatch, Apple Watch.  What is it? What is Apple going to do?  We're going to do everything that we can think of on the shelf.  And we just hope that, you know, is is I feel like Android wear is pretty close.  There will not be a new pebble this year at CES, I'm told.  They may be. I'm wondering if they're kind of kind of sliding behind a little bit.

The Dish folks, Echo Star, has already announced that  just as they introduced Hopper,  which kind of revolutionized DVRs a couple of years ago  with a giant inflatable kangaroo,  they plan to do something called Sage,  which is a home automation hub  along with your DVR and set-top box.  So they own Slingbox,  they have Dish,  and they're going to use this Sage platform,  I presume Hopper as well,  to do home automation.  I think home automation...  I'm sending Father Robert  over to the home automation pavilion this year  because I have a feeling that in years past  it's been disappointing because you have all these  different standards, nothing to talk to anything else.  Samsung's going to introduce appliances  that talk to its smart things hub  this year so you can tell your dishwasher,  hey, wash those dishes,  I'm on my way home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The biggest thing they did is you would embed their code  in your app.  You go to a website and there's a little thing in the code  that pings Google Analytics  and you can know how many Patreons you got.  This was that for apps.  Flurry would be integrated into an app  and basically when you launch it  and people don't know this necessarily  it would phone home.  It would ping their server and say  I just got launched or I just tapped this button  or last time I launched I crashed.  So the developers can see  who's using your app, how often they're using it.  All the stuff that  the app platform itself  doesn't or didn't offer you.  Flurry has now more than  600,000 apps doing the analytics.

Transcript:  Presumably they've normalized for  the Android versus iOS balance.  But according to Flurry  the top five device activations  by manufacturer and this I think  is global.  51% of all device  activations  December 19th through Christmas day  51% were Apple.  iPads and iPhones.  Only 17.7% Samsung.  The real surprise here is Sony and LG  but Nokia which is a Windows phone  platform, 5.8%.  They're in there. They're number three.  They're not  huge but that's still pretty good.

Transcript:  Last year it was the issue of  for example my friend who's not really a tech  person. The father had an  iPad but he bought the whole family  Kindle Fires. The wife  and his three kids he bought on a fire  HD. This Christmas  he went out and bought the wife and all three of those  kids iPads and didn't even do anything  with the Kindle Fires. He just kept them.  And I'm like so he's like I made a big mistake.  He's like they were only $100.  I thought that it wouldn't matter but it matters.  And I had to go and get the things for the apps  for the kids. So people  realized like oh I can get these cheap  Nokia, Windows, whatever  because some people can't afford $400  for an iPad. And then a year later  they're going to be like holy smokes I need  I've met somebody with an iPad and I can't. This is not  the life I want to lead. How much of that though

So Flurry does say that the  reason you pay attention to the Christmas  buying week is in the Christmas  present opening week in Hanukkah this year  present opening week is because that's a bell  weather for the rest of the year. Interesting.  You can kind of tell what's going to happen. Here's  an interesting graph that's a little hard to read.  This is by  screen size.  So I'll  describe this for you looking at home and I'll  try to get this kind of describe this in some way that  people listening can understand it.  It shows three years 2012, 2013  and 2014. In 2012  16% of the devices  that were activated  were full sized tablets.  This year 11%.  Small tablets had  17% of the market  in 2012. This year 11%.  Fablitz, the giant  phones went from 3% to 13%.  Medium  phones, I guess that would be 5 inch  phones. 58%  to 64% and then  the small phones which were 7% of the market  of the new activations in 2012.  Probably iPhone, let's see, 2012  would be iPhone 4S.  Is that right?  Or no 5.  down to 2%  this year. So I think the takeaway  here is that the growth area  is in this big phone.

Start time: 2534.88
End time: 2552.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well I think it's  you're looking at percentage of distribution.  So I think what we know  about the tablet market is  it's roughly flat.  So it's not actually going from 16  and 17 to 11 and 11. But that's  how much more  the phone market is growing than the tablet market.

But on the  phone side, phone sales just continue  to grow. That trajectory just hasn't stopped.  And we see now that phablet sales  seem to be way up. And that  medium phone sales  just keep motoring along.

Transcript:  Also again, what I'm talking about, people  don't have money. So a lot of my friends  bought the 6 Plus because they  couldn't, they were like, oh I always wanted a  tablet or iPad but I couldn't justify  spending $500 on it. But you go and get  a 128 Plus 6.  Now you feel like you got yourself an iPad too.  And it's your phone. So it's like an all in  one purchase that cuts down  on a lot of overlap for regular

Transcript:  consumers. Yeah, we heard,  I was talking to somebody at Apple when the  new phones were announced.  Who said very much the same thing.  That what they found is there are  lots of markets where the people  who buy the big phone, it's their only  mobile device and in some cases it's their only  computing device.  They don't even have, in some places  in this world, they don't have a computer.  They don't have a tablet. They've got a phone.  If you've only got one device, make it a big one.  Right? And you  need it to be a phone. So there you go.  It's a big phone.

Transcript:  digitally. I think this is  going to be one of those roller coaster moves  because I remember distinctly reading  something about four weeks ago. One, Taylor Swift  dropped all of her stuff off of Spotify  and then her record was like the number one  breaking record, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, because people  couldn't get any more said to actually buy it.  Two, Pharrell got a  check for $3,000  for like 180 million plays  of Happy on Pandora.  Like, and I'm like, wait, what?  And he's like, yeah. So he pulled it off of Pandora  and I'm like, well, how does that work? If you're  not getting paid the money, like,  you know, and Spotify is quick to  say, well, we spend 95% of  our money paying royalties.  Well, if those royalties are coming out to $3,000  checks because you got hundreds of thousands of artists,  that doesn't mean anything to the artists when  they could have got somebody to buy it for 99  cents. He could have sold more Happys for 99  cents than the $3,000 check you got

Start time: 2724.66
End time: 2757.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  from Pandora. See, this is, I think, the greatest  threat to the music streaming services  is they're going to turn into Netflix. If  Taylor, and I'm not saying this will happen, but  it's the fear is that more artists,  A-list artists like Taylor Swift, are  not going to play ball with them.  And then we're going to get into the situation like there are not  new releases on Netflix. In fact,  there are not new home video releases on Netflix.  You have to wait for that after you get off  of everything they're selling and renting.  Everything goes on pay cable. It eventually comes  to Netflix. If that's what happens with the music  services where they've got the catalog,  but nothing from the last year is on there,  that would be a big problem.

Start time: 2758.66
End time: 2824.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think the music and the movies are very different.  So first of all, a couple of points. Pandora  is not the same as Spotify.  Pandora is a radio station. So I would  bet the Pandora royalties are a lot closer  to radio royalties in the sense  that it's a discovery medium. Now, the record  companies don't like this.  They've always said, oh, no, no, internet will  never be like radio. Radio  is where people discover music, which of course,  if that's their current plan,  they may want to rethink that.  So I think  Pandora is, because you don't control what you hear.  You say, I want a station, and you're going to get  what you get. So it's discovery, much like radio.  You didn't control what you hear, but you'd have a sound  style that you'd pick the country station or the  progressive station. Second,  I would point out that  music sales  are driven by the new stuff.  And if you don't get discovered,  that's what the album is going to tank. There's no  catalog if the album wasn't  popular when it came out.  So it's really, music  has a long tail in the way I think probably  movies don't. And  discovering and getting excited about an album  when it comes out is critical  to the long term success of that album, I would

Start time: 2824.80
End time: 2854.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  guess. I don't know. I think they're  a little more similar than that. I think  you know, but I  I'm not saying that they're right. That  the way that it works with Netflix is even right.  I mean, we can make the arguments that  movies should come out day in  day out on video on demand, like the interview did.  And that this is all  artificial. But I just, when I  when I see Taylor Swift  withholding her album and selling  well, it does make you wonder  if something's going to have  to give in the relationship between the artist and

Start time: 2854.84
End time: 2866.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  the streaming services. But that's a unique  situation where she has such a strong community  that they, and they're so  the demand is so high for whatever she puts out  that that works for her. It's not going to  work for a new artist at all. Oh, I

Start time: 2866.78
End time: 2868.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  agree about that. But again, people aren't going to want

Start time: 2868.70
End time: 2897.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  their music either because they're new artists. But  established artists that are going to demand  that market is a huge issue for that.  You know, when you say the new people, yeah, they want  to be on everything. They want to be on your mom's  radio station, anywhere they can possibly be, because  they're new. But established people, when they pull  their product off or when Jay-Z goes  and makes an exclusive deal with Samsung  and says, anybody who buys this phone  gets my album and sells five million albums  in one day because we bought the phone.  Like, there's a lot of moves for artists to do that  don't include a Spotify or Beats  royalty check.

Transcript:  you know what I'm saying? And I would like to see what her  contracts are. And  what her contract says about  Pandora versus YouTube. I think  there's, or Pharrell, I  think,  you know, I think the labels have something  to do with this as well. Sure, sure.  There's no doubt. I just, I  By the way, I just played Shake It Off. I don't see an ad.  Yeah. It started, oh, wait a minute.  I'm sorry. That's because I pay for  YouTube, for Google and Wal-Mart access.  So I don't get an ad, but I give her  eight bucks a month.  But that's the same I give, I mean  isn't that the same I'm paying to Spotify?  It's actually a little less. Right.  So I just, you know, I think  this is complicated. Bob Lefcic, who  is an industry analyst and an  observer and often, I think  very right on, says this, and  I wonder what you guys think.  The prediction for 2015,  the major labels  will only get stronger.  We live in a money  economy and the only ones willing to invest  in artists are the labels.  Furthermore, they've got the relationships  at radio, which are  key to developing acts. The players  want cash.  The major labels have it.  No one else will get involved because the returns  are so bad. The majors  have gotten a second win. They have  adapted to the internet. All the hogwash  about disruption was just that.  He says it may not be forever, but it's certainly for now.  You agree? Now this is  a guy, this is what he does for a living.  But he's also old school.  And I just think that, that may be  true if your model is the old model  of superstar artist producing  record, record,  LP, what do they call it now?

Transcript:  to the world.  So artist produces music,  sells it as an album  like Taylor did with 1989.  They hate single sales.  They want to sell the whole album.  And the  record labels somehow have marketing clout.  Radio play, I don't know how important that is.  But they somehow have marketing clout.  You've got to discover it somewhere. I wonder.  There's a different model. There's a model like a Jonathan Colton  or Pamplemousse where these are  artists, unsigned artists  who market using social media very  effectively. Actually by the way,  Taylor may be giving a record label more credit  than it deserves. She does the best marketing  I've ever seen on Instagram and Twitter and everywhere  else. Brilliant social marketing.

Transcript:  But the Jokos of the world are  not, you know, they're I think  a great little niche  group of artists. But  that's not the same as, I got a  13 year old daughter. How does she find  music? Well, some of it's Pandora.  Actually, I think Pandora  is important. But we have satellite  radio in the car and she will turn it to one of the hits,  the pop hit stations, the New York or  LA pop hit stations. And  so I think there is still some  radio, believe it or not. And then  the rest of it is. But it's a lot of Discovery.  And then she will go on  Spotify and listen to stuff  that she discovers. But Discovery is step  one. And I think that's where this prediction  about the labels is true, is to break  through the noise and reach a  13 year old or a 15 year old with a new  artist takes money because you've got to  find them who knows where.

And then they put up the,  whatever they put up, but they put up those songs  because they want to share them with their other, oh, that's good for your daughter,  that's good for your son. That's right.  So there's a lot of ways to discover, but the radio is  still huge. Yeah, I agree. Huge.  You know why? Because it's free. And if it's free, it's  for most people. My kids don't even have  a radio. But not everybody's balling out of control with  my, every car's got radio. Where are you listening to the radio?  Every car's got radio, Leo. Every car.

I'm an 80s on eight kind of guy.  I have to admit it. Lots of 80s music.  But my daughter's like, forget that. And she turns it  to the hits. She's listening to the hits. So radio  is still a thing. And YouTube, you're totally  right. YouTube is a thing. We talk  about Taylor Swift not putting her album on streaming.  I mean, not only did she put Shake It Off on  YouTube with a video, but Shake It Off  was on streaming. Because what is that? That's a teaser  for her album. That's the first single off the album.

Next thing you know, she's breaking all kinds of records, which  I know for a fact, she wouldn't have broken  because one, people want to rally behind her as  much as they did.

President Obama  and the FBI, I would  say somewhat prematurely announced  that it was North Korea.  And immediately, every security expert  in the world said, what?  How could you know so soon?  North Korea's security  is the most recent.  Norse-corp.com. They met with the FBI.  FBI...Norse said has been very  open to the idea  of talking to  other  security firms.  So, now, I don't...  You know, Norse...This is Norse talking.  They said, you know, we called them up and they said, yes, come in and  talk to us. Norse says  its research leads to laid off  Sony staff.  Not North Korea.  Last Monday, the FBI  took a three hour briefing with Norse.  Of course, we've heard  many security  experts, including  the guy at Cloudflare. It was Bruce  Schneier as well who said, I'm not so  sure it was North Korea.  Almost all of them  seem to think it's much more likely an  inside job. But here's  the problem, and we've said this before.  The government, the US  government says, we have information we can't share with you  because it would compromise our  spies, basically, our intelligence  operation to tell you that it's conclusive.  And we just...All we can say is,  well, okay, because  they won't tell us. Do you trust the

They have made major mistakes before  which I won't bring up because I sound like an conspiracy  theorist, but I'm just saying somebody told me there were weapons  somewhere and there wasn't no weapons there, so they tell me  it's North Korea. WMD, that was  secret intelligence. We know.  They want to go North Korea and mess with some people who kick  you the internet up for five minutes after calling Obama  a name. I don't know what's going on.  But I'm going to tell everybody right now, the person who did  this atrocity is Michael Mann.  Look him up, Google it, his name is Michael Mann.  If you don't know who Michael Mann is, Google  him, you're going to know who Michael Mann is. Michael Mann is  the Sony hacker. I know this for a fact.  Uncle Leo. You know why?  He's the creator of Miami Vice?  He's a director.  He is the director and the screenwriter  for Black Hat coming out this month.  Black Hat. Black Hat's coming out next month.  You people keep telling me,  oh, it's a thing to try to  bring people in the box.  No, nobody want to download that stupid movie to interview.  That movie ain't nothing. But you know what?

There is a scenario, because we do know that  Sony Pictures Entertainment was hacked  in the spring, in March, and decided  to ignore the hack and not  announce it, not tell anybody. It could  very well be that the initial attack got  in, then collected passwords  and server names,  walking around the network, and created a  crafted a targeted attack,  which then was launched later in September.  So it's completely, I mean, there's lots of  scenarios you can think up.  It's a question mark.  And I would love to know what  happened, but I don't think we'll ever know.  It doesn't seem sensible, and this is what  most, many people have said, that  if a government like North Korea  had this trove of information, that  they would just give it away. It seems  much more likely they would use it for propaganda  purposes over time, than  they would just say, here, here's a paste bin,  here's a torrent, have fun,  have at it. However,  job done,  they embarrassed Sony, but the movie got released.  Did you see it?

Transcript:  Here is John Graham Cummings'  Tumblr.  It's called Movie Code.  I think this is his, tumblr.com,  in which he talks about source code appearing.  And look, they already have the Black Hat  code. They say it's a  lot of variable declarations in C++,  mostly int and bool, can't find the source  yet.  So this is a great blog  where they  actually try to source this stuff.  Is this John Graham Cummings? I can't remember.  Digimon, Digital Monsters, episode 5.  Here's a little basic code.  Nice.  This is the HBO remake of  Westworld. The code is from  serial port testing software for Cellbot,  a tool for controlling robots via  cell phones.  It was probably a trap in the back door  I used to infiltrate the system.  I'll infiltrate the normal operations  again and determine the location of the train car.  It's Ruby.  It's all in Ruby.

Transcript:  This is a John  Graham Cummings Tumblr. It's moviecode.tumblr.com  nice job.  Hey, speaking of bugs, there was  a fairly significant, well, no, I should take  that back. There was a bug in Windows  8.1, a bug that would require someone  with physical access to your computer, but then he could  escalate. It was a privilege escalation  that bypassed UAC and allowed  somebody logged in as a standard user to  get administrative users. But again,  as Microsoft pointed out, you had to be at the  keyboard. Google discovered this three  months ago. They often are, they're probing for bugs  a lot and they find these. Told Microsoft  three months ago, Microsoft did not patch it.  So Google this week released it,  including sample code suitable  for somebody to take advantage of it.  Microsoft says,  okay, okay, we'll patch it.  This is kind of normal practice. Nobody's  upset about this, right? Or are you?  Should Google have kept it quiet  about this? Nope. It comes  a time when you have, if the company doesn't fix  it, bad guys are going to  get it. The public has a  right to know that there's a flaw.  Now, it does complicate things that Google and  Microsoft are kind of at

Start time: 4638.72
End time: 4650.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  odds with one another. So what's the benefit in Google  announcing this?  If there are, are there  steps that somebody can do as a user  to protect themselves from this? Or do they literally  just have to wait for Microsoft? The best step would be

Start time: 4650.84
End time: 4680.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  not let somebody sit down on your computer.  Yeah, that might be step one.  Microsoft says, we're working to release a security update  to address an elevation of privilege issue.  It's important to note that for a would-be attacker  to potentially exploit the system, they'd  first need a valid logon credential,  be able to log on locally to a targeted  machine. Of course, if you're logged in and they get to your  machine while you're still logged in, that  would count. We encourage customers to keep  their antivirus software up to date,  install all available security updates,  and enable the firewall, which, by the way,  none of those have anything to do with this hack.

Start time: 4680.66

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. So Google  then said that they  notified Microsoft at the end of September  about it. So this is partially  Google sort of shaming Microsoft

Transcript:  into action. I think you could make a case that it's  good for Google, which makes its own operating  system, which is not vulnerable to this  Chrome OS, to say,  you know, look, Microsoft, you've got a flaw. But on  the other hand, security researchers have always done this.  And a 90-day  clock is not unusual. Right. I mean, that

Start time: 4706.76
End time: 4713.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Where 99% of the people have died.  The technology is gone. And then these  musicians and actors  are performing Shakespeare and music.

You can add those books to  your wish list. This is another one I've got to get.  The Complete Sherlock Holmes  narrated by one of my favorite  Audible readers, Simon Vance.  He's got the perfect British accent.  He's a wonderful reader. Whoops. How did that happen?  Let me go back to Audible here.

If you like showbiz, if you like fiction,  if you like non-fiction, great science fiction.  A lot of non-fiction too.  Really great stuff.  I'm a big fan.  I try to...I do an alternate.

They brought down the Sony network and  the Sony network and  the Sony network and  the Sony network and  the Sony network and  they brought down  Xbox.  Xbox Live.  Brian Krebs,  one of our favorite security guys,  identified him  and now for 40 days  he's been bombarded  by DDoS'd  Brian Krebs' site.  Just jerks.  They just say they're jerky jerk jerks.  They ruined Christmas  for people not just in the US but all over the world  by DDoSing. And by the way,  it's a trivial thing to do.  You don't have to have skit mad skills.  They're just jerky jerks.  And then they said, oh, just go out  and get some fresh air.  What are you, mom? You're a jerky jerk  and you're talking like your mom.  So Brian Krebs  identified two members  a 22 year old British man called Vinny Omari  who immediately got arrested.  Yeah, enjoy that time.  In prison, you know what prisoners do  to hackers?

Isn't this the only way  that there will be a cool off  is if people, I mean I remember when I  was a kid and I had a computer and people were like  doing phone freaking and stuff like that where they're  like stealing,  there was always that question of like,  oh will we get in trouble? Will we get arrested?  They're like, nah, nah, it's not going to matter.  They'll never catch us, who cares?  I think there is at least a little bit of a chilling  effect.

Start time: 5880.66
End time: 5978.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can tell you the solution, and it's so easy  that this is embarrassing.  It is. If Internet service  providers were willing  to do what it takes, this would go  away. The only way you can  launch a DDoS attack,  and there's some really good,  by the way, and I don't know if they're using this,  amplification attacks that use known flaws and things  like the network time protocol.  So one guy with a small, you don't have  to have huge pipes anymore  to do a DDoS attack.  You can take advantage of these amplification attacks.  Even if you're on a dial-up, you could bring  down massive sites. A DDoS  attack works by sending  a packet, a SYN packet, to  a website. There are other ways to do it,  but the basic idea is  websites can't ignore SYN packets. That's the  knock on the door saying, hey, I want to look  at your site. They come back with a SYN  ACK. If you're trying to DDoS a site,  you flood them with SYNs and you don't care about the  ACK. And the site is so busy handling  all these incoming knocks that  it doesn't have time for any normal users.  So you bring the site down by flooding  its bandwidth with malformed  packets. The identifying  IP addresses in these packets are rotated.  They're bogus. They're spoofed. Obviously,  you wouldn't want it to be your IP  address. That'd make it really easy to catch you.  In fact, very easy to block. So you have a different  IP address for every SYN. But  the way we stop this is whoever the ISP  is for the person launching the  attack, all they have to do is they see  all the outbound traffic and say, well,  is that an IP address from our network? It's not.  And just stop it. And there would be no  DDoSing. This is from  Steve Gibson, our security guy.  It's that simple. We need to fix that.  ISPs are acting  irresponsibly by allowing

They charge you triple the price of their own internet.  Why would someone do this?  The nickel and diamond of certain companies  is just so idiotic over the broad span  of the money that they would save with good will.  Because now other hotels are coming out saying,  oh, we've got free internet. We've doubled  the speed. Come stay with us.

That they  filed this petition because they have  a lot of people doing fake base stations  that are matched up to their conference rooms and things like that.  They've got a whole story about it. But the problem is  what they're trying to do is erode this very fundamental  idea that this spectrum is for  public use and that anybody can use it.  And that it's illegal to jam it or block it in any way.  And they say, no, no, no, no,  you, of course, will be able to use  your Wi-Fi hotspot in your own room.  But once  they have the right to  block it, they could block it anywhere.  And it's just a terrible idea.

Transcript:  It's supposed to be, yeah, exactly.  So the other thing the FCC is going to do,  they say soon, is rule on  this Title II regulation,  the net neutrality regulation.  In a letter to the FCC,  Google's Director of Communications Law,  Austin Schlick,  said there could be a good thing if we go  with Title II because  that gives Google Fiber access to utility  poles and other essential infrastructure  owned by utilities.  Right now, the way that these companies  can preserve their monopolies, say, hey,  and you can't use our infrastructure.  But if they're Title II, the FCC can  say, no, you've got to open that up.  That's a good thing because what  is the best way to protect net neutrality? Competition.  We all agree.  Nobody disagrees that the best way to do this  would be to have some competition.

Transcript:  I'm not going to buy Google, at least not in the foreseeable future.  So on my site, Six Colors,  a couple of months ago, Glenn Fleischman wrote this  piece that was about the same issue.  And he was saying the tech giants really ought to  get in this game. Google has got the right idea here.  And that other tech giants like Apple  should also try to  invest in broadband only because  the more competition there is and the more  you don't have the cable companies as gatekeepers,  the safer it's going to be  for people to build their businesses on the internet.  I'm rooting for Google Fiber.  And I'm not, in some areas, not a  big fan of Google, but I am absolutely  rooting for Google Fiber because there need to  be more options for broadband internet  in the United States.

Start time: 6248.66
End time: 6279.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The other thing is that  Obama proposed Title II.  FCC is certainly considering  declaring that broadband providers  are common carriers.  But we have not heard anything from Microsoft  and Apple and Google to Facebook.  These guys really should be stepping up.  This is the first indication in any way  that Google supports this.  It's good news too.  I think the FCC has been waiting to hear  from these guys. And in fact, there have been  some have accused the big companies of secretly  fighting Title II with  lobbyists.

Start time: 6280.66
End time: 6321.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the mafia, dude.  The reason some of these companies don't get into  that space is because the old  factory machine is  kicking in alive. They're new. So to jump  into bed with that, Google's got to  put their foot in the water and show that they're not going to  jump out. And then other people might try  and get in on it because everybody's got  TV in their house. You know what I mean? So something  like Apple coming in and being a direct  pipeline in your home will be something they'd love to do.  But it's not something they're going to step out  and branch out to do like what  Google might because, you know,  they want to try everything. You know, they make  stupid networks. They make all kinds of crazy  stuff to flop and they don't care. So  if anybody's going to try and do something different,  Google's the one to lead the way. And I'm  happy for it.

A little known legal venue  designed to take on, take new  powers over the digital realm. It's called the ITC,  the International Trade  Commission. It's been around for a while.  It's the company that kind of prevents,  you know, the fake Gucci bags from coming  in to the United States.  But the ITC, and I don't know  if many people know this, recently gave itself the  power to examine data  as it comes in.  Not merely handbags,  but data.  This goes back to a 3D printing case.  If  the decision holds and  the courts don't overturn  this, it means that  data could now be stopped like the  Pirate Bay at the border.  Fascinating.  We'll watch this case with great interest.  There are a number of Supreme Court cases that are coming up  this spring that are going to be very interesting  for the internet. Google did release  its top search terms.
