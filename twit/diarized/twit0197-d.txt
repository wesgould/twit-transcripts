Some of my favorite people together, and I think together for the first time on on Twitter.  First, Don Tapscott is here.  He's never been on Twitter before, but we had John Ned at night.  And one of my heroes, to be honest, Don is an analyst of the future.  His books, Growing Up Digital and Grown Up Digital, really talk about how the world is changing for our young people.  Wikonomics was a huge success and and really kind of presaged a world where everybody kind of participates in in content.  And we're glad to have you on Twitter. Welcome.  Delighted. Nice to have you.  Delighted to be here.  Also here another. This is Author Day on on Twitter.  Also with us and another guy I've been trying to get on for ages and ages and ages.  And that is Don Jeff Jarvis, the author of What Would Google Do?  And from Buzz Machine and a longtime media old like me, an old media guy who's found his way in a new media very successfully.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm delighted to be on with the nicest man on the whole Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Charles Osgood of the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's my contrast is usually greater when you have Dvorak on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But yeah, I try to get cranky people on to make the difference.  Would you like to take that role, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll let Don do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, everybody here is nice.  You know, it's fun. Yeah, Canadians are Canadians.  The kind of people you bump into them on the street and they apologize.  So an old joke I apologize for.  Also here with Jeff, Jeff's son, Jake, who is a junior in high school, but also a Facebook developer.  And I brought him on because it's the first time we've ever had a father son team on the show.  But but also because he I want to talk a little bit about Google Wave and what from the developer point of view.  And so here's a here's a kid who's also doing a lot of what Don Tapscott's been talking about.  Really very much part of the new digital generation and the queen of the digital generation is also here.  We love Regina Trapani, the life hacker.  Hello. Also a book author.  Her book Life Hacker, 88 Tricks to Turbo Charge Your Day.  And now it's SmarterWear.org.  Yep. And so it's great to have all of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thanks for having me. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Love having you on, Gina. You're always you're the you know, I just realized you're the only one who's been on Twitter before.  So you're going to have to tell these guys how to how to run the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  OK, excellent. Very excited.  I actually I ditched out on San Diego Bar Camp today to come be on Twitter.  It was a really good conference, actually. Oh, I'm so sorry.  No, no, it was it was fine. It was a great it was a really great weekend.  It was starting to wind down. But I took off after lunch and I had to give a shout out because it was a really cool conference.  So San Diego Bar Camp. Yay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, I was talking with Don before we began about how everything is changing.  And Bar Camp is an example of how conferences are changing.  Totally. They're not these hierarchical.  I'll sit stand on the stage and talk. You listen events.  They're they're communal events now. Yeah. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. And Bar Camp is actually a totally DIY conference.  I mean, I was literally with the organizers at Costco on Friday, you know,  like buying like 16 million cases of Coke and Mountain Dew and Monster Drink.  And, you know, the attendees all speak.  So I talked and pretty much everyone talked and it was a really good time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Personally, as someone who's on the rubber chicken circuit getting big speakers fees, I oppose this whole

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  thing. Well, you know, everyone gets in for free.  Everyone speaks for free. But it's a really cool place to like, you know, try out a talk for the first time or just kind of,  you know, just, you know, get goofy.  They don't they don't ask for talks on, you know, technology necessarily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There are all sorts of talks. So I learned I learned from the feet of Dave Weiner,  who yelled at me once when I was on a panel at BloggerCon and he said, damn it,  Jarvis, there is no panel. The room is the panel.  He was right, as Dave usually is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it just a bunch of old hippies now who finally, after 40 years, we finally got to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I just did a review of a book. It's actually online today at the Globe and Mail.  It's a book called Lost in Siberia.  And this guy in London makes this argument that everything that's happening today is the result of Norman Weiner's  original creation of cybernetic.  Norbert Weiner, yeah.  And I think that's that's accurate.  But the point that he made was that the people who came in behind cybernetics were none other than Stuart Brand and the Whole Earth Catalog.  And he describes these weird little scenes where Douglas Engelbart's showing the most for the first time.  And Stuart Brand is actually running the camera.  You're kidding. I didn't know that.  And then but he basically makes the point that it's all these hippies and antiwar protesters from the 60s that went on to sort of create  Silicon Valley and that what we have today is through all these camps and so on is an extension of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, when you say Dave Weiner, he seems the quintessential Berkeley hippie to me.  I mean, I don't know if he is, but he just seems that that's that spirit, that style.  And that's what bar camp. It couldn't be a more hippie event.  And I'm proud to say I'm a hippie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't. Yeah. Well, I was, of course.  Were you? Oh, yeah. I was against the war big time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff, for you, you were obviously you still are.  Yeah, I was. I was. You still are a hippie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm a hairsprayer or shorter now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff, you and I have seen a big transformation in media, though.  I mean, we've seen an amazing shift from old media to new media.  Are you excited by it or is it a little scary?  I mean, a lot of old media types hate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's they do when they hate me as a result.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, your turncoat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a second childhood for me.  You know, here with my white beard and white hair, I've I've learned the new ways of a whole new way.  And I think it's a way to expand media and journalism in incredible ways.  I got out of a big company.  I now teach at the City University of New York Graduate School of Journalism  because I wanted to be involved with young people who were going to reinvent news.  I teach a course in entrepreneurial journalism so that they can even start companies to reinvent it.  And that's where the innovation is going to come from.  I kind of learned the hard way.  It's not going to come from the big old guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, that kind of leads us to a story one of the week,  which was the old guys getting together, colluding, trying to get you to pay for content.  What happened, Jeff? What was going on?  There's a lot of talk about it on Twitter.  Jay Rosen and you were going back and forth.  What was the event?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There was a meeting brought together by the Newspaper Association of America.  And it probably would have been less suspicious if we'd known about it ahead.  But they got together in a cruddy motel in Chicago area.  That's all they can afford now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like the Sopranos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they were met by a couple of companies that are trying to start ways to pay for content.  And, you know, I'm not against paying if you can do it.  But I've argued that by trying to pay, you put your content behind a wall,  you lose Google juice, you're out of the conversation.  But these guys are trying to preserve the little they know of the old world and the new world.  And they don't understand the link economy.  So I think we're going to see a lot of papers that are going to try to charge.  I know entrepreneurs who said, good, please do that because it'll kill you sooner and we can come in afterwards.  This young guy, James Kotecki, who did all kinds of wonderful things during the campaign,  made a video saying, please charge and then you'll all be gone.  And I'm afraid it's going to hasten their deaths.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They just don't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, and I think the other problem is there's an antitrust issue.  You know, I went and looked up the data on the information on the FTC site about what does it mean to be anticompetitive?  And the very definition of it is to get it together in a motel in Chicago.  Right. What a better place to do it.  So they're all going to raise prices and I'm afraid they're all going to get sued.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  And what's interesting is how it came out and how public it became.  And this is an example of where Twitter really exposed this very quickly and got a conversation going.  I'm not fond of the conversation on Twitter.  It's kind of a limited sister situation, but at least it was there and it was happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  James Warren, who used to be an editor of the Chicago Tribune, got the entire agenda and he put it up on a blog beforehand.  And then it spread on Twitter like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like wildfire. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, what this whole thing reminds me of, this monetization of content.  I just got asked to speak at a conference on this topic.  And it's sort of like trying to create a movie by filming the stage play, basically, that, you know,  that these people are trying to take their old model and just run it on a new platform and get people to pay for it.  When really, you know, Gannett should have invented the Huffington Post and NBC should have invented YouTube and AT&T  should have invented Twitter and Yellow Pages should have invented Craigslist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It strikes me that's a very difficult thing to do because your business model is based around dead trees or whatever.  And it's very hard to change a business model in the middle.  Gina, you were going to say something? I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I was just going to agree.  I mean, I think that Clay Shirky's piece on this was so good and that it shouldn't be about preserving a business model.  It should be about preserving journalism. Right.  And like, how's that going to happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Fight for journalism, not for newspapers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Exactly. Exactly.  I mean, you know, of course, I feel bad for people who are going to lose their jobs and all those things.  But I mean, I don't know.  It's kind of the laws of evolution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are they going to lose their jobs?  I mean, does it mean they're out of business?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, a lot are. But I've met with some people last week, like Debbie Gallant, who runs BaristaNet in New Jersey.  And there's 40 people from the Star Ledger who are now starting their own blog.  I'm running a project in new business models for news.  I think that hyper local bloggers and interest bloggers can make a living at it.  Gina has, TechCrunch has in the tech area.  But I think it'll happen in our towns as well.  They're going to be independent agents not working for a big company.  And that's hard. But I do think that there's a market demand for journalism and the market will will meet it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do they do that by charging for content like the newspapers?  No, no. News ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they're doing ads.  Better at selling ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you know, I think it's important to remember that starting a small company, you know, a small company  like Gawker and paying bloggers like me to write Lifehacker and Gizmodo and even TechCrunch is a small company.  I mean, things aren't so easy there either.  I mean, advertising, you know, it's a struggle there, too, but we don't have the infrastructure that newspapers do.  So, you know, I don't know.  Gawker just had this thing happen this week where they started selling, you know, they basically sponsored a separate blog and was  putting posts on Gawker blogs that looked like ads but weren't marked as such.  I mean, so, you know, there's there's much like experimentation going on and lots of pushing the envelope.  But things aren't exactly easy.  I mean, the answer isn't like, oh, just these little companies spring up and there should be bloggers and the advertising will  pay. I mean, there are a lot of challenges there, too.  I think it's important to remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you're right, Gina, that the cost structure, having 300 people in a newsroom, a lot of people who just put out the paper or  another movie critic or another golf columnist, you have to the link economy of the Internet demands that you specialize and  that you do something really well to do the same stuff everybody else does.  There's no value in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Agreed.  Yeah, like the one funding model that's of interest to preserve the New York Times in its existing form is, of course, it  did become an NGO, a non-governmental organization.  Yeah, like a foundation.  And these exist.  You know, there are foundations that's a nonprofit basically.  Yeah.  And I think it was Geffen who was trying to do you know, he was going to try to buy it was there was a couple hundred million.  And the idea was not as a, you know, a national investment.  But here's a guy, I mean, steeped in the whole business world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He may not be the right guy to do this, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But Don, there was this great quote in the Times about a year ago, a young woman in college age, a little older than Jake, who  said, if the news is that important, it will find me.  Right.  Yeah.  And I'm sure you found in your research that people just don't have the same magnetic interaction with media that they have to go to  the site anymore.  Now they expect the site to come to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They want it pushed, not pulled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I had an amazing experience on this.  I was chairing a panel of young people.  It was a big crowd.  There was like, I don't know, six thousand people in the audience.  And I was sort of talking the kids with these stereotypes about their generation.  So I said to this one youngster, by the way, her name is Rahaf Harfoush.  I know Rahaf.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And she has a book that comes out tomorrow.  Oh, great.  And the book launches in Toronto this week.  I wrote the forward to the book, but she was like 20 years old.  She was born in Syria.  She was in Paris studying.  Her boyfriend's in Toronto, so they turn on Skype all day long to keep their relationship going.  So and I put a tour about the media.  I said, aren't you the dumbest generation?  You're ignorant.  You don't read the newspaper.  You don't watch the TV news.  You get your news from Jon Stewart in The Daily Show on Comedy Central.  And she says back to me, she says, I don't think that's a fair stereotype of my generation.  I think we're informed.  She says, it's true.  I don't read the newspaper.  She says, but have you ever seen one of those things?  They come out like once a day and they don't have hot links.  How slow can you get?  They're not multimedia and you get this weird black stuff all over your fingers.  Have you ever tried one of those?  And then she makes this point about the news comes to me and she describes she's got 60  RSS feeds and she says, I like to triangulate the news to form my own opinions.  She says, and it's true.  I watched The Daily Show, but not to get the news.  She says The Daily Show isn't funny unless you know that you have to know what a head  time.  Yeah.  So, but here's a generation that's interacting with media totally differently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I can never beat Jake to a story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was going to ask Jake, Jake, you're the, you're our example, our exemplar of the new  generation.  How do you, how do you get your news?  Do you, first of all, do you care about the news?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And if I figure if something big happens and I'll hear about it on Twitter first or  Facebook or through a friend, I'll always go to a new site or newspaper for more  information.  But the big news always comes to me first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm a friend feed fanatic and it's an aggregator of all of that stuff.  And it's real time.  It's scrolling up on the screen and it is more efficient, but it's not in depth.  So you do have to then pursue the links down.  And this is the question is, well, who's going to do the in-depth reporting?  Who's going to, who's going to create the content that all these, you know, quick  feeds lead to?  Aren't we losing kind of the base, the source of all of this stuff?  If we, if we say, oh, who needs newspapers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Leo, I think we'll have, the problem is we assume that you're going to have  kind of a single new product replacing the single old product.  We're not, we're going to have an ecosystem of news with many players.  They'll be hyper-level bloggers and interest bloggers like Gina, and they'll be, I  believe, some level of publicly supported journalism, not necessarily taking over  the whole New York Times, which I think can still be a business, but things like  the Huffington Post investigative unit and ProPublica and Spot.us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does the Huffington Post have an investigative unit?  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Really?  They just got one point three million dollars and they've hired, they hired away  the editor in charge of investigations at the Washington Post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's very encouraging in that case.  I mean, that's extreme.  That's extraordinarily encouraging.  You've seen the site All Voices.  This was an interesting idea.  It was kind of an open media site encouraging people all around the world to contribute to it.  I really liked the idea behind it, but they've had some struggles.  I mean, not all the content has been great on here.  We need some editorial control, don't we?  Or is that that old school too?  Is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it is old school.  You know, Wikipedia doesn't have editorial control.  There's nobody in charge.  And, you know, these, there is wisdom in the crowd.  If you set the context right, the crowd can be really stupid if you don't have the right  context as well.  But, you know, I wonder about something like the Huff.  Like this is, this has got a lot of traction now.  And when I write something on the Huffington Post, I typically get a better reaction than  I do if I write the New York Times.  A smarter reaction and more active.  No, no, just a bigger reaction.  Bigger.  And it's a lot savvier, too, actually, if you think about it.  And it's valuable for me to do that.  I wonder if they could start charging people like me, charging the writers.  Don't say that.  Build her own brand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't stop Don before he kills again.  So, Jake, do you then...  OK, so you're following Twitter.  You're seeing the headlines.  You click through the links and read the stories in depth.  I mean, you spend as much time reading as if you were reading a newspaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think so. I've never really read a newspaper much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. The thing is, I can choose what I'm interested in and read into that as much as I want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How about this issue, Jake, that people say that you're only going to pursue things  that are consistent with your point of view and you're not going to get serendipitous  other points of view? What do you say about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's hard to avoid things that you don't agree with online.  I mean, you're always going to run into things that don't go with your views.  And I don't know. I find that interesting.  I don't know if anyone else...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to confess, though, that I look on friend feed and I'll block people who are really  virulently right wing because I'm virulently left wing.  And I do. It does concern me.  Is it important to train people to seek out other opinions?  What do we have to teach people like Jake as they grow up in this environment where we  don't have these other...  There isn't any serendipity. Or is there?  Maybe there is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think Jake makes a good point, actually, that, I mean, like, how do you stay away  from Fox News?  I mean, it's everywhere.  Yeah.  And I was in Wyoming last week and I met someone who said her parents just turn it on in the  morning and they watch it all day long.  And it might explain why we have some problems in the world.  But, you know, they're going to they're going to bump into it.  On the other hand, I think that's that it's a good point that we need to like this is  the first time in history when young people are in authority about something really  important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We got an 18 year old or 17 year old on the show.  Yeah.  You know, I mean, my daughter was just on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was an authority on model trains when I was 11.  I was collecting stamps.  Today, the 11 year old at the breakfast table is an authority on this thing that's changing  every institution.  But but but just because they're an authority on something doesn't mean they're an  authority on everything.  And there's certain things that I think that that it makes sense that we would sort of  build training programs or certain educational programs into our schools, like just  something like privacy.  That worries me a lot.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don, I think that the media literacy isn't just about consuming media now, it's also  about creating media and what happens when you do.  Yeah, that's a great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, in fact, you can't you know, if you're Facebook's a really good example, you  don't just get to sit and passively consume Facebook.  If you don't contribute to it, you've got nothing.  Modern media like Twitter, Facebook and so forth requires participation as much as  as consumption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love the only way you connect to people.  Yeah, I love that.  You can't connect unless you reveal something of yourself.  And that scares people my age with the young people.  But that's how they interact.  And I think it actually will be healthy because they'll be connected with friends for  the rest of their lives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I see a lot of parents who say, I'm going to keep my kids off of these social  networks because of this fear of privacy.  And at the same time, I think it's really this is, you know, my wife didn't want my  son to be on my space.  He's 14.  I said, well, what were you doing?  Are you 14?  Were you on the phone all the time?  She said, yeah.  So this is his phone.  This is this is how he communicates with his peers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just sit down with a kid and work through the privacy settings on Facebook.  Isn't privacy dead?  No, I hope it isn't because I think it's a big problem if we lose our our  informational privacy.  You know, like increasingly as we spend time online, this is not just a way of  communicating with others, the basis for work and learning and health care and  entertainment and social discourse and so on.  We're kind of leaving this trail of digital crumbs and these things are being  collected into a mirror image of each of us.  The virtual Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the data smog, the stuff that's trailing off of me as I go through the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the virtual Leo may know more about you than you do because you can't remember  what you bought or consumed or said or whatever a year ago.  And, you know, that right now, I think there are thousands of young people not  getting that dream job in the world this year because they failed the quote  reference check.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I also think, Don, that there are people who are discovering connecting with  people they wouldn't have connected with otherwise.  The discussion so much is about privacy, but I think it should be about control of  your data. I agree there, but the benefits of publicness are great.  And it was Eric Schmidt who said that we all ought to be able to change our names  at age 21 and start over.  I think at some point we have kind of a doctrine of mutually assured humiliation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the trouble is that you can't right now.  I mean, I had this debate with my own son and he said, Dad, by the time I come  into the workforce, we're going to be running things.  And the fact that I was underage drinking or wearing a dress at a party or  something is not a reason to.  But there's a big this is going to take it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Happened. It happened in public attitudes.  It happened in the presidency.  You know, a few years ago, you could not lose a nomination because you smoked pot.  I don't think that that's going to be a criterion going forward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it takes it takes a long time.  The other thing is that it information about you in a highly detailed way can be

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  manipulated. Yeah, but everything can be manipulated.  I mean, we've learned nothing is real anymore, but you can be manipulated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess that's really the point.  Like, you know, there are cases of, you know, a guy shows up for the job, but he  failed the reference check.  And what happened is that his employer got access to medical records, right?  Found out that he had been treated for depression or something like that.  That would be bad.  So there are certain things that we have a right to have private.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jake, what do you do?  Do you have a Facebook profile that you post pictures of you partying on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dad's taught you not to do that.  Or did you figure that out on your own?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I just don't put anything up there that I don't want other people to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you do you think that your peers have that sense as well that they realize that  this stuff lives forever?  They probably know better than we do, Don.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think they're self correcting now, like at parties, you know, this is a  no no Facebook photo party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was a very funny onion video the other day about a fire at an NYU dorm and  they figured out who caused the fire because there were 40,000 pictures, 30,000  videos every it was documented in full detail and they had 20,000 shots of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  cigarette.  Yeah, exactly.  Cause the fire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We had to look around the coeds were kissing or, you know, posing for the camera,  the guy was showing his tattoo, but it was all there documented.  That was a very funny video, but I think maybe a little bit true.  We are talking about all sorts of stuff.  We're gonna talk about Google in just a little bit and the new wave with Gina  Tripani, the life hacker and the smarterware.org Don Tapscott is here,  grown up digital.  That's his latest book.  Jeff Jarvis, the author of What Would Google Do?  His latest book and a media wizard from buzz machine.com and his son, Jake, who  is one of the, believe it or not, as a junior in high school, a premier Facebook  developer.  And, and I love that.  We can talk about that in a second.  We're gonna take a break though and talk about GoToMeeting.  You know, it's kind of fitting today that we were spending a lot of time talking  about collaboration because that's what GoToMeeting is all about.  You know, we, we, the old way of doing business really is, well, was meeting in  person.  Then the kind of guy, we got to conference calls, but when's the last time you were  on a conference call?  Boring, unproductive, just, you know, they feel like they're a waste of time.  Somebody goes off track, people lose interest, they disengage, they're playing  Tetris, they're typing Twitter, they're emailing.  And at the end, you feel like, I, that was a waste of time.  This is where GoToMeeting can really help.  GoToMeeting, because they're seeing your computer screen keeps people on track  during the conference calls.  They're on literally the same page, your page.  Everyone on the call sees your screen.  They're following along with you.  The call is more focused, more interesting, more engaging.  And that means you're going to save time.  You're going to be more productive and you're not going to leave these meetings  going, why did we do that again?  GoToMeeting, very simple to install.  Just take you a couple of minutes, a couple of clicks of the mouse.  In fact, if you go right now to go to meeting.com slash twit, G-O-T-O, meeting.com  slash twit, you can install it and try it for 30 days, absolutely free.  Great for sales presentations, for product demos, for training, collaboration.  That's mostly how we use it.  We also use it on one of our, Maxwell's House on our podcast.  We use GoToMeeting all the time.  We get that great screen.  He can show us, you know, as he's talking to us about stuff, he can, we can see  the slides, see the, Kiwi Nerd is the slides actually, for weekly update calls,  any kind of conference call, GoToMeeting.  It is changing the way I do business.  And I think you're going to love it.  I want you to try it free.  Go to go to meeting.com slash twit for 30 days free from the folks at Citrix.  GoToMeeting.com slash twit.  So let's, let's get back to the conversation.  Boy, I hate to interrupt this.  This could go on all night.  This is a great group of people to talk about this stuff.  But there was a big conference this week.  It's kind of funny.  There were two big announcements this week.  Microsoft announced a new search engine called Bing, which everybody went, looked  at and then immediately forgot about because Google had all these big announcements.  Is there any story left?  I mean, is Bing a big deal?  Anybody want to defend Bing?  Gina, is it the hottest thing since Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think I'd like to try it first.  All for search engine composition.  I think it's good.  I think that there needs to be better search engines or decision engines or  whatever we're calling it.  Yeah, they don't call it a search engine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, right.  First thing we had Wolfram Wright, which is the like computational knowledge  engine, and now we have a decision engine.  Either way, I have to say what I saw of Bing looks cool.  I mean, I hate I'm certainly not going to review a product without trying it myself.  But I think that competition is good.  It's a few years late.  I mean, Microsoft has tried this a few times, right?  So we'll see what happens.  I mean, thank goodness it's not a live something or other.  At least they came up with a different name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Enough of the live Microsoft.  When you actually do something live, then you can name it live and we'll all get excited.  Right.  Unfortunately, Microsoft chose the word live as its branding at a time when in fact,  everything really was going live and the stuff that they were using to brand live wasn't.  Right.  Kind of was ironic that way.  Bing will be a success when people say I'm going to Bing that instead of I'm going to  Google that.  And that day is never going to come.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I have a hard time thinking that's going to come.  But I again, I'm yay competition.  So I'm really hoping that it's good.  Ra ra ra ra ra.  That's good.  Yeah.  Good.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I think Leo that search was yesterday's battle and the frontiers to be fought still  are social and live and local and the deep web.  And you're going to get to it in a second.  But I think that with Wave, they just jumped ahead of the old battles to the new battle  route.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I couldn't agree with you more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think the other the reason that everyone got excited about Wave is that one  company announced a product.  The other announced a platform whereby others could participate.  Boy, is that strange.  And that's that's the old versus the new paradigm.  By the way, urban dictionary, it can't have been a coincidence.  The day that Bing was announced came out with a urban slang meaning of the word Bing.  Do you know what it is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I hate to think what jail.  Yeah, I'm in Bing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I've been I've been in Bing for the last 18 months for BNE.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Great.  I'm in Bing because I stole some bling.  Oh, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I think that's a bad about it being.  I think that's a that's a one of the things that's really remarkable about this.  Microsoft could, of course, and probably will.  I mean, they've got SharePoint and Groove.  They'll do something like Wave, but it will be a commercial product.  It will be a closed product.  It'll be a Microsoft product.  They'll sell and it'll be 10 years later.  Yeah.  And it'll be behind the time.  Whereas Google did it exactly right.  They made something that was open.  They invited developers to create for it.  They said, we're going to allow you to run it on your servers.  We're going to allow you to modify it.  We're going to give you an API and a protocol.  This all this is this is.  So you're saying this is the modern way?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the old way is plan and push.  Right.  We have all these great developers, by the way, they're inside our boundaries.  And we create these great products.  Then we push them out onto the market and you're going to love them.  Eat it or not.  Yeah.  And the other is, well, you know, I've been calling it engage and co-innovate  that we create a platform.  We open up the API.  You know, that T-shirt, if you can't open it, you don't own it.  And we'll engage the world in  co-innovating and co-creating the future.  And, you know, one is the old and the other is the new.  Media is the same way, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, media has gone from push, you know, we'll we'll find it.  We'll report it.  We'll give it we'll, you know, serve it up to you.  And now it's a cooperative effort.  And that's look at this show.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that's the important thing about wave.  I'm blogged about right before coming on the show is that  Google talks about it as the email we would invent if we invented email today.  I actually think it's the news we would invent as we are inventing news today,  because I imagine that a bunch of reporters and witnesses can collaborate  on a story using wave, sharing photos and the latest information  and assignments and questions, and they can push that to a web page.  They can push that to Twitter.  And it really becomes a new way to publish news.  I've been talking about how the article is outmoded as the atomic unit of media.  Marissa Mayer at the Kerry hearings talked about how news organizations  need to have a permalink for an ongoing story.  Well, wave, I think, becomes that.  And that's huge in media.  So wave is more than just communication and collaboration.  It's that. But it's also an entirely new way, as Dawn says,  to engage and collaborate and do it live and to publish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, once that thing is out there, then people can interact with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, and I think this bodes very well for wave.  You know, I had the same reaction, Jeff, as a media guy.  I thought, oh, this is great.  I could put the Twitter video in the middle and the community  that's participating in this can interact and create around it.  It's got features of a wiki, features of instant messaging,  features of of actual messaging.  And then but and then now you have another application for it, Jeff.  And I think the measure of the success of this is that it's seen  in many different ways, depending on your point of view, much like the Internet.  The fact that it could be a prism for what your points of view are.  And it can be a collaborative tool.  I mean, if you're in business, think of a small business being able to.  I think of the projects that we work on here to be able to work on it.  And that kind of environment is fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You really have you win online.  The biggest lesson of Google, I think, in creating platforms  is that when you lose control of something, when people surprise you  and take it over, that's when you really want, as opposed to the old,  centralized, big media and corporate way of looking at life,  is that you thought your value was in controlling something.  No, your value now is in losing control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Again, it's that hierarchical.  We know you don't.  We'll tell you, you sit down and shut up and take it.  You consume it.  I think in a way, you made that point, didn't you, Jeff, when you said  Google may not even understand what this is.  They're putting something out that they think is email. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, Craig Newmark, when he made Craigslist, didn't know that it was going to,  you know, destroy the business model of newspapers as we know them.  And people would use it after Katrina defined each other.  I think that Google's putting stuff out with the exact hope.  They said it often in their long one hour and 20 minute  fascinating demo that we want you to take this over and surprise us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The term that's used commonly is generative.  This is a generative project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They also put out web elements.  And I think that's important for media as well.  I've been talking about trying to make news organizations embeddable.  What if you could embed on my blog or yours more than just a video,  but also an article with a quote highlighted or a graphic or photos  or anything else?  I think that web elements from Google enables that.  I saw Apshur this week.  I think they can enable that.  APIs enable that.  So it's also while some newspapers are now trying to shut their stuff down  around the paywall, the smart ones like The Guardian are trying to get their  stuff out there.  And I think elements and Wave become new ways to also distribute your content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go ahead, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I was going to say that as a, you know, as a user and a developer  and a blogger, I'm totally excited about Wave.  I took the time to watch the entire hour and 20 minute demo.  And I was just absolutely blown away.  I'm especially excited that it's open source following on Android and Chrome,  which is really kind of awesome.  I mean, when you think about the culture of secrecy at Google,  like it's really cool to see them put this stuff out there.  I was really excited about, I don't know if you guys saw this part,  but the Google Web Toolkit, which they use to actually build the app  is super cool.  It's like a Java.  You write the app in Java, which I was really excited about because I'm a Java  developer, and then it like generates all the Ajax and CSS for you.  Just kind of from a developer perspective, that was super cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I immediately ordered a GWT book.  Yeah, I know.  I mean, right? Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Me too. I was I didn't order the book yet, but I will do that when we hang up.  That looked really cool.  But at the same time, oh, and I love that it's federated, right?  So you can, you know, install it on different servers and, you know,  the communication that you have on one server doesn't necessarily go back to Google.  I thought it was interesting during the demo that they kept saying  certain parts of this code will be open source.  They didn't say all. They kept saying certain parts.  So I'm curious to know how that like, you know, if there will be phoning home or what?  I mean, they did say that if like, you know,  some company like Lifehacker has Wave installed on their server  and private communications happen there, that those don't ever go back to servers.  And that's a good thing privacy wise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I asked Kevin Marks about the that that question is how much of you are you going to open?  Kevin, of course, is Google's open social advocate and developer and a very smart guy.  And he said, you know, there's there's technical issues with releasing it all.  But the intent is to make it fully open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's good. That's good to hear.  You know, I also think that you have to have sort of a healthy amount of skepticism  about this type of thing as well.  I mean, Om wrote a piece about how Google Wave was the product of his dreams,  as it is, you know, for us to.  But none of us have tried it yet. But let's see it.  Yeah, but let's see it. Exactly.  And what's the business model?  I think someone else like you, Om, also wrote this piece that was like, what's the business model?  I mean, I'm really not of the mind that who cares?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google doesn't need to know what the business model is.  Their business is search.  Anything that drives eyeballs is good for Google.  I mean, advertising slash search. Yeah. Right. Right.  Yeah. Search driven advertising.  Yeah, they're an ad agency.  They're basically an ad agency.  So just like this, like this show and anything else, the more eyeballs,  the better that's, you know, which is definitely at the announcement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know that they were asked the guy's name. I forget Vick.  The the Google guy. Yeah.  Hard last name. Yeah.  Starts with a G.  I won't say Gupta, but I know it's not right.  But anyway, but, you know, so who is your competitor?  And he said, well, we just we didn't really design this with a competitor in mind.  Sort of reminded me of Eric Schmidt's comment when someone asked him.  Gondotra. Gondotra. That's right.  Eric Schmidt was asked, you compete with Microsoft.  And he said, I don't know. I'm not Microsoft.  That's their problem, not mine.  But but to your point, Leo earlier,  I mean, it kind of is like the web in the sense that what is this thing?  It will be what we want it to be.  Sort of like the Internet will be. It's a mirror on it. Yeah.  Yeah, it's a reflection of everything that, you know, in the case of the web,  everything that goes on from, you know, finding a cure to AIDS to  organizing acts of horrific evil. Right.  But it's I don't I'm not sure they do know what it is.  I mean, it's a platform that's going to evolve.  And it will be what, you know, what we create.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's fine. As long as they understand that and they don't attempt to mold it.  But I think that Google, of all companies, is most likely to let it be  what it wants to be. Jake, you've developed for Facebook.  And I'm sure that's a little, you know, feeling a little risky,  because at any point, Facebook could pull the plug on anything you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh-huh. Or they could change the profile layout or anything.  Yeah. And then, you know, it's it's a closed system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And yet it's been a great system for developers.  FBML is, you know, I guess fairly easy to write for.  And and developers are making a lot of money.  But you must look at something like Wave and say, that's kind of a more  safe place to be. You feel that's great. Yeah.  Have you bought the book on GWT?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I want to, though, because I'm learning Java in school right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's perfect for that. Yeah. Yeah.  Yeah, I think it's an interesting model, although you don't.  By the way, I checked. You don't have to write in Java.  There are bindings for there's also bindings for Python.  Oh, cool. Yeah.  So and I imagine, you know, it's not like Yahoo's user interface  or jQuery, which are basically JavaScript libraries you write in Java.  Yeah. Yeah, I think that's kind of interesting.  It is. That's really cool. Yeah.  So, Jake, are you going to write some gadgets?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I hope so. I'm still unsure like how they got it working.  I think you have to make a bot or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, here's one thing that's kind of interesting.  I asked Kevin Marks about this.  I said, is it like an iGoogle gadget?  He said, yeah, it's HTML, CSS and JavaScript, which I mean,  look, if you're writing for WebOS, if you're writing for Google Gadgets,  Yahoo dashboard, Yahoo widgets, Microsoft Dashboard or Apple Dashboard,  all of these are that CSS, HTML and JavaScript.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's great because they take care of the synchronizing stuff.  They said you just have to change the X HTML.  Is that cool?  And then it shows on all the other different sides.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you watch the breakout presentation on this,  what do they call it, object transformation?  No.  It's how you get this kind of asynchronous collaboration going on.  It's very interesting, very sophisticated.  It's kind of a modern computer science, you know, hot topic,  flavor of the year.  And they've done a good job, I think.  This is going to attract developers for some time.  It does require HTML5 and that means Google called them modern browsers.  The euphemism.  That's a good euphemism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The non-IE browsers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, anything but iE.  Is that like an oxy-con?  Well, no, it isn't because in fact, what they call modern browsers  are really not, in many cases, available yet.  Chrome 2 will do a lot of it.  Yeah.  Safari.  But one thing they pointed out, or maybe it was Kevin pointed out,  that really the best browsers for this are WebKit based.  Chrome and Safari are WebKit based, but many mobile platforms  are also WebKit based, including Palm Pre.  There is the key, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that the power of this instantaneous communication on mobile  is mind-blowing, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can you imagine?  I mean, you have a wave, you get up, you've been reading this wave,  you've been following the news, big story going on,  you're following it on your desktop, you get up and it's on your phone  and you continue to follow and continue to collaborate and contribute.  Do you think it was one thing that I wanted it to do?  And I don't know.  I actually got kind of shouted down yesterday on the Gilmore gang  because I said, well, I'd like never have I'd like it  to scale to a large group.  I'm curious about it.  And as a as a many to many communication tool.  And I think it was Mark Kander said, oh, forget it about it.  You know, it's not it's going to be, you know,  a few to few, 150 or fewer.  It's not going to be a media tool.  Do you think, Jeff, it could be a media tool?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it could be.  I think this idea of working collaboratively, assigning and questioning  as you go on, working with Nokia at CUNY, where I teach with their devices  to try to have an assignment structure they're working on.  Well, you look at Wave and right in the middle of it, you can say, who's there?  What do you know? Go get a picture, add the picture in, do this, do that.  I guess to one extent in the wave,  if you want to try to come out with a good product, maybe you.  It's a benefit to be able to limit it.  But I think that there have to be ways to structure it  like Twitter, where you can follow people and you can have.  That's I agree.  Part is different views of the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes. And that's going to be tough.  I don't know how they do that, but that's you're exactly right.  This is the thing that makes Twitter work, is that you get to design  your own in effect by choosing who you're following.  I don't know how they're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I think that the idea that you and I might see the  see the same wave and see different versions of it. Right.  That's very confusing.  Coming out of an era where everything, every newspaper was printed  exactly the same, we all saw the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We all watched Ed Sullivan on Sunday night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, the whole adoption is going to be super interesting, right?  Like I introduce friends to Gmail for the first time,  and they get freaked out by the conversation threading  and the way that it works. It's different.  It's different than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If that freaks them out, they're really in trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes. I mean, I think wave adoption is going to be like, what is this at first?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think real time scares people initially.  I remember when FriendFeed went real time, there was all this noise.  Oh, it's too much too fast. I can't keep up.  And then people went, oh, wait a minute.  Oh, this is compelling. Oh, my God.  And they and they got it.  I think we're naturally live. All it is is human.  This is this is real time.  It's called a conversation. Right.  That's normal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Part of the way you you curate that is by the people you trust.  You're not going to curate the kind of that.  I've always been I've been saying for the last year that Google is behind on live  because they need content to ferment like wine or cheese.  They need to see the links come in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's hard to do real time search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, exactly. And so I thought that's why they needed to buy Twitter.  And in a sense, they went around the left flank and around the issue  to a whole new kind of live creation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow. Brilliant.  I had the same thing as you described with Twitter when I first came on it.  I was just over until someone said, you heard a tweet deck.  And all of a sudden, I could organize all this stuff in a way that I could deal

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  with it. Got me on Tweety, Don. It's much, much better.  By the way, I saw a question on on Tweety on Twitter  asking someone, what is your Twitter handle on the D taps got?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll pass that on. D taps got Gina Tripani.  Yeah, it's Jeff Jarvis, is it? Or is it Buzz Machine?  Jeff Jarvis, Jake Jarvis.  And I don't give out my Twitter handle anymore.  Because you're just too famous.  You got too many followers.  You know, it used to be a lot of followers is nothing compared to P.  Diddy. There was a little Twitter revulsion, though.  Revolshion. There's a Freudian slip, that little Twitter revolution.  P. Diddy started making a big deal about getting to a million followers.  And all of a sudden, there's a hot and rising topic.  Unfollow Diddy.  And he went dropped down very rapidly.  Another 50,000 people dropped off.  They said, is this the Twitter that we want?  Yeah. Same thing with this.  You know, Jake, you're not playing this spy.  What is this game? Spy Master?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I signed up for it. You did? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm curious. You're not going to be one of those spy master spammers.  No. I think Twitter, one of Twitter's problems right now  is that it's very easy to game it and and to get game trending topics.  And by putting trending topics right on the front page there, they have  they've encouraged people to start gaming it with things like Spy Master.  And that's going to increase the signal of noise.  But the beauty of it is that you that you get to follow who you're interested in.  I haven't seen one.  Only one of my friends, Juana, I'm thinking to you,  only one of my friends now has has had a spy master post on Twitter,  whereas a lot of people are complaining about this.  And it's because who I follow, the quality people like  you, Gina, that I follow, aren't playing those stupid games.  You know, so that's the beauty of this follow model.  I don't know if we can apply it to wave. I'd love to see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, ultimately, it's, you know, age of transparency.  I mean, real value comes to the fore.  If you're going to be I love that. I hope that's true.  If you're going to be on Twitter and you're going to be a jerk  or just promoting your own thing or whatever, you're going to lose it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As long as we have the tools to do that,  then I do have high hopes that quality will rise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just saw on the IRC, no surprise, Scoble is on Spy Master.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Of course.  Well, he has the good sense not to tweet it then, because I haven't seen.  Then Jake, you don't tweet it.  You could play it. Just don't tweet it. OK.  No, I haven't.  Jake, did you ever do World of Warcraft?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For a few months when it came out, it's not as addictive as people say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I, you know, I played World of Warcraft.  I probably sunk 40 hours into it in order to get to really a high level.  You got to be. You got to spend a lot of time on it.  And it's not that much fun. It's a lot of running around.  I want to kill things. I don't want to run around.  You don't play WoW, do you, Gina?  None of the people here play WoW. They're too productive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, no. I would lose my entire life immediately, I think.  Running around.  I'm sure I would drown immediately or do something stupid or like  wind up in the woods and kill. I don't know.  I'm bad at the games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had a really funny one happen to me.  I was over at Nokia in Helsinki and it came up.  WoW came up and the one of the senior execs came up to me afterwards  and he says, I think I have a good story for you.  He says my 15 year old is a guild master and  it was New Year's Day and he's allowed to play on holidays and he wasn't playing.  And I said, hey, how come you're not playing today?  He says, Dad, it's New Year's Day.  It's not a good day to go on a raid.  Everyone in my guild is hung over.  Oh, and the dad is mortified.  Like, what are you talking about?  Why are all these kids drinking?  And then the kid had to explain to him on the average age is probably 35.  It's a bunch of accountants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's really who's playing World of Warcraft.  We're going to take a break.  I want to when we come, we have so much to talk about, but I'd like to.  We've got a great panel here.  Don Tapscott, Gina Trapani, Jeff Jarvis and Jake Jarvis.  And and we're getting some great feedback, by the way, real time  feedback in our chat room.  We have five chat rooms going at once, plus our Twitter conversations.  It's just really I like the interactivity of it.  I like the party feel of what we're doing.  We're going to talk some more in just a bit.  But I want to mention our friends at audible dot com.  Any any I'm just going to ask out here, any of any of you listen to audio, audio,  audio books, you travel a lot, Don, you've got to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't a lot. I have to tell you the truth.  I'm surprised. Yeah, I should more.  I just yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a great way not to waste time.  You're you're an audible listener, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I am. And I'm proud to be on audible.  I recorded my own audio book.  Did you? You could hear how fast I talk.  Nine and three quarters hours of me.  I couldn't even bear. But people are nice. They buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's unabridged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. It's it's every damn comma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's such an intimidating idea of actually reading your entire book  and recording it. I've never that I've had publishers ask me to do that.  And I've always done. I've listened to your book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's weird because I hear you.  And that's not how my mind's ear heard you before. Right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don's economics, how mass collaboration changes everything,  which was really the prescient book in all of this.  I mean, when did that come out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The end of 2006, it was according to Amazon sales.  It was the number one management book for the year in 2007. But  but it came out in 2006.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's available on Audible.  And of course, what would Google do is available on Audible.  Now, here's the good news.  I'm going to give you a chance to get two books free.  So there you go. There are your two books.  Go to audible.com slash twit to if you sign up for the platinum account.  You can get now, Gina, when you put the Lifehacker book on Audible,  then we're going to have to come up with a new offer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If I could stand the sound of my own voice for that many hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you don't have to read your own book.  That's good news.  Actually, Audible's been asking me, what are you going to read?  What are you going to read? They want me to read a book.  And so that's going to be a tough one to choose.  I think I'm going to read fiction. I like fiction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think you should do Don's next book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'd like to hear your opinion.  The opposite of fiction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like that gets common of the day, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Audible.com slash twit to sign up for the platinum account.  50, no, I'm sorry, 60,000 books now, a huge variety business,  but also fiction, great performances, young adults as well, mysteries,  thrillers, a fantastic sci-fi section.  It is my bookstore and I think it'll become yours, too.  There's a new one, by the way, called Twitter Power.  I see. Wow.  This is the first Twitter book to make it on audible.com.  I wonder if it's all in 140 characters.  The book's 140 characters long.  I could listen to that. Audible.com slash twit to.  We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.  You know, we were talking about before the show began about education,  and that's one of the things, Don, you're very active in  is in how the pedagogy is changing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Basically, if somebody was frozen a hundred years ago  and they miraculously came alive today and they looked around at the professions,  a doctor in an operating theater, a pilot in a jetter, they think, wow,  has the world ever changed in technology has been at the heart of.  If they walked into a lecture theater at a typical university or in a classroom,  they'd be the sigh of relief.  You know, they'd say this is something I've read.  University is exactly the same.  You know, the model, you could call it broadcast learning.  I'm a teacher. I have knowledge.  You're a student. You're an empty vessel. You don't get ready.  Here it comes. Right.  You know, and your goal is to take it into short term, active memory  and through practice and repetition to build deeper structures  so that you can recall it to me when I test you drill and kill. Right.  And the problem, it was the problem is not just that that's a bad way of learning.  The problem is Jake, like Jake's grown up interacting with content.  My generation grew up watching TV 24 hours a week.  So that broadcast model was OK.  But today, the kids don't learn that way.  And the whole model of pedagogy is wrong for the generation  that's going to dominate this this century.  So we have a big disconnect, I think, that's shaping up in the universities.  And there's been a lot of hand wringing about the university.  Big article in The New York Times called The Demise of the University  that caused a lot of flak.  But all the criticisms of the university, to me, come down to this one, that  when you've got the smartest kids thinking the thing to do is to get an A  without having ever gone to a lecture, the writing's on the wall.  You know, we need to move to a model of learning that's student focused  and that's collaborative and that's not one size fits all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Universities are really designed around creating more university professors,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  essentially. Well, that's been a big part of it.  And even on that, it doesn't do well.  Like you have all these graduate students wanting to be professors  and there are no jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I think you're absolutely right.  And I don't mean to interrupt my own son there, but but, you know,  Jake's been this year as a junior taught to the test.  Testing is an industrial age model of stamping out the students  all the same, trying to say the same right answers.  And those are not the people who are going to invent the next Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Even teachers hate that, frankly, unfortunately.  That's government mandated these days.  And it's really a shame.  Jake, what do you supplement your education?  How do you handle this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just do what I'm told in school.  I mean, you're told, you know, I have my son doesn't do what he's told.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I have trouble with that, because on the one hand, you know,  I feel like he needs to get an education and get A's and and and.  But on the other hand, I think that maybe his creativity is being stifled.  Maybe he shouldn't do what he's told.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. So, Jake, why do you do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, like in AP classes, about getting a five on the test.  So I want to do that.  Five on the test. Then I just you want to go to college.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And if you don't do that, you're not going to get into a good school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. And I don't agree with that way, but that's how it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So yeah, my daughter is also a junior in high school  and totally focused on getting into college because we've brainwashed her.  The culture is brainwashed her that that's what you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, this gets to a really fundamental thing,  which is the purpose of education.  I mean, when I when I graduated, you went to university,  you chose a field and you graduated and you were set for life.  You just kept up in your chosen field.  Today, you graduate. You're you're not set for life.  You're set for like, I don't know, 15 minutes.  Yeah, you may not be set at all.  You know what you took in the first year, if it was a technical course,  is obsolete by the time you get to the fourth year.  So it's not your ability to perform on tests or even to a certain extent,  what you know that counts when you graduate at your capacity  to learn lifelong and to think and to communicate and solve problems and be critical.  And well, and to search, you know, to research and to authenticate  and to have good B.S. detectors and and so on.  And I think we're just totally headed in the wrong direction.  And these institutions, if we don't invent them for relevance,  then they will fall.  There's there's all kinds of signs that the universities are in deep trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gina, did you what you study in college?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I was an English major in college.  See, there you go. And comps.  Well, I was a computer science minor and then I was getting my graduate degree  at CUNY in New York and in CUNY.  Yeah, CUNY. Yeah, I went to Brooklyn College.  Yeah, CUNY. English, too.  You know, I spent a lot of time at UC San Diego.  And actually, it was interesting earlier when we're talking about Facebook.  My spouse is an administrator at the university.  So she runs into photos of students doing things that they shouldn't be doing all the time.  She's sort of legally bound to do something about it.  She doesn't friend anyone that doesn't friend her.  So that's kind of going back.  So she doesn't. That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She doesn't want to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, no, no, no. She doesn't want to see unless unless it's pushed to her.  She's not like on Facebook, you know, checking in on her students.  She's literally like, do what you want to do.  Make your decisions. I'm going to educate you.  But I don't want to see. See no evil.  Exactly. But, you know, if she comes up on a picture of a student holding  like an enormous bag of weed and has to do something legally,  she has to do something about it.  So that's kind of that's kind of an interesting  thread, but also at UC San Diego, I mean, I kind of agree  with what you were just saying about universities.  But isn't there some aren't there some systems of participation happening?  I mean, I heard that in large lecture halls here, at least  there's like a remote control that you can buy and then, you know,  turns off the lecture.  Well, professors ask questions and then students, you know, through like,  I guess it's some sort of like I are remote, you know, answer,  choose the answer that they think.  And then it gets aggregated on the screen online, you know, live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why don't you just put Twitter up on the screen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But yes, seriously, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a little scary, probably for most professors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think we need BarCamp U.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  BarCamp University. How to teach teaching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly, exactly.  So, I mean, I don't know if that's going to solve all the problems.  I mean, it's just like, you know, real time polling.  And, you know, it's a it's a multiple choice answer from what I understand.  But it's some it's moving toward that a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's a step.  But still, it's it's sort of fiddling with the old,  you know, one way model.  Are you saying disband the whole thing?  Well, look at nineteen.  What was it? Seventy six.  I took a graduate course in statistics at the University of Alberta.  It was all on a computer.  PDP 1170 with a BT 100 terminal  and a slide projector connected to the wow.  The the prof was right there.  So no decline in face to face communication.  But he was out of the transmission of data business.  And well, in statistics, there's no one size fits all anyway.  I mean, everyone in the classroom is either bored or they don't get it.  So I went through things at my own pace, things I understood.  I went through quickly things I didn't understand and went over and over again.  I got an A.  Um, most kids did.  I'm saying computer teaching is a future for it's a it's not about the technology.  It's changing the relationship between the student and the teacher.  Letting you letting you pull the information.  Yeah. And there's a big role for face to face.  Small group discussions, really, but not for lectures.  No, like the lecture is the process whereby the notes of a lecture  go to the notes of a student without going through the brains of either.  Now, as someone who gives a lot of lectures, I appreciate the irony  of that particular point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, let's let's do something for Jake and for my daughter and for all the kids.  I mean, we have a lot of smart kids listen to this show  and they're in the same mind.  Jakeson, they got to get the grades.  I mean, I don't want to undermine you, dad, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  abolish the SAT. Start there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Abolish get rid of the educational testing service  and abolish the notion of teaching to tests and teach to creativity.  Why don't universities and high schools have Google's 20 percent rule?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Start there. There. That's a great idea.  Google encourages, in fact, I think commands its employees  to spend 20 percent of their time one day in five doing stuff that they're interested in.  And some of the best stuff out of Google's been 20 percent stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's going to get us out of this mess is not industrial age people,  you know, marching like in the 1984 commercial.  It's going to be people who are creating new things and are empowered to do so.  As a dad in all candor, you know, I feel guilty that like you, I say, yeah, Jake,  you're right. That's what you have to do to get into Carnegie Mellon  where he's going this summer, I'm proud to say.  But on the other hand, how much more could he learn if he were creating things,  programs, companies, all kinds of other things?  How do we mix the two in?  Because right now they just don't work together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I felt like that the convergence of digital tools and the Internet,  both lowering the cost of creation and giving you a distribution medium  is is going to foster an explosion of creativity,  unlike anything we've seen since the Cambrian explosion.  I really think that we are on the verge of an amazing explosion of creativity.  And I don't I think people like Jake are a good example of somebody  who is both doing in the background, doing this creativity and then forced  to kind of go down this channel that is really increasingly irrelevant.  But we but you can't get rid of these institutions overnight.  I wish we could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But look at all that Jake can accomplish on the side.  And imagine if the world was organized to let him accomplish full time.  So it would be unbelievable. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So why don't we start as parents, Jeff?  Why don't we just say, all right, don't go to college?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because his wife, my wife and his mother in the other room  would come in and kill me. Yeah. And my wife will kill me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's on the college tour with my daughter right now.  I know. What's what's Fred Wilson?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jake met David. I'm sorry, Jake Carp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, David Carp, the creator of Tumblr. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Fred, because Fred said that Jake should have a mentor like that  or someone to meet to see. David's like 24.  Well, Fred warned me that that that David  quit high school to start the company. Yeah.  And when we came home, his mother, my wife said, don't you think of it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that comes from a fear that is understandable,  that if you don't go to college, get the four year degree, get the diploma,  get the graduate degree, you won't be able to get a job.  And I think we know now it that that's a fallacious fear.  It's in fact, it's the wrong direction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Universities should be incubators of creation.  And they are the opposite now.  I teach a course in entrepreneurial journalism.  I teach in university.  I do it because I want to be around the young people  who are going to reinvent journalism.  And I try to foster that.  But they care about the grades.  And I say, don't give a damn about the grade.  You know, you might get money at the end of this course to start a company.  That's better than a grade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Texan says in our chat room something that is a reasonable thing.  I want my doctor to go to college.  I want my lawyer to go to college.  But there's been a lot of thought that maybe instead of a four year  liberal arts degree leading into a graduate degree that lets you be a lawyer  or a doctor, that we get right down to it and we pursue the profession  that we intend to pursue and and you know, treat these trades as trades.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But here's the thing, the credential, this is an important function  of the university is credentials, OK, that you've gone through the motions.  You've showed that you can buckle down and you've you've  you've acquired a certain base of knowledge.  But that that's only sustainable if it is shown over time  that this is the best way to get that knowledge.  So there was a panel that I watched.  It was probably about three years ago where there are a bunch of doctor heads  of a big hospitals complaining about the cost of the health care system.  System and the head of Johns Hopkins was on there and he was talking about,  you know, it's 50 K to do heart surgery and another 100 K to  if it gets complicated.  And on the panel was a woman who is a head of an Indian hospital.  And she says, well, we do heart surgery for three thousand dollars fixed price,  but that doesn't include the airfare.  And they asked her, well,  where did your head of cardiology graduate?  And she said from Johns Hopkins.  Now, but but what's happening is over time,  it will become more powerful if if she says, well, actually graduated  from the local university in Bangalore, which which.  Who are you going to choose for your heart surgery?  Well, the problem is that, again, this is an age where  where true value comes to the fore and where things get evidence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How do credentials the only way we have of doing that?  No, but or data or data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If we had how many patients about to be off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How do you get that data?  Who are the first 100 people he operates on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no, but we're not talking about  seeing how many people he killed or not.  To Jeff's point, I think there's all kinds of measures of data  that this sort of precede the actual being in the operating room.  And if these if the universities are proven to not be the best places,  if there are other systems, other models of learning  that over time show that they're superior,  then the credentialing function is going to vanish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right now, when I wrote my book, Bob Wyman from Google in the comments,  separated education into three things.  I added a fourth.  It's teaching, it's credentialing, it's research.  And I added socialization.  And those four things don't have to happen in the same quad in the same buildings.  They can be separated out, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. On the socialization one, Marvin Dressler was the head of sociology  at Princeton.  We're having a discussion about this a while ago.  And he says, the great thing about a university is it's a wonderful place  for young people to go for four years and get older.  And he says, they're bound to learn something while they're there.  But the thing is that if that's all they're doing is getting old  and smoking a little pot.  It's a pretty expensive camp. Yeah.  You know, it's like one hundred sixty thousand dollars.  Yeah. Kid to go to camp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Melrose Place University. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think a lot.  One thing that people look at, a lot of the people who are founders  of the technological revolution today did not graduate from college.  Some of that's the model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the model for Jake.  You look at Zuckerberg and Gates and at graduate level,  Sergey and Larry. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, pretty amazing.  Gate. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Jake, listen to your mother.  She's just in case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just in case you might want to listen to your mother.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is it? What is this gender difference?  You know, because it was the very same thing in our family.  I kept telling my kids, look, I don't care so much about your marks.  I want you to have a passion.  I'm Lucy Goosey.  You love learning.  And my wife would say, don't listen to this jerk.  Who's your father?  Because you want to get in.  And women have always been more practical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Women have had to fit. Am I right? Am I right?  I think women know that you're going to starve to death  and you just better pay attention.  And guys are going around. Yeah, but I want to play the flute.  I want to sit in that tree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can be a professional athlete.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm going to play ball. It's OK.  That's what my son says.  I might be a guitar player. I'm going to be rock and roll.  Gina Tripani, thank you so much for being here.  You're just great.  We're going to I guess I can kind of informally say that Gina and Jeff and I,  I hope Jeff, you will join us, are going to start a Google show soon.  It's going to really be about cloud computing as much as Google.  But boy, Google has given us a lot of stuff to talk about,  not just last week, but over the last few years.  And and it's happening in the cloud.  And I think it's going to be a very interesting show.  We'll start doing that as soon as we can work out a time that works for for you  too. And maybe you'll stop by once in a while, too, I hope. Sure.  And let us know how that goes. He knows more than I do.  Of course they all do. And talk about GWT.  Gina Tripani is at SmarterWear.org.  That is her new site.  She still, of course, writes for her original blog, Life Hacker,  which has now grown into an amazing place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A monster, a monster.  But yeah, I'm there once a week now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And on Twitter is Gina Tripani.  T-R-A-P-A-N-I. So great to see you, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thank you for joining us today. Great to see you, too. Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff, it was great having you in studio with your son, first father, son team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm honored to be here. I really appreciate it.  It's the only show I could be on that would impress Jake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hope we've helped you with your son.  Jake, it's great to have you too.  Where do you want people to go?  JakeJarvis.com. Is that the place?  All right. And you are also on on the Twitter as Jake Jarvis.  Yeah. Thanks, Leah.  Is Twitter your place still or Facebook?  Where do you spend most of your time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mostly Twitter. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've become a big big friend feed fan.  I don't know why. I like that real time.  I have to try that. Oh, it's awesome.  By the way, let's not forget Jeff's book.  Got to pay the college bills.  What Would Google Do, Ladies and Gentlemen?  A great book about a great company and how it is that they can inspire your company as well.  And it is available now from Collins Business.  And of course, Don Tapscott, thank you for being in studio with us.  It's really great to have you come all this way.  Don's book is latest, although there's a new one on the way, is Grown Up.  You want to talk about the new book at all? Sure.  What's it about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a modest little thing called Rebuilding the World.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we didn't get into it.  We've run out of time. We didn't get into this.  The new cyber czar, what the Obama administration is doing in terms of technology  and and the constraints that it's running up against as well and making major changes.  It's not easy, not an easy thing to do.  Growing Up Digital was the first.  This is the new and grown up digital.  And I highly recommend it.  It's really a great insight into into the future and and what our kids are going to face  and what and what our kids are today.  And somebody like Jake does not need to read this.  You're living it, dude.  Thank you, Don, for coming in. I really appreciate it.  Thank you all for being here. We've enjoyed the conversation.  You can listen to Twitter Live.  We do the show live at 3 p.m. Pacific Time, 6 p.m. Eastern 2000 UTC at live dot twit dot TV  every Sunday evening.  And you're invited to join us for the live version of the show.
