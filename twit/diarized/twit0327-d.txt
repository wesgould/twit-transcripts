I'm sure we'll find out. I thought it was a bar of soap. I opened it when it wasn't. I almost threw it away.  So it's a good thing that I see soap. You're looking for soap. I was looking for free soap. I thought, you know, what could I have?  OK, you've got a shower. Anyway, we are having a barbecue and want to thank everybody who came from, frankly, all over the Bay Area.  It's really nice to have you. Who came here for the farthest, though? Somebody's here from Israel, I believe.  Wow. You came all the way specifically for the show from Israel? No, he's actually a developer.  He writes mobile applications. What's the name of it? Car buzz. Have you ever seen car buzz? Car buzz.  You would actually like car buzz. I would like car buzz kill. Yeah, your buzz kill. But car buzz is the app on Android, iPhone.  You should take a look at it. It's like a it's a magazine like a car magazine on app.  Who else? Anybody from from anywhere else from outside the U.S.? Or just outside of California?  Mostly local because it was you know, it's a barbecue and we want people would be nearby.  We got a great caterer out front. We've got a jumpy jump. We've got tents. We took over the street. You did.  Yeah. It's pretty nice. Yeah, we did. We paid a battle in the police department. Paid the bribe.  No, it's not a bribe. I believe there's a process that you go through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We this is all to perish the thought. No, no, no. Permitted. Everything permitted.  And if you notice, I'm wearing a purple armband. That's not a style statement. That's actually so I can eat meat.  If you don't have you all have the purple. But that's just you're wearing that healthy thing.  What's all this is the job. The job. How do you like it? I was hoping you'd notice.

Start time: 412.32
End time: 416.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What is this? It's like a fitbit. Oh, you're more annoying.

Start time: 416.76
End time: 426.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. And by the way, you know how Livestrong everybody was wearing the Livestrong.  You're this is the use this. You remember this day, the first time you saw this thing in a year, everybody's going to be wearing.

Start time: 426.24
End time: 430.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Have you had to recharge it? There's been a lot of talk on Twitter that the first time you recharge it, it dies.

Start time: 431.54
End time: 484.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I have recharges several times. OK, so maybe they got a bad one.  This is from Jawbone. Those guys do the the Bluetooth. Here, I'll show you the Bluetooth headsets.  Headset. Yeah. And this is not Bluetooth. In fact, it's kind of weird.  The way it works is you have to have an iPhone. It's no point in having if you don't have an iPhone.  It uses the audio jack and the iPhone, but it comes with a USB charger that plugs into that.  So you plug that into your computer and charges very quickly. It goes about six.  What does it do? It is a pedometer in its basis form.  You know who made the technology in here? It's called Motion X.  Philippe Khan. He's doing something.  Philippe's amazing. So Philippe Khan, you all remember.  Maybe you don't from Borland. Right.  He wrote Turbo or produced Turbo Pascal and which transformed an industry.  By the way, I just saw a page. Do you remember? You're too young.  No, too young. You remember Turbo Pascal.  He's three years older than me. I had the.  Is he really? I think so. I feel like you're so young.

Start time: 484.64
End time: 500.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe it's the spiky hair. I'm clearly compensating for my age.  You don't notice my crow's feet when you're staring at the beard.  We'll see the gray. Yeah, there you go. Oh, he's got a gray beard.  So the thing that excites me the most is that not only it's a pedometer, it's got an accelerometer.  So if you're riding a bike or running, it tracks all of that stuff.

Start time: 501.04
End time: 506.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It does. I don't know how well a pedometer on your wrist is going to work, to be honest with you.  So that'll remain to be seen how accurate that is.

Start time: 507.22
End time: 510.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it also tracks how well you sleep and how much you move around.

Start time: 510.46
End time: 526.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you push a button on here. This is the button.  And when you're going to go to sleep, you say, I'm in sleep mode.  And then it will pull up. I should show you. I have it on my iPhone.  I can show you what it looks like.  The app, which is free, is called up. The device is called up.  It's from Jobbomb. It's a hundred bucks.  Pay no attention to that Scrabble game.

Start time: 527.96
End time: 528.47
Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I covered it.

Start time: 529.72
End time: 559.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't want you to see how dumb I am.  So this is my activity.  I've had 1,136 steps today.  This is how many miles I went. This is how many.  Oh, actually. Yeah.  Oh, no, that's not today. That's this afternoon.  So this is a graph. That's the food. I take pictures of your food.  But here's my sleep cycle. Let's tap that.  So the orange is awake.  The light blue is light sleep. And the dark blue is the REM sleep that you want.  And you can see I only got 74% sleep. This Fitbit does this too.

Start time: 559.80
End time: 564.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So now when you when you do you have any memory of these moments that it says that you're awake?

Start time: 564.52
End time: 568.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't remember. That's amazing. No, I do. That's OK.  How is that amazing?

Start time: 569.74
End time: 574.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because no, I do remember it with all the things my body does, Ryan, that I don't even know.

Start time: 574.78
End time: 653.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is when I got up to pee. I'm an old man.  OK, I'm an old man.  I didn't want to talk about it, but you put me on the spot.  So anyway, I remember that I do remember that.  Does it track that?  There's a little cut. So the so and then you have you have a team of people that also are using this.  And you can see how they're doing. I can see how Gregory slept.  I can see how Gary slept. That kind of thing.  He makes sleep. That's what makes it better than a Fitbit.  The idea is to make this a competitive sport. Fitbit does that actually as well.  I slept the hell out of you last night.  And then you could give each other challenges.  The thing is that the iPhone app is actually kind of smart because you take pictures of your food as you're going in.  And then you also register how you feel after you had that meal.  I don't know if that would be of use, but it's interesting.  So here's people putting their status updates. There's Gary's status update.  I don't know. I think this, you know, I could take a photo of my meal, choose a meal photo from library, work out with band.  I don't have a band, but if I have a band, I'll work out with them.  Work out with GPS. That's kind of cool.  If you have your phone with you, it will take the phone will take a track.  This app will take a track of your workout and then upload it to the fit to the Nike Plus.  That is like Nike Plus. Yeah.  So it combines Fitbit, Nike Plus, a food tracker, sleep.  That's interesting. And it's this wirelessly, right?  You don't know. Unlike the Fitbit, you have to plug it in to sync it.

Start time: 653.22
End time: 664.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a little bit of a disadvantage. Because right now I'm using a whole bunch of different apps.  I use the Nike Plus when, by the way, I highly recommend if you ride a bike,  get the Nike Plus jogging app because it's so impressed with you.  It's like, that's your best marathon. You're fast.

Start time: 665.36
End time: 686.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow, 26 miles in three minutes.  Exactly.  So it syncs just by putting it in there like that. It's syncing right now.  It's not bad. It's not bad. It's very quick.  And you don't have to sync all the time.  The one other thing that it does that the Fitbit doesn't do,  it will watch your sleep cycle and will you set an alarm.  So you set your alarm for a half hour time frame.  And when your sleep is lightest, it will wake you up by vibrating the bracelet.

Start time: 687.58
End time: 690.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that's kind of cool. What's the benefit of that?

Start time: 690.10
End time: 694.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You don't wake up when you're in deep REM sleep.  You know how you wake up if you're in really deep sleep and you're groggy  if the alarm goes off.

Start time: 694.56
End time: 698.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You feel more rested because they pick when you're lightest and just sort of nudge you.  Like, hey, get up.

Start time: 699.24
End time: 703.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was already up when it buzzed this morning.  In the morning. In the morning, John.

Start time: 703.92
End time: 704.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a catchphrase.

Start time: 704.78
End time: 707.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What if you need to get up?  Because it just waits until you sleep.

Start time: 708.62
End time: 710.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What if you're just dead out?

Start time: 711.00
End time: 721.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're never going to wake up for days.  Eventually it gives up, I guess.  I don't know. You said it's a half hour time frame.  I'll let you know.  Apparently nobody does REM sleep for that long.  I don't know how we got into this. Anyway, that's what that is.

Start time: 721.68
End time: 724.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You got into it because you said everyone's going to want one.

Start time: 724.58
End time: 737.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have a feeling this is going to be huge.  It's the beginning.  Is it going to swell up when it gets rainy?  Yes.  It's the beginning of a revolution in personal health monitoring.  You know, I already, when I weigh myself in tweets, when I take my blood pressure at tweets.

Start time: 737.96
End time: 747.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and when the company that's collecting this data sends it to the insurance company,  it tweets that your rates have just gone up.  I'm a little worried about that.  Do you think that'll happen? No.

Start time: 748.16
End time: 753.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  It's not medically reliable.  They can't use that.  Yes, they don't need it.  It doesn't have to be reliable.

Start time: 753.82
End time: 755.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They can do it for any reason at all.  Any reason they got.

Start time: 755.76
End time: 759.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They did raise my rates like 13%.  So fake the data and get your rates down.  Probably because you signed on to that thing.

Start time: 759.96
End time: 774.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If they'll use it anyway, then you should spike the data.  Yeah, that's another thing.  Don't get those shopping cars.  Those go right to the insurance companies.  Like if I buy donuts.  You bought more red meat?  Holy mackerel, look at the donuts this guy eats.  Jack his rates up.  He's going to be dead.

Start time: 774.76
End time: 778.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's why if we just had a single payer health plan, John, we wouldn't have to worry.  I believe what it is.

Start time: 778.86
End time: 787.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  On average, and I'm somebody who has to pay for his own health care.  I don't know how we're on health care.  Why not?  This is Twit, don't you know?  Nine, nine, nine.  We haven't started yet.

Start time: 787.88
End time: 793.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll try to get him on track, ladies and gentlemen.  I'll do what I can.  That's why we love you, John.  Go ahead.

Start time: 794.10
End time: 802.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, no, I was just going to say, from what I understand, it's illegal to jack up the rates of any one person,  but that's why they do these groups.  So you start a group and then the group as a whole, 20% every year, year after year.

Start time: 803.92
End time: 809.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I thought that, but they recently raised my rates more than they raised the rest of the company's rates.  Is that legal?

Start time: 810.13
End time: 810.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.

Start time: 810.94
End time: 819.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's certainly douchey.  The rationale was, well, we're such a small group because there are only 20 people that they, oh, well, in that case.  So my rates were actually raised over everybody else's.

Start time: 819.92
End time: 828.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they could do that because of your, if they have your health information and you fit one of the groups that he's talking about, I guess.  I don't know.  It seems wrong, but you know, health care.

Start time: 829.08
End time: 843.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How much is that thing?  Same as a Fitbit.  It's really comparable to the Fitbit.  That's not going to replace Livestrong.  The reason I like it is because I've lost three Fitbits because they're on your belt and it's easy to lose.  I heard audible gasps when you said you lost three Fitbits.

Start time: 845.88
End time: 846.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know.

Start time: 846.88
End time: 848.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  People were like, oh, oh, oh.

Start time: 849.73
End time: 853.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, there's one at the San Diego Zoo.  There's an orangutan wearing it there.

Start time: 855.12
End time: 864.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was by the tiger cage.  And that's going to the insurance company.  He's eating really healthily.  This guy just eats bananas.  How can this be?

Start time: 865.21
End time: 888.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Lots of bananas.  So actually there's some, I think, sad news to start the show with.  It just broke.  This is very sad.  You all know about Diaspora, which was founded about a year ago as a Kickstarter project to compete with Facebook.  They wanted to make an open Facebook, the idea being it would be federated so anybody could run a Diaspora server.  They'd all speak together.  Nobody would own the data.  It's exactly like Google+.

Start time: 890.03
End time: 894.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you log into Diaspora and look at it, it is like a mirror image.  Google Plus looks exactly like that.

Start time: 895.24
End time: 897.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you're saying Google Plus stole it?  I'm not saying that.

Start time: 898.36
End time: 909.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think there aren't that many different ways to do a social network.  But it is Google Plus.  It works exactly the same way.  It's funny because I am a member.  I haven't used it.  I gave them $100 when I left.  Join Diaspora.  Join Diaspora, not Get Diaspora.  Let me type that right.

Start time: 909.96
End time: 916.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But yeah, it works exactly the same way as Google+.  I think there may actually be a relationship between the two.  That's why I don't want to accuse them of stealing.  That's interesting.

Start time: 917.28
End time: 969.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The kids that did this, they were all, I think, NYU students.  They went to Kickstarter to raise the money and raised a huge amount of money.  In fact, Mark Zuckerberg even gave them some money.  Wow.  Join diaspora.com.  They're just calling it the Diaspora Alpha.  The sad story is, we believe, according to All Things D, that one of the founders, I think there were four, a 21-year-old, passed away yesterday.  So, Ilja Zytomyskili, and no word on what happened, but very sad.  I did not know him.  I had not met him.  And I think there were some struggles that Diaspora was going through.  But apparently he passed away at a very young age.  Not sure exactly.  Yeah, they haven't reported the cause of death.

In fact, I'm excited because Tuesday we get the...  You said lighter and then you said fire.  Fire.  Kindle fire.  Kindle fire.  Kindle fire.  Should I say kindle fire every time?  Yes.

Well, I'll tell you where this is going to...  Yeah, you do.  You heard him.  Where this is going to be huge is my parents-in-law are the type...  They already bought the first Nook.  They don't buy any of this stuff.  But the Nook was cheap enough.  They bought it.  They would never consider paying more than $200, $300 for a tablet reader of any variety.  And now this is a whole new opening of a category to a type of people who would never buy an  iPad.  It would never occur to them to buy an iPad.  And I do think it's...  So seeing it as a reader, seeing it as, oh, it's a Kindle.

I think it'll be interesting to watch because what makes the Kindle so wonderful, what makes  the Sony Reader so wonderful, and a couple other platforms out there is E Ink, battery  life, simplicity, and focus.  None of which the Fire has.  None of which the Fire has.  None of it, yeah.  None of which any tablet has.  Right.  You know, the...  And I think it's going to be really interesting to watch that.  I think it's also going to be really interesting to watch as Android is forking.  This is like watching angry Linux developers move in seven different directions.  And I think it's going to be really interesting to watch how people react or if people even  care.

End time: 1281.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know if it's a mistake, but as long as they focus on the reading and media consumption  aspects, then they're able to position as...  Well, I'll tell you, and Tom was saying the best thing that the Nook is doing with Fards  and Noble is implying all the things that...  Oh, they've paid for one over.  Yes, this is great.

Transcript:  They came out in their press release, in their press announcement and said the Nook tablet  has Netflix.  The Nook tablet has Hulu.  The Nook tablet has all these video that you don't get in other air arenas.  They didn't lie.  They didn't say Amazon didn't have it.  Amazon has Netflix and they announced Netflix at their Kindle announcement.  They got angry birds too.  And then the Nook has Netflix hanging and the Kindle doesn't.  Kindle's in Amazon.  They got everybody thinking, well, because Amazon has an ecosystem, of course, the Kindle  Fire is just going to be Amazon.  Oh, that's interesting.  And so Barnes and Noble is the one if you want to get other things like Netflix to the  point that Amazon had to come out with a press release the next day and say, hey, why don't  we just go out there and say, hey, we've said from the very beginning we have Netflix.  That's clever.

I think people are starting to get nervous about Apple.  Apple takes 30%.  Apple owns your subscriber list.  All of these issues.  I think a lot of people...  Those are magazines.  Here comes the counterargument.  Those are actual physical magazines.  He's got magazines.  People like Norton are going to say...  Norton, initially you're going to be skeptical  because you like the paper,  but I think that ultimately this may be,  because magazine publishers realize they don't want that,  that costs them a lot of money to print.  They are going to love this  and they're going to really push this medium forward.  And most people aren't as strong as Patrick

No, we brought you some wine that we broke out.  Oh, wine will be good.  Wine, bring it up here.  John says bring up the wine.  That didn't take long.  I saw you under at 20 minutes.  I think that there's a lot of potential.  You sell 5 million units of this.  Condi Nast puts Vanity Fair on this thing.  How many subscriptions do they have to do?  100,000 to make this worthwhile?  John, you know the economics.  Probably a million.  A million, really?

Start time: 1614.98
End time: 1626.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll use as an example two magazines  that perhaps aren't in the same category  as Vanity Fair and Vogue,  The Economist and The New Yorker.  You hate those magazines.  I love them, but I love the content.  I don't love the fact that they're piling up.  On my bedside table.  So you can't throw them out?

Start time: 1627.28

Start time: 1630.57

Start time: 1633.08
End time: 1640.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you have, as a subscriber to The Economist,  access to the iPad app.  I have them on my iPad.  I know.  So you just toss them.  You can read the articles later on the iPad.  I do.

Start time: 1641.00
End time: 1643.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 1643.00
End time: 1652.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, I get The Economist  and I like having the paper  because I like just having it sitting there  on the dining room table  where I don't have to go get the iPad.  Well, you get both.  But I can also go back  and read articles in the past.

Start time: 1652.04
End time: 1661.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this is to me the strength  of the tablet platform.  And I think one of the reasons  as a magazine publisher,  I think that they would embrace this.  But maybe if the economics aren't there.  I don't think the economics are good.

Start time: 1661.04
End time: 1674.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The other thing is that, for example,  you'll go on your Economist  and you'll look up the articles  and you'll skip,  you won't be able,  you won't fling a page through it  and see all these ads.  I won't see the ads.  You're right.  Because there's a lot of ads  you're not going to see.

Start time: 1674.26
End time: 1694.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a tough,  it's a tough sell for advertisers.  It's a completely different advertising mission  for a lot of special interest magazines.  You don't have to tell me.  When you're talking about  a drumming magazine,  a guitar magazine,  a hot rod magazine,  it is enormously difficult  to go into a vendor and say,  hey, we're going to give you  a banner ad.  They're like,  okay, I know what the click through  item banner ads is.  And it's useful.  I think that's all just a symptom  of the emerging space.

Start time: 1694.08
End time: 1705.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because on the surface,  by all measures,  and we talk about this  on Framerate a lot,  digital advertising is,  ad for ad, much, much more valuable  because you can track  who watches it,  how long they look at it,  whether or not they click through.

Start time: 1706.24
End time: 1723.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You actually have the tools to do that.  And those have to be  embedded into the platform  and they have to be something  that the person paying for the advertising  believes in.  Nielsen ratings,  Consensual Hallucination,  Industry Standard for Television.  It is the biggest pile  I have seen in my adult life.  That was an amazing self-bleep out.

Transcript:  But it's enormously difficult  for a profitable platform  like television to make a transition.  And you've heard it over and over  again in the last five years.  We're trading analog dollars  for digital cents.  And if you're in a beleaguered platform  like most magazines,  Vanity Fair is an exception,  Cosmopolitan is an exception.  A lot of the big, thick books  are an exception.  If you're talking about smaller magazines,  it is an enormous bridge to golf.  You have to figure out how to  carry your existing consumer base,  which in many cases is fairly old,  into a new platform,  onto a new distribution,  and it requires even a Twitter account.  But don't you have to do that?  I don't know what I have to do.  You can also go out of business.  There's your option.

First of all, we talk about  cylinders and LPs and the rest of  it.  These are immature things.  These are immature mediums that  are essentially the same thing.  The cylinder was a bunch of grooves  and the CD was a bunch of holes.  I'll grant you that.  OK.  Magazines have been around for  so long.  It's a mature medium that cannot  disappear just based on media  theory.  It's just not going to happen.  And that's the only argument you  need, which is it's been around.  It's very handy.  It's a portable medium.  I always like to take the point  like let's switch time around.  Now, everyone's reading  magazines on their little  tablets and then somebody comes  out with this revolutionary idea  because they discovered paper  and they're printing on it.  You can take these things and  you can read it and then you  could, wow, this is so cool.  Look, I can thumb through it  and then I can throw it out  and I don't care.  Unlimited battery life.

It's interesting.  I can see them coming out  with a phone.  Maybe they do a phone.  He's saying, I'm not saying  a Kindle Fire phone would be  an antidote to Android  fragmentation.  Actually, if it's like the  Kindle Fire tablet, it would  be one of the most fragmented  Android phones of all.  But the Kindle Fire, with its  simple interface, deeply  integrated services, is  fragmentation with a point.  In other words, he's saying  this could be the best Android  phone ever.  Yeah.  It's fragmentation with love.  It's almost meaningless to  call it an Android phone.  I mean, it's got Android.

It's not getting the same  ubiquity of mobile as it has  in the desktop  We talked about the ubiquity  of HTML5 on browsers  differences in how users consume  rich content on mobile devices  scalability of developing plugins  for mobile browsers  shifting some resources from Flash  to HTML5

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, a message to life  I would actually love to get your take on this one  Because I'm not sure what I believe on this  So as you know, WikiLeaks  Big issue going on right now about trying to figure out  Who is, you know, kind of supporting WikiLeaks  An Icelandic member of parliament and former WikiLeaks volunteer  Birgitta Jonsdottir  Her Twitter account was handed over  By a U.S. judge on Thursday  Because of the release of the U.S. military helicopter friendly fire incident  Now she says, and this is what I'd like to know  Maybe John, you could comment  This is a huge blow for everybody that uses social media  We have to have the same civil rights online as we have offline  Imagine if U.S. authorities wanted to do a house search  At my home in Iceland to go through my private papers  There'd be a hell of a fight  It's absolutely unacceptable  She's tweeting on Twitter  They want to see what her Twitter account has  They didn't get the content

Start time: 5863.16
End time: 5865.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They only got the timing and who she sent the direct messages to

Start time: 5865.76
End time: 5882.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because she was using DMs  So what is...  It's a private company, they can do whatever they want  And what is the merit to her argument?  I mean, after all, isn't it kind of foolish to be using Twitter to DM stuff?  Well, I mean...  So U.S. companies, so I guess her argument is that she's an Icelandic citizen

Start time: 5883.04
End time: 5904.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Another example why you shouldn't trust U.S. companies is what it amounts to  Or any company  This seems to me, I mean, this is one of the big fears that they have  When Google says let's put Gmail  Like certain governments in Canada say  We're not going to do our Canadian provincial email using Google  It's like the U.S. government is just giving it...  It's handing it over

Start time: 5905.21
End time: 5921.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now the interesting thing is there was not a search warrant  They used a 1994 law called the Stored Communications Act  They asked for bank account details, users' names, screen names, other identities, mailing and other addresses  But no search warrant was awarded nor asked for

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like the fact that you looked over at me because you know this is one of my big beings  I know, you're a libertarian  I'm a big proponent of the Fourth Amendment  And I think it's definitely unconstitutional in that  Fourth Amendment, there's no equivocation  That it clearly says the only way you go, the government goes looking through your stuff  And of course, you know, obviously they didn't envision the Internet back in the day  But the only way the government goes through your stuff is when a judge writes a warrant for it  And that's... I got a problem with the other related stories  That's not true

Start time: 5980.35
End time: 6007.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that is... and it is true  The private company, they've got their usage license agreements  And they can have in their provision saying, like, we'll give your information to anyone  Or any government that asks for that kind of thing  That's not necessarily a constitutional issue  But the one that really drives me nuts, and this is also on the dock, is the Supreme Court's question  About whether it's okay to be, without a warrant, go into somebody's driveway inside their garage  And attach a GPS device to cars  Because the argument, of course, being like...  You don't have to go in their garage

Start time: 6009.10
End time: 6013.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Unfortunately, they actually apparently have been going into driveways and garages on private property to do it

Start time: 6014.40
End time: 6040.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, in the discussion, in the article that's in the dock, it mentions specifically inside garages  But they're saying that the expectation of privacy that you have inside your house is not the same as the expectation of privacy in the driveway  The idea being, well, attaching a GPS is pretty much the same as assigning an officer to follow you around everywhere you go  So we're just going to walk up and attach this to your car  And we don't need a warrant  It's no different than following you  It just helps us  It is, because by that logic, why not go ahead and throw one in every car in there

Start time: 6040.72
End time: 6044.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, the Supreme Court is hearing this right now, so we don't know what the court's going to do

Start time: 6045.85
End time: 6055.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because different courts have ruled differently on that one as well  Some say, you have no expectation of privacy when you're driving around, they can stick something on your car if they want  Others have said, no, attaching something to your car, that's your private property, they can't do that without a warrant

Transcript:  You know what galls me about this is that if you spot the thing and take it and just keep it, the device...  Do they send you a bill?

By the way, you cannot decide how a case is going to go from the questioning I've learned  It's fascinating to listen to these back and forths that go on in the Supreme Court  But Breyer said, if you win this case, there's nothing to prevent the police or government from monitoring 24 hours a day  Every citizen in the United States

Use eminent domain to take property to increase the tax revenues of a city in Connecticut  And somebody would basically put together a brilliant idea about taking one of the Chief's deftices' property in Vermont and turning it into a motel  Because it would increase the amount of...

Transcript:  I do think the argument is reasonable  Justice Sotomayor said, well, could you put a computer chip in somebody's overcoat?  And they said, no, you can't do that because that's going to go in their house  They say that a car parked in the...  You bumped into them?  On the street, hey, buddy, slap  Yeah, but then they might go in their house  So what they're saying is, no, no, we're just...  They're saying a car parked in the garage does not have a reasonable expectation of privacy  That we're only going to follow you where your car goes, which is essentially public thoroughfare

Transcript:  There's parallels between this and the Twitter case, right?  Because it's all about expectation of privacy  Expectation of privacy  In the Twitter case, the expectation of privacy is like, it's a direct message  I have to log in to see it, right?  And the court said, no, you gave your IP address to Twitter  And what they're asking for is that IP address and what they connected with it  And when you gave that IP address to Twitter, you made it public  Because you gave it to a third party  So you no longer have expectation of privacy anymore  Because somebody else saw it  So you should know that since Twitter has it, other people might get it as well  And the same thing here, your car's in your garage  I could have sat across the street and seen you drive your car into the garage  I can follow you around  So you should have no expectation of privacy there  Because people from the outside can see your car's in the garage  I have to say, I don't disagree with their argument

DISH Network wants to deploy its hybrid satellite network using LTE  Bringing broadband to every American within view of the DISH satellite  They want to use the 2 GHz spectrum to do this  They own that  They own it  They've written a letter to the FCC asking for permission to do this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Lightsquared wants to do a wholesale version of this  I'm not sure if DISH wants to do this wholesale or not  I hope they do because that's what we need  The biggest difference is Lightsquared's spectrum is right next to the GPS spectrum  Nobody's been using that  So the GPS industry has been bleeding over into the Lightsquared spectrum for years  And now that Lightsquared wants to use it, the GPS industry is squealing that it causes interference  It does  And it does  So Lightsquared said we'll use half of the spectrum  And then that'll make it easier for you to adapt to us using it  The nice thing about DISH is they're using spectrum that doesn't interfere with anybody  It's way up at 2 GHz  But what we need is this  We need somebody providing satellite-based LTE with Sprint on the ground doing repeaters  Which Sprint is contrary to Lightsquared, doing wholesale dumb pipes  We need a business that says we want to be the dumb pipe

Start time: 6429.82

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
