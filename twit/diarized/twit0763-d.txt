Transcript:  shelter-in-place yet like Silicon Valley is or I guess all of  California now but about a week or so ago the governor ordered all the  restaurants and bars and non-essential businesses to shut down and you know so  the only thing they're allowed to do is do curbside service you know or  takeout service for food so a lot of restaurants have just closed completely.  Others, friends of ours that has a restaurant in downtown Ann Arbor,  they're doing curbside takeout service so everybody's just trying to get through  this. All the all the car plants and parts plants are all shut down. All the  the engineers and everybody else are working from home so it's it's tough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know isn't there gonna be a baby boom? I think in nine months I have a feeling.  I think so. I think definitely so. Anyway we're thrilled to have all three of you.  For people listening the show shouldn't sound any different but for people  watching the show is gonna look a lot different. We've gone back to the old  school way of doing things. I am because we don't want to bring in a bunch of  staff. We've really gone down to a skeleton staff in the studios. About two  or three weeks ago we closed the studios to outside visitors which I'm glad I did.  I just wanted to protect our staff and then last week we decided to.  It was really kind of at the same time as California itself or I guess the seven  Bay Area counties were in the eighth. The eight Bay Area counties decided to do a  shelter-in-place order. We sent everybody home. There is some staff has to come in.  John Jamerby our studio engineer is here because he has to you know put tapes in  the machine whatever it is he does that I don't know how to do. Then we most  of the editors are working at home. I'm in my office at the studio  because I've locked the door nobody can come in here. So this is I think a  fairly safe place for me to be. I'm switching the show as we used to way  back in the cottage days nine years ago where I'm at my desk and we've got a  monitor of the three guests in it and I may be a little distracted because as  Sam just told us on the radio show this is actually was a shocker that you are  as bad a driver when you're using CarPlay or Android Auto you're actually

Start time: 515.32
End time: 589.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  worse than if you were drunk. Much worse yeah. A study that came out earlier this  week from the UK they took about 40 drivers 20 Android users 20 iPhone  users put them in a simulator and had them run through a series of tasks while  doing about a 15 minute drive and measured their reaction times and the  amount of time that their eyes were gazing down at the screen and they found  that compared to when they did a study previously with drivers you know that  had drank some alcohol and others that smoked some marijuana the results were  significantly worse. The reaction times were 53% slower when using the  Android Touch Android Auto Touch interface 57% slower when using CarPlay  Touch interface. Slower than if you were drunk? Well slower than the baseline. Oh  okay slower than if you were unimpaired. But for the drivers that were drunk it  was only 12% slower and those drinking those smoking marijuana were only 21%  slower so it was you know more than two and a half times worse than somebody

Start time: 589.84
End time: 595.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  smoking marijuana. The people are reaching down and looking at the screen  and reaching down to touch it they're taking their eyes off the road is that

Start time: 595.56
End time: 649.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  what it is? Yeah it's a combination of you know looking away from the road  looking down at the screen and this is one of the things that car makers have  started to do in the last couple of years is you know new vehicle designs  they're actually putting the screen up higher up on top of the dash so it looks  more like a freestanding tablet on top of the dash so it's closer to it's not as far away from  your line of you know from your normal line of sight when you're driving but  the other problem is you know when you're when you do have to reach out  for a touchscreen reaching your arm out to hit a touch target you know as you're  driving down the road your your arm is cantilevered out there so your finger is  naturally going to tend to move around a little bit so you have to put more  cognitive effort in to actually stabilize your finger and hit that touch  target then for example if you're using a little central controller like a BMW  iDrive type of controller or something like that on the console or just

Start time: 649.34
End time: 654.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  twisting a knob. Wow. I think they would have done the usability testing for that I mean

Start time: 654.20
End time: 683.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  why did they not know that till now? Well I think we did kind of right I mean I  remember when we talked we would go to talk to Ford back in the day when Ford  Sink was an advertiser and their whole pitch was keep your eyes on the road  your hands on the wheel talk to the system they kind of knew that it was  dangerous to touch it but but Sam you didn't tell him the worst part. If  you're if you're talking on the phone with a hands-free. Yeah even even talking

Start time: 683.36
End time: 693.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  with a hands-free phone you know it was still worse the reaction times were still  longer than if you're drinking or smoking marijuana. Just talking on the phone

Start time: 693.68
End time: 699.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  looking at the road yeah hands on the wheel just talking because you're really

Start time: 699.76
End time: 732.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  in two spaces. Yeah you can't concentrate as much on what you should be  doing which is driving. We should not be allowed to drive I swear to God. It's  always been known that even even talking to somebody riding in the car with you  yeah you know takes some of your attention away from the road so you know  and you know touchscreens are the worst possible interface to have in a car and  it's unfortunate that over the last decade we've had this transition you  know everybody's got their smartphones and everybody wants that same kind of  interface in the car but it's the worst possible interface to have in the car.

Start time: 732.86
End time: 737.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Did they do any testing about your reaction times if you are drinking alcohol

Start time: 737.90
End time: 756.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  smoking marijuana and texting? They didn't have to worry about that. When you combine all of those things together it actually gets better. It's why we got a push for self-driving cars I mean we're just terrible drivers and yet there are fewer highway deaths by a long shot than there have been in the past.

Start time: 756.52
End time: 822.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah the progress we've made over the last 50 years you know since the mid-1960s we've gone from about a  fatality rate of about six and a half between six and a half and seven  fatalities for every hundred million miles we drive to just over one so I  mean we've reduced it by by more than 75% almost 80% reduction in fatality in the  fatality rate in the last 50 years and you know so we have made tremendous  progress and you know actually you know for all all the you know yes 38,000  people a year die on the roads in the United States but you know when you  consider it used to be more used to be 50,000 it was it was a lot more than that  and you know that was when we were driving a lot less in the late 60s we  were driving about 900 billion miles or nine yeah nine hundred billion miles a  year eight eight or nine hundred billion miles a year now we're driving three  point two trillion miles a year and having fewer fatalities so we've made  tremendous progress and but there's still a long way to go yeah I think it's

Transcript:  worse if they move the cheese to right they start moving the UI around and  people don't know where to look and so now it gets worse and you have cheese in  your car move the UX around you know and then people do that organizations do that  and then you can't find stuff as though you spend more time on the head that's

Start time: 841.54
End time: 878.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  actually one of the advantages of Android Auto or CarPlay versus an OEM you  know the factory systems because those tend you know they're obviously  different from every manufacturer and at least if you're using Android Auto or  CarPlay it's consistent so if you have more than one car in your household that  you drive on a regular basis and you're using one of the smartphone projection  systems at least it's going to be the same whichever car you get into and that  you know testing that they've done versus manufacturer design systems the  Android Auto and CarPlay are better than those but it's still a lot worse than

Start time: 878.50
End time: 903.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  nothing at all Wow one of the reasons that fatalities used to be so much  higher is that distracted drivers have always existed I mean you were joking  around about cheese in the car but Leo but but in fact people eat in the car  while they're driving I've seen people read the newspaper put it on their makeup  yeah using the mirror and stuff like that I mean people are like you say we  need self-driving cars ASAP because human beings cannot be trusted for the

Start time: 904.32
End time: 922.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  machine like that yeah Porsche used to have this policy that they would not put  they would not put cup holders in their cars they for a long time they were one  of the last manufacturers to put cup holders in their cars because they  thought why would why would anybody driving a Porsche want a cup holder in

Start time: 922.86
End time: 954.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the car yeah but should be driving since they put the cup between their legs and  that's not good either so I think a cup holders the best and this is same thing  with carplay if you don't put carplay in they're gonna pick up the phone and do  it my daughter I didn't after her fourth accident I said you can't drive anymore  but she lately is needed to so I said okay but the deal is you have to put  your smartphone in the trunk before you get in the car you cannot bring it into  the cabin with you at all but I still worry about her fiddling with it right now

Transcript:  them one of the major problems I think so I just wrote go ahead I'm sorry Leo I  just wrote a three-part series on on what enterprises need to be thinking  about it with the coronavirus and it's pretty rich material but one of the  things that I one of the conclusions I came to is that it would be a huge  mistake for enterprise large organizations of any kind including  enterprises to back off on IT spending generally I mean they should be  expecting to increase IT spending simply because a lot of what we're doing now is  we're going from the from the physical to the virtual so we're spending a lot  less on meetings and travel and all that stuff and a little more on video  conferencing we're spending we need to spend a lot more on security because  the opportunity of a lifetime for cybercriminals because suddenly all of  these people are working from home over insecure networks with insecure  equipment and now is the time to get out those phishing attacks and everybody's  nervous you know the emails coming saying well here's a cure for the  coronavirus or here's your tax rebate for the coronavirus and then people are  working from home on their own personal equipment which has not been secured by  the company so I think in general companies need to be thinking about cost  containment in terms of spending more on IT and security and a lot less on

Start time: 1134.66
End time: 1158.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  everything else let me be clear too we obviously is still putting out security  patches that's one of the most important things and in fact on Twyatt we actually  covered a bunch of other things just like Mike was saying to make sure that  you are doing the right thing and you're securing the right thing make sure you  have MFAs turned on and people are using the right services especially for remote  workers because that can leave a bunch of gaps like we said your users the  weakest link so like you need to make sure that they're all secured it's funny

Transcript:  probably gonna be more of the former but I hope it's gonna be really interesting  to watch is you know with with so many people working at home now you know a  lot of companies in the past have been reluctant to let people work remotely  and I think you know with this with what's going on right now you know with  something this is the biggest mass experiment in remote working ever and if  it if it actually works out for a lot of companies I could see a lot of companies  actually making this permanent for at least some portion of their workforce  which you know if they do that that you know there's obviously a cascading  downside to that you know for a lot of the people that work in various services  to support those people people you know in restaurants and bars around downtown  areas where they where they work but you know it could also have some  significant environmental benefits because if if suddenly you know  significant portion of people that were commuting are no longer commuting that  reduces the amount of the amount of miles they have to drive pollution is  down traffic is down improves air quality yeah and it could actually end  up having more of an impact on greenhouse gas emissions and climate  change then all of the other technological things we've been trying

Transcript:  will there is a apparently Apple decided to release something I don't know there  is a new product or two we'll talk about that in just a little bit but  first a word from our friends at Mint Mobile they have done something really  really exciting really remarkable they have we've been talking about them for  a while they're in an MVNO that is they resell T-Mobile connections you get the  T-Mobile connection at a really low price as little as $15 for their  internet a month for their introductory three-month plan that's $15 for unlimited  nationwide talk and text and three gigabytes of data I actually liked it so  much I got the Mint Mobile sim put it in a phone I had it in the one plus 7T I  liked it so much I I said well I'm gonna do the year package 300 bucks 300 bucks  25 bucks a month 25 bucks a month for unlimited text unlimited nationwide talk  12 gigabytes a month it's the best deal and sell out there and I'm a T-Mobile  customer so I just exactly the same service I was paying for and a lot less  money I think this is really great they are stepping up they're giving unlimited  free unlimited data for all it started March 15th it goes through April 14th  all current and new customers if you sign up today with free unlimited high  speed data add-ons so I mentioned three gigabytes 12 gigabytes during this tough  time when we're all needing the bandwidth maybe to work at home or just  to watch movies unlimited you can go to MintMobile.com slash unlimited to learn  more about that if you're not a Mint Mobile customer now's the time they save  money by not having stores by being entirely online they pass the savings  on to you every plan comes with an unlimited nationwide talk and text  crazy fast 4G LTE it's the same LTE you'd get if you're a T-Mobile customer  you can bring your own phone they do cell phones but in most cases people can  bring their own phones you can take your phone number with you too it's yours you  can port it right over to Mint Mobile you all your contacts everything come  right over and of course if you're not a hundred percent satisfied Mint Mobile  has you covered with their seven-day money back guarantee now's the time to  get your new wireless plan for just $15 a month with their three month  introductory plan and get the plan shipped to your door free Mint Mobile  dot-com slash twit Mint Mobile dot-com slash twit cut your wireless bill to as  $15 a month I'm 25 bucks is a third what I was paying for the same exact service  and now through April 14th there's no cap no limits thank you Mint Mobile you  learn more about that at Mint Mobile dot-com slash unlimited take advantage  of our offer we're so glad Mint Mobile is on the network we thank them for  supporting the show and I encourage you to visit Mint Mobile dot-com slash  twitch show your support as well thank you Mint Mobile cartoon from Nitro ZAC  and snaggy the joy of tech Wow did you see the new iPad with a new backlit  magic keyboard and lidar scanner oh you make me so mad OMG is the faster 812 Z  bionic chip and ultra-wide camera how can you possibly care about this stuff  when the whole world is crashing in on itself and millions may die and our life  is oh we know it is over because I understand there's a crisis and we all  have to do our part to get through this but I'm still a geek and I love it when  there's some amazing new hardware you really know how to throw cold water in  a pandemic don't you so it's got lidar by the way who was it I think it was  Stacey Higginbotham who said it doesn't really have lidar at least not I'm not  so sure about that. Is it lidar? She said it's a time of flight sensor we're talking about the new iPad Pro.

Start time: 2143.50
End time: 2163.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well that's what most lidar is most the vast majority of lidar sensors are time  of flight sensors you know cuz all lidar is it's a sensor that uses laser  emitter and photo sensors to to measure distance to an object you know measure  the time it takes for the photons to bounce off and come back. Lidar

Start time: 2163.86

Start time: 2168.22
End time: 2172.34

Start time: 2172.72
End time: 2178.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  than sound right but the I don't think I'm gonna guess that the new iPad

Start time: 2178.86
End time: 2276.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  doesn't actually have a laser in there. Actually it probably does. What? It's a low  power probably a 905 nanometer laser emitter okay and okay you know what it  is there's a lot of different types of lidar you know the ones you see on the  roof of the automated vehicles. The spinning ones but they're doing 3Ds 360 degree  3D imaging. Right so those have an array of lidar emitters and it rotates around and scans as it  drives down the road so it gives you a 360 degree field of view but there's  other kinds that are you know solid state that use a MEMS mirror system like  a DLP basically to do beam steering from the from the emitter and then there's  also something called flash lidar which is a very low-cost lidar and what it  does it can use one or just a few emitters and it pulses through a  diffuser and then has just an array of photo sensors so it's you know kind of  like a camera sensor like an imaging sensor but it's tuned for the the  lidar frequency from 905 nanometers and what that does there's no moving parts  at all but because it's diffusing one emitter through the you know through  this diffuser you're spreading out the photons so you have a lot less range and  they say this this lidar sensor on the the iPad is only got about a five meter  range. Well that's pretty distant. Yeah you know and and it's fine for what it's  what it's designed for you know so it's a it's a laser emitter going through a  diffuser and then you've got a sensor set that's generating a point cloud. And

Transcript:  the idea is it's really for all by the way this is the website obviously this  was designed before the work at home orders because somebody put a lot of  work in it but what they're clearly going to use it for is augmented reality  in fact they've showed videos the guy who did the lava game for Apple arcade  that would be kind of cool you know where the carpets lava and the furnace  your kids probably play this Lou the kid and you know the furniture's your island  of sanity and you jump trying to avoid the lava well in in the hot lava game  you're in a world and you're doing that but now you can make it your living room  you hold up the iPad and you'll see the lava you'll see the furniture you're not  jumping a little man is jumping but but I don't I mean it seems gimmicky to me  who wants to hold an iPad up for hours at a time he's given he's giving developers a path

Transcript:  interesting part of this announcement besides the fact that they announced  products they can't sell in stores but I guess they'll sell I mean I bought both  I guess there are people sheeple like me who will buy it no matter what but I  thought the most interesting thing was the ad copy that basically said your  next computer is not a computer it said it's a magical piece of glass okay you  can drop the everything's magic now Apple everything so fast most PC laptops  can't catch up that's that new a 12 Z bionic chip which admittedly Apple makes  amazing silicon the problem is their silicon platform is arm not x86 they  have a little bit of a problem which is they have basically arm iOS touch and  then non touch Intel they also released a new Intel product the MacBook Air which  is easily their most popular computer their best-selling computer that has the  new 10th generation Intel core they're using the why not the you processor so  it's the mobile slower mobile part I seems to me what I see here is a very  we've wondered what is Apple's plan when it comes to arm versus Intel when it  comes to computing in general for a long time they've said the iPad is a computer  that's not a computer I think now there's a clear path because the big  announcement isn't so much that iPad Pro it's this yes it's magic this this new  magic keyboard with a trackpad on it and a cantilever design that raises it's  really an interesting design in fact I think you tweeted somebody tweeted I  think was you Lou tweeted that this is interesting comparing it to the surface

Start time: 2508.42
End time: 2533.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  because yeah it is I mean if the 201 designs been around for a while but I  think one of the biggest things is the fact that they are changing the  interactions to be a little different than let's say a surface because they're  allowing you to kind of still feel like you're touching the device rather than  you know from the touchpad so that kind of interaction user experience is almost  a game changer it might actually shift other technology companies do the same

Transcript:  thing I think yeah it's very I mean it's really interesting because I also think  it makes clearer Apple's roadmap there was a lot of talk there maybe maybe this  is gonna still happen but there's a lot of talk about oh when are they gonna  make all their computers arm-based and take advantage of their custom silicon  now I think it's a little clearer that when Steve Jobs said well people always  need to drive trucks that the x86 stuff will continue for people who need  computing video editors you know car designers probably developers but that  them I think their vision is Brownlee Marquez Brownlee and his K work flow but  there are still most people who use computers don't need that and the iPad  especially with this keyboard the trackpad the the the attractive touch  first interface might be the computer for the rest of us there's still a  problem though and this is the one that Apple's gonna have to dress head on  before they can make this vision a reality I really think they're really  now saying we're gonna have two roads we're gonna have the consumer road we're  gonna have the pro road the trucks will be I x86 I don't think they're gonna  bother with arm that was it gonna be a painful transition we'll keep doing arm  and iOS for the rest of us the problem is Apple screwed the pooch a little bit  and I think you've said this Mike Elgin with iOS apps they set a standard a bar  for the price of iOS apps 99 cents five bucks maybe maybe ten or twenty bucks  that no one's gonna develop professional apps for the iOS platform because they  there's just no money in it and that's what's missing right now the iPads  fantastic amazing processor great cameras it's got you know lidar it's  got yeah this I think this new keyboard and the trackpad solves the last little  usability issue but they still don't have the software that's right they you

Transcript:  in general and across the board you see Apple devolving into an ordinary  company it was an extraordinary company between two thousand you know whenever  jobs rejoined it launched the iPod in 2001 all the way through until his death  and since then they've been devolving back to a normal company you see still  still see them coasting on jobs over simplicity I loved how stupid this is to  call it a magical piece of glass that's what Steve Jobs called the iPad when it  was just a magical piece of glass now it's a magical piece of glass it's a  magical piece of plastic in the form of the pencil it's a magical piece of vinyl  that goes around for the keyboard and the trackpad everything's magic all the  materials are magic the recycled aluminum also magic it's really it's  really dumb what they're doing what essentially what they're doing this is  desperation you think this is a mistake I think it's done well wait a minute I  really want this iPad and the keyboard of the trackpad and all that stuff yeah

Transcript:  keyboard I use I use an iPad and I also use a pixel book so I go back and forth  depending on what I'm doing but I do my writing my main work on the iPad and I  use an Apple Bluetooth keyboard if this is a great keyboard I would love this  cube I prefer it because it's attached but but my point is that essentially  what what Steve Jobs used to enforce is there's one phone you should buy there's  one laptop you should buy he always had this this obsession with with simplicity  with singularity and now Apple's just like well it has this it has that  everything has everything and I don't really think it's reasonable to assume  that they have a very clear strategy fact is they have to keep growing revenue  from base where they are they're a trillion plus company right now and they  have to keep growing so how do they do that right now they're discounting things  to do all kinds of very unappley things meanwhile they're doing also appley  things they're kind of doing both so I think that what they're really looking I  think that they there are three things that are going to enable them to survive  in the future their car their financial services and their glasses right but  it's not clear to them exactly how they're gonna make a lot of money from  that in the meantime they're trying to they're trying to prep us for that world  they're trying to continue to serve the the faithful and things like little  problems like do does the does the iPad compete with the laptops that's that's  an issue but I don't think that's top of mind for them they're trying to sell  anything to anyone and keep selling these things until they can get to this  future where basically smartphones aren't even the main device I think  that's coming in five ten years where it's gonna be glasses and other devices  embedded systems and so on but right now they're just I really don't think they  know where they're going in the future but in the meantime they want to sell as  much of this stuff as possible and one of the hints is I mean look at how

Transcript:  know that's the big the divide is the software I think that's where they're  running short on I if you look at it the you know any other device has touched  doesn't have to be a Microsoft device is around similar pricing and you get the  full gamut of enterprise software that comes along with it so and then these  are off lineable type software right there's are not require like VDI or  anything like that you have to be online so I think that once they get closer  once they bridge that divide they will start to get more people on it and  they're trying like like they've upgraded some of their own packages to  be more efficient with the touchpad and and to make it more you know integrated  with it and that will kind of force other applications that are already on  the iPad to do that as well and so they'll start to bridge it a little bit  more but I think you're right there's some professional applications just can't  do you can't develop on the iPad you can't you know you can't do really  serious editing and video editing on the iPad you know that's only because

Windows 8 right he was Windows 8 right yeah yeah I mean he's a smart  guy drive yeah he's got his got his legacy and I think once he was able to  talk about things besides Microsoft he's become a very interesting it's certainly

End time: 4059.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that has multiple advantages you know obviously it reduces cost a lot by not  having to stock all this inventory right it's also good for quality too because  when you know if a production problem somewhere along the chain comes up you  know if you're stocking you know two three weeks worth of parts in your  assembly plant and a problem cropped up in the supplier plant you know you're  gonna have a lot of bad parts in your factory and it's gonna take a while  before you realize the problem and so you know if you're you know only  stocking a few hours worth of parts or a couple of days worth of parts then you  can find those problems and address them much more quickly before hopefully  before they get out into the field yeah is there any truth to the rumor they'll
