We've become we've become a  nation of what do you think  about this almost like there  aren't there more.  There are serious things  going on in the world and  somebody's worried that the  Christmas decorations aren't  on Starbucks red cups really  and it's not even the fact  that somebody is worried  about that because one person  might be worried about that  but that it becomes a thing  thanks to Twitter and now  it's every everywhere.

Transcript:  Yeah.  No no that's true.  That's a good point.  So that's why the New York  Times is sending this out  with each and every Sunday  Times today.  This being the cardboard  Google Cardboard even says  Google on it which is their  viewer their virtual reality  viewer and on the Times  magazine they says virtual  reality the storyteller  newest tool did anybody  watch the video.

Start time: 385.49
End time: 408.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm a little mystified to be  honest with you because so  there's the news story by the  way there's there's ads  there's an ad for Cooper and  there's a General Electric ad  among the other videos you can  watch but the story is about  the displaced which is their  cover story in the New York  Times magazine on the  displaced children of war 30  million children displaced in  their homes and these are the  story of three of them.

Start time: 409.52
End time: 416.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I can ask one question.  Yeah.  I haven't seen this.  How much should Google pay  them to put this all out.

Start time: 417.45
End time: 445.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good question.  I know I mean I figured that  GE which is branded right on  there has an ad in there and  Cooper the minis and by the  way the minis I thought at  first because there's a URL  here which brings you to the  minis ads and I thought that  was the content but it's  actually just an ad for the  minis.  So these guys I think are  paying a lot.  This is this is an incredible  revenue opportunity clearly  for for the New York Times.

Start time: 446.79
End time: 464.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it would have been  interesting to ask them the  question especially the media  writers should ask them this  question is would they have  sent out this is VR device and  we are content for free had it  been sponsored or advertised

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to keep.  Right.  Well this cardboard can't  cost that much.  I mean it's a couple of bucks  worth of paper.  It's literally cardboard.  But but you make make a good  point.  Actually this is somewhat of  an upgraded cardboard because  it has a little bit of a metal  clip here and I think what's  interesting to me.  Yeah you're right.  I think you're right.  I think it's a revenue  opportunity.  Is it the storytellers newest  tool.  I don't know.  My biggest concern is that for  a lot of people this is going  to be a very very sad story.  I mean it's not VR.  It's immersive video.  It's kind of it's kind of  depressing.  Frankly I'll be honest with you.  It immerses you in a very sad  very very sad story.  As I feel like that VR is  really more about  entertainment than it is about  news.  News.  How important is it that we be  in the middle of this video.  If it's news.  Ben what do you think about  this.  You write about this kind of

Start time: 525.70
End time: 584.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  stuff all the time I know.  Well I think it's maybe selling  the New York Times a bit short  to presume that this is they're  just doing it because they got  paid to do it.  Right.  Frankly the New York Times has  impressed me greatly over the  last six months to a year with  with a pretty active shift to  at least experimentation.  I mean we sit here and we will  praise a company like Google or  any other services company for  doing lots of experiments and  tests and seeing what works and  what doesn't.  And frankly that's how the New  York Times has been behaving  lately whether it be  everything from instant articles  whether it be the Google open  source you know fast article  thing whether it be different  aspects of their other business  model.  And so I would actually be I  agree it's a good question to  ask but I'd be inclined to  presume they were not paid but  rather trying you know I would  just give it a shot because  they've been first quite a few  things over the last few months.  They certainly understand that

Start time: 584.60
End time: 598.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  digital is the future right and  not print and if they're going  to succeed they have to succeed  in a digital world.  This is I think it's interesting.  I'm glad they did it.  I'm going to take a like a

Start time: 599.45
End time: 676.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  contrary position on this.  I'm going to say this you know  yes you know they're trying out a  lot of new things but this is  the same company which can't  bring performance to its own  app.  They can't bring rationalization  to its pricing.  It can't bring rationalization  to its log in schemes.  So instead of trying to do VR I  think fixing their you know  their current you know products  and make them more comfortable  to use for existing paying  customers like for example like  me would be a good use of their  technology chops.  And now my question is Google  and Facebook and Twitter and  every other company in tech tries  new experiments without anyone  or any clarity on what the  business model is going to be.  I am asking the question of Love  of New York Times is would they  have done this on their own time  or did they do this because they  had advertising.  I think if they did just because  of advertising they get less  credit versus if they were just  going to do it on their own.  That's more experimentation.  This is just you know a revenue  generation scheme.  Well I don't see it as a scheme.

Start time: 677.84
End time: 721.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean revenue generation that's  part of the challenge in  innovating in journalism and  digital right now is figuring out  these new revenue streams right.  I mean they can't sell enough  ads and print anymore.  The paywall only does so much.  So this is the new revenue  stream itself is an experimentation.  So I think it's really interesting.  They said hey we have the  resources to do this and by the way  GE and Google two brands that want  to be tied with innovation and  storytelling will be happy to give  us money to help support this  project.  That in itself is a really  interesting way to experiment with  new advertising models.  So I'm all for this.  I think it's great and I agree with  Ben too.  They probably would have done it  without GE helping them out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know you're Steve I'm going to  say this you're very young.  So you haven't seen this movie  play out before.  They used to do the same thing for  CD-ROMs and there was a lot of talk  about that.  Other people would underwrite those  and then they wouldn't like I can  probably still find about 50 of those  like music magazines CD-ROMs which  are hanging around my place.  But essentially what I'm saying is  that experimentation and innovation  I'm absolutely in favor of.  I just think sometimes because it is  Google is also trying to get some  attention for its VR efforts.  Let's not forget that you know they  are getting a little bit pushed aside  by the Oculus VR onslaught.  So this is a good way for Google to  get attention too.  Although to be fair you couldn't

Start time: 771.60
End time: 796.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  really bundle on Oculus with the  Sunday Times.  Well I mean I mean this is this is  cheap.  This is the only company that really  this is the only VR that could  actually be distributed with the  Sunday Times.  I don't see a lot of Google branding  on it.  There's Google on the especially GE.  It's most GE's got a much bigger  brand and then Cooper on the  magazine.  It's all about the coupe the mini or  whatever it's called.

Start time: 806.97
End time: 815.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Couldn't it be both?  This is a great opportunity to make  money and a great opportunity to tell  news stories in a new and more  immersive engaging way.  Couldn't it be both?

Start time: 815.72
End time: 932.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When it comes to the business model  actually the New York Times has gotten  a lot of clarity about it.  I mean they've they recently passed a  million digital subscribers which is  regardless of your opinion of their  their apps or their or their payment  options which I agree are very  frustrating particularly the way they  kind of obscure it.  But that's still very very  impressive.  And they had a new strategy memo that  came out about about a month ago  basically saying that they are going to  double down on on that strategy.  And I think that's actually a really  encouraging sign in that you know it's  very dangerous for any business to be  stuck in the middle and for them to be  clear that our focus is going to be on  subscriptions they want to double their  revenue there including both new  subscribers but also increasing revenue  from their current subscribers.  I like the clarity of their thinking  around that and like I said it's in line  with a lot of the other stuff they're  doing.  At the same time the trouble with  subscription business and I know this  very well is getting new subscribers.  It's getting new people.  It's it's figuring out why people should  care.  And the fact that and this actually  again I think it's very clearly an  experiment but it does fit with that.  One it's a benefit for subscribers only  so you're getting something for being a  subscriber.  Two it's something that certainly gets  attention as opportunity to attract a  new audience that's interested in a new  form of media.  And so yes I certainly agree that the  company has opportunities to improve  but I think that it's tempting to just  kind of lump all journalism institutions  in kind of the same boat.  And I think again I think that's that's  someone who's been a critic of the Times  a lot of stuff they've done.  I think over the last last few months  they've really shown an impressive  clarity of purpose when it comes to the  strategy.  And I don't think that this is and I  think in some respects if you look at it  that way this this is a better fit than  it might seem at first glance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  History is not on their side.  The hardest thing in the world is to  take an incumbent business like printing  a newspaper and moving into the digital  environment.  It helps when you have no choice.  Well they have to and at the same time I  cannot think of any examples.  I can think of so many counter examples  like Kodak where it's just even if you  saw it coming down the road at you it's  so hard to make that change without  cannibalizing your existing business.  That's the that's the excuse I would  give them for their Byzantine subscription  model and Wall Street Journal similar.  It's cheaper to get the paper and the  digital version of the Wall Street  Journal and just the digital version for  instance.  Same with the Times.  It's so bizarre but I understand why.  They have to somehow make this transition  without killing the the cash cow and it  feels like the Times of all of the of all  the journalistic entities anyway seems to  be doing that the best.

Transcript:  Look I think no one is saying that they  shouldn't experiment.  I think experimentation is good.  I think you should look at the New York  Times labs is doing interesting stuff and  you know that's experimentation just  nobody talks about this.  This one looks like a way for them to  capitalize on a hard trendy thing right  and and make some money on it.  Like I just like I would want to know  what the data says about the results of  this experiment.  How many people actually saw these things?  How many people actually you know opened  the they'll never tell you because it's

It actually interestingly and I don't  know if it's a coincidence.  Normally he throws the guy throws it on  the driveway and it gets run over and it  gets rained on.  Today's Sunday Times was nicely placed on  our porch.  I think they might have sent out a word  to all the delivery guys.

Transcript:  Maybe it's his last day on the job.  My only concern I thought was that this  is going to be people's first exposure to  VR and I'm afraid that they're going to  have an indelible impression of sadness  because it's a very sad story.  It's about three kids who are living in  war zones basically whose lives have been  devastated by war.  It's it's there's also I get this weird  there's a strange sensation because in  fact even in one of the scenes you can  see the shadow of it.  You know that there's there's one of  these weird 360 degree cameras.  There's no reporters in this story.  It's all narration over these kids just  kind of living their life.  But you know that there's this thing in  the middle of the recording this this  five thousand dollar camera or more in  the middle recording this and you kind  of get I always get this feeling with  documentaries too.  I always think about the you know the  guys out in the wilderness living on  worms except what about the 20 person  camera crew that's following him around?  And I got this strange sensation that  you know maybe if you just gave them some  some money that would be better than  just putting a camera in the middle of  the recording than just putting a  expensive camera in there and shooting  their lives.  It's almost voyeuristic.  Anyway those are just a couple of  concerns.  I think it's good that the New York  Times is trying something and it's going  to be for most people their first  experience of VR right?

There's a really cool like tour of New  York City street art.  There's a story on that.

It's actually a conference talk where  Kara Swisher and Peter Kafka in  interviewed Dean Bucquette and it was  really good about quite a few things  including the Amazon story including a  few other things.  But one of the points that was  interesting to your point Leo was about  the the print thing and for example he  talked about how the Amazon story why  did it run on a Saturday which was not  your traditional news cycle.

Start time: 1285.60

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right right and the reason was was so  that it would still be fresh when they  printed it on the front page of Sunday  paper and interesting.  Yeah and he was very honest about it.  He's like it's kind of a silly thing but  the fact of the matter is the Sunday  paper is by far biggest you know it  drives a ton of revenue and a ton of  margin.

End time: 1363.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right but I think they I think they've  calculated that if they put it on  Saturday it'll be fresh enough for their  Sunday subscribers they won't feel  they're getting old news because  apparently what happened with the nail  salon story they ran it during the week  as a series on the web and then plan to  print it on the Sunday paper but it got  more pickup than they anticipated and so  it ended up being they felt they had a  very stale story for their most  profitable customers and so that went into  the thinking of the timing of the Amazon  story which I thought was was very  interesting and it really gets at you  know the the trouble they have in this  transition that any incumbent company  has at the same time the benefit they  have is there the New York Times I mean  there you know it you don't get a  million subscribers you know by having  a harder pronounced website name I can  tell you that much.

Transcript:  Not at all I have no problems with what  they do on a day-to-day basis I think  thankfully in last one one and a half  months we have seen the return of of the  classic big publication you know stories  like which they both the Times and the  Wall Street Journal went on investigative  story you know track and came up with  like some really solid strong stories  you know everything they do from an  editorial perspective is not perfect but  most of the things they do are actually  pretty good if the Times went away I  would be actually there will be a hole  in the universe.  I agree.  Don't get me wrong on that I am only  making a point about this specific VR  related move of theirs I think this is  less reflective of their innovation and  more opportunistic you know.

Transcript:  the Amazon story there is no way the New  York Times is misreporting a story of  that magnitude you know the nail salon  story I think they they may not be  you know talking about things which  seem you know you know perfect or  realistic at times but as a publication  they just are very solid and deep and I  quite enjoy I mean I really I can't  emphasize my day would be incomplete if  the Times wasn't there.  My you know whether I wake up to read  their tech coverage probably not.  Do I wake up to read their tech  coverage probably not.  Do I wake up to read John Markov?  Yeah.  Do I wake up to read their foreign  service foreign reports?  Absolutely.  Their features?  Absolutely.  So I think from that's sorry.

Transcript:  No no but I was saying was that as a  publication both you know they and  Wall Street Journal have been doing some  really strong stories I think the  stories when they they are not you know  they're not the stories which are like  you know acceptable to a certain part of  let's say Silicon Valley the the Torino  story exposed certain you know like flaws  in in how we value and companies and how  we write about them and how we talk about  them and the fetishization of startups  and so it kind of was jarring for all of  us in in in the entire ecosystem whether  you're a commenter investor blogger  whatever it felt like whoa where did  this come from and I think that's what  big publications can do take eight nine  ten months to investigate deep you know  stories which actually need look you  know closer look I think Amazon was one  of those things I think the the third  I don't think it has anything to do with

Transcript:  it was before the show started but we  were talking about the trivialization of  story I guess it was during the show of  the stories that thanks to the you know  the drive to create links and social  media that just a vast amount of trivial  stuff that hits the front pages it's nice  to have somebody doing what Stephen  Levy calls slow news you know this the  Times did a story controversial though  it was about a guy who died alone and it  was an immensely researched a year in  the making story that only a big  organization like the Times could really  do I think agree that was a pretty move

Start time: 1730.84

Transcript:  actually sit down and go through I mean  this is I'm just turning to quite a  up end of the New York or to the New  York Times but I mean if you go through  and just consider the the incredible  volume of very high quality content that  comes out every day it's actually it's  pretty phenomenal and and again that's  what makes me so encouraged again I'm  being a bit of contrary and I think I  tend to would probably agree with Om that  this VR thing is more of a publicity  stunt than anything but but that said  my points about them having much more  clarity in their strategy and being  focused on being super highly  differentiated and doing the stuff that  only they can do and then charging  people for that I think is it's  encouraging and and it's encouraging  because we need institutions like like  the Times and again do they get  everything right no they don't but the  reality is is no newspaper has ever  gotten anything right it just so  happened they were the only source  before and so everyone kind of just  presumed it was right and yeah and  that's a that's an adjustment for them  as well to know that they're not the  only source of truth and and go to go  to go back to the Amazon thing that's  why I thought it was so great that  but could responded on medium to the to  the Amazon PR guy I mean because that's  the whole point what was so hard I think  for the Times for a very long long time  to adjust to was appreciating that news  can happen that isn't in the New York  Times and it might never be in the New  York Times and that doesn't mean it's a  small story like that whole phrase all  the news that's fit to print was was so  limiting in a way and I think they've  really moved past that in a very real  way and in a way that makes sense in an  environment where you don't have a  geographic monopoly you don't have a  moat built on distribution you  competing with everyone on the internet  and that means you do have to be focused  and you have to do what you do best and  and it's good it's good for them and  it's good for it's good for tech I mean  be prepared I bet I'm pretty sure  there's gonna be more of these sorts of  some stories coming and frankly we're  all big boys and big girls like we can  deal with it and and and as an industry  collectively should welcome it well

Transcript:  can give my defense about why I read  what I do write about particularly print  media well I'll talk about it right now  like the reason why I find right about  me is so fascinating is it's not because  I'm compete an industry although as any  human I'm sure that plays a role but  it's it's that text is perfect text  perfectly translated from analog to  digital like it no bits were lost no  exactly like text is the fundamental  structure of code and all that sort of  things I want ones and zeros but you get  I'm saying and what's interesting about  that is that meant the effects of the  internet the effects of their being zero  distribution of your ability to have  basically zero transaction costs and to  manage a huge customer base in a way  that was impossible before that  manifested itself the impacts of that  manifests itself in print way faster  than any other industry and so  immediately you had you had this very  jarring sort of disruption going on and  so one if you can understand what  happened to newspapers and what happens  when distribution the distribution  function goes away like what how does  things fall apart in interesting ways  that's actually something you start  thinking about when it comes to other  industries whether it be the  transportation industry where they be  the hotel industry where that be the  the video industry and then on the flip  side if you can start to think about  what business models might emerge from  this like how can you actually build a  business then again that might be a clue  for how you can build a business in  other industries once they've been all  sort of messed up and it's kind of the  purity of the fact that text was just  so perfectly translated which meant  experienced all these issues far before  and what else that I I find it so  fascinating to think about and write  about from a business perspective  because I think the lessons will  ultimately be broader than just you know  the future of the New York Times I think

Transcript:  is is we know exactly how far the  current Twitter experience will get you  and it will get you a reportedly 300  million monthly active users and we'll  I wonder I'm curious how big that  number actually is for people actually  you know looking at Twitter and not  bots or accidentally while you're on or  things like that and the other problem  with Twitter is the Twitter works well  as a brand advertising platform with  300 million just isn't an isn't large  enough frankly which is kind of amazing  but it's not and and 300 million is  definitely plenty big to do a nice  direct response platform but the actual  format of a feed where it's flowing by  quickly isn't great for direct response  they have a real mismatch when it comes  to their business models and they're  kind of canvas and again I generally  think moments is nice I think it's a lot  nicer if you're a sports fan because I  think the sports moments are by far the  most compelling I certainly agree it has  lots of problems but the the the fact  that it's not at all like the regular  Twitter experience is in the absence of  all other countervailing evidence a plus  in my mind I have to say I have to

Transcript:  but we owe the that home page of  Twitter with like the rotating three  clip art images yeah like for you that  was the home page of Twitter for over  three years and when I talk about this  advertising problem there being a  mismatch between the sort of advertising  products they can offer in the canvas  they can offer them on this is all  intertwined a stagnating product isn't  just a problem from a user perspective  it's a problem from a business model  perspective and frankly it it boggled  the mind it still boggles the mind how  little the product evolved over years  and and frankly just wreck it's like an  alcoholics sort of thing just  recognizing you have a problem is right  50% of the first step exactly and at  least it seems like they recognize they  have a problem they have massive issues  in overcoming that problem one the  brain drain issue is a huge problem like  why would you want to go work there or  why would you want to stay to there's  this real mismatch and you see this with  moments not to pick on Steve but but  there's the there's this on one hand  they have people who love Twitter and  never want it to change and that's their  biggest strength is they have this  built-in user base that's fanatical  about the product and on the other hand  they have four times the number of  people who have tried the product and  decide it's not for them and to get  those people back is is is massively  massively difficult independent of the  fact that anything you do to get them  back is gonna really annoy the other  group they're just in a really tough  spot and and frankly the American

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  opinions about Twitter he's right I  think my piece on Twitter which was  about all the challenges it faces is  it's like many Ford I think not only  Facebook has is very strong it also has  competition for attention from Instagram  and snapchat and a whole bunch of other  things so the task is much more  difficult for them then then most people  actually realize now on the good news  side you actually have a CEO who's comes  from the product background who is the  who was a co-founder he has the moral  authority to make tough decisions inside  the company and so I'm actually more  hopeful about Twitter making some kind  of comeback than most people and purely  based on the fact that we finally have  somebody who cares who cares about the  product who cares about the users who  cares about the experience and you know  it won't it's a it's not something which  can happen in three months or five months  this is going to happen over you know  12 months at the very least you know  there's a lot of articles people write  about Twitter it's like whether it's  decaying it's dying whatever man the one  thing I've in from the day I first covered  Twitter till today that company is knows  how to make a comeback it just keeps  coming back I didn't know how they have  the ability to to reinvent themselves  right now I think with Jack in charge  they will figure out a game plan

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  ahead I'm glad I'm said that and again  this is just an agreement fest but I  think that that's a that's exactly right  I mean you can't the whole thing about  Twitter and there's like it's a company  that's kind of a ridiculous company from  the from the from the get-go and they've  overcome so much obstacles the prime  most of them self-generated but there's  there's something meaningful to that and  and and I know like Dorsey previously has  invited this sort of Steve Jobs  comparisons but I mean there's a real  like all these sorts of like ridiculous  things are there's some grain of reality  in them and and man I hope that it ends  up being ends up being a repeat though  the only thing I would add though is we  intact way over value I think the the  impact of Twitter I mean Facebook is  responsible for 79 percent of social  referrals number two is not Twitter is  Pinterest with 16 percent and Twitter is  three percent so even though we all live  on Twitter and so we act like it's an  equivalent to Facebook when it comes to  a political campaign or any or an  advertiser and figuring out where to  focus your time it's really not even in  the conversation and that's that's the  big you know that that's a big part where  all our discussions I think tend to warp  warp the the reality of the challenge  they face what about this good that's

Start time: 3216.62

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  exactly what makes it interesting right  like all the influencers are on Twitter  they're talking to each other and that  gets amplified in other platforms  whether it is print or radio or television  or even you know other social platforms  so I think what what Twitter has is the  the all the media and all the celebrities  I think it's the best vanity platform  that is out there. Vanity is a good word  for it yeah yeah no that's it that's

Start time: 3249.76
End time: 3301.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that's that's where the value really is  I mean because if you when you when you  think about it the dispersion of  information Twitter is is much closer  to the top than Facebook and I don't  have it in front of me but there's  absolutely been studies about that the  stories that blow up like the BuzzFeed  dress story for example they did they  did a breakdown of like how the traffic  flowed and it always starts on Twitter  and and figuring out how to capture that  and and give value from that I think is  a thing but but there's something there  that's the thing there there is so  there's something there in Twitter and  and that's the biggest reason to be  encouraged more than anything is like  it we there's something and yeah and I'm  glad Jack's back I'm glad to have the  the authority there I think yeah I love  how I'm put it I'm not gonna add anymore  I think he put it well.

Transcript:  time for unicorns no the well one I  think I'm right I think actually square  is is a almost a better IPO investment  than some other companies in part  because they pivoted relatively recently  to purely focusing on SMBs so I think a  lot of their growth is actually in front  of them unlike some companies that have  their growth is entirely private yeah  but too I mean the the narrative around  this square IPO I think is in the  pricing is totally backwards this is  strong evidence that there is absolutely  not a bubble because if the whole idea  of a and I wrote this six months ago and  saying it's not like 1999 like a big  part of a bubble is euphoria and the  presumption there's always you know a  bigger fool down the road and that  prices are going up for prices sake I  mean if there was a bubble we should  expect that there this this valuation  would be even higher there to be wild  speculation about it and there's not  people are being quite rational about it  and you can argue that within a narrow  band of financing the the the growth  level that there are some evaluations  that are that are perhaps unwarranted  but that's very different than this sort  of prevailing narrative that the entire  there's structural issues that are going  to go up in in smoke and and I agree  like there's there is a business here I  think it's probably being evaluated  correctly and and oh by the way I'm  talks about value versus valuation you  look at the terms and like the fact the  valuation was always a myth and it  wasn't a myth just because all those  things are myth they are but was a myth  because the people buying in at that  six billion dollar valuation were not  really paying six billion dollars they  included lots of caveats that like if  it's priced at those price lower we get  a bigger share of stocks that guarantees  returns there's all these sorts of things  in the agreements that if you were to  actually price the value of that  optionality the reality would be that  the valuation is probably about where it  ended up being and and the the top and  this is a reminder I think for people  paying attention to this that whatever  is reported as evaluation if you don't  understand the underlying terms that go  into that valuation it is is not just a  meaningless number it's an actively  disingenuous number and that's the case  almost certainly for nearly every single  unicorn that the number is not is in a  proper accounting is not what it is and  and and frankly I mean I don't know I  just the whole narrative the whole  bubble narrative in general is very is  very frustrating to me there I think  there is issues there are things going  on but it's nothing like 1999 anyone  that even suggests that it is I'm going  to say I'm gonna pull the oms on I think  you're a little young I mean I'm not  compared to what was what was going on  back then except for the really for

Transcript:  you were talking about that article by  in the Atlantic right yeah and I read  that article my my thinking was well  when this we had the Industrial  Revolution and in the 21st century it  20th century the idea of food and how  people consume food change and fast food  chains came around right now we are once  again changing the idea of time work you  know live all those things are being  redefined because we are we are infinitely  more connected all the time so the  the restaurants will have to look  somewhat different like so to me spring  looks like a fast food chain not not a  restaurant right like except it doesn't  have a physical space where you go and  get the food the food comes to you so is  it the same I think the the old underclass  is being replaced by the new underclass  if that's what she's talking about  except you know it's the reality of how  the world is changing right I'm not I'm  not saying she's right or wrong but I do  feel that we have to recognize the fact  that the society we are changing because  because of how the on-demand behavior has  become pervasive at least in urban areas  and now if you look at cities like  Shanghai or or even San Francisco there  is much less retail space being built  right so if you want to open a restaurant  you have to pay a premium on rent which  means the food is priced at a premium so  only a certain kind of people can go to  the restaurant so there is like a  demographic you know barrier being  created around around what is the food  experience I think a lot of it we just  don't you just look at it from a very  narrow perspective without trying to  understand how the society is changing I  think how the iPhone and the smartphone  itself has changed the society's  behaviors is is like spread out it's like  on food it's on it's on how we communicate  it's on how we find you know relationships  everything is is being redefined because  we have a much more real-time you know  existence now because of the phone in our  pocket I think it is easy to dismiss you  know that I don't like this but well  this may be the model of the future not  that I would like to eat from spring  because their food does suck but I like

Transcript:  about thinking about evaluating the  impact of a product based on sort of its  knock-on effects on other on other parts  I mean I'm just mentioned rents I think  one of the most fascinating things about  AWS is you there's been this shift in  startup plan from the valley up to the  city and there's lots of reasons for that  shift consumer you know different  preferences but part of it is you don't  need to have server space in your office  you can you can start a company in a  we work office and then bump up to you  know a thousand foot square space or  whatever and grow from there whereas  before you you had to start out with  space and not to mention the whole cost  of servers and Oracle databases and all  that sort of stuff like there there's  very real I I met someone a checker  reader who works in construction I told  the story a couple times so sorry for  repeating myself for people who listen  but he works in construction and he  works in retrofitting old offices and  the biggest part of all their jobs is  retrofitting old server space like  there's all this infrastructure all this  air conditioning all this sort of stuff  and it's because of AWS and and that is  that gets that in a sort of very profound  way the impact of AWS same thing that  I'm send with the smartphone and frankly  that's why as I'm noted I think that's  why uber is such a big deal it's not  just because it's replacing the taxi  industry it's the potential to replace  the the car broadly and you replace the  car so you need less parking spaces you  know as parking spaces you can build  different kind of buildings you have  a different kind of buildings you a  different sort of foot traffic you might  get people living closer you might get  different density different different  real estate patterns like that is you  want to talk about changing the world  like that is how the world is actually  changed by some of these products and  and and yeah not that many make the cut  but the ones that do I mean the the  impact really can't be overstated we're

Transcript:  most of the books were stock to move not  stock to stay there right I think if  they have much more intelligence about  what sells and what part of Seattle  so they're going to start books which  are kind of you know in of interest to  people in in that region however like  when you look at this like it was  interesting that I would go in there's a  book author you know I listen to the  author by the book probably order it or  do something and I also check out the  new Kindle or the new Kindle fire or  the new fire TV and who knows I might  end up with one more product like I walk  out with one more product or prime  membership or something and I think that  ties you into the ecosystem more tightly  more ecosystem perhaps not the right  word the Amazon experience you're you  know experiencing the Amazon at a much  more real physical level so it actually  means you can go and trust them and  when you buy stuff from them online  which is is what probably they are going  for I mean you know why would Microsoft  open a Microsoft store they don't need  to but they have because it's all about

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  something super duper important though  that gets at why the vast majority of  talk about this has been kind of facile  it's that Amazon evaluates the Amazon is  thinking according to long-term value of  a customer like it's almost like like a  like a CPG company like why do why do  you see ads for for deodorant or for  dishwasher soap it's because once you  get in a habit of buying something right  you're gonna buy it for the rest of your  life and and actually that small  purchase magnified by buying it every  month for the rest of your life is  tremendously valuable that's why you  have you know PNG flying over themselves  to get on different platforms where they  can reach young people it's the same  sort of thing with Amazon they don't  just getting a new customer and  particularly getting a new prime  customer pays off over decades yeah and  so you you can't properly evaluate this  store or any other initiative Amazon  does unless you have visibility into  what the lifetime value of a customer is  what the churn rate is all these sorts  of things that go into calculating that  and frankly anecdotally speaking anyway  I live in Taiwan I don't even have access  to Amazon I still have Amazon Prime  membership because that that's how  phenomenal the experience is for when I  when I'm just back or whatever and and I  think lots of people who are Prime  members are know that's the case and the  way you stop thinking you just buy  stuff when you need it and man I the  value if this gets people if it gets  like that guy buying a prime membership  or gets them buying a device and getting  locked into this and the whole Amazon  video thing tied to prime and all this  sort of sorts of things I mean again I  I wouldn't be surprised if the stores  will I would bet it's losing money today  I won't be surprised if it loses money  forever if you only look at the store  but to only look at the store is to  is to not understand Amazon as a company

Transcript:  still books I wonder? Well what it's not  it's shrinking the portion of media  which is books and software and package  music stuff like that is I think 19% and  falling although it's still very  profitable but I think what's interesting  is they did start with books the first  time and they're starting books now but  I think the reasons are actually very  when they start with books the first time  is because books had a huge amount of  margin to play with frankly and they had  and it fit the whole Amazon vision you  could offer every book in the world when  a regular bookstore couldn't and books  were just a perfect fit for getting a  company like Amazon off the ground and I  think Bezos has said he would have  particular attraction to books per se  just they were the it was the perfect  thing to start with whereas here I  think what what Am said is is a really  great point like no one wants to walk  into an Amazon store I mean yeah we all  care about Amazon because we're geeks  and we're you know they some tiny  minority who uses Twitter but the the  people like going into bookstores they  like browsing they like looking around  and that makes if you're going to  enter retail to Steve's point to  deliver an experience that builds  affinity for for your company and your  brand and leads to other products and  all that sorts of things books are a  are a perfect fit for the people who  are interested in books and they're  books are a pretty compelling place to  start and it's just a happy coincidence  that it really fits the Amazon  branding and origin story as it is  let's talk about Comcast in a moment

Transcript:  mean this is this is a this is exactly  what we should have expected to happen  once net neutrality was was was banned  women I thought we had neutrality or  sorry which was enforced sorry use the  wrong word this is entirely 100%  predictable I fortunately wrote it at  the time when that Charlie was going  down I mean and and if you back up and  look at it from a if you want to  incentivize if you want to incentivize  faster and faster broadband speeds well  this is a great way to do it Comcast now  is a great incentive to get you even  faster internet because the faster net  you have the more you use the more you  download and the more they can they can  they can earn so setting aside the the  the the other issues like from a there  from a certain perspective this is this  is a good development because now they  have good incentives to improve internet  and once you removed the opportunity for  them to charge for discriminated data  then it was inevitable that this was  going to happen for one that said  there's certainly lots of issues here  for one Comcast does violate net  neutrality blatantly as does every other  provider because Comcast own data does  not count against the cap they have apps

Start time: 6140.86
End time: 6273.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that's and we're just in general just  cable television uses a tremendous  amount of data they're going over the  same wires uses a tremendous amount of  data and that that doesn't count either  so that there's certainly problems there  but the reality is is as long as you're  not going to have a regulated  environment which again has its own  problems it's not it's not it's not a  panacea by any means in its own problems  particularly around incentives that this  was this was inevitable and frankly I'm  a little I'm a little tired of in this  entire thing that we've been talking about  I'm a little tired of in this entire  debate there's a lot of people want to  have their cake and eat it too like they  they want they want private companies to  do things that aren't they want them to  give to infinitely invest in new capacity  and not discriminate data and not charge  for it I mean like I'm sorry like if you  want to have a debate should have a  debate about whether this should be a  regulated industry whether the  underlying infrastructure should be  there be competition on top of it the  best markets in the world work that way  where the the the wires themselves are a  public good and then ISPs compete on top  of that is that how it works in Taipei is  that is that your situation yeah I have  like 10 select choices for internet  access and it's all the same wires the  government owned it's a like it's it's a  it's a privatized company but but yeah  the access is is regulated so yeah no I  have a hundred I don't 300 down I have a  hundred down and I'm paying thirty  dollars a month for it so it just like  this this is an an adult sort of thing  I think that maybe this will wake people  up to being a little more serious about  it the problem in the US obviously is  the the per our earlier discussion the  political system particularly when it  comes to anything government related or  regulation or or that sort of thing is  so so extreme in a sort of anti-government  sort of attitude that this is this is an  this is an edible outcome and again all  things considered all things considered  I think it's it's a good thing actually  because I want there to be more and  faster data I'm concerned about the  people who can't afford it and that's  something that we need to have more of a  conversation about but don't you think

Start time: 6273.88

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's also kind of react not just the net  neutrality thing but a reaction to just  the growing cord cutters I mean doesn't  Comcast now have more internet only  subscribers than they do internet and TV  so this is a way to protect themselves  against that totally and they get the cap

Start time: 6288.68
End time: 6316.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  in now when most people aren't violating  it and by the time the people start  violating it well it's part of the  landscape no I mean from a pure business  perspective it's a it's a smart move by  Comcast and from and frankly from a  systematic perspective I think you can  make the case given the realities of the  US political system it's it's it's the  best of bad alternatives I'm glad we have  net neutrality but this is the trade-off  that comes with net neutrality how about

Start time: 6321.60
End time: 6482.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  got heavy there for a minute I think  there is there is another way to think  about it and this is what I've always  argued for is that if you can charge  more money for higher tiers so if you  want a hundred megabit connection  Comcast should absolutely charge more  money for it and that's how they pay for  their networks by paying like by making  more money of people who want the latest  and the greatest speeds right just like  you would Intel would make the most money  from people who wanted the latest and  greatest Pentium chips or whatever right  these days it's i7 so similarly in the  similarly ISP should be going after  that very model rather than saying yes  we are going to go for that model but  will also limit how much how much  bandwidth you can consume and then we  will charge you know companies like  Facebook and Google and Netflix more  money on top of that to bring the data  which you and I have actually paid for  to access you know to access that data  so they want to like eat their cake and  you know have it and keep it and just  just it's insane like I just think the  whole thing yeah it just is like you  know there is and they save so much  money when they offer in a network  bandwidth they don't have to deal with  you know their frequencies on their  cable are much more efficiently utilized  with much fewer overheads and much less  cost to them and so from that standpoint  I think you know they're not being fully  honest about things like how much is  their cost they never talk about their  cost they never talk about what's the  real economic model it is all shrouded  in ambiguous you know stuff which is  what this memo was all about I you know  I think look nobody's saying that you  know we shouldn't pay for higher speed  tiers I think absolutely if my ISP said  two hundred dollars or five hundred  dollars for a one gigabit connection yep  you can have it you know I want the one  gigabit connection and I will pay for it  and and so be it like I think that's how  they should be pricing and then and not  double dipping on the other side too I  think that's the problem I have with the  with the cable companies and the phone

Transcript:  as a heavy hammer to discourage cord  cutters I mean the only people who are  going to use more than 300 gigabytes are  people who are using services that  compete directly with Comcast television  business right the fundamental issue here

Start time: 6514.74
End time: 6520.81

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  broadly I just have a yes you can say  what they should do and they ought to do  I just don't have much room for their  telling businesses what they should do  because like some blogger in the internet  really wants them to do it and I put  myself in that category the the the issue  in the US is the lack of competition  and usually you do a lot of competition  by regulation but again for various  political reasons that's not really the  case in the US so given that we're in a  bad situation and so my argument is  given the crappy situation we find  ourselves in all things considered this  is a better outcome than meant then then  favoring some sorts of data over others  but they're doing both no no I mean the  actual stuff coming over the internet  is is treated non-discriminatory that's  not true it is true the issue when it  comes to coming in the back end is  Netflix has always been able to go over  the general internet stream is that net  for quality of service reasons now
