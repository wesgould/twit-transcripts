Transcript:  Let's do the twit.  Let's do the twit, baby.  This is Twit, This Week in Tech, episode 21 for September 4,  Wow, that's an amazing response.  Thank you, everybody, ladies and gentlemen.  And you probably gathered, we're not alone.  We are not alone.  We are here at the Apple Store in San Francisco,  our first live twit.  And this is really a thrill.  It's nice to have all of you here in the live audience.  And of course, the people listening all around the world  who are joining us.  And the twit's at the table today.  And let me go down the table and introduce everybody.  Of course, the lovely and talented Patrick Norton.  Patrick?  Even though there's a live audience,  the radio audience at home can't see you wave.  So you might wave verbally.  Hi, everybody.  A twit hint.  David Prager is also here.  Hey, everyone.  How you doing?  The lovely and talented Robert Heron for PC Magazine Labs.  Hello, hello.  Kevin Rose is here.  Kevin Rose brought his entourage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, brought the Revision 3 crew with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You've got Keith Harrison videotaping.  Yeah, we're going to launch this as a download, too.  This will be the first video ever of a twit.  And we were never all together before,  so we really couldn't very easily do a video.  We looked at different ways to do it.  In fact, we tried that iChat conferencing,  but it just really, we didn't have the bandwidth  to make that work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It looks like a Brady Bunch intro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It did.  Here's the story of three geeky guys.  Ladies and gentlemen, John C. Dvorak.  Hello.  He gets, say it with me, he gets no spam.  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know why this has become a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because you're the only one in North America who doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  He gets no, let's do that one more time,  because I really want some volume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're just going to use this on,  you're going to use this as a role.  It's going to be part of our music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Ashley Twitt is already recording.  He gets no spam.  Oh my god.  And now we have, I'm really pleased to say,  joining us right now, Roger McGuinn, who is, of course,  the man who is famous for the birds  and for his own solo career, 8 Miles High.  And you've heard, yeah.  And you're kind of a gadget hound, aren't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Yes, I am.  Yeah, I love it.  Love tech, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So he sent us an email, said, I want  to be in San Francisco, can I come by?  He actually brought some stuff to show.  We'll talk about that in just a little bit.  And you've known Dvorak for a few years.  About 10 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He invented this guitar.  Seriously.  What do you mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  I really did.  That's why I brought it.  Oh, it's a new invention.  It's a 7-string.  7-string, yeah.  And they have 7-string guitars, but not this configuration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, you're famous for your beautiful 12-string playing.  Is this kind of a cross between 6 and 12?

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Yes, exactly.  That's what it is.  It's got the cool G-string pair.  Like, it's like, the best part of a 12-string  is this part here, like a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's almost like a sitari kind of resonance  in the background kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Yeah, it's got a high string and a low string.  So I've got that.  And then I had a regular 6-string aside from that,  so you can bend it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  That's beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  So it gives like a bluesy thing, but you  can do the 12-string thing, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But this is a Martin.  So you not only invented it, but it's actually being manufactured.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  I had Martin make me one, and then a couple of guys  came up and said, hey, I want one, too.  So Martin decided to make a special edition of them.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's really neat.  It's called the HD7.  The HD7.  Well, it's not exactly tech, but it's pretty cool.  It's low tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  It's a gadget.  It's a wooden steel tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  As Dvorak pointed out before we got started,  there are people in the audience where they're blogging,  even as we speak.  Is that wild?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, he says now that he's not blogging live.  He's making a movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So they'll be a competitor to the official Twit video.  I want to see if I can get.  Matt, would you get me the handheld?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's also going to be a great shot of your ass, Leo.  Thank you.  I just stood right in front of the microphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  In fact, he had to do a panorama.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I noticed he panned away from my backside.  You can just remove it.  So we actually have a bit of a set up.  We also have a lot more people here that we're  going to get on mic later on.  What's your name?  I'm AJ.  AJ, what are you doing?  I'm recording you guys.  On your iSight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Yes, I am.  And then what are you going to do with that?  I'm going to share with my friends who  weren't able to make it today.  You could post it if you want.  If you want me to serve it, I'll be glad to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  All right.  All right.  Cool.  And you don't mind if that's in competition  for the Revision 3D?  It's all good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What format are you recording?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What are you recording in, AJ?  Is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's just QuickTime, yeah?

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  QuickTime recording into iMovie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So it's, yeah.  You could make 264.  It's DV.  Yeah, it's Firewire.  Do H264, whatever it wants to.  Yeah.  That's the best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's OK quality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So you know, Apple put out this invitation.  Did you get one, John, with the blue denim, the jeans,  the pocket of the jeans?  No, I don't get anything from Apple.  Biggest revolution since A Thousand Songs in Your Pocket.  They invited everybody to this thing Wednesday?  Yeah, yeah, I'm going.  Well, I'm going too.  But do you think that'll be a surprise?  Because an analyst, like the next day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, you know, we should talk about that here on the show.  We've got all these brainiacs here,  and maybe some gossip mongers out there.  And maybe somebody knows.  Well, because I talked to Markov the other day about it.  And he says that everyone's still trying  to guess what they're up to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  John Markov from the New York Times.  Well, he doesn't know.  But this analyst I can't remember,  is Morgan Stanley or whatever.  He said, oh no, Singular's going to do the sell the Motorola  phone.  It'll be the iTunes phone.  That's kind of boring.  It is boring.  It doesn't sound like as big an announcement  as the original iPod.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I want the video iPod.  Who wants a video iPod?  How many of you think it's a video iPod?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Definitely one.  Yeah.  Well, doesn't Steve say that video iPods are bad?  Isn't it jobs?  Yeah, that's what he says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because right now, he's milking it with this overpriced iPod.  It's going to change his mind.  So he figures, well, you know, until the sales start  to flop a little bit, then he'll jack into a new one.  It changes his mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Can we say this stuff in the Apple store?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They can throw us out at any time.  Actually, did I say overpriced?  I meant considering what the prestige aspect about it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  It's probably the coolest.  It's a thing of beauty.  It's a thing of beauty.  It's a work of art.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John's not worried about being thrown out.  He's worried about getting into the horde of angry Apple fans  between him and the front door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Hey, move your microphone a little bit closer to your mouth  there, because you're not as loud as the rest of us.  Roger has pulled out his iPod.  He's whipped out your iPod.  How many of you have iPods?  They're whipping out their iPods.  There's a mini.  There's a regular iPod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have four, but they're all at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You see, maybe Apple's going to announce a counter-suit  to Creative, Creative suing Apple for patenting  their interface.  Apple tried to patent the interface in 2002.  It hadn't gone through yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that patent thing has just nested menus.  And Creative got their first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Here's an interesting thing.  Because a patent lawyer sent me an email  after we talked about it.  Because remember, we said Microsoft got their first  and patented it.  And this guy said, first of all, nobody got there.  No patents have been approved.  So nobody has the rights.  And he says, it's not exactly what anybody's been saying.  Of course, I don't have the email in front of me,  so I can't.  But Creative is a real patent.  I mean, obviously, they're pursuing it.  So they have a patent.  And they're suing Apple.  John's fascinated by the iPod interface.  Have you ever seen that before, John?  No.  It's pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  It's a beautiful thing, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's in color.  It's in color.  This one is, yeah.  If the screen was bigger, it could be video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Creative's got problems of its own, though.  Something like 10,000 Neons to Asia, 4,000?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  4,000 units to Japan with a worm on the install software.  They put a Windows worm on the software.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That sucks.  Scan disks.  What?  So they recall them all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nobody seems to be following up on that.  Nobody's heard anything from Creative about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, it's just Asia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, on one thing, it's horrible  that somebody's shipping software, an install disk,  a CD with a worm on it.  But the flip side is 4,000 CDs for installing  a Creative product that's not particularly popular anywhere.  The Neon.  Followed by the fact that Windows XP is getting ransacked  on a daily basis.  Anytime you go online, it's like, yeah, big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Keith, I hope you're getting this Roger McGuinn showing  John Dvorak how to use an iPod.  That's a moment in history.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey.  So another story.  I think we've lost all interest in this one.  Have we?  Is there anything more to say?  Creative suing Apple?  I mean, is that a big story?  Is there something to say there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, it's interesting.  It's kind of there's so many lawsuits going around  the portable interfaces right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, there's Microsoft in one direction,  Apple in another direction.  Creative's got, I mean, ironically,  Creative, which has like the ugliest interface on the planet,  may have gotten the nesting menus or however you want  to categorize it patent first.  So they're going to sue them.  So it's going to be another long, drawn out legal court  battle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  See, we talked about this earlier.  I said Microsoft will never sue Apple  because they each have patents in their back pocket that  could cause a shooting war back and forth.  But what has Creative got to lose?  I mean, are they not kind of out of the business practice?  They can't sell their stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they're actually the second largest provider  of portable media devices or MP3 players after Apple right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I just saw a story saying they're  going to start pushing sound cards because they're giving up  on the MP3 market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I was at a table with the CEO two weeks ago.  He says he's going to keep doing it.  Yeah, the CEO seems to have a very different opinion.  And in terms of sheer volume, they're still turning over  the pretty much the largest, or from what I've seen,  they're the second largest provider of MP3 players  after Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, but I mean, Apple's 80%.  So second largest doesn't mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah, but that's like saying AMD is a joke.  You know, if you can get 10% of an $18 billion market,  that's still a fair amount of change, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think the microprocessor market's  a little bigger than the.  I'm not arguing that it is.  I can.  I can argue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, is it?  I guess it is.  Yeah, because even if iPod has to have a microprocessor,  by definition, it would be a bigger market.  The iPod Plus market.  AMD is sued to Intel now.  Intel's saying they're just a bunch of cry babies.  Did you see that Intel release this week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's a lot of things going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, OK, let's talk about this because we never really  talked about this Intel AMD thing.  Is this a case of the time-honored tradition  of if you can't succeed in the marketplace, sue?  And that's what creative is doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If somebody sees somebody that they perceive  are benefiting from illegal activities  from their perspective.  They should sue.  They should sue.  It's like if you somebody shot a friend of yours  and the police department don't want to do anything about it,  you can always sue for wrongful death.  I mean, there are ways of suing people  for doing wrong things.  Now, who's right and who's wrong on the thing?  The courts have to decide.  But it wasn't thrown out of court.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, that's right.  It wasn't.  But did you read what Intel said?  I don't have it in front of me, but Intel  was whining and moaning saying, oh, it's.  Right here, I believe.  Kevin's doing Dvorak's research.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Kevin's got this thing down.  Like everything you can bring up,  Kevin's got a tab for it on Firefox,  and he just pops right to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Except for that story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't think you sent that one around, Leo, did you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I forgot to send that one around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It sounds more like, it sounds in this case,  more like Intel's doing the whining.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, you're right.  I'm saying, they said there's no merit to it.  You think that AMD is rightfully complaining  that Intel is, but it's the same thing  Microsoft was doing there, saying,  we'll give you discounts if you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I recommend people go to the AMD site,  or you can go to dvorak.org slash blog.  And you'll find a link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I recommend.  He has a link to intel.com there,  if you can't remember that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hey, you know, you'd be surprised.  So anyway, you should go to the AMD site,  and then click on the complaint, and read it for yourself.  And you make your own decisions.  It's very entertaining reading.  I've read a lot of legal documents in my day,  but this is the most fun one I've ever run into.  It has merit, you think?  It's hilarious.  I never said that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It gives you very careful not to say things like that.  I'm objective.  He's a journalist, ladies and gentlemen.  You got to, yes, Patrick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Outpost Crystal or the CNET Google debacle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, you know, I kind of want, we didn't talk about the CNET  Google thing when it happened.  It's now, what, six weeks old.  But I thought John might have something to say about this.  You heard what happened, of course, at CNET,  wrote a story, reporter was writing a story on privacy  issues with Google.  And she looked up Eric Schmidt, the Google CEO,  and using stuff that she found on Google,  wrote an article saying, look, even Eric Schmidt,  the CEO of Google, this stuff.  And Google hit the roof.  In fact, they cut off CNET.  They said, we're not going to talk to you anymore for a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, you know, it seems to me that anyone  can do that any time they want to.  They don't have to talk to you.  But so I don't think that's.  But it's whiny.  That's not.  It's a little wimpy.  That was Eric Schmidt's getting a little sensitive now  that he's a billionaire.  He's acting up.  A lot of people do.  But it seems to me, as long as they haven't really  messed with CNET's links on Google, in other words,  that would be bad.  So this is just a pissing contest.  Who cares?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, the thing about the information in Eric Schmidt's,  it's all something that would be available  in any public filing.  Exactly.  It was on Google.  All that information is public.  It's not even that it was that private.  What I've heard from some people who  say work at CNET in certain departments  was that Google was upset that CNET wrongfully accused them  of using desktop search to catalog  what was on people's desktops.  And send it back to their super secret Google servers  where all the secret information is kept.  I mean, the fundamental question is,  and it comes back to an incident.  We had here on Twitter last Saturday night was,  how exactly do you guarantee privacy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Not that I would ever whine about somebody revealing  something that was public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the point being is, our complete BitTorrent system  has been redirected because our feed burner system has been  redirected because you felt that they revealed information  that shouldn't be public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right.  They said we had 41,000 subscribers.  I think there's more people in this room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the issue with Google is that they're  using their size and power to try to muscle CNET.  They're trying to send them in there to be saying, hey, look,  if you mess with us, meeting other media organizations,  if you try to report us in a way we might not like,  we're big enough and important enough  that if we don't talk to you, you might care about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, that's why I'm surprised John's not  leaping to CNET's defense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is how the entire music industry is run.  If you work for a music paper, if you  don't cover all the horrible little bands  that nobody cares about, especially the ones that  are total marketing fabrication, you  will not get an interview with the larger bands  unless you're maybe Rolling Stone.  I mean, that's just the way it's done in other industries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, there's a precedent.  I mean, you go downstairs and find a Wiley and Sons book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, here's one other thing you have to consider.  CNET's a news outlet.  If they wanted to, which is what I think they should do,  if they find this to be a problem,  why don't they go after Google, start investigating  the company, writing a lot of negative stories.  That always helps.  I mean, there's ways of doing this without whining to us.  I'm not working for CNET.  Why should I be defending them?  They can't take care of themselves or bigger companies  than I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The reason this came up is the New York Times op-ed pages  did, in fact, just publish an editorial piece saying,  it's shameful what Google's doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, it's so shameful that the New York Times does it.  Who are they kidding?  Do they?  Embargo people?  If you don't ask the right questions at a big press  conference, you'll never get invited back.  I mean, Apple's the same way.  Why do you think I don't get invited to these things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  At least CNET knows why they can't give phone calls back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  True.  Besides that, you can always have a stringer go do a story  and then file it with CNET.  You can always circumvent the system.  You don't have to say, I'm with CNET.  You could be an independent guy.  And they can hire freelancers to do this kind of work.  If they want to get a story out of Google, it's not a big deal.  Anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think that pretty much says it all.  Anything on your mind right now, Kevin Rose?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Linspire launches 5.0 giveaway.  They're going to give it away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Now, wasn't that because somebody else, FreeSpire?  Somebody did this FreeSpire that was a Linspire distro that  was going to be free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They've been doing this for a while, though.  They've been giving coupon codes so you can get it  for a couple days.  They're saying just for a few days, they're  going to be giving it away.  But who cares?  I think Linspire is the worst Linux operating system out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Somebody sent me an email saying, quick, you  can get Linspire for free.  I was like, that's terrible.  What do you use?  I get SUSE for free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I get Mandark for free.  I would rather prefer using a Linux distro that you don't  have to pay for.  Debian?  Like Debian?  Well, it's based on Debian.  Would you like the best?  Debian.  You do?  Debian's for advanced users.  Well, the package management is pretty much the nice part.  Apptget and all that is wonderful.  It's really easy to update applications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Gen 2 is similar.  It uses the same kind of thing.  Do you use anything but Windows, Roger?

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  I use Synoptics, like the STD.  I love those live distros.  They're really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And why is that?  Because you don't want to bother installing it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  I don't want to take up the hard drive on my dedicated other.  Because I'm recording and I've got a lot of tracks on hard  drive and I don't want to mess with it.  So I'll just get into Linux.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He actually goes on the road with a laptop and does live  recordings with these expensive microphones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Tell us about this mic.  He's got a mic.  This is a Samsung.  It's called a C01U.  Not Samsung.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Samsung, like the guy who lost his hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Like Samsung.  Samsung is a music.  They sell hardware, music like instruments and stuff like  So they're well known?  Yeah, it's Sam Ash.  It's Sam Ash.  Oh, Sam Ash.  Right.  And this is their proprietary brand.  And so it's a C01U.  It's a USB studio mic.  It's a, I think it's about a 19 millimeter large diaphragm  condenser mic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So it would be very good for voice.  Yeah, it's great for voice and musical instruments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Right, like acoustic instruments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How much does it cost to go for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  I don't know.  He's like you, Dvorak.  He doesn't buy this stuff.  It's a gimme.  But what's neat is USB.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  At least I have a ballpark figure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  It's probably like under 200 bucks.  Really?  Yeah, it's like 199.  What's the model again?  It's a C01U.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think a lot of podcasters, that would be probably a very good.  Oh, they need it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  It's ideal for podcasters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Most podcasters do a crappy job.  Audio is a good problem.  They don't have good microphones.  It's about 80 bucks.  And this is so simple.  It's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Samsung C01U.  80 bucks.  It's 80 bucks?  It's about 80 bucks.  Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  80 bucks on Frugal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right, that's great.  Now, does it have a mount?  I mean, it looks like the USB is plugging into the bottom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a mount here that's on screws.  So you could put it on a microphone stand.  It goes on a mic stand, right?  I just didn't bring the mic stand.  It didn't fit in my bag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Actually, for all this publicity,  we should be getting a bunch of free mics  for all the twitcasters here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  I think it'd be a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think so.  Yeah, now that I've spent.  I'll look into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We just bought one, two, three, four, five Sennheiser headset  mics.  And so we don't need them now.  But thanks.  Thanks anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But this could be handy for other things.  No, we could use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  And also, I just wanted to say I'm  recording this on Audacity, which  is a cross-platform free multitrack program.  It's a wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We were talking, because I use right now what  I'm recording this on, for instance,  is Auditions from Adobe, which is a proprietary $300 program  for Windows only.  Audacity is Windows, Mac, Linux, and it's absolutely free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  It's great, yeah.  Do you find them comparable?  Well, no, I think there are probably more features  on Adobe Audition or Pro Tools or the ones that  cost hundreds of dollars.  For the price, you can't beat this.  I mean, it's amazing.  And it's also great if you want to record something on a Mac  and give it to somebody on Linux or a Windows box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You said that you recorded an album on Adobe Audition  in a laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  I did.  Dell gave me a complimentary laptop  to play with, an 8200 Inspiron.  And I used Adobe Audition to record my last CD, which  is called Limited Edition.  And it's available on Amazon.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So you're not working for record companies anymore.  You're doing your own thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  No, I became a record company.  I bought a book on how to become a record company.  And it was pretty simple.  Because basically, when you have a record company,  the only thing they're good for is promotion.  And they are great at that.  They're wonderful for promotion.  They can get you on Leno and Letterman and all that.  But they take all the money.  Yes.  So you get the publicity, and they get the money.  But you get nothing else.  I'd rather have the money.  Thanks.  You're not that bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He gets to screw himself.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  I get to take myself out to dinner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Charge it to myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Camilla and I go out to dinner and go,  the record company's paying for this.  Isn't this great?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We love it.  Do you think more artists will kind of move in this direction?  I mean, I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Now that the equipment is getting affordable for everybody.  I mean, anybody can buy a Pro Tools or an Adobe Edition  set up and record an album now.  And you don't need to.  See, the thing was before you had to sell your soul  to the company store to get the money to record,  because it cost $1,000 a day to do it.  Now it costs nothing a day.  So it levels the playing field for artists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's really cool.  Nor do you need them for distribution anymore, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Not really.  Because right, you've got Amazon.com.  I mean, that's a perfect international distribution  system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How hard is it to get yourself on iTunes or Napster,

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  or services like this?  I side with, I'm not sure what the threshold is,  but it was easy for me to get into it.  I got sort of a one stop thing that got me on iTunes  and all the other ones, eMusic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So it was.  It helps to be a brand name artist.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  It helps if you get some name recognition.  Yeah.  I'm not sure how easy it would be for just coming up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you used a third party service?

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  For what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To get onto iTunes, or did you deal with Apple directly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  I did not go to Apple directly.  I went with eMusic first.  eMusic is great.  Are they still around?  Do they?  Yeah, I believe so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, that's a neat idea.  And that's what Michael Rogers did before Lenspire,  was mp3.com.  And I mean, all of those, that's what we need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, mp3.com is part of CNET now.  eMusic, it's free.  And it's not free, but it's actually  It's a good deal.  It's free music, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Consistent rumors that at some point,  Apple is going to do this with iTunes.  They're going to make some channel in GarageBand  that you push a button and you sell your stuff on iTunes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  That would be cool, yeah.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Would that be the kind of thing?  It wouldn't probably be something you'd need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  I've already gone at another level  where we sent it to a pressing plant.  You've got actual CDs.  Real CDs and sell them at gigs and online.  So I'm not sure how long people are going to want them.  Although this next project we're doing  is something that people will want,  because it's got a 40 page colored booklet  and a lot of information that you can't really  get by downloading.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's the one thing I miss.  I used to sit and we would, you know.  Look at the album cover.  Look at the album cover.  I have one of your albums you have covered,  kindly autographed on the wall.  Yeah.  Yeah, John brought it back for me.  And that was really great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  I saw it on, I actually had a net cam in your office  at one time and I saw it on the wall and went,  that's pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, I think it's pretty cool too.  So you think that the days of the record companies  are numbered or do you think that they still have a place?

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Well, they still have a place, but their place  is not what it used to be.  Because they can't really own you as easily.  Because artists can afford to record their own stuff now  and distribute it.  But there's still a place for them.  I know a kid who just signed with a record label  and he's got a band and he's going to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Did you make money off the old records?

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  You know, the deals back in the 60s were really bad.  I think it's, for my personal take on a Bird's album,  it's something like 0.0003 cents.  Sounds like my book deals.  For album, right.  But I have to say, and I can't bash the record company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, but the difference is Roger actually  wrote the music, so that's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  But we've made subsequent deals and they've  done a lot of reissues.  So I can't bash the record companies.  They do pay royalties.  Subsequently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You get a fat ass cap check every month, don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  I'm BMI.  Oh, BMI.  Camilla's ass cap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You just wanted to say fat ass cap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Yeah, you just like that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh, don't do that.  But you do get a fat check.  BMI.  BMI?

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  BMI's good, yeah.  BMI's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I've been trying to get for years,  trying to find out what this check amount is.  He's trying to find out what I'm worth for years.  I've never been able to get that number.  I don't like to discuss that.  Because I think all these guys make BMI or ass cap.  Now, what would you say?  Ass cap doesn't give you a royalty?

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  I'm not with ass cap.  Camilla's with ass cap and I'm with BMI.  And we write songs together, my wife, Camilla.  Yeah, I know.  And sometimes she gets more than I do on the same song,  which I can't figure out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But she comes from ass cap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  She gets more on ass cap than I get on BMI.  But we told that to BMI and then I got a big fat check from them.  So I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  In other words, they're just making this up as they go along.  It's a slush fund.  Well, give him more.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  For people out there who want to know,  artists are paid based on radio play and a bunch of other things.  Well, radio stations have to pay into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Not artists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  People who own the publishing rights.  And that's kind of a big.  Because I once, we had to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Frank Sinatra.  So when you're listening to free music on the radio,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  you are.  Somebody's paying.  The money gets split out.  But not to the performer.  Mysterious way.  Not to the performer.  Yeah, but it's mysterious.  That's why I've been trying to get this number for him.  Oh, yeah, that's why.  No, it is why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So Frank Sinatra never made any royalty money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Well, all his life he tried to get performance royalties  and he never pulled it off.  No kidding.  That's kind of sad.  I'm sure he made money, but he didn't make it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I remember we had the captain of the Captain and Seneal  on the screensavers once.  That was the best we could aspire to now that we've met you.  I think we don't have to go that way.  But I asked him, well, you mind people stealing your music?  He said, I couldn't care less.  Neil Sadaka gets all the money anyway.  So it doesn't cost him.  Yeah, Darryl Dragon.  Darryl Dragon.  He's a producer now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Yeah, so that's the thing.  I went to the Senate and they asked me about MP3s.  It was the Senate Judiciary Committee.  Is there an upside to downloading?  And I said, downloading is not bad for artists.  It's bad for record companies.  I have no problem with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But they try to pass the whole thing.  They try to make it look like you're hurting the artists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what bugged me.  That they were saying the poor artist isn't getting the royalties.  They were never getting the royalties.  So it was about them not getting the royalties.  How can we screw the artist if you screw them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, right.  We're busy screwing the artists.  Stop getting in our way.  Well, would you tell people who, I mean, there are a lot of people  listening who download music that they shouldn't download from illegal music?

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Well, you know, I took that side and I got sued by somebody for,  you know, like saying that, like it's cool to download.  So I'm really, you know, I have to be careful.  Let's not say anything.  Yeah, we don't want to get sued.  Personally, it doesn't hurt me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right. Yeah.  Or Darryl Dragon. Yeah.  Yeah. So there's two.  But there's a lot of people like Janice Ian who have been very outspoken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  She's on the side of that. Yeah.  And quite a few other artists are sitting next to me was was Lars from.  Lars Ulrich, who was the other side.  He was on the other side. I don't think he got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I just don't think I agree with that.  I don't think he did either.  And the other thing is, you know, these guys still can't face the reality  that during the heyday of Napster, the record sales were actually increasing  because I still believe to this.  I'll never not believe this because I've seen it happen to me.  When you were on Napster, you could see you'd find some guy  who had a song that you wanted and then you check out his collection  and you'd see he has your taste.  And then you'd see, what's this?  I've never heard of this group.  You check it out and you say, wow, these guys are great.  And you'd go buy the album or my wife, for example, never not doesn't buy CDs.  And even if, you know,  and then it seems to me that the latest thing they want to do is kill off iTunes  by, you know, these guys are now dicking with Apple to tell them, well, you know,  maybe we should have a variable rate structure.  Let's charge a buck and a half.  You know, some of the newer songs should be more expensive.  I'm thinking the newer songs should be more.  Old songs should be more expensive than new songs.  They should be pushing them out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, actually, I don't mind if they charge a buck fifty for Britney Spears.  As long as I can. Seriously, as long as I can.  And that actually makes maybe that structure does make sense.  Well, if it makes sense for this record company to let them have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So they can screw Apple out of this lucrative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But if I could buy the Temptations for 30 cents a record,  I don't care that I can't buy Britney Spears for, you know, that it will cost me a buck fifty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Do you buy that Apple iTunes is losing money on selling music?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's a lot of actually there's a lot of analysts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You know why I buy it?  And actually, I won't say where I got this from, but it's somebody we know.  The problem that people don't think about is, yeah, they get the 60 30 split, right?  But but it's not even that the bandwidth.  They pay a lot of money to Akamai for the download bandwidth.  And there's a hidden cause that nobody takes into account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let me I just did a call for PC magazine.  I should mention that where I discussed this Apple iTunes R.I.A.A. issue.  And I believe that the R.I.A.A.  started to screw with Apple, not because of the money or anything else.  I think it has to do with the fact that all of a sudden,  because when they began iTunes, it was like, oh, there's a lark, you know,  I was going to sell stuff on who cares.  And, you know, if nothing else, we'll get a check in the mail.  Then they started to realize that, hey, wait a minute,  there's an awful lot of songs going through this Apple system.  And now we have a third party that we don't control.  That's right. Accounting for numbers.  They can bring out numbers and say, well, it looks like this is a group sold this  many, sold that many.  And meanwhile, the groups are getting screwed out of their royalties  by these crazy bookkeeping schemes that both publishing companies  and record companies employ to make it look like you're not making any money.  They got some tricks. They got all kinds of cool tricks.  But now with third parties, with independent numbers that can be  just kicked out of a computer like that, their record companies are going,  oh, my God, we're going to be found out.  We've got to kill this now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Didn't didn't Sony just get busted for Paola like a month ago?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, they got all this. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There was a big. But they say that hasn't happened since the 50s.  Apparently it's happening all the time.  Yeah, probably. Yeah. They haven't been busted since the 50s.  Yeah. Big record companies come to me all the time saying,  would you play our songs on Twitter?  But I always say no, not not one, not not yet.  Anyway, you guys have any other stories you're excited about?  All the old guys are on this side of the table.  We should talk to the young sitting here in the Apple store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Apparently a couple of days ago, I wasn't privy to a couple of days.  You could buy Mac mini and try it out.  What happened to that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The one day Mac mini test drive, they pulled it out.  They pulled out the plug in 24 hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it because too many people were doing it or because they were worried?  And I'm guessing it's because too many people are doing.  That's what I was thinking.  And maybe they couldn't keep up or is it because they're not?  They wouldn't know what customers say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I come in, I get this like bait.  And I come in there, all the Mac minis have been.  They're all gone.  For I'd be annoyed and I would maybe lose.  They might lose a sale or something.  And I could see where you have to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Raises a couple of questions.  First of all, why they did it.  Do they are many sales slowing down and they feel like they need to prod them?  Or what?  First, why did they think of the idea?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think there's just a lot of people that are sitting there.  You know, they have the extra money.  They're not sure if they quite want to buy it.  When you throw out the 30 day return, why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's a good promotion because how many people are ever going to return it?  Nobody returns these things.  It's a cool box.  It's really cool.  I mean, so it's a sensible promotion.  I mean, people have been doing this for years.  You have free money back guarantee.  Nobody ever takes a money back guarantee.  So it just gives you the security.  Well, I'll buy it.  And if I don't like it, at least I can always take it back.  And very few people I'm sure do.  Do you think, I mean, it was too soon to have abuse.  It couldn't have been that somebody was abusing.  It was only 24 hours.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It got dug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It got dug.  That's what happened.  AJ says it got dug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It did get dug.  Yeah, it was on the home page.  A lot of people were buying them.  You think so?  Well, I mean, not all from dig.  But there was definitely a lot of interest.  I saw it was picked up all over the place, all these different blogs.  And I mean, a ton of people were hitting that site, you know, I'm sure,  buying the minis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So it's not going to be a close out item, though, is it?  Where they're just trying to get rid of them for a new item that's coming out?  Well, I wonder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Look, they said they were going to have it.  The Intel minis would be the first.  And they would have them by mid 2006.  My prediction is they'll have it by January for Macworld Expo  and surprise everybody, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Is that going to be 64-bit?  Well, that's the problem.  It's 32-bit.  They're moving backwards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But not that anybody needed 64-bit particularly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Should be a Centrino processor on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That would be a good choice for that, wouldn't it?  A low-power Centrino.  It should be a Pentium-M processor.  Yeah, because it's very low heat.  Simple choice for them.  They don't need the Yona.  They don't need anything more.  Well, they don't want to use Centrino.  Not Celeron, Centrino.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, Centrino.  That's a Wi-Fi chip.  Yeah, that's why I backed away.  They've got to cut just a closed deal with Broadcom.  They're not going to switch to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It wouldn't be Centrino.  You're right.  It would be a Pentium-M.  The Pentium-M.  Well, that would be a good product.  I would buy that.  So you think that that's what happened?  Well, no, because they want to get these.  Maybe they cleared them all out already.  Yeah, maybe they set aside $100,000.  That's very low.  Are there any Mac Minis here?  Has anybody looked to see if they've got Mac Minis?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Someone run downstairs.  Count the Mac Minis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Bring us all the Mac Minis.  Are you out of Mac Minis downstairs?  They've got Mac Minis down here.  I guess that throws that one out the door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they're going to know in 30 days what percentage of the  people that decided to do the trial got into that.  Nobody returns those.  I have to bet you there's a vast majority of them.  The only time people return them is where they go to Best Buy

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  and they buy a product.  I used to know somebody who would buy shoes at Nordstrom,  and then she'd tape the bottom of them so they wouldn't get  dirty and then bring them back after the  prom the next day.  I mean, there are people who do that with Best Buy, right?  They buy a product.  I do that sometimes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Buy a DV camera.  A DV camera and shoot the wedding and bring it back?  Yeah.  There are a lot of TVs sold right before the Super Bowl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It works.  Nobody would do that with a Mini.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I mean, there's no reason you need a Mini for a couple of weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it sounds like a good way to sell Mac Minis then.  Well, that's what I'm thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think it's a good promotion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So why did they kill it?  It's also the most affordable Mac there is.  You're given a really easy way to try it out.  That all makes sense.  For promotion.  But the reason they probably killed it was just simply to  supply the man.  And like John mentioned, just simply having high-rate  customers show up looking for the deal and it's not there.  But, no, of course you get it here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's kind of a weird thing.  You don't expect a big retailer like Apple to do something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe Steve didn't sign off before it went live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I keep expecting Steve to show up.  He's gonna say, what are you doing here?  He just took off.  He just peeked around the corner.  Oh my God.  There's media.  All right.  Well, that's it.  Okay.  Any other issues you guys?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Text America has a couple of really cool sites about Katrina.  Let's talk about Katrina a little bit.  They came out with SafeKatrina.com and MissingKatrina.com on Text America.  They actually have people down there taking pictures with cell phones and uploading them.  They actually go to where there's internet connectivity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I went right away to Text America because I thought, well, there'll be a lot of pictures,  but then I realized there's no cell signal.  How are they getting these things out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I talked to Chris, who's the founder of Text America today, and he said that they have  400 pictures that they've taken of people that are safe and they're going to be posting  them.  They're actually driving to where there's internet connectivity and then uploading the  pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And then, you know, the symbol has offered free Wi-Fi if you can get, but there's no  power.  They're saying now two months before the powers are stored in New Orleans, two months, 80  days before it's pumped out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And who was the person who sent out the press release about WiMAX being a way to save people?  Somebody did that?  Well, this was like somebody sent out a news story.  We could get you a signal.  If there was WiMAX, people would have internet in New Orleans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  At least those who haven't lost their battery yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah.  And that's like the person who's saying WiMAX is going to make internet all across Africa.  It's like, well, we need electricity first and computers.  More hamsters.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So I know we have a lot of listeners, by the way, in that area, in the whole Gulf area.  And so our prayers and thoughts go out to you if you're listening at all.  I mean, tons of people listening down there.  It was really kind of neat to see how quickly the net responded.  I was looking at the Red Cross page.  Every time you went back, it'd be another $5 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, they're getting a lot of money, but you know, FEMA wouldn't even let them into  New Orleans.  That's what I heard.  Now, what's the story there?  It's on the RedCross.org site.  They couldn't get in.  Apparently, FEMA wouldn't let the Red Cross in.  FEMA wouldn't let the, there's a bunch of...  Maybe that was to protect them.  Oh, yeah.  And there's a bunch of airboat guys that wanted to get in to save people off the roofs.  And there were people on regular boats wanted to save people.  And they were called renegade boaters.  They didn't want them.  No, it was all done by Homeland Security because these were all security issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, but if there's guys running around with guns, shooting at people...  No, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, there is guys running around with guns.  It was three days before Katrina, excuse me, before FEMA showed up in Manhattan when  the trade centers didn't stand down.  72 plus hours.  FEMA's broke.  Broken.  FEMA may be broke.  FEMA may be broken.  But the point is, if it wasn't for a civilian response after...  9-11.  ...after 9-11, things would have been a lot nastier than they were.  And the idea of, yeah, it's horrible and it's scary and people are behaving in unconscionable  manner down there.  But the flip side is like, why are you preventing a civilian...  And you know what I mean?  I get it.  You want to organize, you want to check boxes, you want your 724 to be...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a big brother phenomenon.  They won't let people help themselves.  I mean, I've had...  I was blogging a lot of this stuff, so it's kind of annoying.  Isn't that what George Bush is all about?  That's not getting too political.  I don't want to get too political, but that's...  There's an issue here and it has to be resolved.  And the thing is, I think there's going to be a lot of moaning and groaning over the  next few months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Very dramatic blog.  Did you see this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, the fact that Condoleezza Rice was shopping for shoes two days after the hurricane  hit is ridiculous.  And she was taping the bottom of them.  They had the rouser.  No, she wasn't.  They had the rouser from the shoe store because some woman apparently came up there and started  berating her for being in New York.  You know about this?  Yeah, she was in New York the most of the time.  She berated her and apparently the store, the Secret Service got freaked out and they  whisked her back to Washington because everyone was like yelling at the woman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Did you read the...  There was an amazing blog from a network center, it was Direct Nick, in downtown New Orleans.  Right, they're downtown.  They had amazing pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They had their own generator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And they're talking, the trucks are coming with more fuel, we don't run out of fuel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's a live cam.  It's amazing.  You can watch it.  In fact, there's a building that caught on fire a couple days ago and they had it on  the cam and it's burning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah.  There's an example of citizen journalism.  Long before the mainstream media were able to cover this story and before anybody was  in there to rescue, we were seeing what was going on from blogs and people who were there.  This Text America thing is a good example.  It is really quite amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was never a big fan of the idea that bloggers are going to be the new journalists of any  sort and I'm still not completely convinced but I have to say they've done a much better  job than the general media.  You do have to kind of edit it yourself because there's guys that are just full of crap on

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  there.  I don't think journalist is the right word.  It's covering the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's somebody that's there and recording what they see and talking about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  They're storytellers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But it's participatory journalism.  It's people who are part of the story telling the story.  That's fine for journalists then to come in and make sense of it or analyze it if they  do a decent job of it.  The fact is that the primary sources now are so much better than they used to be.  You're really seeing stuff.  And they're faster.  Yeah, instantly.  I think it's just fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We've got this guy here, reporting on me right now.  Exactly.  I mean there are a lot of people.  The War Act just said that Rice was in the shoe store.  Can you believe this?  Left wing, right wing, left wing, what am I?  Well, that is one of the scary things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And we've seen that happen too where there's this kind of wave of public opinion that's  influenced by completely fallacious blogs.  And that's another problem.  That's a whole other issue.  But I think people are going to get smarter about what they believe.  I don't think so.  You don't think so?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No evidence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There's no evidence of people getting smarter.  They're actually talking about Katrina.  Who was it that was telling me that their company is going to do...  Come on over here.  In fact, let me get the handheld mic.  We all know Scott very well from resellerratings.com.  Hey, Scott, how you doing?  Hey, great, how are you?  Oh, I have to turn you up.  I forgot, I don't have a rave on here anymore.  You hear me now?  Okay, great.  So resellerratings.com, great site where you guys publish ratings of the companies that  sell stuff online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  Yeah, you can go to our site and read reviews of merchants before you buy online and compare prices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What are you doing for Katrina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  So what we're doing is we're matching donations to the Red Cross up to $10,000.  That's great.  So we're trying to raise a total of $20,000.  resellerratings.com  Yeah, just go to our homepage and click on the banner there and there'll be instructions.  It's really easy.  You just donate forward your receipt to us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You see a lot of companies doing that, doing matching donations.  In fact, if you're going to do a donation, you should probably check to see if your company  is doing matching.  Did you see Clorox is giving a buck for everybody who goes to the Clorox site and clicks there's  some new detergent or something.  You click and they're giving away a buck.  That's pretty cool.  You might as well.  How are things going at resellerratings?

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  Really good.  We're focusing more on the fraud, preventing fraudulent reviews and working on the shopping  engine and deals.  It's good to see you again.  Thanks for coming by.  Good to see you guys.  Your success out here.  It's a great show.  We're Twitter-fying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It is pretty amazing.  I don't know how this happened.  Matt, why don't you bring that mic over to Sal.  Matt, same thing you say, Grenowitzky.  Grenowitzky.  Grenowitzky.  Grenowitzky.  Grenowitzky.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Grenowitzky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Grenowitzky.  Grenowitzky.  Grenowitzky.  Grenowitzky.  We have a Twitter intern, ladies and gentlemen.  I am so honored to meet you.  This is Sal Seguin.  Sal is the king of Apple Talk, the Apple Talk product manager at Apple and a great guy.  I learned a lot about Apple Talk.  Apple Script.  I'm sorry.  Apple Talk.  I think that would be a bad product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the Apple Talk product manager is a very lonely guy right now.  Long gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The Apple Script product manager.  I learned a lot from you on the last Mac Mania.  On the Geek Cruise.  On the Geek Cruise.  Yeah, it was incredible.  That was wonderful.  And you showed me Automator before it came out in Tiger and that is amazing.  X-Name.  I'm sorry, you didn't show me anything.  I know nothing.  What was that again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That will be expunged from the record.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, wait a minute.  Let me think.  That wasn't so long ago.  It was after Tiger came out.  Right.  So how are things going now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Automator has taken off like crazy.  It's really, acceptance has been incredible.  It's actually raised awareness about Apple Script and we have more interest in Apple  Script and Automator than we ever have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I love Apple Script.  I mean, for automating your workflows, for getting stuff done, it's just really nice  to have that nice high level language.  I find myself doing more and more in Apple Script and less and less in Perl or Shell.  Yeah.  It's just really great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's very approachable.  I mean, you don't have to really get down and dirty with it so much.  It's an English-like language that lets you control applications and the computer itself.  We missed you on the last Geek Cruise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yes.  Are you going on the next one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  I'll be on the Geek Cruise to Acapulco and I'll be on the following one to the Mediterranean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  See, I haven't decided about the Mediterranean but I'm going on the Mexican Riviera.  That's in February and the Mediterranean is in July, right?  That's right.  Yeah.  So that's geekcruises.com.  Yes.  Give them a little plug because Woz will be there with us as well, I believe.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I'll be teaching a class again on Apple Script and one on Automator as well.  Oh, that was fun.  And it was the highlight of my life that Woz took the Apple Script class and showed up  for the second day.  It was so cool.  It was so cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Woz is amazing.  Woz goes to the...  He's an amazing cat.  He shows up for these courses and then goes to the classes, which is like, what?  Don't you know all this already?  He did all the scripts and everything else.  That's great.  That's really great.  Well, Sal, it's nice to see you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you for coming by.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you.  I really appreciate it.  We really appreciate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, it's a nice crowd we've got here, I'll tell you.  Is Arlo around?  Where's Arlo?  Arlo Rose, are you here?  Because I wanted to say hi to Arlo, too.  Here's coming up here.  You can give Arlo the mic.  We got a red muff on our mic, so it's easy to find.  Arlo Rose.  We'll put the red nose back on.  Arlo created Confabulator.  Don't you love Confabulator?  Greatest app.  Isn't it incredible?  And of course, Apple kind of...  We won't say it ripped you off, but Dashboard.  But you know, it's a great app.  It's a great app.  It's a great app.  It's a great app.  It's a great app.  It's a great app.  It's a great app.  I can't comment on that.  I understand.  I understand.  But I have to say, I used Dashboard for a while, and I went back to Confabulator because  I like the additional functionality, the ability to see it all the time or put it on the desktop  and stuff like that.  It really makes it a more useful product.  So you just sold, though, the company to who?  To Yahoo!  Yahoo!  Yahoo!  Yahoo!  Yahoo!  Yahoo!  Yahoo!  Yahoo!  Yahoo!  Yahoo!  Yahoo!  Yahoo!  Yahoo!  Yahoo!  Yahoo!  So did you say when they called, did you go Yahoo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  It's actually kind of a long story that began with Microsoft and ended with Yahoo.  I can't really tell the story, but let's just say that we'd much rather work at Yahoo  than Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah.  Because you do offer it for Windows and Macintosh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  We've been doing a cross-platform version, which the whole reason was because we love  Dearly and we wanted to make sure that as many people could get their hands on it as  possible to create really cool widgets.  That would be cross-platform?  That would be cross-platform.  So the more people that made it for Windows, the more people got to use it on the Mac.  And it was a real amazing success.  And now with the whole Yahoo!  involvement, it's crazy.  We get hundreds of submissions a day to the gallery and we're just making our way through  them.  Wow.  And we get millions and millions of downloads a week of these guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's very similar to Dashboard.  You write in JavaScript, you create resources that are images and so forth.  It's very similar to the Dashboard development model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Yep.  Yeah.  It's actually pretty much identical, minus the fact that we use XML and they use DHTML  as the base.  But with our next version, we can do some really cool stuff that actually makes them  more Dashboard-like with the embedded views.  And we're doing some stuff with Yahoo!  login technology so that if you're a Yahoo! user, you can have persistent preferences  if you log into your machine.  So you have all sorts of cool widgets up on your desktop at work.  You can have them up on your same ones at home with the same information, same positions  and everything.  Oh, I really like that.  It's going to be really cool.  We've got a really great developer who just came on board who does really neat game widgets.  He's on the audience over there named Rob Marquart.  And he's hopefully going to do some really cool stuff with us too.  A great widget developer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Really great guy.  The thing I like the best is Yahoo! has given it away now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Yeah, totally free.  Do whatever you want to with it.  Make cool widgets, give it to your friends, put it on CDs.  Well, wait.  Yeah, something like that.  You can do that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's a lot.  Yeah.  K-O-N-F-A-B-U-L-A-T-O-R.com.  It's always been one of my favorites and I like it that it's free now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Yeah, and we love you for that.  If it wasn't for the screen savers, our Windows Beta program, I don't know what would have  happened.  That day that you talked about it, we had thousands and thousands of people within minutes  signing up for our program.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Was that the day you made the widget of me?  The Looking Leo widget?  No, no, no.  It was about a year after that.  I still use that widget.  We've got to update it because it points to the Tech TV search.  Oh, you're right.  Yeah.  That's no good.  I'll do an update of it this weekend.  No, it's all right.  Thank you.  It's great to see you, Arlo.  Good to see you again.  I'm glad you were here.  Yeah, yeah.  Good to see you too, Patrick.  Congratulations on the success of Confabulator.  I'm glad.  Good things sometimes happen.  Yeah.  It might have been a little bit of a curve, but no road.  But it was worth it.  But it was worth it.  It was worth it.  I hope you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  No, no, no.  It's going to be something I probably shouldn't say, but I will.  There will never be a paid version again.  There will never be Yahoo advertising built into the product or the widgets.  Yes.  And we hopefully, and I can't promise this, but there will hopefully never be Yahoo advertising  on any of our websites because we're in a business section that is not slated to make  money.  We will be making widgets that are like the Spider-Man 3 widget probably.  But that's not something you need to download if you don't want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you don't have to be a Yahoo member to download it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, definitely not.  I like the additional functionality of if you are a Yahoo member, your widgets are on  all your machines.  Do I have to then download the widget on each machine or does it automatically kind of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I'm not actually sure how that part of it is going to work just yet.  It might actually be something we keep on the server and then spread around if it's  something you have installed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's kind of neat because then you're really customizing your desktop.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Yeah, it'll be great.  And you'll be able to do cool stuff with your actual, like your Yahoo Finance stuff will  show up in your stock ticker.  Your regular Yahoo weather stuff will show up in your weather widget.  And again, you don't have to be a Yahoo member to use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So basically the business model from Yahoo's perspective is to do the things like the Spider-Man  gimmick so they can like pre...

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  It's actually...  That's not the...  The business model for Yahoo for this is that we're doing...  We're opening up all sorts of web XML APIs right now.  And what we want to do is use this as the starting point for getting people hooked on  them and doing really cool projects with them.  So you download Confabulator, you learn how to do the Y photo stuff with the XML APIs  for Y photo and then you go and add it to your application.  And then suddenly a lot of people are using Y photo that didn't necessarily know about  it before.  And now we've got more customers going to Y photo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So they're using it as a conduit for other services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There was a little bit and I kind of am sensitive to this complaint among Flickr users.  That's Y photo.  Right.  That in order to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's actually totally separate.  Oh, it is separate.  They're not going to merge the two?  They might.  Here was my issue.  I'm a Flickr user and all of a sudden I have to sign up to have a Yahoo account to keep  using my...  Well, they were trying to get people to sign up to Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Eventually, but you don't have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I don't want to.  I'm a Flickr pro user.  I don't want to kind of merge.  I mean, I'm a Yahoo account too, but I just don't...  I think the problem really was that there isn't really any disadvantage to Flickr users.  It's just Flickr users are kind of anti-corporate.  We don't want it to be part of a bigger company, I guess is the issue.  So it's not...  It's good stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'll tell you.  Does it have to do with your code name on Flickr?  Big Daddy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's my private Flickr account.  Now somebody with Big Daddy is going to be getting a lot of...  That's actually mine.  I'm Big Daddy.  I believe there is a Twit widget, but I may be wrong.  Is there a Confabulator widget for Twit?  I believe there is, but maybe not.  There will be shortly.  Exactly.  Before this show comes out.  Hey, let's thank you, Arlo.  It's nice to see you.  Let's bring Alex Lindsay up here too.  Can we make an announcement, Alex?  Would it be premature to make an announcement?  Go over to the microphone.  Would it be premature to make an announcement?  Would it be premature to make an announcement, Alex, about what we're doing together or no?  No, it's fine.  Can we say that?  Yeah.  Alex Lindsay, you may remember from Call for Help.  In fact, he's still on Call for Help, the Canadian version, which is now back on G4.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  We just noticed because the emails that I get...  All of a sudden.  Just straight in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's on a weird time.  It's 11 a.m. Eastern, 8 a.m. Pacific.  It seems to be effective either way.  But hey, at least it's back in the United States, so we're happy about that.  Alex is our Photoshop guy.  He does Pixel Core, which is an amazing idea, which is getting people all over the world  involved in 2 and 3D graphics design and learning how to do it.  But then once they become skilled, they become part of the Pixel Core getting jobs.  More of a guild.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  It's a guild.  Right.  Yeah.  The idea was that 500 years ago when you wanted to build a castle, there were a handful of  guilds that you'd go find.  The Mason's Guild and the Painters.  All of those different things.  Right now for our industry, there isn't anything like that.  There's no way to find any...  Sure you can find one or two great ones, you just can't find 500 of them, which is what  we're interested in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And they're all over the world.  You've got Africa, you've got Asia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Yeah, we have 36 countries.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So Alex and I are going to start something in a couple of weeks.  MacBreak.  It's a new half-hour internet-only television show.  Yes.  Yeah, on Macintosh.  So we're really excited about that.  And Roger, whenever you're in town, we'd love to have you on the show, by the way.  We're going to videotape it across the street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Our offices are like 100 feet from here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And we're going to do the first one in a couple of weeks, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Yeah, at the end of September.  It should come up in October.  So it's the first one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Is there going to be a website?  How will people find out when it's available?

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  We're going to put out announcements, but it'll be macbreak.com is the website.  It's not up yet.  But it'll be going up.  There'll actually be some short daily stuff that starts coming out.  So you'll start seeing stuff, hopefully, on iTunes, podcasts, and so on and so forth.  There are little videos that kind of get people prepped for it.  And then that'll kind of build towards the full show.  I'm really excited about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  All of us as Twits, that's really what we're excited about, is the idea of IP content delivery.  I've been doing audio, and Kevin's been doing video.  And I just really think this is the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Well, the more you research it, the big thing is you have to question whether there is any  future in TV.  At all.  There's why bother is what I kind of start seeing more and more of.  I don't have a TV.  I mean, everything I get is IP.  Everything I watch on my laptop, when I want to watch it.  We're just testing a little Elgato thing, which seems to work pretty well.  You can take your cable and record it.  You can turn your Mac mini into an EVR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's the iTV.  Are you using the HD version or just the regular 500?  We got the HD version.  You did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Do you do that, Roger?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Do you watch IP TV at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Yes, I do.  In fact, I watch it all the time.  I download Kevin's stuff.  I watch it in the van.  I burn it to video CDs and play it on a 20-inch LCD.  I think that's the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  The thing is, before there was a constrained distribution.  You had broadcast stations or you had cable networks.  The issue now, though, is with BitTorrent, most people think of BitTorrent as this way  to pass pirated stuff around.  But really, when you look at what BitTorrent does, it lets any of us, it breaks that entire  distribution wall down.  If I had a show that was, say, 500 megs and I put it out to 500,000 people, that's $100,000  of distribution, just to upload it.  With BitTorrent, it's 500 bucks.  That's an entirely different reality.  That means any of us could make shows.  That's what we're going to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, we'll see.  MacBreak.com.  That's coming up later in September.  I'm not competing with you, Kevin.  It's all of us in there together.  The more the better, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  I love Command-N.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Command-N. Mike and Amber do that.  Of course, Dignation has video, which is very popular.  We're going to have video of Twitter.  Now is this going to be, Kevin, are you going to do this on a regular basis?  This is the trial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, we're going to try and do it probably one month just to start.  It depends on how much time Keith has.  He's so busy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It all comes down to Keith.  He's the bottleneck.  He's got to video it.  He's got to edit it.  He's got to produce it.  He's got to get it out, right?  Yeah.  Can you get another Keith?  Or is there only one?  There's only one Keith.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's only one.  What do you use to edit?  I don't want to say because this is a Mac store.  Premier.  Premier.  We use the Premier Pro.  But we're trying to get a Mac.  We're going to get a G5.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Final cuts.  All the way, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Is that what you would use, Keith, is final cut?  Yeah.  You think so?  Yeah.  Keith should turn the camera around.  Interview.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  I wanted to say one more thing about IPTV.  I used to really want a DirecTV satellite thing for our moving vehicle.  And now all I used to do is I'd record the screensavers and I would watch it if I had  that, I would watch it and it's not there.  So why bother?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, if we do the screensavers again, it's very likely we'll do it on IPTV.  That would be the logical way to do it.  Patrick's doing video.  In fact, I've watched a few of them now and you've got the audio working and it's actually  pretty, I'm now liking it a lot.  I mean, you really got a great job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can I have a Dvorak moment here?  Please.  DigitalLiveTV.com.  Episode 4 we do live on Tuesday, available for download Tuesday night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And Patrick was not at work in the last Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You did a masterful editing job.  You would never know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  You would never know, would you?  By the way, the mic that you love so much for Skype?  Yeah.  Straight from China.  You can use a $75 headset or a $3 one and Leo will like the $3 one better.  It sounded really good.  Isn't that scary?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And it wasn't USB or anything, you just plugged it in.  It was plugged straight into the notebook.  You know what I would like to do is give the people in the audience a chance to ask questions.  So why don't we put that mic in the stand and if people or actually hold on to it, Matt,  and you can actually get to them maybe.  That'd be easier.  Yeah, it'd be a lot easier because they're all over the place.  So if you've got a question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Wireless for Netflix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's the next step is wireless and I'll see the phone interface and I need a microphone  for the guitars and the saxophones.  Do you want to play a little bit for us a little bit?  Yeah, I'll play just a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  You know, like, let's see what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Can you play that wild riff of eight mills high on the seventh string?

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Yeah, I can do that.  I'll tell you what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You weren't here, John, when I was saying that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Hold your mic up to the guitar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You were here.  Yeah, we got to have a mic on that.  Here, bring give me the little red mic and I'll be the I'll be your mic stand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That sounds beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  I really should be.  I should put my leg up here because it's hard to in this position.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I was telling you weren't here, John, yet, but I was saying that the last time I saw  Roger McQuinn was 1975 of the Rolling Thunder Review with Bob Dylan, Jumbayez and Mick  Ronson played eight miles high.  I was, in fact, eight miles high.  I think I saw God that night.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, Roger McQuinn.  I should ask, is that podcast safe?  Yeah, that's cool.  You own that.  You give me the rights to.  You've got the rights.  Hey, thank you, Ben Williamson at Apple.  We really thank Apple stores for allowing us to use their facility for our very first  Twitter recorded in front of a live audience.  We thank all of you for being here.  This is really great.  Now, we just gave away an iPod and we also thanks to Apple, but we also gave away a bunch  of these Twitter hoodies.  And I'll be honest, Ben called me said, well, your sweatshirts have arrived.  I said, my what?  Because I was going to get pocket protectors and I apologize to you all, but they didn't  come in time.  They're ordered.  But of course, everything takes longer than you think.  We'll have them certainly by our next live broadcast, December 18th at noon.  And I hope you'll come for that.  But this these sweatshirts came from a listener.  It says Leo and Kukun Gats on your first live show.  I hope it's a success.  Please enjoy these sweatshirts there.  And thanks for all of the entertaining shows.  You might think it's an odd color choice, but this is actually reflective ink.  So take a photo of somebody wearing it with a flash and you'll see what I mean.  You'll say, Tweet, Tweet, subliminal, subliminal Tweet.  Or jump out in front of traffic.  Yeah, that's right.  Then they'll hit you.  Yeah.  Take a flash picture of me, John.  Oh, yeah.  So I have to zip up my twits.  I use this technique.  He says I use this technique for a great deal of the bands that I do, and it works great  in the surf skate industry as well.  John's checking to see if it'll work.  That's dead sexy.  It's dead sexy.  I love it.  So we want to thank Chris Siglin of Capistrano Beach.  Thank you, Chris, for the for the shirts.  These are great sweatshirts.  And Chris, if you send me, I'll send you an email, Chris, but if you send me information  about your company or business, if you want, we'll put a plug on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  In fact, we'll do that for anybody who wants to give us free things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Anything you give us for free.  We don't take advertising, but we take crap.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  As long as it's free.  Take crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Can I say one more thing?  The HD7 Acoustic Guitar Magazine is giving one away free.  Oh, neat.  Yeah, Martin Guitar Company and Acoustic Guitar Magazine have gotten together, and all you  have to do is sign up.  I don't know.  It doesn't take anything.  You don't have to buy anything.

Transcript:  We'll put a link in the show notes.  That's a beauty.  That sound is so incredible coming out of there.  I don't know if I did it justice.  I mean, we had, you know, I mean, that was an SM57 that Patrick, the punk rock microphone  of choice, says Patrick.  So we used them for many years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's your guitar manufacturer?  That's a Martin.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Martin.  It's nice.  So there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  I mean, that's a nice, nice guitar.  And the price?  Yeah.  It's not that long.  It's not that bad.  It's not that bad.  That's not, that's not awful.  Street prices in the 40s and so on.  That's not awful for a really good good guitar.  Yeah.  They are handmade, yeah.  Made by hands.  Yeah, they're made by human people in America.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hurray.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So thank you, everybody, for being here, and thanks to the Apple store.  We can take some audience questions.  Matt Graniewicki, our, our Twit turn.  He's a private in the Twit army, but he'll be corporal if he keeps this up.  Just raise your hand if you have a question you'd like to ask.  Or a comment you'd like to make about Twit.  You can raise your hand.  How old is he?  Is he two?  You can, if you have a question, it's okay.  He's well trained from school.  Yeah.  Do you need a potty break?  Because I can give you a pass and you know.  Go ahead.  Just take somebody at random.  There you go.  Yes, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  What's your name?  Brooke Drum.  Hi, Brooke.  Welcome.  I just wonder what the business model is for this.  Either you guys are rich or you're bored.  Oh.  Because, I mean, you guys are well known and, but guys like us wanting to start a podcast  or video cast, no one knows us.  Right.  So what's the incentive?  Is it just for fun or is there a way to make money off this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's to block guys like you from taking our, you know.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Actually, I think.  If we didn't do it, you know, then it would be a problem.  It's fun for me.  You're not taking advertising or anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So how do you do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Patrick, you raise your hand.  Would you explain our business model?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is partially just pure vicious bitterness and vengeance on the part of a bunch of people  who believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Do you remember the original name of the show?  Yeah.  No.  The revenge of the screen savers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was almost, you could say, it was purely motivated by malice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  There's no money in that though.  Don't knock malice though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a lot of money in that because it works really well on major media.  Just look around at what gets broadcast.  I mean, Jerry Springer, all about the hate, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Somebody sent me an email.  I got the greatest email saying, what's your business model?  Because he says, you know, I know you do this and this.  Do you make all the money on books?  What are you making them?  How are you making a living?  We have day jobs.  We all have day jobs.  You know, I do a TV and radio show.  Patrick, it works for PC Magazine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who here doesn't work full time for themselves or someone else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, the only one who really is in this for real is Prager and Kevin because they're doing  revision three.  And that's, I mean, they're the ones really putting their butts on the line, but we all  have jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I'll get fired if enough people don't watch digital life TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Digital life TV.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're a business model.  These guys are just blowing smoke.  A business model will emerge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's not blowing smoke.  One will emerge.  I think really at this point.  The model is, and all of this is paid for by donations.  So we do it for free, although I think we have enough donations that we could probably  just pay people some small amount of money for appearing on it.  But it's not a business.  We were never created it as a business.  We created it because we like doing it.  It's a public service.  Well, it's not that either.  We created it because we like doing it.  It seems to be one to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  People like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  It's a public service.  I like to look at, like The Grateful Dead had a place where you could record their stuff,  you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right.  A taper's pavilion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  And it didn't hurt them.  They got bigger than any other band in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We all get some benefit.  I don't think Call for Help would be back on G4.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  My blog at davorak.org slash blogs, the numbers have doubled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  If you say it again, it might go triple.  davorak.org slash blogs.  There you go.  Look at that.  So we all get some publicity out of it.  But publicity in itself doesn't make you money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And most of the time we reject that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The thing is, right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Why are you not on mic?  Can you put your mic somewhere that I can hear it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's been there the whole...

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I know, but I don't hear you very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it unplugged?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, I can hear you.  Just talk into it a little more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When I do that, I breathe.  When I breathe, you get upset.  Don't breathe either, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yes, you can talk but not breathe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The thing is, like the model for all this IP stuff is, right, to borrow from Davorak,  it's all evolving, right?  There's no Nielsen.  There's no Arbitron rating system.  And the problem is, if you're looking for somebody else to pay for this, they either  have to trust and believe in your product, like a sponsorship you get for a race car,  which is a nightmare to get.  Or you have to prove, by hosting all of your own content, that you have a large enough  user base to warrant somebody spending on it, right?  The advertising model is usually CPM, cost per thousand listeners.  You get paid X number of dollars for cost per thousand listeners, which is usually either  verified by you holding up something that says, hey, I had 150,000 downloads last week,  it's 150,000 bodies, or it's done through other means.  And it's a messy, messy, messy system to set up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We have proof of numbers, we have good numbers, and we could probably make money on this.  In fact, you know, I mean, we're turning away advertisers all the time.  We didn't want advertisers because we didn't want to have anybody tell us that, first of  all, we weren't completely independent.  We didn't want anybody snooping into our, you know, we're all rebels.  We're rebelling against, except for Dvorak.  No, it's true.  That's how this got started, John, is we didn't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The only limit we give ourselves is just holding that PG-13 rating.  Get the Sennheiser headset down a little tighter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There is a condition for the bandwidth we get from AOL.  We get two things from AOL.  We get bandwidth, so we don't have to pay for that, which is something that you as a  podcaster would have to figure out, how are we going to do that?  You could do BitTorrent, but then you couldn't be on iTunes.  And iTunes is a very important publicity medium.  So that's an issue.  We get bandwidth from AOL in return.  We actually get two things.  We get bandwidth, and they play this on AOL radio, which is very valuable.  That's 10 million uniques a month.  So that exposes us to a large audience.  So they're giving us airplay and they're giving us bandwidth in return for us saying,  AOL radio, thanks for the bandwidth, which we've just done, so we don't have to do it again.  But that's the only business deal we have on this.  And I'm happy about it.  I don't want to have to deal with those people.  I don't want to have to talk to an advertiser every week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Yeah, it's cool to be on your own.  It is.  I just love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We're very lucky.  We can do what we like to do, and people enjoy it.  I think that that's a privilege.  So there is not really a business model.  I mean, if you want to do your own podcast, you could create one.  Subscription or advertising would be the two ways to go.  But I don't think anybody is yet really making money at podcasting.  You do it as a labor of love still.  Do you think, John was kind of skeptical about podcasting at first.  Do you think that podcasting will become a viable commercial medium?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, and the funny thing about it is that right now, whatever our numbers are,  probably about, I mean, potentially a third or a tenth of what they could be.  Because it turns out that the podcast technology, the way you do it properly  with an RSS feed and the automatic download and the rest of it,  to typically an iPod.  And if you look at the numbers, in fact, I see this when I plug the blog  and then I get these hits, and I see the Mac numbers go way up.  It's mostly Mac users that are kind of at the cutting edge of this whole thing.  Yeah, well, and that's why...  And when the other side gets in on it, it's going to be enormously big.  And the numbers that we have right now, once I think the market settles in on the concept,  iPod or a podcast being cool to listen to in the car, for example,  a lot of people listen to them in their car, or casually, or when they're jogging.  Once I think that becomes ubiquitous, which appears to be headed,  I think our numbers on this show will easily go over a million listeners.  I want to be...

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No problem.  There is ego involved.  We would love to be the first podcast to have a million listeners.  I mean, if that's the payoff, that's...  Roger, I mean, as a performer, and I think this is true of programmers,  I think it's true of most people, monetary, you got to feed yourself.  Yeah.  But really...  It's about more than money.  What really makes it is the acknowledgement of your peers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Exactly.  I love the work, I love doing it, I love getting on stage and playing for people,  and the feedback I get from that.  That's the payback, ultimately.  That's the payback.  He just played for free.  Yeah.  Well, like that joke about the musician who won the lottery,  they said, what are you going to do with the money?  He said, I'm going to keep on playing until the money runs out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But if people ask, well, what's the business model for open source?  People do stuff...  I think human beings will do stuff that we love...  As long as we can eat and have a roof over our head, we'll do stuff we love,  whether that feeds that or not, and that people give us positive feedback.  I think we've beaten this to death.  Okay, next question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's the name of your podcast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, you're going to do a podcast?  Yeah, vaultmultimedia.com.  Vaultmultimedia.com.  And what's it about?  It's actually about how to use technology in churches.  Love that.  That's great.  I'm going to do an interview with a Methodist church podcast next week.  I listen to a number of Buddhist podcasts and religious podcasts.  I think there are...  My wife is about to do a podcast...  John, don't look at me like that.  My wife is about to do a podcast where she talks...  She's a psychotherapist where she talks to people and just gets their life story.  You couldn't do that on commercial radio.  And yet, this is what's so great about podcasting, is there's an explosion of content.  Do they know they're being recorded?  Yes, they will be knowing they're...  Go ahead.  Yes, sir.  Get away from...  Michael Bozo's gets to you there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Bozo's knows.  Leo, what method would you recommend is the easiest way to do the RSS encoding for a program  to make a real podcast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well the easiest way is to do what Kevin, for instance, does with Dignation, which is  to have a blog...  What do you use?  Do you use WordPress?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, actually we're doing it all in-house now.  We are using FeedBurner.  Well that's what I was saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You had a blog with its own RSS feed and FeedBurner, if you give it the RSS feed, will take whatever  enclosures are in there and turn it into a podcast.  So initially that's how you did it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, actually, Typead just announced that they're now doing the enclosures by default.  So they're supporting podcasts.  So you don't...  Then you could do it without FeedBurner on Typead.  And WordPress does as well.  WordPress too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does the FeedBurner have the extra code in there for iTunes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it actually has a place where you can just browse.  If you have album art work that you want to put in there, you just browse, select a file,  and it'll automatically put that into the feed for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I was very jealous initially because I was struggling with the iTunes stuff.  And Kevin's feed immediately was iTunes compatible.  I was pissed.  But it turned out it was because he was using FeedBurner.  What we do now is we hand...  For Twit, in fact for all my podcasts, I hand encode the RSS using a great program called  Feeder, which is a Macintosh only program that makes it very, very easy.  And what I found is that in the early days of RSS and of podcasting, people would just...  It was kind of very basic.  The enclosure, the location of the enclosure, maybe some simple descriptive stuff.  What we do now is we put the whole show notes in there.  When you get the RSS feed, you don't just get the sound.  You get all the show notes.  You get a lot of extra stuff.  And I can do that now because I'm using Feeder.  So I could put the show notes into the RSS feed.  I think podcasts are going to want to do that.  I think they're going to want to make the feed be more than, here's the audio.  That's what I'm using too.  You like Feeder?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Dynamite.  Yeah.  What's the name of the...  The John Hammond Show.  It's a podcast version of my cable TV show I've been doing for 22 years in New York City.  Oh, that's great.  Yeah.  What's the show about?  It's music, travel, and soft news.  That's great.  I stay away from the hard news.  I leave that for CNN.  That's exactly what this podcast is about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Music, travel, and soft news.  Right on.  Next question.  Thanks a lot.  Is that John Hammond dot com?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it on?  By the way, I'm John with no H.  I'm the organ player, accordion player.  Member of local 802 Musicians Union and local 6 in San Francisco.  You have some jam after the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You bring your keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Sound goes right on, dude.  And what's the URL for it, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's on iTunes, and you go to www.johnhammondband.com slash files slash XML.  Got it.  Something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  AJ, did you have something you wanted to add?

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Yeah, there's actually a really inexpensive way of getting a podcast on the internet using  dot mac and a piece of software called, it's by Real Mac software, it's called Rapid Weaver.  Oh, cool.  And it allows you to create a web page using cascading style sheets, and you can actually  upload your mp3 online, and it will automatically create a podcast like XML feed for you, which  is pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's really great.  The only problem, of course, is if you get very popular, Apple's going to pull the plug  on your dot mac account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Yeah, well, maybe.  But that would be a good thing, right?  Yeah, and dot mac is cheap, and Rapid Weaver's real cheap.  I love dot mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think that's a great value.  More questions from the, thank you, AJ, more questions from the audience.  Yes, sir.  Go ahead, Matt.  You can get to him in the back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Hi, yeah.  Yahoo just recently did a sale on their domain names for $1.99 a year.  I saw that.  Isn't that amazing?  Why do you think they did this position?  Because recently, like, lately, it's been $10 a year.  So why do you think they did this $1.99 sale?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The actual cost, I think, of going to the ICAM with a domain name, I think it's $3.50.  So they're selling it at a loss there.  But I talked to the Two Cows guys, and I think that they said it was around $3.50.  So anything that's all about the-  I heard $4.00.  It's in that ballpark.  You pay more than $4.00, you're overpaying.  But it's all about the renewal, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But no, the Yahoo thing is you can get a five year thing for what?  $10 for five years.  I didn't see the five year.  That's an amazing deal.  I don't know why they're doing it, because they want to, what?  They want to sell you more services.  It's a loss leader.  It's a loss leader to sell you more services.  Now that makes a lot of sense.  Take advantage of it.  Yeah, why not?  Yeah.  Yeah, do some squatting.  Go ahead.  Just run to somebody with their hand up, Matt.  Well, maybe you can.  This will be really-  earlier, those of you listening at home don't know this,  but earlier I stepped on the power supply  and unplugged everything.  Maybe you did notice when you heard that giant-

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  brrrr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I can't wait to go home and listen to Twitter.  I don't know what it's going to sound like this week.  It'll be in the video version.  We'll see you trip over to the-  Watch, yeah, the video version will have what happened.  That'll be the highlight.  The audio version won't, because all you- it went dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Yes, sir.  Hey, how you guys doing?  I was wondering, where do you guys see PowerPC going in  desktops after Apple drops the processor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Apple just ordered a bunch of new chips, didn't they?  What is that all about?  They actually reserved them.  They reserved more PowerPCs.  They don't have to sell them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think it's dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  And a little bit more open-ended,  Kevin, where's Hacking with Ramsey at?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When's he coming back?  Ramsey, actually, he lives here in San Francisco.  He'll be doing another episode of The Broken with us here  in the next couple months.  Broken is back, and so is Ramsey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's right.  People love Ramsey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Is he a little Masad or something like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, he's from Jordan.  He's an awesome little hacker guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Awesome little hacker guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  He loves to hack.  This thing on.  OK, good.  Hi, my name's Chris White.  I'm actually a Gen 2 developer, so thanks for mentioning that.  Love Gen 2.  Thank you.  I love working on it.  The question I wanted to ask you is you're mentioning patents  and whatnot.  Two comments on that.  Number one, I found that there was a very interesting patent that  was put out in the net about someone who actually,  they patented the Tarzan swing along with the Tarzan yell.  So if I do that, I could get sued.  I don't know how they enforce it, but I saw this online somewhere.  The other comment I wanted to make, too, was what are you guys' opinions  on the recent, I think, the Microsoft Developers Conference,  somewhere they were talking about digital rights management  through the actual hardware itself.  And then if you try to play, I guess if you're  trying to play like a Malingo file or something,  it wouldn't let you do it.  That's TPM.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  What's your general opinion on that?  Sounds like a bad idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, and that was the whole furor over Apple putting TPM  into the developer box, which we never confirmed that they were doing.  And that kind of blew over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That Blu-ray, you're looking at the same situation  with updatable cryptography.  Well, they learned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  CSS is a flop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  In addition to, if you put a disk in that's not authorized,  they could just as easily disable the entire player.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You know, I'll tell you, I'll give you a really good example of where this  reaches into your computer.  And it's a little too much.  Electronic Arts.  If you ever installed alcohol on 20% or Clone CD, which are two programs that  allow you to crack games, but also put drivers on your system  so that you can mount CD images, right?  And I do that all the time, because I have a spindle-less laptop.  So I'll copy a CD, put the image on there so I can mount it.  If, I think it's Medal of Honor, a couple of Electronic Arts games,  if Doom 3 see that driver on there, they refuse to let you play the game.  They presume that you wouldn't have that on there unless you were a thief  and about to steal their program.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  It's like having a cantena.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like having a cantena.  I mean, I'm appalled by that.  Do you think you've seen that before?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's annoying as can be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think it's more than annoying.  It's none of their business what I'm running on my computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And nine times out of 10, whenever you're patching a game,  if it's a relatively small patch, you don't see really what the heck they  did.  God's Heart's just an update for that copy protection scheme.  To put it in.  That's going to re-say, like, there's a back and forth game between the people  like I'll hunt 20% to make a workaround, get us off the blacklist.  And then they turn around and release a patch that updates the security  on the disk that was shipped to go ahead and re-blacklist them.  And you go back.  I'm seeing it less on some of the new titles, either that or they've finally  just given up on it.  But for a good year there, every new game you had, especially the ones with,  I want to say Star Force, or it was one of the two major.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think it turns people into pirates.  I told the guy who this happened to, well, sure, no problem.  Just go get a crack and take that code out of yourself.  It's forcing legitimate users.  This guy paid $80 for these games.  Can't play them because he once installed Clone CD, uninstalled it,  but the driver doesn't go away because they think, well,  maybe you're still going to mount these disks.  And he can't play the game.  And I said, well, here's how you get a crack.  It's turning people into pirates.  TPM will do the same thing.  It's bad.  Can you elaborate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I just say, what can I say?  It sucks.  It sucks.  How's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  There you go.  That's elaborate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  What were those DVDs that used to evaporate?  Dibics, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The original Dibics.  Some DVDs should evaporate.  Let's get the gentleman in the UCSD t-shirt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I have a question for Kevin.  Did G4 fire you, or did you resign?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I resigned.  They actually, there was about 30 days there where  I was trying to get on my contract.  And I went into Peter Green, who was in charge of programming there at G4,  and sat down with him and said, I really want out.  I want to do my own thing.  And thankfully, they released me.  Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to do what we do with Revision 3,  because I signed a three-year deal with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'll vouch for that, because he was so happy.  Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I remember when he told me.  I was like, I don't know, man.  G4 sucked.  There's a point where.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know.  That's going to go over big with the podcast.  Make sure to keep that on the tape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, the only person here who could be hurt by that is me,  because I might have a show on G4, but I don't care.  I agree.  Well, you can take it out then.  I'm going to take it out.  You want to hear my show, Kevin?  Now?  What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Kevin's on Call for Help 2, yeah.  It's really weird, because I'm back on G4 now,  because I'm on your show, Leo.  But without a contract?  With no contract.  Leo didn't make me sign a contract, so we're good there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm thinking about it, though.  Five, six years.  No compete?  Lock him down.  No, no.  Tech TV lives on.  Yeah, Tech TV lives on in a weird way, doesn't it?  It just refuses to die.  We're the living proof of that.  But I think it lives on, not because of us,  but because the viewers wouldn't let it die, basically.  I mean, it would be long gone if people didn't want it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  It had a bigger market than G4 gave it credit for.  I think that's why Call for Help's back on G4,

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  is they're saying, hmm, even if it is in the 8 AM on the Pacific  coast.  Go ahead, just pick somebody else, Matt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Along those same lines, do any of you guys  who aren't on any networks anymore,  what do you miss about it?  And the other thing, have you guys seen the Asteroids Fossil  Watch?  I have one of those, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does it actually play, or does it just  do asteroids in the background?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It plays itself.  But you can't play it?  No, I wish it could.  But the watch would be as big as me if that were the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I don't think so.  You could probably make asteroids in a size that small.  Bet you anything you could.  I mean, there's an Asteroids widget for the dashboard widget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is there a Palm Pilot Asteroids version?  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  Because you can use the Palm Pilot watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There you go, see?  There you go.  You can play it on your Palm Pilot watch.  More questions?  Anybody else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, to answer that question,  though, I know Leo and I miss, like, there's  a pure, vibrant, nasty adrenaline rush you get out  of making live TV.  That's why we're doing this, Patrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, seriously, I mean, it's one thing for Patrick and me  to sit sweating in my attic office with everybody else  on Skype.  That was all right.  But this is so much better, don't you think?  We like doing live TV.  There was nothing like doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a tremendous group of people at Tech TV.  More talent came in and out the door than probably anywhere  else will ever work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I miss that, too.  One of the things I hope we will do with Twit in our live venue  is we're just going to say to all of those old Tech TV people,  we're in Loxborough Landing every Sunday afternoon.  Come by.  There's a place, a chair for you, and a glass of bourbon.  Have a seat.  We'll get Bordeaux for John.  Black coffee for you, Patrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Appreciate it.  White wine for Dave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Roger, what would you like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  I'd like some Chardonnay.  Chardonnay, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Any other questions or we're going to wrap this?  OK, I kind of have to work your way to the side here,  because Matt can only go so far with our microphones.  So a couple of things, I'm going to make some notes.  I need longer mic cables.  Wireless.  Get a wireless for the audience.  Get a room mic.  OK.  And I need a power supply I can't step on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Piece of tape around it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah.  If I would just sit down, I would be fine.  I just can't sit down.  Yeah, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Quick question.  I just want to know, is there going  to be any element of estrogen on this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes.  You know, we invite, we've had Megan Maroney,  we tried to get her on.  Gina Smith was supposed to be on this week.  If the women had a little more guts, they'd show up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, no, you know what the problem is?  They all have babies.  So Megan has twin boys, and it's hard for her to get away.  But she swears, she promises.  She's dying to do it.  And Gina Smith was going to be here.  And her son, her two-year-old Eric, has the flu.  So she couldn't make it today.  But she will probably be on the next Twitcast.  And I've invited Kate Patello many times.  You haven't heard from her.  She lives in New York, and that's the problem.  But absolutely, I don't want it to be a boys club.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's not a problem.  We would love to have some women.  Jessica will be back.  Because right now, it's just five weenies  and whatever I said in that posting.  What did you say?  I think the show consists of five blowhards and a weenie.  And you're not going to identify the weenie.  Of course not.  So we'd like to have some female blowhards, too.  Yeah, well, you can't have a female weenie, or could you?  I'm out of here.  I'll edit that part out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Go ahead.  Good call.  Another question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah, hi.  I just wanted to ask a question about privacy issues.  I'm into genealogy.  And I'm always looking up dead people.  And I happen to look up live people.  And to my surprise, I can find online, unprotected,  my birth date, my mother's maiden name, and everything.  My home address.  Your home address, everything.  And so this is what my bank and my credit card  asked me to protect my account.  So what do you suggest we do?  I mean, I'm safe.  I got married.  They can't find me.  But you guys.  They will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They will find you.  I don't have a suggestion.  I think the problem is this stuff is public.  Leave the country or something.  I move frequently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Changing an address three or four times in one year  helps a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  If you didn't buy, the problem is you're in the,  you've involved yourself in the economy.  If you didn't buy a house, if you didn't have a credit card,  if you had no, if you don't vote,  if you don't have a data trail, you're invisible.  But I mean, we all want to live in the economy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  But this is being put out by official records  from the state of California, vital records from the various.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Remember that for years, county records,  and for good reason, were made public.  But you had to go to the county courthouse to see them.  Well, now those records are online.  I think that probably the best thing to do  is to go to your state legislature and say,  and this happened with the Teresa Saldana case,  where she's an actress who was assaulted by a stalker  who found her home information in DMV records  that were online.  At that time, the state of California  yanked those DMV records.  And so they need to do the same for other local records.  But right now, that's who has to do something about it.  You cannot protect yourself.  Because those things are public record.  You know what?  I bought a house, and I get in the mail every day  solicitations to refinance my house  with the exact amount I paid for the house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You have a bullseye on your forehead  as soon as you buy a house nowadays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Have a baby, and you start every year now  that my child has a birthday, I get junk mail  from people that the hospital sold my information to.  So it's very hard to protect yourself.  And I think that really that's the only people  who can do anything about it, other government officers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a long tradition of people  walking into the DMV office with a $100 bill  and a plate number, going through former police officers.  Doesn't cost $100 anymore.  You can go online for $50.  Always get that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, there's full rundown of just about anybody.  It's a shame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a nasty side to the whole information  wants to be free.  And the flip side is information  has a very interesting habit of following.  If there's money, the information's out there.  You can move, you can chase your phone number.  Basically, without dropping out of society  and going to a barter system, moving to Baja  and checking off the grid, your information's out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You raise a really interesting point, though,  because that is the flip side of the thing  that we celebrate so much, is that information  wants to be free.  Music wants to get out there.  This stuff, the podcast, the video,  wants to get out there and spread itself.  Well, information doesn't discriminate  between your personal information and anything else.  All of it wants to be free.  So this is the flip side of the technology  that we celebrate.  There needs to be some legislation.  That's what needs to happen.  I think it's the only way, frankly.  But I mean, you can't trust the government,  I think, to do the right thing in this case, can you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If you call all these jerks that are in there out  and put some normal people in it,  they're fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Commercial interests want this information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It really needs to be an opt-in system,  or unless you say otherwise, it does not.  And one final comment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Next time for your next free broadcast,  why don't you solicit some duct tape  so you can tape down all of your cords?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You should see this.  Well, you will if you watch the video version of it.  But it's all carefully designed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And all of us that have worked at Tech TV  have tons of gaffers taped to the holes.  This stuff is so handy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  It's great for everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You know, I have a pledge to keep this podcast  down to CD length.  We've already exceeded that.  But what I'm trying to do is keep it down to 2 CD length  for this particular podcast so that we can make...  What we'll do is we'll split it in half  and we'll have a two-hour and 10-minute versions.  How many of you, just out of curiosity,  how many of you listen to the podcast on your computer?  Most of you, huh?  How many of you listen to it on portable devices?  Oh, about an equal number.  How many of you burn it to a CD?  Oh, just a few, a handful.  But those are the ones that we're doing that for.  So forget it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Obviously, it's a non-existent market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, I just think it's a nice thing to do.  I don't know.  How many of you listen to the MP3 version?  AAC version?  AUG version?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, him and him.  Two guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I should probably explain that a lot of people, MP3,  even more probably AAC, of course, this is an Apple crowd,  and not any for the AUG version.  Anybody, how many of you would...  Currently, I've distributed a 64 kilobit version,  which is a fairly, it actually is a CD quality version.  How many of you listen to the 32 kilobit  or the lower version or would like  an even lower quality version?  You like the high quality version.  Most people have enough bandwidth  that they can download the high quality version.  Finally, if we were to create a merchandising store  at, let's say, ThinkGeek, with T-shirts, mugs, sweatshirts,  Patrick Norton masks, would you buy merchandise?  All right.  Put the guitar on there too.  I'd like to thank Roger McGuinn for being here.  It was so great to have him.  Thank you for having me.  Just a real thrill.  It's a real pleasure.  Patrick, you gotta give back the guitar now, I'm sorry.  Patrick's been like Elvis for most of this podcast.  He's been holding the guitar.  Not playing it, just holding it.  Patrick Norton.  I'm just having to run scales.  Patrick is on TV again on the internet.  Digital.  LifeTV.com.  .com.  David Prager is, of course, working for System  and Revision 3 putting out more IPTV with Kevin Rose.  The great Robert Heron is available at PCmagazine.com.  He's their HDTV king.  Kevin Rose, you wanna tell us anything  about what you're up to?  Because I know you got a lot of projects.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Mostly trying to scale DIG right now.  DIG has really taken off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  DIG is amazing.  D-I-G-G.com.  And we gotta work out a way that I could get you  the show notes so that you have them on DIG.  We'll figure this out.  Right now, it goes out at the same time.  You can always get it off the website,  but you probably want it ahead of time.  Yeah, we'll get it.  We'll figure it out.  John C. Dvorak at dvorak.org slash blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  PC Magazine, Market Watch, here and there.  But dvorak.org slash blog will link to those other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And ladies and gentlemen, does John get any spam?  No spam.  No spam.  John, I get no spam, Dvorak.  And I wanna introduce somebody who we haven't talked to yet.  Ashley, I call him Ashley Twitt.  Ashley Witt, who is a composer.  He's done music for many movies you've seen.  He works with, I was gonna say Richard Burton, Tim Burton,  and a number of other people.  I mean, he's the guy who did this great  doing the Twitt theme.  I just wanna thank you for that, Ashley.  It's just really a great contribution.  How did you come up with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Well, before you started Twitt,  I don't even think you remember it,  but you were in the KFI chat room  and you actually mentioned some of the stuff  that you'd like to hear in a song.  Oh, I did?  I don't remember that.  And you wanted a little guitar, you wanted to be upbeat,  little hip hop-ish, you put a few songs up  for people to listen to.  And pretty much within a few days, I had just like,  what was it, like 30 seconds or something like that,  and I sent you an email, but I didn't hear anything,  so I thought, whatever, I'll just let it go,  somebody will put some music.  And then one of the guys in the chat room,  and I think you were one of them  that pushed it along there, William,  but there were actually a couple that just said,  you need more, you need more, you gotta put more,  you gotta have Leo listen to this.  And then they kept bugging in the chat room.  Once I heard it, I flipped my lid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I must've missed your email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Yeah, oh, well, I'm sure that's easy.  I wasn't too worried about it,  I wasn't gonna send you 50.  Well, please do, next time.  Nobody else was saying that.  But yeah, it was really the chat room,  the guys in the KFI, that Mike B and Dan,  and there's a big gang, and they finally got you to hear it.  Yeah, I'm so glad they did.  So glad they did.  But it was fun, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Those of you who were here live earlier,  you heard Ash perform a little bit of that.  We're gonna close the show with that.  I wanna thank you, Ash, I wanna thank our panel today,  and I really wanna thank the live audience for being here.  Thanks, because we wouldn't do this without you.  Thanks to Apple and the Apple Store San Francisco.  Remember, we're live from now on  at Noonan's Larkspur Landing in beautiful Marin County.  Please come by and say hi anytime.
