Transcript:  I don't know how he does it. It drives me crazy. I gained weight in Oaxaca  Like we were eating chocolate and coffee and tortillas and oh my god, it's the best stuff ever  So good. All right. I said there was news we got to do it. I guess the first story I  Thought we might be like doing wall-to-wall coverage of the aetherium merge like oh my god  Ethereum is crashed. It went so smoothly Thursday  Ethereum which is the I think now you safe to say while Bitcoin gets a lot of the attention  Ethereum is probably the biggest I don't know what its market cap it is  But the but the most popular of the bitcoins is what most NFTs use eat eat eat th  It moved from the very energy costly proof-of-work  system on  Thursday to the proof of stake system saving they say  99% of the energy used and and I'm sure there's a big sigh  From the from the world at this putting a lot of Bitcoin miners  and a business  I  Alex does this part of your portfolio to cover crypto?

Start time: 351.07
End time: 382.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah  In fact, I have a dedicated crypto reporter on my team  So I've been tracking this pretty carefully and what kind of shocked me the most was the smoothness of it  The aetherium merged the move from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, which is a different way of kind of figuring out  What transactions are legit and handing out newly issued tokens?  It was pushed back and pushed back and delayed and delayed  it became almost a joke like when will this ever happen and then it finally did and  Seemingly, you know fingers crossed for everyone else out there without a hiccup. I was very impressed actually

Start time: 384.33
End time: 397.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The bad news is all those guys who spent a lot of money on custom rigs with giant GPUs and a6  To do mining are now finding it unprofitable  So here's what I think that's not a bad thing. Yeah

Start time: 399.82
End time: 430.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not a bad thing anybody who was doing that was  Simply ignoring the environmental costs, which was well documented. They knew what they were doing. They were basically just  I've heard statistics like the mining of Bitcoin generally  Was vastly more energy consuming than all the savings from solar energy combined in the world  So so I I'm not I'm not too torn up about the fact that they that they sort of lost it  Plus as you pointed out they had plenty of warning that this is coming. You want to hear a crazy stat?  This is from Statista

Start time: 432.14
End time: 479.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the average energy consumption for for  Transit a single Bitcoin transaction  Was 2,188 kilowatt hours  2,188 kilowatt hours for one transaction  Which which is this the the little bar to the right?  148 kilowatt hours. That's a hundred thousand visa transactions  So Bitcoin is basically unsustainable now Bitcoin is still on proof of work. It's still using all that energy  Proof of work, it's still using all that energy but according to PC magazine  It's so expensive now to mine Bitcoin nobody's doing it's just hard to find a place where energy is so cheap  That you can do it profitably

Start time: 480.18
End time: 521.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The ethereum move is is really  a point of leadership by ethereum  Where you know, it's getting a ton of press and now that they they're doing this  Uh, the rest of the bitcoin and and cryptocurrency communities will have to they'll have to respond to this because it's  A world in which you can burn that kind of energy  Uh for for bitcoin mining transactions, etc, etc  Um, I I just think it's it's untenable. It's it's unacceptable. It's socially unacceptable and they're gonna have to do  Something about the about the massive energy consumption and again ethereum here is pointing away  So it's it's really a positive thing that did that it was a very risky thing

Start time: 522.04
End time: 531.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course, there's ethereum miners who were making money, uh with proof of work who were upset  Uh, there was talk of a fork the the fork happened

Start time: 533.02
End time: 593.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Alex so I there have been forks of ethereum before  But what's really interesting about the situation and what mike's talking about the pressure essentially from this successful merge  To take the remaining chains that are on proof of work and move them over to proof of stake  Is that it's not just a technology conversation  It's also almost a religious conflict because if you talk to some of these bitcoin maxis or people that really put  Bitcoin above all just because of how it functions  Um proof of work is a very important component to why they think that  And so the argument and i'm not saying that I endorse this but the argument is that now that ethereum has moved to proof of stake  It's effectively more centralized and you can argue that different ways  But the the power of bitcoin such as it is described by its fans is that yes, it is hard to mine  Yes, it is very energy intensive, but it's so spread out around the world that it's essentially bulletproof and there's some  Reasonableness to that but I I end up much closer to where mike is which is saying that  Guys, can can we not if it's a possibility burn all this energy for effectively no reason?

Start time: 595.20
End time: 656.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are you could buy in a bitcoin miner rig  That would heat your house in in scandinavia  It was a little literal. I mean i'm not joking  It was a stove for your house that incidentally would also mine bitcoin it generates that much heat and that's why it's not profitable  It's not economical because electricity is just I mean the the people were really making money with bitcoin mining were you know in china?  Next to hydroelectric dams or the cost of energy was virtually zero  Uh, so this pc magazine says, you know, they've talked to a lot of miners the merge kill it all off  All my stuff is idling now said one miner  Uh, they look at other coins ergo raven coin that that still are on proof of work  But they have so little value that mining them is unprofitable  Almost all the profit I didn't realize this had gone to ethereum. So this was a very important thing very risky  and uh  And it and it worked so amazing. Well done. Well done

Start time: 657.40
End time: 692.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a tie though between climate change and what you just said because if you look at chinese weather in the last couple of months  There's been a historic drought in china, which has led to a decrease in the flow through  Um damnable rivers and in essence that's led to a power crunch in parts of the country over the last couple  Weeks and months so all that cheap power that used to be used for mining bitcoin before the chinese government banned that  Uh ended up kind of going away  And so it's it's there's there's a full circle of uh of cause and effect here with humans trying to do things  That I I appreciated the irony of even if it was quite sad to see an entire country go through such a staggering drought

Start time: 692.72
End time: 782.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, we're going through it here in the west as well  Yeah, um, so  One of the side effects of this is a lot of there are a lot of gpus on ebay right now  And the price the price of gpus is tumbling  Uh, it's it's it's the world has changed in fact. It's cost invidia  substantially  Another story I think somewhat related  one of uh invidia's biggest oem's evga I think more than half of the uh,  Nvidia video cards was sold by evga is is ending its relationship  with evga  With the g force with uh with invidia  So they're going to sell them until they run out of stock, but they're not going to make any more they make power supplies and other things  Apparently there was a little  battle  a little a little bad blood between invidia and uh, and uh evga  They were upset that invidia was undercutting their prices  Uh, they were upset that they're suddenly the the profit margin collapsed as the gpu market collapsed as bitcoin  Mining collapsed and so they're just getting out of the business. Here's uh, here's the gross margin  Uh, the light blue is the people who make invidia cards  Based on the invidia platform and sell them the blue one is invidia  Its margin went up while theirs went to almost nothing over the last 20 years

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah  Uh invidia themselves hurting their stock prices have tumbled as well. They had an excess inventory of cards  they will next week have gtc their big conference and they're expected to announce the uh,  4 000 line of uh  Video cards they've been using the rtx 3000 for the last couple of years so  You know, but it's it's now it's mostly just you know gaming invidia does have a good business in self-driving vehicles  And ai

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm curious about this. So I need to buy a new gaming pc  Which I know is always dicey territory on twitter because everyone here knows more about pc's than I do  Um, but I didn't for a while because you know  All the ethereum kiddos were buying up all their graphics cards and I didn't want to get into that fight  Uh is now a good time to build a new pc or should I still wait?  I'm not sure where we are on chip shortages

Start time: 848.74
End time: 893.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there are a lot of gpus out there  But I think a lot of them have seen some heavy use  They've been rode hard and put away wet as as the saying goes  So I don't wouldn't go to ebay to get one but it has certainly uh, I think tanked the prices when the 4 000 is announced  Next week probably won't come out for a month or two  Uh, you probably see 3 000 prices go down and a good 30 80  Is going to get you a very it's going to be good for a gaming rate you have  So you're in your little see I know more about you than I used to  That's true. You're now in your little house out in the backyard. Yes where I used to sun in my youth  Uh, and as I remember there are quite a few little gaming things  Do you just sit out there and play games until somebody notices and then you file copy?

Transcript:  Oh, man, I I if  Yeah, that would be great  I hear about I hear about  That's research alex see carolina's honestly there  No, but people always talk about how people have these jobs. They don't do anything. I have never  Managed to find one of those jobs. And so no I the the gaming rigs out here  You have to I have to I mean i'm i'm leading a team. We're doing a big conference.

Just as a warning point like the game is still being expanded tweaked and really great  Yeah, does it actually look like this? Yes. It looks just like that. Um satisfactory though  That's the first person builder for factories, right? Yeah that threw me because I played factorio which is top down

Transcript:  This is a game. However that I shall never play pen and teller as a joke  Some years ago meant a game called desert bus  And the whole premise of the game is you'd get in the bus  And you drive by the way, your driver is alex. Hey, hey alex  Why haven't we crashed yet? No, no, this is the game  This is the game for hours  This is an eight hour video on youtube  This is the game  Wow  Oh, it's night now. It's night. Okay, so we just you know, it's a little change of scenery  Uh, I don't even know if you have to steer to be honest with you. It's just  I it was a parody but it's kind of legendary now bus desert bus. It was on sega  This is a playthrough by the way  Which means that it's an eight hour video of that and then you I guess you arrive  I guess you arrive.

Uh the gtx 4000 next week from invidia  gtc  Uh, we will probably not cover that stream  But uh, I think it'll be something to watch and it might be uh, I think you're gonna see a  General drop in older video cards because of the 4000 and because of this  ethereum merge

Transcript:  So the laws of evga a big deal because I was on some some gaming subreddits and people were pretty cut up about this  And to me as a as one level nerd above knowing that I was a little perplexed by because I thought they were all in  Nvidia cards and turns out I was wrong and no invidia is a foundry

Start time: 1345.36
End time: 1359.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they design them  And then they have a bunch of people who make the cards evga's  Revenue is 80 percent g force gpus  So it's huge because they're basically turning their back on their business

Start time: 1360.36
End time: 1431.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  80 percent of their business the the the the press kind of played up the acrimony between the these former partners  But but the reality is that the that the business is changing  uh in in a bad way so the the the part the part that uh,  that uh invidia is  Doing is great as you can see from that chart what that chart doesn't show you it shows you the declining gross margins  Uh for the manufacturer, but it doesn't show you the rapidly rising costs for design and manufacturing and all that stuff. So  it's it's it's really the the  The risk here is that  The price in the future where there's a glut now  because of what we're talking about but there's a there's a risk in the future that the price of of of these uh,  Of these cards is going to go through the roof because  they're so  complex now and so difficult to to to design and manufacture that  Uh, it's it's hard to believe that any company is really going to want to be in this business, right?  Unless they're really getting um, you know much higher gross margins than  Than than we see here. Um  It's it's just it's just not a great business anymore invidia.

So does artificial intelligence machine learning  So I guess it's really about a transition to some degree

Transcript:  Uh intel is in much the same boat, right?  Yeah, they they kind of hit rock bottom  uh this week and uh  They're desperately trying to figure out what to do  Next they've kind of split their business into foundry and fab they they're they've decided, you know for a long time  Their prop their value proposition was we design and we build our own chips  Uh that integration though some say ben thompson has been quite vocal about this kept them from innovating  At the speed that a company like tsmc which only builds chips was able to innovate tsmc  Had all this revenue for companies like apple  Uh, and they were able to take that revenue invent new processes  Uh come up with some very sophisticated chip manufacturing stuff that intel couldn't do didn't do they didn't have the revenue to do that  And so they lapped intel and intel's, you know pack under pat gelsinger. They're they're a new relatively new ceo  Has decided well, we're going to try two businesses. We want to be a foundry  In fact, he said we we could make apple's chips. We want to make apple's chips  They're they're breaking ground on a giant fab now that the chips act passed  the 52 billion dollar subsidy act from  Washington passed a couple of weeks ago until now is going ahead on its 20 billion dollar  Factory because some of that will be federally subsidized in in arizona  so it we are in

Transcript:  No  They said well, you know, we're gonna keep uh, we're gonna they pretty much buy up as much of the production  This tsmc can come up with and it's to their credit. You know apple just released and you were there. I know  Um  At the at the event in cupertino a couple of weeks ago carolina. They just announced the new iphone  Uh as far it's hard to tell because apple doesn't give unit sales out or anything like that  Uh, and it is true if you didn't order  on friday  of last week  Uh, you may not have picked one up on the 16th as I did  It's you might be waiting till november at this point. I don't I haven't looked at the lead times  But I think apple was able to make as many phones as they want you think

I'm gonna buy it outright  I'm gonna choose any care you kind of click a lot of boxes to find out when you're gonna get this no apple care  Finally, uh october 25th. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. Wow is right  So maybe they aren't able to get as many chips as they'd like out of tsmc

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know if is if a supply versus demand. I think that although i'm sure that apple took this into account  that the  dynamic island  Uh as much as I wish still, um that they gave it a different name  Um is really getting a broader appeal than not just the camera  I think the pro max has always been the device that was either for people that really wanted  Everything and more from the camera and the larger size now  Now you have the 14 plus that would take care of people that just wanted, you know a larger model  But not necessarily all the bells and whistles and the price point that comes with it  uh, and the the dynamic island just gives a different vibe to the the whole phone, um, and I think yes  Just broaden the appeal. So i'm not surprised that the pro is  You know into november for delivery if you combine the fact that early adopters tend to  Ask for higher devices and buy, you know higher spec devices. That's what you have in pre-orders usually  You know people don't usually kind of rush into pre-order for

Transcript:  The the entry-level models. I should also point out that it may not be  the tsmc a 16 or a 15 for the  Of a for the apple 14 and 14 plus that are in short supply but these legacy nodes  This is actually the bigger problem is these older  You know chips nobody's making them or they're making them slowly or there's a shortage  So it may just be the like the accelerometer. We can't get the accelerometer chip  Uh, that may be the problem that may be the shortage  Uh, I I like the dynamic island by the way carolina. Did you like do you like I do too?  Yeah, I don't even mind the name although it's a little gilligan's islandy but

Transcript:  It sounds like a reality show. Yeah, I I  the other the other thing that is a sort of wild card for apple and for lots of other companies that are trying to to  sell electronic products at massive scale like apple does  Is china which has become a very um, kind of unreliable place because of their zero zero covid policy which still exists  Right. So if somebody sneezes in a factory, they shut the whole thing down  They trap everybody inside and they stay that way for three weeks or whatever  It's really a bad deal and that's it's largely driven at this point by xi jing ping and the upcoming  Communist party conference where he's going to be installed as emperor for life or whatever  And he doesn't want any sort of covid bad news. And so he's willing to  jettison their economy to a certain extent  To keep the covid numbers down  The other place where this affects  Manufacturing is that some of these lockdowns some of these slowdowns are still happening in chinese ports  so  Not only are electronics having to come out of chinese ports many of the components from elsewhere outside of china have to come into china  So they can be put together with chinese components by chinese workers and then shipped out  So if there's slowdowns in the ports that they lock down the ports because of covid or whatever  Um, it's it's not that it it's likely that it's not going to be that bad, but there's no way for apple to know  uh exactly how  You know what's going to be shut down? What what's going to be uh, go into lockdown? It's just unpredictable at this point

Start time: 1871.38
End time: 1904.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's not good. And of course apple is as a result building plants in vietnam and india brazil  Uh, they're they're trying to expand out of china, but that's going to take a while before they can do that  Yes, right, I should point out that you can get the low-end iphone 14 tuesday  so  I guess it's you know, and I think it's always the case that the early sales are to  Dummies like me the uh enthusiasts who buy the higher end phones and the less expensive phones are uh, pretty much available  In fact, you could get it tomorrow if you wanted to go down to the store  so

Transcript:  So I I have a question leo because I was watching the apple event as I always do and paid attention and I  I can buy a new phone if I want and I have a purple 12. I think I think it's purple 12  I don't know. I like it. It's fine. It's not a it's not a pro. It's not a max. It's just 12  I'm cheap and take terrible photos. I'm not the target demographic for this, but i'm just curious like

Start time: 1949.14
End time: 2017.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, then  uh  I'll speak and i'll let carolina who is more expert on this  But I think this you are fine with what you got  And I think this has been the case for about three or four years with apple that we're you know, we're really at a plateau  Okay, they had the dynamic island but that's kind of like putting fins on a cadillac, you know, it's it's it's uh, it's it's  It's a aesthetic thing but it doesn't add to the real functionality of the phone  It's got a faster processor face. I noticed face id is faster than on my i- I went from a 12 as well  My iPhone 12 I noticed  Maybe you know the camera in the hands of people really know what they're doing  You could take advantage of those 48 megapixel  Pro raw photos and do something interesting i've seen some really interesting  Things on the halide site and stuff, but most people aren't going to notice any difference. I think it is a thousand dollar  Expenditure most people won't need to make and because of you know, economic woes probably won't make so  I expect apple to have a little fewer sale. What do you think carolina? You think this will be a  A slow quarter for apple slower than usual

Start time: 2018.20
End time: 2142.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I I don't think so for a couple of reasons one  I agree what you said as far as the enhancement, you know for a lot of people if you had the 13  You're fine, right? It is not really that you need to certainly the 13. Yeah  Let's remember though that the phone is still  a very  Emotional purchase for a lot of consumers, right?  Is part of your status it is a way to show that you have the latest and greatest so there's that kind of  Visceral, you know part of you that has nothing to do with that whether or not you need it  Or if it's any better than what you had before you just go through the motions  I think there is a lot of carrier support right now  Not just for the latest model, but even last year if I can get everybody onto 5g networks  They will so you see a lot of promotions and lastly, you know very few people in the us still buy a phone  You know outright they all have it on an installment plan. So  upgrading your phone  doesn't really see  A huge, you know pay out as he used to even when you have to buy and pay  Tax on it and then you know do your installment payments  So for a lot of consumer you're talking about adding five six dollar maybe to what their payment for last year was right last year  Model, so I don't know that apple would necessarily feel  the pain of of of the recession  Because they already have the higher chunk of the market from a from a disposable income perspective type consumer, right?  so, you know, they never seem to suffer and  Overall the mobile market has always been pretty resilient  Because we are so dependent on phones. And so although you might see maybe a slow down in replacement  So a lengthening of the cycle of maybe two three months  Um, I I don't think that the market will will suffer

Transcript:  Uh, I mean apple is really good at shipping away at market share a couple weeks ago  They rose to about 50 percent for the first time in the u.s  Yeah, in the u.s  and so one of the things that I think  Is driving that is other apple devices  Become so compelling the m1  Macbook pros were super compelling to the kind of people who switch around between you know, a microsoft device or chromebook or whatever  Uh people like me I switch from a chromebook to to a macbook pro because I just had to have it  It was so good  and so, you know back in the old days I used to switch back and forth between an android phone and an iphone  no more the combination of the  The degree to which I love my apple watch and the degree to which I need a a macbook now  Uh means I and and I've always loved the ipad  I really it doesn't make any sense for me to have anything other than an iphone and I think a lot of people are  Slowly making that decision. I was  You know, we were in provance with with with some folks a couple weeks ago and I was just listening to conversation  These are not super techie  Folks for the most part and they were talking about their phones and and about half had iphones about half had android phones  But the android phone users what we're all saying? Yeah my next phone. I'm just going to get an iphone  and so I think there's there's there's a lot of  Sort of trading over from from android to apple that is just kind of a constant  They just are always growing their market share  And again, I think it's the I think it's a larger apple environment that that drives that you said something interesting carolina. I want to pursue

Start time: 2248.74
End time: 2258.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, you said there's a lot of support from the carriers because they want to move people to 5g  Is that a marketing thing or is there a technical reason they they want to get on the 5g networks?

End time: 2268.68

Start time: 2273.76
End time: 2318.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, and then there's a  There's just an efficiency from a network perspective that for the carriers  They just want to move, you know as many people as possible on the 5g network  um, just for efficiency reasons so  Um that you've seen even the the trade in  Numbers this year 800 to a thousand dollars, although i'm not quite sure what you need to trade in to get that  You probably need to trade in a 2013 pro max to get that number because I traded in  Uh 2002 so, uh, sorry an iphone 12  Pro max and I got 320 dollars so nowhere near, you know d8 and a thousand bucks, but  They're they're the most generous that we've seen so far

Start time: 2319.56
End time: 2361.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I have to say I was skeptical about 5g apple was promoting it like crazy two or three events. Well now they are  Yeah, but I have to say, uh  I'm on t-mobile. Uh, I have family members in verizon in both cases that mid-band 5g is becoming more and more available  And it really is fast. It's 100 megabits 150 megabits. It's as fast as you'd ever want  It's certainly as fast as your home network for a lot of people faster  Um mike, I I want to follow on what you said though  Uh, because you're traveling around the world. I I believe it in the u.s that people you know, we're affluent more affluent country  They're buying more iphones, but that's not the case around the world right android still dominant around the world

Start time: 2362.60
End time: 2425.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  absolutely and and  uh there there there's been a flurry of  Uh  Analyst sort of charts showing what percentage of your annual income?  You have to spend to buy an iphone  And in the u.s, it's like, you know, it's like 1.5 percent on average something like that in some countries. It's 50 percent  Uh, and even even some wealthy european countries. It's three four five percent  and so you really don't see the kind of uh, uh, uh uptick for iphone's  Abroad here in spain you see them, but it's not like in the u.s. Um, you you they're kind of a  relative rarity  And so yeah, it's just it's purely it's purely a cost thing. They're pretty cheap in the u.s  I think the only other countries that are cheaper like  luxembourg  Uh as a percentage of income, right and countries like that. So if you go all this is this is an eye-opening statistic  Yeah, lots of work in switzerland

Start time: 2425.70

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  69.12 percent. Of course, nobody's going to buy an iphone 14. There's no way you would do that unless you're a very wealthy nigerian  So it's it's really um, uh, you know the the global market really belongs to android. Yeah

Start time: 2445.92
End time: 2492.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's also a big difference in markets outside the u.s of the percentage of people that have a prepay  Contract versus a you know a monthly contract  So, you know once you go to prepay you don't have all the advantages of paying  Installments and you know discounts because they can't lock you in  And that is obviously favoring more aggressive price. Lee priced android phones  There's also more variety outside of the u.s  I always get depressed whenever I go over to nwc in barcelona and see all the other  Manufacturers and and I remember when I lived in the uk, you know, there's much more variety of  brands and and models and price points that there is in in the u.s and that's always been the case

Start time: 2494.02
End time: 2508.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's the carriers also because the carriers here  Really push certain brands. Absolutely. They push the big flagship phones  They make more money on them and I think you walk in the door at any carrier store  You're probably going to be offered an iphone first

He said gnome  And to which lisa my wife said I love gnome and I said I love gnome too  gnome  Our sponsor for this segment of this week in tech is a great way not to diet  But to understand why you eat how you eat  And so that you can eat more healthily when we decide to lose weight  It shouldn't just be about a number on the scale. It should be about  learning to eat right and gnome's  psychology first approach focuses on  That they empower you to build a more sustainable  habit a relationship with food  That that has lasting results to date and it really works it worked for me  I lost 20 pounds lisa didn't have as much to lose, but she's kept it off. She's at the lowest weight  She's been in 30 years  Noom weight has helped more than 3.6 million people lose weight  But every one of us is different and that's what's so great about noom  Your daily lessons are personalized to you and your goals  The program is based on scientific principles things like cbt cognitive behavioral therapy  Which really is about helping you understand your relationship with food. Thanks to noom. I realized that you know  I ate pretty well when I was paying attention  It was the fog eating that was getting me  I wasn't almost wasn't even aware of it i'd come home and i'd stuff some food in my mouth because I was hungry or tired  Or tense or stressed and it was that extra cal those extra calories that were putting me over the top  Noom does not say you can or can't eat any particular foods and I really liked that too  In fact early on in noom, you know, you get with noom you get you get the app  You track your food  You have your lessons in there the little readings and you can set it to be as many minutes a day as you want  Just a few minutes or I think it's no more than 15 minutes a day of reading  But you also get a counselor and you also get a group that you can  Cooperate, you know work towards goals with and things like that. I told my counselor  This is in the first maybe a couple of weeks of noom. I feel terrible. I eat a hot dog  She said what's wrong with that? No, no bad foods  Just you know, keep on keep on doing it what you're doing  It's a non-restrictive food program that focuses on progress not perfection  You choose what support you want from five-minute daily check-ins to personal coaching  Off days are totally okay. In fact as I progressed through noom they started bonusing me. It was so great. They say okay  You could do anything you want today. It's a bonus day. But the funny thing is  Even though I had the freedom to eat all the junk I wanted  Because i've been doing noom I kind of had this awareness of what I was eating and I didn't go wild  It's kind of nice to know I could have if I want noom weight helps you get back on track. No matter what happens  95 percent of customers say noom weight is a good long-term solution  At least it's been on maintenance for a year and it's really still working for her. She's she's still active  It's very interesting. She's i'm kind of impressed. They publish more than 30 peer-reviewed scientific articles  To show users other practitioners scientists the public about what they're doing and how it works and why it works  It has totally changed my relationship with food. I'm much more conscious when I eat  One of the things I learned from noom and lisa and I both do we put our phones away  We turn off the tv we sit down we chew when we enjoy our food. We taste it  We sometimes we close our eyes while we're eating it. It makes a huge difference  Stay focused on what's important to you with noom weights psychology based approach  It worked for us. It worked for our friend  Sign up for your trial today noom.com  Slash twit try it really trust me  N-double-om.com  Slash twit sign up for your trial today. Thank you noom for all you've done for us. We really appreciate it  Thanks for supporting this week  in tech  I'm pressing the join button on facebook science  If I can't be on facebook, at least I can be on facebook science, right?

Oh, I don't have an account  Oh well  Oh well  so, uh other big news little uh,  Guy, uh, his name is dylan lived up the road a bit grew up in sonoma county  Uh, he's 30 years old now when he was about three the family bought him a computer. He really took to it. He loved it  Wasn't a great student. It wasn't until he uh gotten that, you know first robotics program in high school  That he kind of really thought about technology. It was kind of this is really cool  um  he uh  Went, you know, he couldn't get into cal. He didn't have great grades in school  He did get into brown university. I'm not sure how but he got into brown university  So he went there you may remember a few years ago  Uh a a guy named peter teal who had a little bit of money because peter teal  Uh was an early investor in facebook. Do you remember this mike? You probably about 2012  Teal put together a fund saying if you drop out of college, i'll give you a hundred thousand dollars

Transcript:  Yeah, uh, that was ill advised. So uh dylan took the money. He was in his junior year at brown  And with a a friend of his also at brown they started a little company their first  Idea was drones to monitor traffic laws  And then the  Uh, you know, maybe there's not maybe there's not a business here. I don't know but  You know, we got we got a little money. Let's uh, let's design a web-based graphics design program  They call it figma  A design platform for teams who build products together didn't make a lot of money at first  They were in above a gas station a small office. I'm sorry above a bar a small office  It got so noisy after three o'clock on fridays  They had all had to go home because the bar was just too loud to get any work done  Until a few years ago. He was you know living in the mission district in san francisco  Buying one dollar cup of coffees on his way to work working really hard  But it things started to turn about four years ago. They were able to raise money  Enough money in fact to value the company. I think at about a hundred million dollars  Which good money right  Then a few years after that  Uh, it continued I think because of mostly because of coveted  Oh good. Yeah, they uh, they had a valuation round that got them to wow ten billion dollars  Still, you know a lot of times founders raise this money, but doesn't mean they're gonna live a lavish lifestyle  But that was good and that coveted really helped this little design company do very well  Adobe started to notice because this company started to take money out of adobe's pockets  In fact last year 400 million dollars in revenue and you have to think that most of that money that went to figma  Was money that adobe didn't make on photoshop and illustrator  And in design  So adobe started to think well, we got to do something about this guy  This week adobe announced they're buying dylan field's company for 20 billion dollars  One of the biggest companies in the world  One of the largest acquisitions, I think the largest acquisition of a of a web company ever  He has 10 percent. He's got two billion dollars half of it in cash half of it in adobe stock  That's too bad about the adobe stock part, but uh, because adobe took adobe stock tanked as a result  But this is one of those stories where you know what this guy did. All right  And uh, and i'm kind of happy now. It's not a done deal. They still have to get through regulator approval and all that but

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It'll it'll probably go through and and timing is everything because basically  The reason i'm certain i'm certain the reason that adobe really wants this company is that right now with remote work  With digital nomads and many of whom are digital creators and designers  uh, and with the the need to collaborate in the cloud like this this um,  offering  Enables  That's where it's at and adobe is is nowhere in that space and so adobe is is uh,  It's still kind of living in the past of of when everybody shows up to an office  And those days are over essentially for many many creators. And so  This is a golden  Idea just it's one of those ideas. That's exactly the right idea at exactly the right time  And they are really uh, you know, it's really paying off

They had to move from the boxed software  To subscription as much as people didn't like it and I think as much as people don't like the idea of them buying figma  They they probably it's probably an existential crisis for them.

Transcript:  I think what the market didn't like is the evaluation not necessarily the purchase itself billion  Dollars. Yeah, I think that you know and they waited say six months as people  Settle into a more hybrid versus remote workplace  That evaluation could have been lower. I think that's what people are taking  um, you know a negative, uh  Kind of take on on the deal versus whether or not adobe is doing the right thing because aside from what mike was saying about  You know hybrid work is here to stay. It is also true that  We all are more creators than we were before right content has become part of  What you need to come up with no matter what?  Job you have as a knowledge worker, right?  And I think that's the other trend that we see that that I think adobe is taking  You know is looking at taking a chunk out  and not to have  Special skills so you don't have to necessarily have people dedicated to I don't know coming up with social media  designs for your ads or your post or you know coming up with  Infographic for a new report that you've done  You know all of that is now part of you know a writer's job or especially for for smaller  Companies where you don't necessarily have dedicated people doing that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I I do I I don't think adobe has it in them to to create something that  Would be just like this and do it quickly enough or i'm not even sure they could ever do it exactly like this is pretty lean company  And it's a pretty uh, you know  It's got a lot it gets a lot of praise for its usability and its user interface and so on  um  Um  Now the I I suspect that the reason that the market isn't thrilled is that they don't trust adobe  To to own this company in the right way. They're saying all the right things  They're saying we're going to keep it completely separate. We're going to keep the team in place. We're not going to change anything  We're not going to change the pricing. We're not going to do any of that stuff  but  Whenever a company acquires another company, they always say those sorts of things  And they might stick to it for a year or two in two years  um  This guy is going to probably leave and start another company. His contract will be up and  After a year or two or three years  The promises the mindset that they had when they made the acquisition is all gone and they will use this  Uh the people the technology the customers and all that stuff in whatever way suits adobe's interests  And their shareholders and so on so, you know  The fact that they're saying they're going to keep the pricing  Okay  They may or may not they probably won't in a few years. They'll probably jack it up and make it expensive like every other adobe product  Uh that they may move to adobe like uh payment, uh, you know subscription  models and so on  but for the time being it's it's I think it's a it's a good move for adobe simply because this is where  Uh, this is where the world is and it very well could be that this  Uh product could become adobe's  flagship product in five years  It's possible  um  Time will tell now the best case scenario is they they do a lot of integration so that adobe  tools  work seamlessly within this  Environment and that would be great. But um, I think it's good for everyone involved  I think it's likely that the regulators will allow to go through and uh, you know, I think it's kind of  The only downside is a lot of the customers for figma  One of the things they loved about it was that it was like that. It was not adobe

Start time: 3815.80

Transcript:  Yeah, so, uh, and let me ask you alex. Is it a good because you cover business it seems okay, so  20 billion dollars  That's a kind of a significant amount of money for a company that only has  Four and a half billion in revenue  Uh last quarter, uh  That's more than their annual revenue  Furthermore, uh, it's a lot more than figma makes it's uh, it's arr last year was 400 million as I said  Uh, it takes a lot of 400 millions to get to 20 billion

Start time: 3876.40
End time: 3886.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It absolutely does but I don't think you should think about that in those terms  I don't think revenue is the number you want to use in this case  And I say that as someone who's a huge fan of using revenue multiples to value companies

Start time: 3886.36
End time: 3893.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, don't you yeah multiple of a beta?  Uh, but that's this is a multiple. I can't remember. I saw the number like 50x. It's a huge 50x arr

Start time: 3895.76
End time: 3959.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For the end of adobe's fiscal, um year which ends november 30th  But what matters here more is adobe bet roughly 13 14 percent of its market cap on figma huge because it was worth like 170  It's been sold for it's buying for 20  To me that is actually a pretty reasonable chunk of the company to bet on something that could become  The sort of threat that mike's describing and the thing that I that's been stressed to me by folks in the space  Is that it isn't like figma was out to?  You know immediately cannibalize all of adobe's revenues  But instead because it was designed to be worked on in a collaborative environment and had a fundamentally different architecture  Than adobe products which are designed for single person use and so adobe needed something  For the future and in defensive capacity and critically figma is cash flow positive  So once you buy it, it doesn't continue to leech from your cash flow  And I think that is a pretty important distinction and it's growing at about 100 per cent per year  So 100 per cent per year growth sure. It's expensive, but you're only betting 13 and 14 14 percent of the company  Um, I think it's a great move. I think investors are being morons. I love it

Start time: 3960.83

Transcript:  um  I think your point alex is defensive right? I mean go ahead at carolina

Start time: 3965.76
End time: 4019.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I was just gonna say the point that alex just made about the back end and now that is organized for true collaboration  I think um is critical right because that might actually well  Be the you know, one of the reasons for adobe  Acquisition because they can take then their products as well a use of the same back end presumably or parts of it  To deploy that for better collaboration even on their products  This is the when we talk hybrid work everybody gets fixed on the you know, you're in the office. You're at home  That's not really what it is  The hybrid work is how you work and how much more in the cloud our workflows are and this is not going away  Right. So for adobe to get  To be part of that to empower people to truly collaborate  In this new environment. Um, I think this shit seems like a very good shortcut

Start time: 4020.50
End time: 4060.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the sad thing though carolina is that  I think it's a smart deal from adobe's perspective right like to me  They had to pay a premium on the lost private valuation  We all expected to go for a relatively high amount given the quality of the business itself, etc  But i'm bummed that figma didn't  Turn them down and try to kill them because the whole point of startups like why I care about them  Why I watch these little baby companies is because they potentially grow up to become incumbent killers  And in this case adobe used historically hoarded wealth, which is fines corporation to essentially buy out the competition  And so we're not going to see adobe get superseded. We're going to see adobe more entrenched and that just

Start time: 4062.24

Transcript:  Makes me kind of sad. Isn't that one reason lena con and the ftc may stop this  Uh, you know, they're looking at facebook's acquisition of  uh instagram  Same thing to kill a rival  And they're wishing they could roll that back they're wishing they had looked at it a little bit more closely when it happened for a bill  It was a billion. I remember we were  Blown away a guest at one billion  Uh dollars, so do you think this new regulatory?  attitude in washington might  Stop this for that reason alone because it is about to put a competitor out of business

Start time: 4096.86
End time: 4143.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the only thing i'll say is here and I know mike has a strong opinion  I want to get his take on on why he's so positive on on the deal going through  But the reason why I would be in that direction is that no one talks about adobe  In in washington if you if you read, uh, you know transcripts of congressional hearings and so forth  It's the big five american companies and tiktok. Yeah, and um  I don't recall adobe coming up once it's kind of a sideshow because it's not a platform in the operating system sense  It doesn't have a social network that politicians can grandstand against and so it kind of sits to the side and does its thing  so maybe maybe lena con will  Keep her fire focused somewhere else and if she does then it goes through  um  I never thought i'd be you know voting for an opinion here  But like I hope she does block it because then figma would have to kind of go away and make me happier

Transcript:  I just I want to uh to to uh, support what alex said, which is that  basically  Anti-trust big big anti-trust actions, you know big moves like blocking and acquisition like this has become  political and and  I don't think washington  Has the understanding to to basically is kind of arbitrary to a certain extent  What they block and they tend to go after the big the big name  Of social networks and the big tech giants and and they don't they barely know who adobe is  They they don't really care that much. There's no constituents  Demanding that they you know stop their steamrolling of the industry. Nobody really cares about this  And so I think it's just going to go through simply because they want to pick their battles and the battles that they want to have  Are with you know apple google, etc. Amazon bigger bigger fish to fry

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh, you know and and that that is such and that is such a soft statement  To say against a competitor. He probably had in the back of his mind at all times that this could be a  significant possibility  And so, you know even even after the acquisition in even during the announcement both they and adobe are saying  They're we're going to keep their independent cultures. They're essentially saying exactly what that tweet said. Yeah, and so  It was really you know, the press is is making that tweet sound like it's a you know, uh,  Shot over adobe's bow in the past.

I agree  You don't have to sell to an aging giant that barely pulled off a sass transition to have the silicon valley model work  In fact, that's not how the majority of the wealth was made in silicon valley was made via ipos of companies that ended up becoming  new giants not selling out  Um for a smaller dollar amount than you could in another two or four years  Not that I blame dylan for collecting the bag to be clear like shout out if someone offered me 20 billion dollars

They all want the next thing  Uh, and they don't have a lot of patience for the current thing and this is true of dylan  He's gonna you know, like I said in a couple years is gonna two three years is gonna have another  Startup that he wants to be a hot startup  And then and of course all the venture money wants to just turn that around  This is a big big payoff for them bigger than they probably expected  And they want to take that money and invest in the next, you know such thing and they want to accelerate accelerate accelerate  And so this is kind of you know, the the days in which you know a bunch of engineers, uh,  Leave fairchild semiconductor and found intel  Uh, okay, you know that that that world has been transformed into a much faster  uh much shorter term thinking kind of a  Culture at the same time because of that culture because it's kind of toxic  There are lots of new entrepreneurs who are trying to avoid vc and trying to bootstrap their operations make revenue right away  This is was almost one of them because they were they're actually not you know, they're not like, uh, you know  Uber or something like that just burning cash  They were actually making money, but a lot of companies trying to do that without the vc pressure  So the vcs are pushing for this sort of exit  And somebody like dylan is probably pushing for this kind of exit  it's a bummer for all the legions of fans of this of this platform and also  The the the employees of this company who are kind of missionaries, you know, they're like they're they're really they've really been on a mission  to to to change how  how  Digital collaborative work happens and so it's kind of a bummer with them to a certain extent  But this is how silicon valley works.

To acquire what could be the thing that's going to put the nail in your coffin, right?

We're over that  You know people want their own autonomy  They want to choose if they have roommates that want to choose them and not have a company choose them for for them  I just think it's a terrible idea  I don't think it scales now that the the the the problem is that he took all that  We work money and he he owns the property.

That he does for mint mobile. They're so good. I just love it  they  do  wireless  Right, they save you money  and I mean  I have to say when I first heard about mint mobile and it was  $15 a month for premium wireless service. I said that no, come on. There's there's an upside  Somewhere there's there's secret fees. There's something I thought what's the catch?  But you know what? I've been using their service now for i'm almost on my second year of mint mobile  And because their secret sauce is the first company to sell wireless service online only they're cheap  They're like the scots and the genovese  They it's they're cheap  They cut out the cost of retail stores. They pass along those sweet savings  Uh directly to you and I am so happy  I was able to get an iphone se from them for 15 bucks a month  wireless service for 15 bucks a month  30 bucks a month  Unbelievable  And you get a phone. That's great. So you can bring your own phone if you want  They're going to give you the best rate whether you're buying for a single person or a family  In fact at mint family line started two lines and it doesn't actually have to be your family  It could just be your friends your roommates your college  Sweetheart all plans come with unlimited talk and text on the nation's largest 5g network. I'll tell you now  It's it's team mobile  So if you get great team mobile service where you are and you probably do because they're really doing a great job  Get it for less unlimited talk and text high speed data delivered on the nation's largest 5g network. Look at your bill  Find out how much data you use every month then don't pay extra buy just the data you need you get four gigs a month  for 15 bucks  That's a lot.

And if you want more you can get more see there it is four gigs for 15 10 gigs for 20  15 gigs for 25.

Well, you can't just go and get a sim but you can activate  up to eight e-sims on uh on your phone  I think it's up to two at the same time  So there are there are ways and I think that e-sim is the the way forward  Apple always has this strength of you know from a negotiation perspective to really twist  The the carrier's arms and and let them do what others have been trying to do because  You know e-sims have been around for a long time and especially in other markets  And multiple sims as well  but  You know for for the u.s  Is is one of the things that consumers don't necessarily think about to too much but in markets like europe  You can get eight different virtual sims in the at&t

I look look at the experience you had  Upgrading it was so easy  So the way I got this phone the only way I could get a phone day and date was  To go pick it up at the iphone store down in Marin. So I went down to Cordo Madera  And I was a little nervous because uh, you know, they give you a qr code for your appointment  You have to be there between 3 30 and 3 45 in my case. So I show up I show the guy my qr code  And he says get in line. I thought oh god, there's all these people ahead of me. I timed it was eight minutes  When I bought the first iphone, it was more than eight hours in line  So eight minutes not so bad, but here's the amazing thing  Uh, it I it said, okay, uh, see your old phone  Do you want to transfer the team mobile account from your old phone to a new phone? Yep. I said yeah  Said okay. You're good phone calls will now start ringing on your iphone 14  It was that easy  At the apple store. They said yeah at the apple store.

It does not have an e-sim carrier  So that's going to be the problem australia austria the czech republic germany hungary india japan  Poland but by the way, not every carrier in these countries romania spain switzerland  The united kingdom and in the u.s. Most carriers  support  uh e-sims  but the quick transfer  And not quite so many right?

I don't know if an mvno can use a uh an e-sim or not  Probably can but um  The great thing about google phi and especially now that they have unlimited is like you just tell them  Hey, send me five of them and they send you five sim cards.

Thank you very much  I mean i'm the idiot who had a comcast  Router in my apartment for eight years that I didn't realize paying like 10 bucks a month for so like i'm i'm not  I i'm not the smart customer here  But my question is about the move to e-simst and listen to the conversation  It seems like it's easier to generally speaking swap  So does this mean that apple is setting a little bit of precedent to later on free us somewhat from our  Locked in carrier contracts or am I misreading or perhaps being too optimistic about what this change could mean there was some

Transcript:  But to me this this move seemed to to eliminate  Um, you know the physical sim that's the bigger move than the e-sim part because they already had an e-sim they had both  Um, but the move to eliminate is kind of like how they eliminated, you know floppy disks and stuff like that  Everyone's like whoa wait, what are you doing? And you're saying can't imagine a world without uh, you know  Three and a half inch floppies and apple said nope  Floppiness is the is the future floppy-less-ness  And so we're just going to cut them out and that's what this is really all about  They're shocking the industry with this thing saying no more sim cards.

And so yes, you can switch but there's also number portability that come into play and and I I don't know that carriers have said  necessarily  Uh what they're willing to do?  Going forward when it comes to e-sim. So in other words, yes, I can switch but whether or not, you know where i'm going  Is going to be able to give me the same number or if I have to pay something in order to take the number with me  As is the case today with most carriers

Transcript:  Silicon valley ceo by your earlier logic likes to smoke smoke the tobacco  as they say  our show  A little too much lore our show today brought to you by  Blueland you want to do the right thing? I know you want to do the right thing  We do too. We're trying to eliminate single-use plastics in our house. We don't use, you know plastic bags anymore  We use paper bags all that stuff, but there is an area of of single-use plastics. That's really appalling  Did you know that an estimated five billion with a b plastic hand soap?  And cleaning bottles are thrown away every year in covet we move didn't move away from the bar soap to the hand soap  But you use it up you throw it away five billion  Thrown away every year  And if that's not bad enough, most of what's being transported in those bottles is water 90 percent  The active ingredient is only 10 percent  So here's a better way blueland  Blueland  We now do all our squirters all our our surface cleaners our window cleaners laundry detergent  Dish detergent everything from blueland blueland is on a mission to eliminate single-use plastics by reinventing home essentials that are good for you  And good for the planet  You buy the what they call their lifetime bottles. They're beautiful forever bottles  for the hand soap their heavy glass so that you could squirt them and for the  The you know surface cleaner and the window cleaner. It's light plastic, but they last forever when you use them up  instead of  You know throwing it away  They send you a little tablet. It's like a little fizzy tablet that you throw in there  You add your own water so they're not transporting all that water uselessly  And you've got a whole new bottle of this. It's so great. They smell great. They work great  And and and blueland's innovated tablet refill solution takes one-tenth the space  Of a traditional bottle so the shipping and all of that. It's much simpler  Fill it with warm water refills start at just a couple of bucks  I'm on a subscription plan. So I get the refills when I need them. Oh, oh, oh, oh  One of the things you've got to get is the toilet cleaner tablets you throw it in  You go do some other stuff and then your toilets all clean. It's amazing. Those run out fast. They've got more in stock  I think blue land is a great idea from cleaning sprays to hand soap to toilet cleaner to laundry  We use their laundry tablets scent free laundry tablets  Uh, so, you know that we don't  No, no sensitivities. No allergies  A great I recommend this in fact, I did it for my daughter when she moved into her new apartment get the clean essentials kit  It's a great housewarming gift. We got it to start. I said, oh, oh, this would be good for abby  Everything you need you get blue land products in refreshing signature scents like iris agave  Fresh lemon eucalyptus mint  And they have seasonal scents. This is for the fall. They've got apple butter  Wouldn't you like to wash your hands and apple butter vanilla chai? That's actually a nice one and maple pumpkin  Right now you get 15 off your first order you will feel good it works  The only thing you have to get rid of now the only thing you have to throw away now  Is your notion that this these environmentally good products are not effective  They are very effective and they are not pricey. You're going to save a lot of money because you just buy the tablets now, right?  15 off your first order get the whole kit get started at blue land.com  Twit get the I would say get the clean essentials kit. So you have all of it blue land  Slash twit we thank them so much for saving the planet  and  For supporting twit and you can do the same  For both by going to blue land.com  Slash twit.

Yeah. Yeah  Um, but you know, there's such a high production value  In in what they put together, especially if you looked at the part about the um, the apple watch  Ultra and you know talking to the different, you know the climbers and the divers and everything else  There was a lot there. Um  The the people that had been impacted by having a watch or an iphone save their life in critical situations  You know, there was a lot there that they just cannot replicate  Just from being on stage

So you don't need this watch  but my my uh  Universal theory of all of this consumer electronic stuff is we don't need any of it  We don't we don't need a smartphone. We push your mouth  It makes us feel good. That's what carolina is saying. It's an emotional purchase. Yes, right? All right

Um, my apple watch band broke  Yes, and I do not have it because I need to buy a new one and uh, I fidget with it too much  And so I break them every six months. It's just whatever. Um, i've been moving a lot less because I do not have the little guilty  Yeah, yeah, yeah  And i'm definitely more so for me  I respect mike's perspective here and I generally agree with him  But I will say the lower tier of many of these gadgets brings base functionality. It's very useful  You wouldn't catch me no, I agree dead in a new apple watch 8 pro max ultra hd  Whatever because i'm not into windows vista branding

Transcript:  Actually, that's a good point. That's a very good point. You've been doing all of that. It's no joke. It's super useful  I thought it was really interesting and very, uh attuned  to the political mood that apple  When they started talking about the watch  Talked about the watch for women. It was the it was a big thing

Start time: 7045.62
End time: 7075.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, actually I I think they did one better leo because they said this is not about women issue  This is a family issue and and I so want people to really talk about  Whether it is about having babies or talking about abortion as a family  Issue both ways, right? It's not just about us  Um  You know I and I I I appreciated that  I don't know how many people picked up on it, but they they made the point  In the presentation. Yeah

Start time: 7076.34
End time: 7093.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So unfortunately what they didn't tell us is in order to do the retroactive ovulation the cycle tracking all that you have to watch  The watch to bed for five nights before it can measure your temperature relative temperature  Uh, and especially on the ultra that is that is not a  enticing prospect

Start time: 7094.12

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Uh, it's actually super light. I don't know if you tried it in the store. I haven't tried it. No  It is very very light. I have a very small wrist and I I posted this this video  On instagram and tick tock because it does look  a little bit big on my wrist  but I was  very  Surprised how light it was and I think that from a design perspective, you know aside from the  Want to be iron man people  Um or iron women people there  There is a broader market. Um that is for women that even if is  Large and there are a lot of women actually that like bigger watches because they have a small wrist and so

Start time: 7139.42

Start time: 7143.58
End time: 7158.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's and the wrist the the watch is more comfortable to wear  While you're sleeping  Then it is comfortable for the person you're sleeping with when you roll over your wrist  You clock some in the face a big piece of metal. Hey, but my sapphire crystal is fine. So that's all I care about

Start time: 7160.18
End time: 7186.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is weird that you I mean this is a limitation and of course apple is very good at these events of promoting  the excitement of it  And all the things it's going to do but this is a limitation of measuring temperature on your wrist with a watch  Is it's relative it's not your actual temperature and it needs a base  That's going to require five nights at least of sleeping  It doesn't measure your temperature while you're awake for a variety of technical reasons it can't so it has to do it while you're asleep

Transcript:  what's interesting is that the quantified self movement and separately the  Smartwatch movement have been have skewed very very male historically, right?  But especially the quantified self movement. It's it's a bunch of  tend to be younger  Men who are into that sort of thing, but this is this is a quantified self thing that is  Probably compelling for a lot of women who want to start families or just want to know what's happening with their with their menstrual cycles  And so I thought it was really brilliant. It was a brilliant way to combine  New hardware with artificial intelligence and something that has a real world benefit  But also has this really compelling like I want to know what's happening with my cycle like that  I think since the beginning of time  Women have wanted to know like when when when is when am I fertile all that kind of stuff?  so I just think it's a stroke of absolute genius for them to  Open with that and really emphasize it and also back it up with a product that  I mean, we'll see how it actually works in real life. But you know, this is this is a major major  Way to sort of broaden their market by

I I believe it's really they're going to sell a lot of these

End time: 7346.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Based on that. I love what you said carolina that it's not about women. It's about families  And actually I would go even farther that apple is really positioning itself as a company that cares about  Its users and and wants to protect its users with the crass detection  With the with the cycle tracking  And let's not forget that all of the period tracking apps that you get on your iphone and other devices  A whole lot of them leak information about information that could be  Uh, I think that's something that's going to be  hugely problematic in this post-rogue world so apple without saying it at all  Is really very strongly creating this impression that we care about you and you can trust us and we're not going to  Rat you out  So this is something you can use with us  Because it's safe and uh, and they're really pushing that and I think that's smart of them  Over the last few years now and and tim cooks always said health is going to be a very big part of our business  It's certainly a tent pole business for them now. It's even more. It's like this is the company that cares about you

I don't know what their real  Intentions are I mean their only real job is to make money for their stakeholders, but  It is certainly a good marketing position to say hey, here's a company that's going to protect your privacy going to protect you  Cares about you and your health that is a nice position to be in for any company.

Transcript:  The thing that the problem that I have with this apple approach is they were really big on privacy for a long time  They changed the way  Consumer privacy works with applications and tracking and so forth and then after they had whacked everyone else's business  We're like and by the way new ad products. Yeah, apple  Yeah  And so here's the thing an ad based business if you are a platform company will lead to constant product  Compromises down the road and so i'm very concerned that apple in a search for growth going back to the will the new iphone sell  Better than the last one conversation will have to essentially compromise its own principles when it comes to generating ad revenues

And that's why i'm saying I know it's a good marketing strategy  And I don't know what their real intent is because you're exactly right and look what it's done to google frankly  Uh google went from don't be evil to let's be as evil as you possibly can  Uh block ad trackers in chrome  Uh, I mean do do everything they can to own the browser ecosystem  And then make it impossible for people to protect their privacy in it while pretending to be private

Yeah, that's a weird story  Well, this is basically  If I if i'm understanding what they're doing and why  The whole point is well all these little  Unique innovative things that we've come up with aren't making any money  So let's just double down on the stuff that is making us money today  And the ai stuff that's going to make us bank in the future and all this stuff about experimenting and like trying new things and throwing  There's no use for it. Here's the thing that people don't realize I think google has 175 000 employees or something like that  They have a ton of employees  Uh, they're currently down to under a hundred  in area  120 oh wow, so  So so we're talking about a hundred people out of that many employees out of all the billions that they make  And they want to cut that in half  That's how uncommitted they are now are to innovation. It's really kind of horrible and it's to me  It's it's akin to this idea of transforming  Google search into it an ad delivery system  And doing it for the money just going for the money  It seems to me that that's what they're backing off of innovation is we know these areas these limited areas  Where we can make a ton of money. Let's just do that because that's what we do. We make money

That's what created maps  I mean a lot of the best google products came out of that area 120's model was we work on  The 20 products a hundred percent of the time. That's where 120  Came from and now it's what 60 percent right because we're just gonna cut it in half this week google  It's rumored, but I believe uh said we're not going to do a pixel book  They asked last month the google hardware laptop division  Project loon got sped spun off and now they're cutting 120 their rnd arm in half  Is this uh, what happens to?

Transcript:  Ah, this is a really good  I've been thinking a lot about this lately because as companies reach kind of a maturity point of growth with their initial product that wins  Them the market for apple it was max for google it was search now alphabet, etc  um, they tend to have to dilute the  Consumer value proposition in that core business as a way to keep juicing growth, which is why on google search on mobile  There's more and more ads before you get to results because they need to drive  More revenue to keep their investors happy  And I I know that i'm a capitalist at heart and I cover the public markets and private markets for my job  But I wonder if a lot of companies wouldn't do better if they just stayed private. It didn't have to sacrifice consumer value  For shareholder value  Long-term

Transcript:  Never I think there's a big difference though between google and apple that that makes it hard to  Say they're going through the same thing is that you know, apple has been a hardware company at heart all  The way and google has always been a software company and and yes apple is doing more in services and the revenue  Is moving more and more towards services and they you know diversifying they also are  You know broadening their their product portfolio  And I never actually believed that  Google was serious about hardware  You know that they the way that the the made by google team operates  It just doesn't fill me with confidence.

Let's do something gigantic. Let's do somebody come with an idea and they say yeah  What the hell let's do that  And so sundar pichai is not that kind of guy and he also is not the kind of guy who gives a rat's  Hine about the consumer market you see him slowly moving the ship of state  Toward enterprise government contracts that sort of thing and away from consumer plays you mentioned the uh,  You know the the cancellation of of loon  They what they did with loon. So loon was originally  We were told was going to bring the internet to remote villages  Around the world by by relaying it from balloon to balloon and and bring it to a place where they didn't wouldn't have the  Infrastructure on the ground we could deliver it from the sky. This was the promise it was utopian  It was a utopian idea to to expand eliminate the digital divide and expand the internet by  By bringing it to people in far-flung areas. Well now what they're doing with that  They realize that the most valuable technology they have  Is the technology that used lasers to transmit data from balloon to balloon  So now they have a new startup. They spun it out as a startup called aleria  And what this is going to do is it's going to they promise that they have this hardware technology called type beam  And and they and and it's a software called space time. And basically what they're going to do is they're going to have this  laser  uh, uh based  Uh data communications network for space  For you know underwater for all these places where you can have physical  Infrastructure and what that means though is that they're really going to go after  Mainly government and military contracts.

They love to you know, uh  Get together with with like-minded business people and then when they sell something they sell three billion dollars worth  Instead of just trying to slug it out with the whole world in the in the world of consumer uh, uh markets now apple  Has a unique position in the sense that they you know  The enterprise market and the consumer market is practically the same thing to apple human beings using the devices  That's that's what the way they look at it  It's a really interesting perspective and it really works for apple but google and suno upper chai leading google  Uh is is not they they're losing  Interest in in the consumer market. I'm pretty sure although I and admittedly apple was a hardware company

Start time: 8073.54
End time: 8108.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but I want to say was because  A lot of what apple's doing now is focused on services is focused on  I mean that's they've understood they've saturated probably the market for hardware  And what they're trying to grow on is average revenue per user through services, right?  So, I don't know if does that kind of software? I don't know what that counts as but it ain't hardware  Well, the services are essentially recurring revenue points  Oh, sorry, you sell the watch once every couple of years. You'll sell a phone every couple of years, but you get the monthly income  Every every month from those owners. That's good money

It's almost impossible to stop  Uh, they had two factor didn't matter. They just uh, they probably said hey, yeah, we're from the it department  We're just checking this login. Can you log in for us? Okay. Good. That looks good  What's the code that they just sent you? Okay. All right. That looks all right. We're good  And now they've got full access, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I mean I I have historically played gta games going back to the era in which they were actually top down 2d  But not in a very long time. What's interesting is how this sort of leak you might think would be  Always well received amongst gamers, but it's actually not so there's a game coming out called victoria 3  Which is a grand strategy political sim essentially  And um, it comes out in a couple weeks and i've been looking forward to it  So i've been tracking the news and a build of it leaked a couple months back and the community behind the gaming company  And also the game itself  We're a little peevish about it because the developers were kind of bummed because it was an older build and it didn't show off  What they had built and they didn't want people to get the wrong impression of what the game's going to be and so  You would think these leaks are slam dunks for the communities, but they're a little bit more complex than that  Uh, but in the case of gta 6 again that has been in under production for apparently 700 years  Uh, there's a lot of pent-up demand. So i'm not entirely shocked. That's something finally broke  If it is the same hacker from the uber hack  um

Start time: 8854.34

Transcript:  That's embarrassing for tech. It's embarrassing. It's actually uh rockstar gets hacked pretty routinely  Uh, thanks gta 6 is reportedly at least two years away according to the verge  Uh, i'm sure rockstar is bummed because it's uh early unfinished development builds testing  Uh, yeah, this is never good for a game company and I have to say  Embarrassing yes, but also you guys we gotta get this  Social engineering under control you gotta train your employees to be more skeptical

Transcript:  If there's no solving human nature, it's human nature. Yeah, it's human nature  What you need is what you need is a wholesale embrace of zero trust  architecture  everywhere and um and this this is this is this is this will get us in the in the ballpark of not having  um chinese spies working at twitter  Not having everything being leaked not having everything being compromised all the time through social engineering because  people will always  Uh be people they you know, and and we're on the brink of a totally believable  um  Uh deep fake video that is affected in real time  There are people who are applying for jobs and doing interviews and they're they're using somebody else's face to do the video interview  Uh deep fake audios a big deal. So we really have to  We can't rely on training as you said, I mean we need a lot more training for sure around cyber security  but we have to embrace zero trust as just a baseline and um  Even the federal government is finally  Uh being forced through exe Biden executive order to embrace zero trust  So zero trust is is got to be the new baseline at all these companies or this kind of stuff

So so we didn't really have time to talk about it  But the the whole uh, all the congressional, uh gnashing of teeth and ripping of hair  over tik tok is a bit of a red a red herring because basically this idea that because tik tok is a  Is a  Chinese company that the chinese communist party or whatever will have access to it  That's that mindset is perimeter security mindset  They think well because they're over there and and and the communist party is over there. They'll have access  Well, that that's not how any of this stuff works anymore. There is no perimeter  For any company anywhere, which is why you need zero trust and and so this

Transcript:  That's the distinction that doesn't quite work for for american legislators and to be clear  I'm not going to sit here and defend josh holly in any capacity ever  but I will say that I don't think it's xenophobic to say that  the government and economic rules that are set up in china are antithetical to the sort of transparency that we might want  in terms of everything from auditing corporate financials  Which has been a big sticking point between the u.s and china for a long time  Uh to data privacy and security and given the sheer quantity of state-sponsored hacking and so forth is seen from the chinese government  Uh to me being skeptical  At a very minimum of claims regarding data privacy matters and given the amount of u.s data in play it's

Transcript:  Yeah, go for it mike. There are three issues one of them one of them is gathering data, which is what they're obsessing about  Okay, they can gather data from any of the social networks  I don't think it's necessarily easier to do it from bite dance than it is from twitter  It's probably easier to harvest that data from twitter. And what kind of data do you get from somebody who's posting?  Movement of troops maybe something like that. The other the other thing is the the the oppression of pro-democracy people around the world  Which the chinese government is definitely interested in in suppressing those people and and the third thing is  Propaganda, that's the real risk with tiktok. That's the main risk with tiktok if there was a conflict. So for example, if  China invades taiwan  Or when they invade taiwan, it seems like they really intend to do that at some point and if the west gets into a conflict  over that issue  It's it's an almost it seems to me a no-brainer that the chinese government  Would reach their hands into bite dance and say you know what we don't want any of this kind of stuff  and we want lots more of that kind of stuff and  uh that that is a real that is a real reason to  Be concerned about that. You can imagine if if bite dance is a russian company what what vladimir putin would be  making them  Do around propaganda?  um, but but all this stuff about about  Data the thing they're focusing on most is that is the data privacy and that's the least  Of any that should be the least of their concern

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Carolina the point that I don't understand. Um, and maybe i'm thinking about it the wrong way is  Your I agree what you said mike and and in that case you have a government that is asking you to do things  But when you're looking at facebook and twitter and you know western social  uh platforms  They might not have a government, but they have players that pay them right to put more of these and less of that  on their network, so  It seems like the government is using two different weights to  assess and then you know punish or discipline or you know, um  I guess constrain this  social media platforms and for tiktok is because they're owned by a chinese company

Transcript:  Well, it doesn't help to be an american company in the eu google has lost an appeal  over illegal android app bundling  4.1 billion euro fine was reduced from 4.3 billion  because uh  This goes back to 2018  The company imposed unlawful restrictions on android phone manufacturers in order to promote its search engine on mobile devices things like  saying if you are selling a  a googleized version of android you can't sell the aosp  ungoogled version on others of your phones  You must pre-install google search and chrome apps and the play store things like that  Uh, that is enough to sting 4.1 billion euros, right?

Transcript:  Yeah  Even for google, I think currently that's enough money that they're going to sit up and go dang dang ouch  Well again, we can't swear on twitter. So i'm i'm trying to make this a little more family-friendly  They have tons of cash, but they they use it for things like shareholder returns. So to me a 4.1 billion euro fine  Uh now roughly 4.1 billion dollars, uh is is material even for a company of that scale. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google has to wait two months and 10 days before it can appeal because this is on appeal  But there is one last appeal available in a couple of months and that's to the highest court in the eu the court of justice  I see no reason to think the court of justice will overturn this  I'm, not sure I agree with it  google  Says we're disappointed the court did not annul the decision in full and and I do agree with this next sentence android has created more  choice for everyone  Not less and supports thousands of successful businesses in europe and around the world  I can't disagree with that. Uh  Isn't google kind of being punished because they have an open source version of android  Wouldn't I mean this they wouldn't have they'd avoid this if they didn't have aosp if they just said well  No, it's I mean apple doesn't get apple requires all sorts of stuff for people  To you know to carriers to have an iphone in their lineup. That's not illegal. I think it's because their justification

Start time: 9438.90
End time: 9506.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right there just if the apple's justification is because we want to make sure that this is your experience  Yes, a good experience that is secure all that kind of stuff  The the the thing that they're parts of this that make more sense than other parts  The the part that makes the least sense to me is that you know, I I do think it should be fine for google to say  Okay, if you're going to use if you're going to sell devices with our free open source version  Then we're not going to license to you the the the google version, right?  And and this is this is a point of contention  I think that's a reasonable thing for them to do for the same reason you went out experience  Yes, they're offering this free version  They're they're enriching all these companies and getting nothing in return. And so I think that's  That's fairly reasonable, but they're also saying okay  If you if you do use the google version you have to have our search engine  You have to have all these things installed and that this gets back to microsoft and internet explorer and all that kind of stuff  If they're if they're going to punish microsoft for bundling internet explorer  Maybe it's consistent to punish google for bundling or forcing other companies to bundle their browser

Wait, there's no open source ios and as a result apple's not in trouble

Transcript:  the the way so so the way  Um, so we americans tend to think of how american law  Uh deals with antitrust. We see it as a competitive issue that harms consumers, right?  Whereas in europe they see antitrust is an anti-competitive thing that harms other companies competitors  and so the  so the the the existence of open source and the  Subsidic subsidy of that  product if you will  By their non open source version of android  Is a bit anti-competitive  From from the from the european mindset just the existing focus because basically what they're doing is they're blocking other  Innovators from entering the market and having an inexpensive or free operating system  uh  You know most of the most of the cheapest phones in the world use the open source version of android, right?  And and and google's kind of it's a kind of a holding mechanism where  Uh, you know google has this brand name. It has this, you know android has this brand awareness in in the global market  And then then they have this free version out there preventing, uh new entrance in the market  So I can see that but that's not even what they're doing here  They're basically just they just don't like the whole scenario apparently  And they think that google if google's going to have an open source thing  It should be available to all companies including those that choose to use the non open source version of android  So, I don't know. It's it's it's a it's an ugly ruling and it's not really about it's not really about europe  uh coming up with these ideas and then finding google it's  Europe is like the u.s. In that sense. It's other american companies are complaining to europe and europe's going  Okay. All right. We'll go with the microsoft point of view whatever it is or you know apple's point of view  Whoever's lobbying them, right?  And so I don't know. It's I don't like I don't like this ruling. I don't like this fine  I think there are other areas of like search advertising and stuff where they have a stronger case  This just seems fairly arbitrary to me

Transcript:  So the state of texas  Has a law  Uh  That declared social media platforms with more than 50 million monthly average users in other words twitter and facebook  uh  are common carriers  And as a result  They should not be allowed to decide who can post and who can't post they shouldn't be allowed to  deplatform conservative voices  Because  That law of course, uh  Violates the first amendment because government is supposedly not supposed to make any laws that abridge  the freedom of speech even of companies like twitter  Uh, nevertheless, uh, so, you know a number of companies sued in court the fifth circuit  court  by the way the uh  the uh in their in the initial uh court ruling  The law was  Temporarily put on hold right supreme court said well let this you guys work this out  Uh, they they said okay the law is blocked for now, but but uh, the lawsuit has to play out now  The fifth circuit court of appeals in new orleans has ruled in favor of the texas law saying. Oh, no, that's fine  Yeah, but first amendment schmerz amendment  Uh now of course, it's gonna have to go to the supreme court  No idea what the supreme court is going to do with this. This is very similar to the florida law  Uh, which allows which was ruled unconstitutional which was ruled unconstitutional by an appeals court  So now you have two decisions by equal courts that are both going to go i'm sure go to the supreme court  Uh one for one again

Transcript:  There's an inversion here that I find interesting during the net neutrality debate conservatives  That these provide that uh internet providers were not common carriers and now social media companies which have much stronger protections written in the constitution are now being forced to  Platform speech they don't want to I I like to view it that way versus their deep platforming that's a better way to put it  Not amplify it. You can't you have to you have to publish this  Content. Yeah, this is also not about the sensory of conservatives  It's about the right of platforms to be able to police their own networks and what content is uploaded to it  Which is a very important thing otherwise, they can't moderate right?  Right, let's not fall prey to the fox news framing of this and talk this talk about how we're trying to save conservative speech  Conservatives are doing fine on twitter. I follow a bunch of them because it keep my eyes open  But i'm i'm i'm in awe of the gumption of texas and and the the sheer  Insanity of quote small government conservatives trying to use the government to force private corporations that they fought to enshrine as individuals in  Other supreme court rulings has been forced to platform speech.

I thought I'd turn it on because I couldn't hear what did you say?  What are they talking about? But in fact  At this point recent surveys suggest younger generations  Are using closed captioning more than the old folks  Not because of hearing problems, but they just they can't otherwise they can't pay attention or something

End time: 10031.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so it started I think i'm gonna guess with facebook in the news feed because  Companies like taste made and uh all the companies that were doing, you know  These trying to make viral posts realize that people aren't don't have their sound on by default when they're going through the news feed  So in order to capture their attention, they would put captions on there  So you can see the video and they see the caption  Maybe you'll turn the sound on but it doesn't matter if you do and then tik tok followed suit  Instagram automatically generates captions on uploaded videos unless you turn them off  uh  Snapchat users can turn on auto-generated subtitles

Transcript:  There's there's another reason for this in addition to all the reasons stated  Already, which is that?  in recent years  Sound design has gotten way more aggressive and this has been pushed by christopher nolan primarily and then others following suit  where it's actually  objectively  Dialogue is objectively less intelligible than it used to be  and um, there's there's a lot more content that we watch where people have  uh  Axes strong accents. So the combination of lots of other noise going on in in the content  uh, and people speaking in a way that's you know, a much broader range of accents means that  uh, there's there's kind of like a  Sort of utilitarian reason to put on captioning. We just can't understand. I can't it's not just old folks

I was complaining about this on twitter just a few weeks ago because my mom is visiting and  um, she's watching netflix in italian with subtitles in italian  And although the italian is you know, is good  There's no correlation between what they say and what I can read and it's not because it's wrong. It's just a totally different  sentence  um  Because I I don't think that you know  Content creators are investing enough to actually have good  um, you know good subtitles and and and things done properly especially for most markets like italy  Where everything is dubbed

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was a great piece on a slash film  uh came out  Last year, I think they've just updated it. Here's why movie dialogue has gotten more difficult to understand  And they blame a bunch of things some  Some of it's because of people like chris nolan  uh director of tenet interstellar and the dark knight rises who  Wants to sound more natural robert altman started this wants to have hey, that's the way life is everybody's talking at the same time  uh, it's also  actors who you know, uh, I think marlon brando started it who mumbled a little bit because they want it to be  More realistic and then really this is the third one, which is that the sound recordist the person is on the set  Often isn't respected enough. The sound recordist should be able to say hey, no one's gonna be able to understand that dialogue  uh very often  The sound guy doesn't say that they or if he does they say no we're moving on  so it it is a uh, it is a  a big problem  And I think it is another reason why people are uh, this is an interesting one  I asked a sound recordist who called the radio show and he talked about familiarities that everybody kind of  Has heard this dialogue so many times. We all know what the person's saying  So we the director and sound guy may not even notice that you can't understand it because because we've heard it so many times  We know what he's saying  And then of course, there's the problem of uh, five dot one seven dot one a thousand dot one mixing  Which means you have to have a center channel to hear anything. I think it's just very interesting  I think it's going to be in years to come. Everything will have a set a caption on it, uh all the time  And it's and it's not because of us old folks  Although I have to say I leave the captions. There's some shows like succession where there's soto voce  dialogue  There's the main dialogue and then people are saying something background if you leave the captions on they often transcribe the sort of voce  so if there's something subtle behind the scenes, you can kind of catch it because you're reading it instead of uh,  listening to it well struggle

Start time: 10294.18
End time: 10312.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The struggle here is that if you have a partner who disagrees with you on the use of captions. Oh goodness gracious  It engenders a regular conversation about if they should be on or not  And I happen to have one of these spouses who does not appreciate them  And she says that if you want to understand what they're saying stop looking at twitter on your phone and walk
