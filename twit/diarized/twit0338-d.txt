And so for us, the great thing about Shine is they make MasterChef  and The Office and Ugly Betty and all that kind of stuff.  Oh, my God. Oh, I didn't know that.  This is like a real production company.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And they've got offices in, like, 25 countries or something.  They make the UK office or the American office?

Anyway, Will,  congratulations. I think that's great.  It is just the beginning.  I think that you're going to see mainstream media companies like Shine  start to, I hope,  start to snap up new media companies.  You're rolling in dough. You don't care.

They bought Twitter. It's just great news for everybody.  People believed me.  It's very remotely believable.  It is. That's why I did it for April Fools.  It's distant.

Transcript:  Two that I liked the best when I did one where they were going to change the name of Sioux City or Sioux Falls to Gateway City.  I had a bunch of documentation showing how this was going on around the country.  People were taking money from large corporations to change their name.  This is based on changing Pack Bell Park to Monster State.  That ran above the fold in the local paper in Sioux Falls.  Right at the top.  That's it.  When you're in the hoax hall of fame, you're going to get drunk on the information superhighway.  That's interesting.  I like the best one.

Transcript:  They were all moaning and groaning about this comment.  The better one was the bill they were going to pass that required people to be sober when they were using a modem.  Then I made the assertion that these idiots in Congress didn't know what a modem was.  They just knew about information superhighway.  They thought it was drunk driving and they were crazy.  That's a great idea.  I named Leahy and two other senators and they got tons of calls.  I'm not going to lie.  I'm not going to lie.  I'm not going to lie.  Leahy was irked.

Transcript:  This is my favorite new site.  I found out about this.  We were interviewing Clay Johnson about his book on information diet.  It was all about how to vet information.  Make sure you eat good information.  Also information.  He pointed to this site.  It's called gullible.info.  This guy just has fun making up facts that sound true.  He spends a lot of time going to Wikipedia to delete this data that gets in.  Because people are going to be like, oh, I'm going to be a good person.  I'm going to be a good person.  I'm going to be a good person.  This is the kind of thing that gets in because people believe it.  Why bother?  We should do a contest.  This would be a great game show.  I give you three facts.  One of them is true.  True or false?

Start time: 629.61
End time: 630.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That sounds true.

Start time: 630.90
End time: 693.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sounds true.  Geneticists discovered in 2004  the human ability to see the color red  stems from a genetic mutation  that took place in a common ancestor  two million years ago.  Projections indicate that in another million years  red color receptors will be  a recessive gene and appear  only in a minority of humans.  I believe that.  I believe it too.  None of these are true.  One of the facts this guy  consistently gets back  into Wikipedia  which was that Timothy Leary claimed to have  found a new color called Glendale.  And it has appeared  ever since in his biography  and people keep putting it back in.  Did you know that Jude Law  stipulates in his film contracts that  none of his movies may be preceded  in theaters by any previews in which he also appears?  Not true.  Anyway, enough.  That's the fake news.  Now we've got some real news. How about that?  Big story, the big story of the week.  We talked about it a little bit on this week in Google.

Transcript:  announced that they  have a new privacy policy and that they're going to  unify data across all of their platforms.  So what they know about you  from watching YouTube  will be added to Google search, will be added to  Gmail, etc., etc., etc.  And they announced a new privacy policy.  In fact, if you haven't gone to Google.com lately  you might want to go because they'll say  right at the beginning of it  we have a new privacy policy  and it's not the same old yada yada.  Actually, I guess I've been there so I'm  not seeing it now but see if you see it.  It's not the same old yada yada.  Is that what it says? Yada yada?

Start time: 730.32
End time: 740.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You get it if you log into  Gmail, I can email to me,  if you go to Google+, if you go onto YouTube  it's like oh my god there's a new privacy  policy, I know it's fine.

Start time: 745.35
End time: 768.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So  Washington Post,  before the policy came out,  really cried wolf on this.  Fox News said in  capital letters be afraid  people have been just  going crazy. Even Extreme Tech wrote an  article about how Google's new  policy has no opt out  and all of a sudden the Google is  evil. Agree?

Start time: 769.22
End time: 820.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, we knew this was coming for a long  time. Ever since Google Plus launched  I went to Google and said okay  what's your big strategy with this?  Surely it's more than a dinky little social  network and they said yeah. Not the next door quit.  Well no, it was, their plan  was to unify all Google Web  products under one umbrella so that  you have one identity that you use everywhere,  you have one login, you have one privacy  policy and I think that what they're doing with this privacy policy  and they've  whitewashed it, which is their job.  You know, they want to  make sure that the Web is personalized for you  and that you can share with everybody. But what if you  don't want personalized content?  What if you don't want the sharing? What if I don't want my  personal life and my social  life to be dragged onto the Internet  wherever I go is the problem.  So you have to log out of Google and stop using  Google Web products.  Which is inconvenient, but you know,  it's not like we don't have other options.

Start time: 821.50
End time: 836.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I should talk about a couple of things here.  One is some of the new technologies  being used to track you, namely IP  tracking that instead of putting  cookies on your machine, there's  databases of IP addresses and they can just  they all subscribe to it. You don't need  a cookie. Yeah, cookies are bogus.

Transcript:  All I need to know is a few, maybe a half dozen  parameters about your browser, what versions  of things you're running and I can tell exactly who

Start time: 843.46
End time: 850.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you are. Now the thing that's out there, people should look  at is a product called Ghostery.  Yes. Ghostery.com.  It's a Firefox plugin.

Start time: 851.22
End time: 853.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It actually works on Chrome as well.

Start time: 853.18
End time: 868.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It works on all the browsers and what it does is  it sees who's doing  what to you and then it gives you kind of  a quasi report and you'll  find a lot of these sites that seem innocuous  or they have a jillion trackers  on you and Google is like one of the least  problematic.

Start time: 869.46
End time: 897.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't need to track you because they are  everywhere on the Internet.  Google Analytics is one of the things that will  show up when you use Ghostery. That shows up constantly on Ghostery.  And we use Google Analytics. Actually I'm proud  to say that on Twit.tv I think there's  three Ghostery items.  But it's hard to, look, every website  you go to is almost certainly logging  your IP address. If it has ad  banners, the company that serves those ad banners,  Google, DoubleClick or whoever  is also able to track you from site to  site. This is going

Start time: 897.18
End time: 934.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  on. Well that's part of the disgusting  commercialization of the Internet and that's  one thing but the other thing is your  personal life and your social life, your  intellectual life, which are very different  from what you do online. Sometimes  you just need to be anonymous. And when I talked to  Bradley Horowitz  at Google one of the last times I was  there, I was like Bradley, it seems like you  are making us log in to do everything  so you can track us everywhere. What  if you don't want that? And he gave me the indication  that you were going to be able  to anonymously and pseudonymously  use Google products. And I  am starting to feel like I  was lied to. I think it's really interesting. I'm so pissed off about that.  It's sort of making Google

Start time: 935.20
End time: 995.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  into not a series of  disparate products  but one sort of holistic  Google-y experience.  And so there was a really  interesting quote from  I think it was last week that  Sergey, Larry Page  was saying, you know, to internally  to Google employees, if you're not on board  with Search was your world and this new world. Get out of here.  He said, yeah. Get out of here.  What was also interesting was that he referred to a number  of times and in previous speeches over the last few  weeks has talked a lot about how he  wants Google to be a beautiful experience.  And that's not something that  we've ever really associated with Google before.  And I think it's quite clear  that he started thinking  in my mind it's like the  productization of the Google experience  if that's a real word. It's like  making all these disparate Google  bits into one place that you  sort of come together or one experience  is all like Google Search is the hub  in the same way that Facebook  Wall is your hub. But all the rest  of it is all unified on LinkedIn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  On the one hand,  of course, Google is a private company,  not private, publicly held, but  they're a corporation. They're  entitled and in fact  I think probably obliged  fiduciarily to make as much money  as they can fiduciarily.  Is that a word? I don't know.  Is there fiduciary responsibility to  return a profit to the stakeholders?  On the other hand, we do expect  I think a little more of Google for a couple of reasons.  One, don't be evil is supposedly  their motto. I think we could throw that one out.  That's ridiculous. They said it, but  obviously it's no longer true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Corporations are neither evil  nor not evil. They're just corporations.  They are profit driven.  However, you piss off your users,  your advertisers go where the users go.  And they are linked. And I think

Start time: 1041.73
End time: 1083.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  because they run the  search engine that is what fuels  travel on the internet  without a good search engine, without Google,  the internet doesn't work. We expect  more of them. They're almost a public service.  They're almost a public service.  And if you think, oh, I can go use Bing,  Bing's doing this already as well. They're combining  Facebook with Bing results. I don't think  Bing's any less  of a unified experience.  Google, I do praise them for  at least publishing a unified  privacy policy. I mean,  that's a big step forward. It's in plain  English. You can at least see what Google's doing.  They do something that nobody does, which I  think is fantastic, which is the Google dashboard.  You can go to Google.com  slash dashboard and see what they know about

Transcript:  You know the guy? Never mind.  So I can see my dashboard. I can see exactly  what they know about me.  And that's good. And  as they point out, you could log  out of your Google account and continue to use  Google, some Google tools,  not all, but you could watch videos on YouTube.  You could search  on Google without anything being saved  about you. So I think that given that  they are a company designed to make money,  You can also use Scroogle for your search engine.  You can use Scroogle. If you're on Safari,  you can use private browsing.  You could use an encyclopedia  and read the newspaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Like on Chrome, on Firefox,  on Safari.  And you can private browse on anything.  If you don't want to be in  this thing,  A, you can try and opt out of it at the Google end.  You can just opt out of it at the client end.  Just use a browser and you can support cookies.  Or, but here's the problem.

And in fact,  required by the law,  to save two years of it for the FBI  request.  So, I mean, maybe we trust the government  more than we trust Google. I know you don't.  Of course not.  But at least you know what Google's  motivations are. You never know what the government's  motivations are. Profit.  What is the government motive? We don't know.  Who knows what it is.

So, I think  the thing to remind people is,  privacy policy or not,  dashboard or not,  your data is being collected about you every time you step  out onto the internet. You're in public. So you might as well  act as if you're in public.  It's just so depressing. And if you don't like it, read the newspaper. You're right.

It was enough to buy some presents.  Presents? For all  my loved ones. I didn't get anything.  There's quite a few of those.  You I like.  You I like.  So... But in general...  And by the way, I am donating more than half  of it to charity. Oh, brother.  To charity.  Most of it to our school.  Which is a nonprofit. That's nice.  But in others... And then we donate...

It's all very well saying, okay,  if you're not comfortable with all these privacy controls,  don't put all this private stuff online.  But, you know,  the government expects you to do your taxes online  these days. They are encouraging that.  It's the most private thing you can get.  All the sort of  health and social services and all this kind of stuff  is all existing online. We're moving to a  world where you have to be  online and everything has to be online. So, actually,  it's Jolie's point, how much  choice do you really have if  you have to be online and all the major  places that you're going to be online are going to keep all this data about you?

And so,  the only restriction, unfortunately, after place  is when other people get involved. Like,  for instance, Will here, who  is not allowed to say what  this company is sold for. So I can't.  Or my family members.  It's not for me to decide what's public about  my family life. But for  me, I got nothing to hide.

And he has immediately said, I am  going to license the BlackBerry  software to anyone who wants it.  Really? And nobody called.  And nobody called.  I think this is the wrong way to do it.

Start time: 1757.16

Start time: 1776.33
End time: 1786.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's obvious  that the thing they should do is completely the opposite.  They should start leasing  either Android or Windows Phone 7  and start making BlackBerrys that use the other  software. Is that right?

Start time: 1787.22
End time: 1828.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the first interview that  Thorsten gave, he was like, basically  there's nothing fundamentally wrong with the company.  There's no real problem.  We've got a product issue and if we just  fix the product, and there was this massive  sort of outcry at the beginning of last week  of just like, oh my god, has this guy got a clue?  And now the  financial post is new CEO  who has dramatically different  strategies. And he's completely  like in the space of a week ago. He's like the Nokia guy.  He's gone from sort of nothing to see here  to oh, it's all going to completely change.  But this guy's the COO.  So he's been in  the middle of the complete  head store. They needed somebody from the outside.  Of the last couple of years anyway.  So usually you need somebody new.

Start time: 1830.43
End time: 1834.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean everybody  says they know how to solve BlackBerrys  problem, but I mean...

Start time: 1835.52
End time: 1854.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well I don't know if I know how to solve it,  but clearly offering to license  our software to other hardware manufacturers  is not the way to make  a lot of money. He says  at the very core of RIM is  our innovation. We always think ahead.  We always think forward.  Sometimes we think the unthinkable.  Which is what?

Start time: 1855.16
End time: 1859.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 1861.99
End time: 1883.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ah, we are thinking  the unthinkable. He put out  a YouTube video to say this.  Shoot all users.  I would disagree  with you that the new CEO, relatively new CEO  at Nokia actually did the right thing, which is  say we're going to make Windows mobile phones.  Don't you think that's going to save Nokia?  You should see this 900 is  gorgeous. I have the 800, which is the

Start time: 1883.64

End time: 1930.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, I've played with them.  She's given up on phones. Yeah, phones are BS.  So, no, I've played with them  and they're absolutely gorgeous.  I think they're really nice. And I think it's funny to see  and here's why I'm kind of  whatever, RIM, because  you see, we always kind of  thought Windows mobile was going  to be in the dustbin. Nokia definitely  in the dustbin. Yet here they come  back to life like these Lazarus companies  with these beautiful, beautiful, very  competitive looking and feeling  products. So I'm not really willing  to write RIM off yet. They still have a very strong  presence in the enterprise. They are a legacy  product. So I'm not going to  poop all over them yet.

So it took me  just starting to take me on a wild goose chase.  I said, wait a minute, I know where this place is. I already looked on the  map. I went there. Then I punched the number  in again thinking it may have been some misspelling  and I punched it in. It showed me I  was on York Street. It showed me where I was  on the map. I put the address  in which I was standing in front of  and it says, OK, take off.  It took me around the block and  dropped me off on another street.  I'm a block away. I'm thinking, what kind of  this is terrible. The Google  Navigator is the Android Navigator with  the little picture at the end is the best  thing in the world.

Transcript:  against. Capen in  the chat room has a really good point  which is nobody really wants to license  the RIM operating system. But what if you could license  the RIM email server  technology integrated to like iPhone, right?  No, I agree. That's a product.  I agree. So that's a product. And the  messenger as well, BBM, that everybody  uses. People are obsessed by it.  If you could integrate BBM and BES  into iPhone, Android, Windows,  phone, that would be a business.

Start time: 2005.22
End time: 2018.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree. And we're not talking about QNX  or OS6.  We're talking about the server end.  Why do  people use BlackBerry? Because of BBM?  Pretty much. And because of the secure  server. Businesses like it.

End time: 2051.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But if you're bringing your own phone,  this is what happened, unfortunately, to RIM.  RIM was always the phone the boss gave  you. But if you got to bring your own phone, you  wouldn't bring, you'd bring an iPhone or an  Android phone. And then you're using consumer apps

He was at Palm.  He, when Palm,  was running Palm when HP bought WebOS,  ran the WebOS division,  was responsible  for the touch pad.  You can't,  you know, this guy had a huge reputation.  He was at Apple, right?  And then went off to do sidekick, right?  And he's had a huge reputation.  And everything he's touched since then  has just turned to RIM.

Transcript:  Let's talk about  something that's been going on  for a long time in Silicon Valley.  Apparently  it's very common  practice for tech companies  to have deals, side deals, sometimes unwritten  side deals with other tech companies, not to hire  their employees.  So for instance  Steve Jobs  was angry when  Google tried to hire an Apple employee. He called  Eric Schmidt. Schmidt said whoa we have an  agreement that we will never poach  Apple employees. And he said  fire the guy who tried to  recruit the Apple engineer.  Steve.  Make an example of him.  Google's staffing director responded the employee  who contacted the Apple engineer will quote  be terminated within the hour.  Please extend my apologies  as appropriate to Steve Jobs.  And they  wanted a public flogging for the guy  who dared to recruit somebody from Apple.  It's disgusting. Now this is illegal  and I didn't know this until I  talked to a cousin who was a  attorney  law professor at Harvard and an  expert in this. No this is so

And among other  things you've got  Paul Autolini of Intel  CEO of Intel saying writing  in an email let me clarify we have nothing  signed.

Transcript:  No we're all friends. Jim  wasn't mad for very long.  Apple says  we care about every single  employee who makes any Apple product.  But they are getting a lot of heat.  I think it's unfair to signal out Apple.  I think every bit of gear  that we buy today is made by  the same Chinese  employees in the same factories.  The Foxconn and Shenzhen factories.  But the  Times is all over  Apple for this.  Talking about the fact that for instance  workers assembling iPhones,  iPads and other devices labor in harsh  conditions.  Excessive overtime, some cases  seven days a week, live in crowded dorms.  Some say they stand so long  their legs swell until they can hardly  walk. Underage workers  help build Apple's products.  Apple did  take I think  appropriate step by finally disclosing  their suppliers. They weren't even doing that.

Start time: 2623.16
End time: 2652.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well that was several weeks ago or a couple of weeks ago  that Apple disclosed its list of suppliers  and along with it a fairly  detailed report on each kind of  abuse they found in each factory that they  visited. And I was surprised that  there were some that had indentured  type labor. They had slave  labor and child labor. I was surprised  not too surprised that they didn't  immediately sever any business relationship  with all those plants  that were employing people that way.  But again, they're a business,  there's no morality, there's no profit.

Start time: 2653.56

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  writes, some people are questioning Apple's  values today. Any suggestion  that we don't care is patently false and  offensive to us as you know better than anyone.  And he's writing to the Apple employees.  Accusations like this are contrary to our values.  It's not who we are.  So the question is, what are they going  to do about it? And I think you're right John. They don't  Here's what I'd love Apple to do. We've  talked about this a little bit before. I would love  them to offer  products as a choice.  They don't have to make them all this way. But say you could  buy an iPhone for 25% more. You  could buy an iPhone made in the US. Like organic fruit

Start time: 2701.58
End time: 2719.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  and fair trade diamonds? Exactly.  Okay, I think it's patently false and offensive  for Apple to suggest that that company  or any technology company has any kind of  morality at all or any values other  than make it cheap, make a shit ton  of them, excuse my language, and sell them to everybody  you can. Those are their values.  They don't care. No one

And we can't,  as we've previously discussed,  live our lives without computers and phones  and microphones and whatever else you want to buy.  All of this stuff comes from China.  All of it's made in this way.  Why are we so surprised that there are human  stories behind it? Why does it take a  human story to get us pissed off? That

Start time: 2751.30
End time: 2765.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  bothers me. The truth is I think every  single person who buys products  made in China knows in their heart  of hearts that  these standards, the American standards  are probably not applied to Chinese workers.  But I think the idea about made in America iPhones,

Start time: 2765.34

Start time: 2853.50
End time: 2901.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  one of the points that was being  made, I think that this sort of  came out that Steve Jobs made to Obama, was that  you can't,  you can add the cost of the labor and  say, the cost of the components and say,  okay, it's going to cost you 10% or  20% more to make these things in America.  What you can't do  is have a production line that will  just kind of run  with sort of half a minute's notice  and just absolutely churn  through these things in the same way that you can  in the Far East, because the labor laws mean  you won't be able to work like 13 hour shifts  or 16 hour shifts and be able to work  seven days a week, 24-7.  And it's only by  the sort of Eastern manufacturing processes  so the story goes,  that Apple can have these amazing sort of time  to market, so design something  and have it. Yes, it's not just profit, it's time to

Start time: 2901.22
End time: 2935.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  market. Well, there's that, but there's also one  element, I'll back up Jolie  on this, which is the  Japanese or the Chinese are actually  probably selling stuff for more than  we know about. I mean, they can make  stuff incredibly cheap over there. And at  some point, it comes to the board and somebody says,  because somebody will present  them with this, and they say, look,  you can be making an extra $10  million in iPhone and we're selling 30  million of them. That's a lot of money.  And why are we making them here?  And you have to, you're the  CEO or whoever, and you have to answer that question.  Well, because they got child labor

Start time: 2935.48
End time: 2945.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  over there. And it comes to your point  about, you know, you have a responsibility, a fiduciary  responsibility to your shareholding.  When someone shows you a graph with a line that goes a little  bit higher, you say yes to China.

Start time: 2945.91
End time: 2961.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you could also,  and this is the thing, is it's not a clear-cut  decision, because as you pointed out,  making customers happy is also a fiduciary  responsibility. If customers are saying to you,  they're happy, Apple users, give me a break.  That's why we need to raise awareness.  Well, that's why Apple put out this big report, like,

Start time: 2961.28
End time: 3002.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  oh, we know this is going on and we're working with  companies to remediate these things.  That was a big PR piece, whatever.  I don't know if they're doing anything or what they're  doing, but only  because Apple sells so much  product and buys so much product from China,  can they put pressure on those companies to  change? And  can they amplify any pressure workers might be  putting on employers to change  working conditions? But this  goes back to labor law.  We have, you know, we're indignant.  We're Americans. We're extremely privileged.  We didn't have these labor laws 200 years  ago or, you know, some of them,  even 70 years ago. Someone in the  chamber mentioned Upton Sinclair, and yeah, I think  we need an Upton Sinclair for this.  But it's not going to be New York Times.

Start time: 3003.20
End time: 3028.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why I think that Apple  would say, well, we're going to stay in these  countries and we're going to push for improved labor  laws. We're raising the standards  of living, and now we want to raise  the standards of labor in  China and the countries that we work in.  Brazil, for instance,  they just built a new plant in Brazil.

But as we all know, if you do  not bill,  you do not get paid.  And that's why in 2004  when Amber MacArthur told me about FreshBooks,  I jumped. And I love it.  And I've used it ever since. It's the easy way.  I love it. And I've used it ever since. It's the easy  online invoicing service  for small business that saves you time.  And more, maybe more importantly,  gets you paid more quickly.  Over three and a half million FreshBooks  users know. You could try  the service free for  30 days of unlimited use right now at  freshbooks.com.  So here's the deal.  Creating the invoices, you could  do it in Word. I mean, a lot of you have ways  to do this. FreshBooks, you upload your  logo. They've got great software. It handles  all the currencies, by the way, which is great.  But even  if you say, well, I can do all that,  here's the beauty part. You email  your invoice. Your customers can print it as a  PDF. If you pay an additional fee, FreshBooks  will also print, stamp, and mail it as well.  But you want them to do the  invoicing via email because there's a button  on the invoice that says, pay  right now. And your clients  can press that button and play with a credit card.  They can even set it up. And you can set it up  so you automatically invoice and automatically get paid.  It is really  the way to make invoicing streamline,  fast, and efficient. There's automatic features like  if you don't get paid, you can have a 30, 60,  90 day  response that's automatic.  If you do time and hours,  your timesheets are automatically entered into the invoice.  They have an app for the iPhone.  They have a web-based app as well.  There's just so many nice  features. I want you to try it.  Free right now. 30 days  of unlimited use. All the features.  Clients, staff, everything.  No limits. Just by signing up  at FreshBooks.com. Tell them you heard about it on  Twitter if they ask.  Again,  it's not advertised on the site. This is something that  we do for you here. It's some inside  information. But if you sign up right now,  they will not charge you for 30 days of unlimited  use. So sign up for everything. All the features,  all the clients. Try it all free for  30 days at FreshBooks.com.  I'm a big fan. Fortunately, I have people  to do that for me now.  I don't have to worry about that anymore. Boy, that was a pain.  Facebook. Now, it's a rumor.  It's been in the Wall Street Journal.  It's been in the New York Times.  But Facebook is supposedly  will file an IPO. You know how I know this is true?  How?

They did a very interesting deal with the San Francisco firm,  and I've forgotten the name.  It was Hambrick.  Yeah, Hambrick and Quist.  No, it was just Hambrick.  Bill's all by himself now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  These companies get screwed by the system.  Well, that's the other side of it.  Yeah, that's the main part of it.  You bring out an IPO with $10 million, let's say,  and the stock triples, making the offering potentially worth $30 million.  So you want to do it as a Dutch auction.  So you get all that money instead of some speculators  who just get in early and they make a quick killing.  These firms don't like that, of course,  because they can't give their buddies some deal.  And that's why they're not...  Dutch auctions, you don't see them that often.

Transcript:  Google's, which was back in 2004, was the largest IPO ever, $1.9 billion.  Facebook's talking about $10 billion.  Yeah, it seems a little high.  Google did, in fact, because of this auction,  they thought they were going to go off at $108 to $135.  They ended up going off at $85 a share.  But of course, what is Google now?  Almost $600, something like that. $400?  No, it's six something.  It may be under six now.  And there may even have been splits in between then.  No, Google has never done a split.  It's $579.

Start time: 3828.16
End time: 3857.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because I think they're only just getting started.  That's what I think, too.  I think if you look at what Facebook has achieved in the last four years,  and you look at what Google achieved in the four years after IPO,  I remember when Google IPO'd and it was like, really, $85?  That's a lot of money for a search engine stock.  And, you know, of course, if you bought it then,  ten years later or whatever it is, you're laughing.  So I think Facebook is just getting started.  I honestly think it could go to two, three, four times that in the next decade.

Start time: 3858.20
End time: 3873.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would agree in one way or not in the other.  Of course, they've got 800 million members.  You can't get much bigger.  There's only, what, two billion people on the internet?  Not even that.  So they've almost got everybody.  They're saturated.  But what you haven't...

Start time: 3874.16
End time: 3880.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but if you look at what Google, if you look at what Facebook does in terms of monetization...  That's where they haven't...  They've just gotten started.  Exactly.

Start time: 3882.16
End time: 3896.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, they're also just getting started with Facebook credits,  and I think from talking to them,  I think that's their biggest area of opportunity.  Ads are going to become maybe even secondary as Facebook credits.  You know, we think of them as something you use to play Farmville.  Eventually, they'll be something you can use in the real world to buy bread.  Exactly. It's cash.

He's got a big stake in Facebook.  No, Zuckerberg's got at least 25%.  Does he?  So this guy's going to be immediately Warren Buffett class billionaire.  He's going to be one of the top five richest people in the world.  He's going to be one of the top five richest people in the world.  Immediately.  Like, boom.  Is it going to change Facebook, though?  He's always said, I don't want investors,  I don't want a board, you know, outside investors.  I don't want a board, you know, outside investors.  Yeah, he's got one now.  He wanted to keep Facebook private, and certainly,  he has very much influenced the direction of Facebook.  He's been able to run that company.  Is it going to change it?

Start time: 3962.26
End time: 3993.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think big time.  In fact, my son, who's a student of Facebook,  and Zuckerberg in particular,  says that, as far as he's concerned,  Zuckerberg's a genius,  and they're taking away his power very slowly.  There's a lot of new ideas showing up on Facebook.  They're definitely not Zuckerberg's ideas,  and they're going to end up screwing it up,  because Zuckerberg's not a very aggressive person.  He's like an Asperger's guy.  He's almost like a Bill Gates character.  Definitely.  Definitely.  And he's going to lose control.

Start time: 3995.27
End time: 4032.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that's exactly right.  I think, you know,  the one thing that Zuckerberg  has always been very canny about doing  is making incremental changes,  and doing things quite slowly.  You know, it's taken a long time for Facebook monetization  to get to where it is now,  to the point, you know, we still,  or do we just have ads now in the newsfeed?  I'm like, that's been a long time coming.  And I admire that.  The thing is, you can do that when you're a private company.  When you're a public company,  as we were saying earlier,  it's like, right, now you have a fiduciary duty  to make as much money as humanly possible  as quickly as possible.  And that could be a massive step change for Facebook.  I think so.

So if you take all that away  and you just think that this was a company  started by a Harvard sophomore  about 10 years ago, right?  No, not even that.  Not even that.  And the value that has been created by this one person,  that has been created by this one company  in such a short time,  is stunning.  And it could only happen in this technology.  There's no factory spewing smoke.  There's no Chinese  indentured servants.  It's almost a virtual company.  It's bits.  And the value that he's created out of  nothing is mind-boggling.

Transcript:  You agree, Will?  I think one of the most important things about Facebook  in the next five years, the next phase of Facebook,  is actually the mass decentralization of Facebook.  So while we think about Facebook now  as something you go on and do,  I think Facebook now is going to start to be  just something that is.  You're somewhere on the web  and it's already that you're commenting on Facebook,  you're logged in to get your personalized preferences  for a particular site on Facebook.  Somebody in the chatroom was saying,  what's the bet that Facebook credits will be  legal tender in 7-11 within the next five years?  I think so.  Facebook is not going to be something that you do,  it's just going to be something that's just part of your life,  like your wallet or your phone.  Yeah, and Will, what you're talking about,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Chilling Effects, which is I think kind of  interesting. Chilling Effects is an electronic  frontier foundation  website that basically the  premise of it is, what  are the chilling effects of these laws? What  are the, what's the impact of these laws? Sure,  the DMCA allows  companies like Twitter and YouTube to have safe  harbor. In other words, not to be held  liable for pirated content or  whatever that's on their services,  provided they offer  a mechanism so that  the companies that own the rights can say, hey,  get that off of there. And Twitter does it,  YouTube does it, even MegaUpload did it,  although it didn't protect MegaUpload.  And so here are all the  cease and desist notices  for 2011  up here from Magnolia Pictures,  from  Simon and Schuster. What are  they links to? They're links to  pirated content, I guess?

Transcript:  There's like three different divisions of it.

Start time: 5094.52
End time: 5112.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So ACTTA is the very  sneaky SOPA  that is done as a treaty  instead of as a law. Yeah.  And in fact, get ready for this, it probably  will be made the law of the land in the US  not by Congress, not by the Senate,  which normally approves treaties,  but by executive order.  Yeah, it works.

Start time: 5114.44
End time: 5119.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we have a king run in the country,  so you might as well just make  executive orders all day and all night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Parliament says, yes, we can.

Start time: 5122.16
End time: 5157.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Ron Wyden's fighting this. Ron Wyden's really  upset about the fact that ACTTA  is not approved by the Senate.  True treaties are not approved by the Senate.  So ACTTA is an international trade agreement  negotiated by the European Union,  the United States, Japan, Canada, South Korea,  Australia, Mexico, Morocco, Singapore.  Canada's involved.  It essentially gives  you the Three Strikes Act.  It gives you  a lack of due process and shutting  down so-called  pirate sites.  It is  really the backdoor  sopa.

Start time: 5158.16
End time: 5162.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and I like the Three Strikes thing.  Let's start taking people's internet access away.

Start time: 5172.16
End time: 5186.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So if you're interested, I urge you  to go to EFF.org and read up  on ACTTA and why you should  care about it. ACTTA has several features  that raise concerns for privacy,  for civil liberties, for the free  flow of information on the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've said it before. I'll say it again.  We're finishing up on the golden age  of the internet. I think you might be right.  And we might as well enjoy it while we can  because in the future, and the public doesn't care  because as long as they can get to Facebook and Amazon,  they're good to go.

Start time: 5202.38
End time: 5219.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The only thing you can do at this  point is to petition  the White House not to make it an executive  order and tell members of Congress  actually not even members of Congress because it's the Senate  now that would be responsible. Tell your  senators to demand the right  to review ACTTA and then  not to approve it.

Start time: 5268.50
End time: 5272.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 5272.24
End time: 5308.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  be this kind of now  boudlerized, protected internet  that most people will use.  But I believe the internet is self-healing and geeks  want free flow of information. I think  what's going to happen is you're going to get a second tier. You're going to have  a black internet. You're going to have a  just as you have a black market.  You're going to have an internet  that you, if you were  well this is what happened in China.  In China there's the internet everybody uses  that doesn't allow Facebook, Twitter, YouTube.  But if you're  in the literati,  if you're digitally literate,  you can get on all of those. You know how to get on all of those.  And I suspect that that's what's going to happen. What do you think?

Start time: 5340.36
End time: 5347.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's analog, baby.  But already hackers, and we talked about this a couple of weeks  ago, are putting satellites up so they have  satellite access. Will, do you think this is crazy?

Start time: 5349.43
End time: 5380.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think it's crazy.  I wonder if it's  a forced evolution.  What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.  And I wonder if it will lead to, you know, there are so many  structural flaws with the internet.  I wonder if a sort of  rebuilding from the ground up of something that's  better will lead to, you know,  you build something that's got security  built in and, you know,  anonymization. And  if you were going to design the internet from scratch  again now, you could probably do a better  job of it. And so I wonder if this will be the catalyst  for sort of a next generation of evolution.

Start time: 5380.52

Transcript:  Oh, you're blowing my mind now, Will.

Start time: 5382.83
End time: 5445.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm pretty sure that, you know, with internet  2 and some of this other stuff, we're definitely going to  always have a couple of alternatives  to the internet. So why wouldn't  we just do something like that?  Or just let the other one split  into pieces. I still think  what's going to, I think the real scenario here is  first of all, we go into a nationalization  of the internet country by country.  That way you don't have a  any problems within Saudi Arabia  about anything because it's essentially a closed  system. We have one here and  the thing that's going to  kind of diminish everything, even though you have people  like yourself and Leo and others,  is the fact that  the public at large  doesn't care. They  will have their three or four things. Nobody goes  like people that when you remember when PCs first  came out, you had, they did some  studies and it turned out that people only downloaded  or installed three or four extra  programs besides the one that they got  on their PCs. They don't do all this stuff.  There's very few people that, and  in fact I think the number is getting smaller that  are involved in anything more than just the basics.  And we were just stalling for Leo.  Well you know my concern.

Transcript:  You're right not to find it.  I don't know where it went. It was OS2  warp in a sealed package.  Which I know you would love. Somebody sent it  to us and I don't know where it's gone. It belongs in the  Smithsonian. Believe it, it does.  It was the IBM operating system  that John was a big advocate for.  And somebody sent it to me sealed in the box  and it's disappeared. So I think one of my staff  members actually thought it was something you might want.  Or junk.

Start time: 5470.38
End time: 5471.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 5472.22
End time: 5476.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway, no I think this is a great  conversation. I think this is what's going to happen.

Start time: 5476.16
End time: 5485.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Leo, if that does happen, I mean what you  and Will are talking about is like okay we're going to have  a separate non-internet internet like thing  that will allow digitally  literate people to access information

Start time: 5486.64
End time: 5492.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The digitally literate. It's  for everybody. I mean did you read  Vint Cerf's op-ed in the New York Times? It's not a  civil right, it's not a human right. But it gives you  access to those things. I agree. I agree.  100%. And when you limit that access  I'm not advocating this. Just to geeks.

Start time: 5506.16
End time: 5510.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

End time: 5516.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do you think we can get people to fight ACTA  after fighting SOPA? It's hard to  get people interested. They only fight one or two

Start time: 5520.16
End time: 5526.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  it's what's going to happen. So who do we need to call?  Do we need to call the White House? Or do we need to call  our senators or both? About ACTA?

Start time: 5526.16
End time: 5543.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can go to WhiteHouse.gov and there are  petitions on WhiteHouse.gov.  In the petition section, one of the  petitions is, President Obama  do not sign ACTA.  Let the  Senate have something to do with it.  Let me see if I can find it. Because

Start time: 5544.40
End time: 5572.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Also the thing, if you're in Europe  the thing you can do is write to your European  member of parliament.  Yes, because they have to approve it.  They have to approve it. So even though most  of the countries in the EU, apart from Germany  and a couple of others have approved it at a national  level, it still has to be approved at the European  level by the European Parliament. So if you write to  your European member of parliament and tell them  to don't be so idiotic,  there's still a  chance that's going to happen in June. So  writing campaign between now and June

Transcript:  executive order. What would be his rationale?

Start time: 5592.91
End time: 5610.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's the problem.  His rationale is maybe to get elected.  Because we do have an election coming up in November.  I just think, if, this is how  SOPA and PIPA worked. We scared  the hell out of the members of Congress into thinking they were going to lose  their constituency.  The only choice you've got at this point is to really  make this an urgent thing.  And the reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that's why Obama's going to win.  Sorry. Cause everybody  who would want Ron Paul to be on  the Republican ticket, they're not going to see that happen.  No, I agree. And Newt Gingrich  is going to be up there being all Newt Gingrichy.

Start time: 5648.18

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 5656.16
End time: 5662.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 5668.16
End time: 5677.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would be good. Alright, maybe I'll vote for him.  Let's go back to the story.  And by the way, somebody said  they're absolutely right. Because I live in California,  it doesn't matter who I vote for.

Start time: 5678.44
End time: 5698.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  True. And actually, if you live in California,  it doesn't matter if you call your senators, really.  Because it's so funny that we have all the  entertainment here, and  we have a lot of the technology talent here.  And last I checked,  our two senators do not plan  on not supporting  legislation that helps the entertainment  industry by censoring private citizens and elevation.

Start time: 5698.32
End time: 5756.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, right. Because Feinstein and Boxer  are getting a lot of money.  They're in the pocket. From Hollywood.  Here it is. It is on the WhiteHouse.gov site.  We the people please submit  active to the Senate for  ratification as required  by the Constitution.  It is a trade agreement.  Now that's step one. And by the way,  there are 4,549 signatures  on there. It's easy to create  an account and sign it. That's how many  needed to reach a goal.  But the goal is meaningless.  What you've got to do is everybody has to sign this.  Raise this issue. Ron Wyden in the Senate  has been fighting for this.  The Senate wants the right to  see this. The thing about  ACT is it's been in secret the whole time.  If it weren't for Michael Geist in Canada,  who finally found the  treaty itself and published it,  we would never know about this.  This has been a secret.  This is one of them. We do a lot of that.  You bet. And it's really  shameful.

Start time: 5758.22
End time: 5764.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Eric Duckman in the chat room has got a  link to a  petition, an active petition on the WhiteHouse.gov  that's got 35k signatures.

Start time: 5766.56
End time: 5809.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the one we were  pointing to. There's also  some others on ePetitions. But do the one  on WhiteHouse.gov.  The first step is to say  you can't sign this as an executive order.  Send it to the Senate.  Then the next step is to pressure the Senate.  Pressure the hell out of the Senate.  Unfortunately, not all of them are up for election.  Only half of them.  Thank you, Dan. End ACT  and protect our right  to privacy on the Internet.  I think this might be, there might be, so there's two of them.  I tried. This is too bad. No.  Oh look, at 35,000 on this one. So this  reached its goal. So there are several  active, anti-active positions.

Start time: 5810.16
End time: 5812.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's a dummy.  The dummy guy in the beard with the  thing on his head. Don't like him.  See? And then they would all know.  Generally, yeah. Generally speaking.  I think you have to do this because you're  operating in a nation. You have to abide by the  rules of the nation. It's the same issue Google had  in China. They had two choices, either  adhere to the laws of China or withdraw.  So Twitter has the same thing.

Start time: 5871.09
End time: 5886.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's also an interesting one  for France. So for example, in France  there are all sorts of like anti-Nazi  propaganda laws. Right. So  Germany too. Yeah.  So, you know, it's not just sort of the  Chinas and the Saudi Arabia. That's a good point.  The European countries are quite big on that.

Start time: 5886.62
End time: 5892.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 5892.24
End time: 5901.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it's just what you do. But Twitter, I mean...  Who cares? It's Twitter. It's Twitter.  It's just like, hi, how you doing? Oh yeah.  I met this, you know, I mean  it's just mundane. I mean who...

Start time: 5902.16
End time: 5921.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I mean Twitter would argue if they were  here, which they're not, that they have had  some role in like political  goings on where there isn't free speech  in the press and there isn't free speech, you know, on the radio  in those countries that they play, that  they take over that role.  Yeah, they claim that. Yeah, they claim that.  But then they say, okay, we'll play along with local  censorship. So which one is it? Facebook was

And then we send 30,000  people and we send 15,000 to  one phone and 15,000 to another and  the one that responds best wins.

Transcript:  personality and say, chill, dude.  What are you getting so freaked out about?  So then last night  someone sent me an anonymous email  that Curebit hadn't only stolen  the images and the codes. They had  a demo video where they stole music from  a local San Francisco artist.  Not like Metallica or somebody where they make millions  of dollars. They don't care. A local, independent  artist. And then if you go to  Twitter slash random  rab,  you can see it all going down where  this guy says, yeah, they did steal  my music for their demo video. They  didn't  get in touch with me beforehand.  And I'm asking them to take it down.  And then they're trying to buy me out now.  But he said, it's sad to be  put in the position of telling someone why  it's wrong. You cannot convince  the Curebit guys that what they have done  is wrong. They think stealing is okay.  And you know what? A lot of  people think it's okay. This is why we needed Sofa and Pippa.  A lot of the lean startup people think that this is perfectly fine behavior.  That's how you be lean.
