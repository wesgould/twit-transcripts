Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, trying to make sure my voice is heard, which is good. Good start so far.  But yeah, I love this job. Love being at daily code. Really great technology in the age where people are just trying to figure out how to get video working even internally.  So we help some companies who are now going remote first instead of returning to the office to use to make their own tools internally for communication, which is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Boy, it looks like many companies are going to stay remote, too. We're going to get to that in just a second.  But let me introduce our third panelist, Mr. Ed Bott, who I have known for 27 years, something like that.  Something like that.

Transcript:  It's so strange. I mean, you know, we're we've been doing twit for 15 years.  You know, we'll probably do it at least for 20 years to even think of doing anything for that long.  It doesn't doesn't really compute. I remember when I was first starting out in radio and they said, oh, you have to have three to five years experience.  I thought, how would anybody get that much experience doing anything?  Now, I guess now I say you got to have 30 years experience or I don't want you on the show.  Anyway, great to see you, Ed, from New Mexico, New Mexico.

End time: 363.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right in between Albuquerque and Taos and a little town called Santa Fe. Oh, I've heard of that.  Yeah, kind of artsy, kind of artsy and artsy place.  And by the way, so the last time I was on was back in September.  And the room there was a rumor that CDNet was about to be acquired.

Start time: 363.16

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I remember. And I asked you and you said, I don't know anything more than you do.

Start time: 370.30
End time: 377.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

End time: 387.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 387.12
End time: 389.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

End time: 398.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 399.16
End time: 409.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, what? So I doubt they're going to change much.  They bought they got seen at two, right?  They got all of the former CBS interactive properties. Correct.

Start time: 410.04
End time: 453.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. So it's all all of those.  And, you know, the the. At least for now, there's not going to be any change for, you know, any changes in anything.  And I would, you know, aside from the legal disclaimers and stuff that goes on there.  But I think they bought the division because the sites are doing well.  Yeah. And so the management teams are all are all intact.  The only thing that's really changed is that, you know, I sent it.  I sent a manuscript off to one of my editors yesterday and I got a email back, an automated email back that said, you know, please update your email address to so and so adventures.com.  Oh, wow. Oh, wow.

Start time: 454.80
End time: 465.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're doing it's funny because you and I go back to the days when computer magazines were totally dominant and there were two big companies.  You worked for IDG. I worked for Ziff Davis.

Start time: 466.96
End time: 471.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then and then I worked for Ziff Davis. Right. So I worked for both of them. Yeah.

Start time: 472.50
End time: 504.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And obviously, magazines have kind of gone by the wayside.  But Red Ventures looks a lot like the old Ziff Davis in a way, except that they're all websites instead of print magazines.  You know, they're assembling a portfolio in a variety of different verticals.  That's really interesting. They've got the points guy for travel and bank rate and reviews.com and as well as CNET.  So I think that's a really interesting. It's kind of analogous to something that we were a little bit more used to the old days of magazine publishing.

Start time: 504.58
End time: 543.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it is sort of fascinating the way that they did the you know, when you look at the integration there, you look at those those rectangles that were just up on the screen.  And the the absence of overlap was almost startling.  You know, it's a really good fit from the standpoint of, you know, everything.  There's a lot of B2C type stuff there.  But just, you know, normally you get it. You get some an acquisition like this.  And there's a couple of properties where you look at and you go, OK, these guys are going to have to duke it out and see who survives.  And and in this case, there's just none of that, which is fairly comforting for someone like me who, you know, gets a paycheck.

Start time: 544.24
End time: 555.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, our friends at I'm more were bought by the future folks and they have a lot of tech verticals.  And so there's always that, you know, a little bit, that little feeling in the pit of your stomach.

Start time: 556.00
End time: 556.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Start time: 558.40
End time: 578.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does does Red Ventures seem like a company that's in this for the long haul?  Because I mean, you know, we've seen some other digital media companies get bought by, you know, these companies, you know, that are I don't know how much these guys are venture backed.  They've been around. They've been around for 20 years.  They've been around for 20 years.

Start time: 579.64
End time: 594.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And as far as I know, they're, you know, profitable and self-funding, no venture backing.  So it's all it that ticks all of the right boxes for for me.  It's good to hear.

Start time: 596.24
End time: 691.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is a kind of a constant theme on all our shows and has been for the last 15 years, which is the disintermediation, the recreation of every area of life thanks to technology.  And so you're seeing this with, you know, magazines initially replaced by the Internet and now kind of a reformation of the old publishing houses, except that it's blogs.  Same thing's happening in my field and podcasting very much so with a couple of big incumbents now just grabbing everybody.  There's fewer independent podcasts between the PBS mafia with WNYC and public radio and then Spotify, which has been very aggressive.  People like Joe Rogan acquiring podcasts and then I Heart, which is, of course, a big radio, the number one radio broadcasting in the United States now is becoming completely dominant in podcasts.  So it's really it's I guess the more things change, the more they remain the same.  It's just we're juggling it around.  In fact, maybe that leads to one of our first stories because somebody called me on the radio show about T-Mobile's new video service.  They're getting into the cable industry in effect and with kind of similar to Sling TV and YouTube TV.  It's what is it called?  I can't even.  T-Vision.  T-Vision.  Yeah.  And it's kind of a lightweight cable bundle, although if you add enough channels and get up to $60 a month, it can be very much like a cable operator.

Start time: 692.92
End time: 702.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It seems like all of these new ones start off lightweight and then within a year or two.  Get as expensive as cable.  They get walked up like YouTube TV.  They're up to what, $65 a month now.

Start time: 704.12
End time: 767.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's interesting because they bought Layer 3 and this is actually technology they got when they bought Layer 3.  I think Layer 3 thought this was going to be like streaming concerts and things like that.  But they're using the repurposed to stream television and the plans start as little as $10 a month if you're a T-Mobile customer.  But it's not just for T-Mobile customers.  It's really there is a jockeying now to become the next cable power.  We don't need cable anymore.  Everything's over the top.  And there's one big, there are two big gaps though in what T-Mobile is doing.  One, they don't have CBS at all.  That's kind of a problem.  They don't have HBO either and they're not on Roku, which has been a problem for a lot of these guys.  Remember, HBO Max wasn't, Peacock wasn't when they first launched.  You got to make the deals.  So it's actually just as complicated a universe.  It really the only thing that's changed at all is instead of coming in as television over the cable, they're coming in as internet over the cable.  I don't know exactly how to.

Start time: 767.14
End time: 793.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wanted to add a little asterisk there.  Like I am one of those legacy Sprint customers and it's for T-Mobile proper customers that get in first and Sprint customers won't be able to sign up until later.  Yeah.  So we're still treated like we're a part of another company, which I think is very unfortunate.  Doesn't feel like the acquisition went all the way through in terms of same.  Yeah.

Start time: 794.61
End time: 816.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Also a legacy Sprint customer here.  And yeah, I can attest to that.  In fact, now when you go to sign into your online account management for the thing, you you go there and it takes you to T-Mobile and then you type in your email address and it goes, oh, you're one of those.  Sorry.  And then they send you over somewhere else that isn't quite as as magenta.

Start time: 817.52
End time: 873.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I will add myself to the pile on because I bought a new iPhone for my mom.  She still had the six.  I thought it's time for a new one and she's on Sprint.  And so I had to call Sprint except T-Mobile answered.  And then he said, oh, hold on.  I waited for half an hour to get.  Oh, hold on for another half an hour.  I have to say the T-Mobile music is on hold is much more rockin than the Sprint music on hold.  Just, you know, little review.  And also, by the time I got online with somebody from Sprint, it was clear they were not not only not in this country, I think they were not in this universe because there was about a three second lag.  You say something three seconds later, you hear what you said coming through the guy's headphones.  So you just learn, oh, I'm going to wait because we had a lot of collisions up front.  You maybe you could fix that, Wesley.  Can you get daily.co on that?  Because that's a mess.  It's ugly.

Start time: 874.08
End time: 889.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They can call us.  I'll hook them up.  But it sounds like maybe do you think that they are just shuffling off Sprint and then hoping through some sort of attrition through these deals that they'll incentivize people to switch plans or no.  It's a migrate over.

Start time: 890.04
End time: 894.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They say you guys will get access later this month.  It's not like they're going to keep you out in the cold forever.

Start time: 895.40
End time: 899.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think in terms of the support, you said, well, think like they are fully funding that.

Start time: 900.30
End time: 925.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, they've got to integrate.  This is, by the way, why Comcast is so bad for years.  They kept acquiring cable systems, all of which had different computer systems, different, you know, completely different systems.  And they somehow had to cobble this into some giant ball of string that worked.  And it didn't work for years and years and years.  And I suspect it'll be like that with T-Mobile and Sprint.  It'll just be a mess until it's not.

Start time: 926.62
End time: 930.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it sucks that it's a telecom company, right?  Like, well, why would you think it'd be any different?

Start time: 931.00
End time: 966.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're bad communicating with each other.  They're the worst. Are you kidding?  They're the worst monopoly in America.  Telecoms shortly just by inches, followed by the cable companies, which are becoming telecoms.  Cable TV of execs, according to Tector, move past denial stage.  Now fully expect a cord cutting bloodbath.  This is this is this is the disintermediation we were talking about.  It never ends well for the cable companies.

Start time: 967.00
End time: 984.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, we we cut our cable like five years ago.  Yeah. And a couple of years ago, we actually tried did the trial of YouTube TV.  And quickly within a couple of days, we realized, you know, it's a cable company.  Don't miss all the ads.

Start time: 985.35
End time: 989.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a cable company. It's just it's just a different delivery method.  Why would I want to pay for this again?

Start time: 991.66
End time: 1021.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, there was there wasn't really anything we wanted to watch that we didn't have on the streaming services that we had.  And we had to have had to watch ads.  You know, so we canceled the trial and we've been you know, we have a bunch of different streaming services, you know, some of which we cancel and restart at various times, depending on what's on them.  You know, like, you know, stars, you know, this show we were watching on stars like American Gods finishes.  OK, cancel that. When something else comes up, we resume it.

Start time: 1021.08
End time: 1027.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. So that's the clearly that's not an improvement, though, Sam.  That's just as bad. Right.

Start time: 1029.05
End time: 1047.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, because I don't have to call up the cable.  Oh, that's true. If I want to cancel one of these services, I go into Google Play, hit cancel.  Boom. I'm done. That's a good.  And I don't have any retention officer, you know, trying to keep me on.  I just hit cancel. And, you know, when I want to restart, hit subscribe and I'm done.  Yeah. It takes me three seconds.

Start time: 1048.32
End time: 1095.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What they should have done instead of like fight.  Do you remember Aero or Aero?  Aero.  Yeah, which the courts put out of business.  Yeah, they made that whole business basically illegal to try to spin up and do them do it again.  If if the major cable companies bought them instead and like transition themselves into this new  cord cutting new wave, then they really could have like it wouldn't be a bloodbath.  It would be a slow transition where people would just move over and it would be the new way of getting  your TV and everybody would be on it and they would just be so dominant and just add on these other  Hulu Netflix services to that and they could have been the Roku of IPTV.

Start time: 1095.12
End time: 1188.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But instead, they you know who shut down area is the broadcasters.  Yeah, because they were they were rebroadcasting.  They were grimly holding on to their model.  And in fact, the reason it's now sixty five dollars for YouTube TV is because they have said, OK, you can  you can rebroadcast us, but it's going to cost you.  Meanwhile, as you point out, Sam's not cutting one minute of advertising from their from their hour.  So they're kind of double dipping.  Somebody must explain to me and I don't claim to understand how this works at all.  Lowcast. So you know, do you know about lowcast?  Lowcast.org. If you're in one of the markets and I am in San Francisco, I don't know.  Detroit is so you're you're probably count, Sam.  There's nothing in New Mexico. I'm sorry.  And there's nothing in Austin, although you might be you might be in the Dallas greater metropolitan region.  I'm not sure. But this is free.  They pop up a please give us money all the time, but they haven't been shut down.  And the weird thing is they seem to be partially owned by broadcasters.  So I can't quite figure this out.  They're on every hardware platform, Apple TV and Roku and Android TV.  And it's it's a it's a very odd business model that it feels like Aereo.  It's got all the local TV stations.

Start time: 1190.55
End time: 1201.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If I recall correctly, when this launched, it was it is kind of like Aereo.  But I think that it was actually set up as like a nonprofit.

Start time: 1202.62
End time: 1218.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. Which is exactly what it is.  Yeah, it's dot org.  But see, you could put Sam, you could put lowcast on your Apple TV or your Roku and you'd get your live locals at no cost.

Start time: 1218.36
End time: 1223.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you could put up with the donation requests, you know how else I can get those live locals.

Start time: 1223.20
End time: 1235.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, an antenna on the roof. Yeah.  See, I'm in an area where antenna does no good.  I get channel 50, which I don't really don't want.  I don't want channel 50. It's not the best channel.

Start time: 1236.00

Start time: 1243.12
End time: 1249.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, but you can pop in your ExpressVPN to some location that has it.

Start time: 1250.40

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 1253.04

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't tell anybody in the court system.  Actually, they've got other they've got bigger fish to fry right now.  They're worried about an election. So you're probably you're probably safe.  According to Carl Bodie on Tech Dirt in since 2012, 25 million US households have done what you did, Sam.  They've cut the cable cable industry expects that randomly picked another number.  Yeah, there'll be about another 25 million.  We expect we're going to have we'll be cut in half.  They used to have 100 million subscribers.  They'll have 50 million traditional cable TV subscribers.  At least three major media companies now expect to pay TV subscriptions to stabilize around 50 million.  According to people familiar with the matter who declined to speak on record because their company plans are private.  The projected decline in subscribers will meet a drop of about 25 billion dollars in cable subscription revenue,  plus advertising losses for the largest US media companies, including Disney, Comcast, NBC, Universal,  WarnerMedia, Viacom, CBS, Fox, Discovery, Sinclair and AMC networks.

Start time: 1331.82
End time: 1351.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think that's probably that's part of the reason why companies like Disney have been pivoting like Disney did a big reorg in the last month or so.  You know, and now basically all streaming all the content together all streaming through in your streaming.  Yeah. Yeah. Both the movies and TV stuff, putting everything in the streaming group.

Start time: 1351.46
End time: 1383.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Big change for Disney. Right.  But it's but it's kind of recognized seeing the writing on the wall.  Here's the original CNBC story. Media executives are finally accepting the decline of cable TV.  Finally.  You know, and then you look at people like Netflix in particular, but Amazon Prime also who are really doing a good job,  obviously, of making money, of making content, of surviving in an over the top world.

Start time: 1385.57
End time: 1399.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Disney Plus is raising their Netflix is raising their price.  And you're thinking, whoa. But if you look at the cable bills, right, have not competed whatsoever.  And they stayed high and market pressures has not pushed that down.

Start time: 1400.20
End time: 1420.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I think they deserve to die. It's a smart time for Netflix to raise their prices.  Yeah, they're going to go up. The top plan will be eighteen dollars.  I think it's a couple of bucks across the board.  But yeah, eighteen dollars a month for what you get on Netflix.  I think that's worth it. As long as they keep getting new content.

Start time: 1421.00
End time: 1431.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Except if you are depending on a check from Quibi to keep production going, there's a there's a I can't remember the name of it,  but there's a production company in Europe that is like freaked out because the money stopped and they haven't finished their film.  And they want to finish it because you're right, they'll have the rights to something that they can sell, but they've got no money to do it.

By the way, this is part of the problem with Quibi you're seeing right here is I can't show you a clip.

Yeah, my favorite was the one where they took a meal, they mashed it up and fired it and can't with it through cannons at chefs who were then supposed to recreate the meal from the shrapnel of the meal that they got with.

Anyway, that's why we're paying $18 a month for Netflix, ladies and gentlemen, and not for Quibi.  All right, I want to take a break when we come back.  Well, let's talk about the companies that are making big bucks.  Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Amazon, all of which issued quarterly results this week.  And guess what? There's money in them.  Our technology plays lots of money, all of them show showing a huge growth.  I guess that's not really much of a surprise.

I don't, honestly, financial results, we're going to skim through these.  I don't think it's much use unless you're investing in the stock market.  And even then, nowadays, because they're using non-standard accounting practices,  it's kind of hard to know anything about what's going on.  Apple had a great quarter, a record quarter, interestingly, for both services and Macintosh.  Apple's really doubling down on this services thing.  Although, when you find out, you know where I'm going, don't you Ed?  When you find out that a significant portion of that comes from Google,  something like $7 to $12 billion a year, $1 billion a month,  it's not quite the money you thought it was.  I mean, it's money, but it's not services sold to end users.  It's sold to Google so that your iPhone continues to use Google Search as its default.  Mac revenue up, again, record quarter.  That's funny because it's almost a surprise.  I thought Apple might have Osborne'd their Macs by announcing  that they were abandoning the Intel platform,  and future Macs would all be running their own silicon.  But apparently, I think what happened is a lot.  Either it was work from home, because PC industry has also done very well,  or it was people freaked out saying, I've got to get the last Intel Macs.  Huge growth in Mac sales, 29% revenue change.

Start time: 2037.09
End time: 2071.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there was also a little bit of pent-up demand there, I think, too,  because there was a fairly significant period in the second quarter,  second calendar quarter, where manufacturing was slowed or stopped.  And so there was this delay in the pipeline.  That's interesting, sure.  And a lot of that picked back up.  So various companies, depending on where their manufacturing is done,  how it's accounted for, and what their sales channel is like,  had those dips and then blips.

Start time: 2075.02
End time: 2088.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, and we'll get to Microsoft in a second.  But the PC industry, that's exactly what happened in the PC industry, right?  And sales are very strong, record sales for PCs.  Intel, though, not doing all that well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  wow, a bad keyboard can really ruin your day.  Maybe we should always put these better keyboards in there.  There's a rumor they're going back to the butterfly in their next Apple Silicon Macs.  No way.  That can't be true.

Start time: 2116.02
End time: 2120.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  Actually, that's another story we can little sidebar here.  But TikTok will live to see another day.  This is one of the things not only the Chinese government,  Chinese people were very upset about the WeChat TikTok banning.  That was supposed to happen November 12th.  A court has ruled this week that that wouldn't be fair to TikTok influencers  who would be hurt economically by the ban.  So the judge, Judge Beetlestone, best name in judiciary,  Judge Beetlestone said, No, you can't cut off TikTok November 12th or WeChat.  So they're going to continue for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The other thing is, with regard to WeChat,  that's probably part of the reason why Apple's been declining somewhat in China.  And Ben Thompson has talked about this a lot over the years.  Where the Apple's lock-in that they have here with iMessage doesn't really apply in China.  In China, everybody uses WeChat for messaging and payments and for dry cleaning, for railroad tickets, for everything.  So the platform doesn't matter.  And there's less incentive to go with a much more expensive iPhone  when you have a choice of all kinds of different Android phones that you can run WeChat on.  And it's the exact same experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And to your point, Wesley, there is a certain amount of patriotism.  Huawei's had the best quarter ever and has become incredibly profitable  because people in China are turning their backs on iPhones and picking up Huawei phones,  which are actually pretty darn good phones.  We can't get them here because they're spying on you or something.  Alphabet slash Google had a nice quarter.  They were up more than 50% profit year over year, $11 billion for the quarter ending September 30th.  Not bad.  When you look at this financial statement, it doesn't really show you that,  but when you look at Alphabet's results, what you also want to look at is how's Search doing?  And Search is growing, but not nearly at that rate.  YouTube is growing a little closer to 50%, but it's still only $5 billion in revenue in the quarter.  That's the real question, is how is Search doing?  Because everything else takes a big backseat to the Search revenue.

Start time: 2336.42
End time: 2421.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and that's always the fundamental question when you look at Google's business,  especially when you consider the antitrust action that was just filed against them by the DOJ  and 11 state attorneys general.  They have been trying for pretty much as long as I can remember to develop some kind of business  that can be a counterweight to Search and a counterweight to Search advertising,  and it just never seems to happen.  They've managed to get their revenue from non-Search related sources.  It used to be like 7 or 8%, and I think it might now be 12 or 13% or so,  but it just isn't there for them.  To their credit, they're going to start breaking out Google Cloud.  They're going to start actually reporting some detailed numbers for those,  maybe put some pressure on Microsoft to do the same thing.  But that to me is the thing that I look for in every Google earnings report,  is have they managed to show any signs that any of those other businesses are going to turn into something  that could pick up the slack if the antitrust case turns out to be very bad for them?

Start time: 2423.40
End time: 2430.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, and so you think that one of the results of the antitrust case could be some diminution of their search?

Start time: 2432.98
End time: 2456.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, that's all the things that are in the complaint involve striking at the heart of their search business,  of their search agreements, and the linkage between the advertising and the search.  So yeah, that's existential dread for them.

Start time: 2460.13
End time: 2461.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That seems to be the phrase of the hour.

Start time: 2464.12
End time: 2476.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, to your point Ed, just looking at these numbers here,  it looks like Google Cloud and other are now representing about 20% of Google's revenue.  Still a fraction.

Start time: 2477.42
End time: 2483.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And if you just take Cloud, a 3.4 billion out of a total of 46 billion, it's not yet to the size.

Start time: 2486.22

End time: 2504.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. Yeah, that's some good revenue. That's some money.  So Microsoft does not break out their earnings from Azure, from their cloud offerings?

Start time: 2504.92
End time: 2555.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, they do a weird thing. Mary Jo could expound on this at some length.  And she will. She will, I promise.  And she will. But what they do is they declare the annualized run rate for various parts of the Azure business.  And then they mix it in with a bunch of other cloud services, so that you're basically looking at a big stew.  And it's a very big stew, but it has some things in it that are like Microsoft Dynamics, which is a huge business.  And that's just mixed in there.  So you can never quite tell exactly where the revenue is coming from, from all of their different cloud product offerings.

Start time: 2556.00
End time: 2573.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This was a big complaint of Paul's, which is how do they get away with this? And all the companies now are doing it.  They're basically hiding the most important information if you want to understand their business and whether to invest in it,  which is, and my limited understanding, the whole point of these financials, these quarterly financials.

Start time: 2574.58
End time: 2640.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So here's the counter argument to that is that especially when you have a growing business and there are cycles,  there's product launches, there's business cycles and everything that go in there.  One thing that you don't want to do is to create a perception that something went down and, oh my God, it's the end of the world.  And the market is going to react to it like that.  So there's a natural tendency on the part of accountants.  I'm the son of an accountant. So I learned this early on.  Smooth everything out. And when you smooth everything out, you get to tell a nice, consistent story of growth.  Whereas if you focus on the individual things, you see spikes going up and spikes and dips going down.  And then you have to do the narrative that goes with that to explain why it's not a big deal that it went up and why it's not a big deal that it went down.  And those always sound like spin rather than reality.

Start time: 2641.00
End time: 2665.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's why Apple, instead of reporting iPhone sales, now reports revenue per customer.  And I think it can make a pretty strong case that that's a more useful metric for everybody involved,  how much per customer you're making, because you're not going to see the same iPhone growth nowadays that you would have seen 10 years ago.  So I guess I understand that.

Start time: 2666.62
End time: 2688.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The other thing they try to do is reveal as little detail as possible so that you're not giving information to your competitors as well.  You don't want them knowing how many units of Apple Watch you've sold or how many iPhone minis versus Pro Maxes have been sold,  because you don't want to give any clues away to your competition.

Start time: 2689.75
End time: 2715.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By the way, you're an analyst. So I should really defer to you on this.  But I'm not an accountant. I'm a technology analyst.  Oh, OK, good. But it really is the case that this is not for journalists. This is for analysts.  Journalists are trying to understand it. We're doing the best we can. But this is for financial analysts.  In fact, Microsoft doesn't even allow journalists on the earnings calls.  Mary Jo keeps saying, I'm going to sneak in as an analyst because you can't ask them questions.

Start time: 2716.80
End time: 2802.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So one of the most interesting things when you look at the quarterly reports, the 10Qs and then the annual reports, the 10Ks,  one of the things, you know, I'll always skim through the results because, you know, the numbers matter and everything.  That's what everyone's going to be writing about tonight and tomorrow.  But the thing that I always zero in on is the section called risk factors.  And when you look at the risk factor section, then the thing that you do is you compare the wording in the risk factor section for this quarter to last quarter and the quarter before that.  And and boy, oh boy, you can find some really good stories when you see that all of a sudden something showed up as a risk factor that had to be disclosed.  This is this is the kind of stuff that that they're putting.  They're putting that in there because they see this as possibly something that's going to happen.  Right. You know, six months from now or two or three years from now.  But when when the bad news happens, they're they're they're basically inoculating themselves against shareholder lawsuits by disclosing it in the risk factors.  So that's from a you know, from a pure lay persons or a journalist as opposed to analysts point of view.  That's the place to go and read first as you get you get all the juicy dirt in that one.

Start time: 2802.38

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Of course, a lot of back. Sorry. Before before we miss this point, you talked about about you want Google to break out their cloud business on their fact sheet.  But they may never do that because wasn't it last year they said that they're going to give it a couple more years.  And if it doesn't work out, they might diverse divest and like move on and sell it.  That's the Google way. So there's a possibility that here's why they're not breaking it out.  Right. Because they might get rid of it and they don't want it to show up in the books.

Start time: 2835.24
End time: 2857.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's there's a certain discipline that Google CFO Ruth Porat has imposed over the last few years that wasn't there maybe in the early days of Larry and Sergey where she's pretty quick.  If something is not going to turn a profit, she's pretty quick to say, OK, boys, it's bye bye.  And there has been a little bit of a detriment to Google because I think there's also the impression that Google just doesn't stick with anything.

Start time: 2859.08
End time: 2950.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, right. Well, that that same thing, you know, what Porat's been doing with the various other bets, I think, is actually behind something that happened with Waymo earlier this year for the first time.  Back in February of this year, Waymo took outside investment from outside of Alphabet up until now.  It's the self-driving project at Google has always been internally funded by Alphabet and Google.  And this year they took three billion dollars in outside investment for the first time.  And it wasn't talked about very much, you know, other than saying, oh, yeah, everybody's got all this.  You know, everybody's all excited about, you know, Google raising this extra money.  But, you know, why why are they suddenly taking money from other investors?  And I think it's because Porat looked at, you know, the the prospects for automated vehicles becoming a real business and decided that, you know, it's probably going to happen, but it's going to take a lot longer than everybody was thinking two, three, four years ago.  And she probably told Waymo, look, if you want to keep this going, you're going to have to find some funding elsewhere.  And, you know, that's why they went to Silver Lake and Magnum and a few other investors and, you know, raise this extra money to give them extra runway until they can actually scale a business out of that in three, four, five years time.  And, you know, so, you know, Porat probably told him, you know, you can keep it going.  We're not going to shut you down, but you're going to have to find funding somewhere else.  And it's not just more money.

Start time: 2951.00
End time: 2980.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's also reducing their exposure.  If the if the bet fails and they only own two thirds of it, that's better than if they own it 100 percent of it.  So that's, by the way, what Google calls them is other bets.  Historically, Google's not done nothing but lose money on other bets.  They make enough money in search and advertising that they can fund all this stuff, but they've yet to find the magic bullet that's going to give them a new business.  They really haven't. Even Android, I don't think, is a huge benefit to them.

Transcript:  Only to the extent that it that it props up search business.  Search and advertising. Yeah.  Yeah. Search and advertising on 60 or 70 percent of mobile traffic worldwide.  You know, my you know, my question on for Sam on taking the external investment in something like Waymo is that it also.  Lessons the the the the likelihood that if they have a home run, if they if this becomes the business, you know, one of the businesses that can help sustain them when, you know, if search and advertising gets into trouble.  But all of a sudden you've allowed a whole bunch of outside investing in there.  You're now sharing the profits with other people.  And a lot of that ameliorating effect that you're hoping for doesn't accrue to you.  Right. Yeah. I mean, you reduce the risk, but you also reduce the upside when you bring in other partners.  And I mean, that's that's pretty much the whole point of the search and advertising.

Transcript:  Income up 30 percent year over year, 13.9 billion for the quarter.  Not bad, not shabby, although on a par with every other of these companies that we're talking about, all the all the other big tech giants, behemoths.  Little sidebar here. These investigations by whether it was the House Antitrust Subcommittee that issued a very long scathing report that did include.  Did it not? Microsoft? Maybe not.  Maybe they feel like Microsoft's been spanked already, so they don't need to be spanked again.  The Department of Justice's investigation into Google, a number of investigations in the EU.  But the U.S. investigations, especially this past week's testimony, really about Section 230 seem tainted by politics to some degree.  And I have to wonder if there really is any real risk to these companies, any more than the president's executive order against Tick Tock has harmed Tick Tock in any way.  If anything, it's probably just increased the number of downloads.  The politics seem to hinder the ability to kind of agree on what to do.  Do you agree, Ed? Oh, God, absolutely.

Transcript:  The the whole the whole, you know, the Section 230 hearings that weren't they were just they were just grandstanding.  They were political grandstanding. It was it was political grandstanding.  It was, you know, and and and the real thing is, you know, when you look at, you know, the hearing that is legitimate is going to have legislation that comes out of it.  I I failed to see how any legislation could come out of this that would that would get passed.  There's no consensus. There's no consensus about what to do on on anything.  And and all of the possibilities, no matter which direction you go, make things worse, not better for everyone.  I mean, it's just it is the classic lose lose proposition.  So this was just an opportunity for primarily this was in the Senate.  You know, so it's run by the it's run by the Republicans.  And it was an opportunity for Republican senators to yell at social media companies and create sound clips for their own bites that they can use for the run in ads or to share with their share with their constituents.

Transcript:  Tough on Twitter. Let me tell you, it also diminishes the power that it would be in the past.  Like, oh, I got called in front of Congress. I don't want that to happen.  But when it happens every other week, you could there is a note about how calm all of the the CEOs were like when they were being questioned, even though they're being screamed and yelled at.  It's because they're like, so I know this isn't going to do anything.  No one cares. And nothing's going to come of it.  So it's unfortunate that the power of Congress or the power of the Senate is having a diminished effect because of this theater and era where facts don't hold the same weight.  So it's it's even both sides, the Republican and the Democratic sides, they're talking as if they didn't really understand what the law was governing these companies or how their place in it could affect the future of the Internet.  They're just like, why did you do this? And why did you do that? And why don't you do this?  And it just felt like a scolding and not really well, moving moving it forward, especially on the eve of an election, because they're going to be a lame duck Congress in three days anyway.

Transcript:  And highly unlikely, as you say, that anything will happen.  I don't want to, on the other hand, diminish any threats to Section 230, because those are existential dread threats to my business, to everybody who produces content online, especially if you allow comments or a chat room as we have or a forum.  All of that is protected by Section 230 and any threat to Section 230 is a threat to them.  But so I don't want to kind of say, oh, don't worry about it.  But you know what? It really felt like, don't worry about it.  They got bigger fish to fry maybe next year.

And I thought, you know, wow, that's like, I mean, that is chill.  That that dude is that is chill.  But I also thought that it would be a really interesting thing to, you know, the next time they do these hearings to require all of these CEOs to have heart rate monitors.  Look, real time, you know, heart rate.  So you can just watch this, the spikes as you go up there and Jack, Jack, I think would just be it would just be, you know, flat, you know, but but but but.  I would want to see, though, I would want to see Zuckerberg's EKG is his heart rate monitor because I, you know, I think he he's really calculating the entire time.  How can I use these things to lock in an advantage for Facebook and keep us, you know, keep keep any competition from ever getting near us?  Yeah.

And my other kid says, hey, I want to do this. I said, you two figure it out, then talk to me.  And then I know that delays that for like hours because they will not come to a very strategic.  You guys like go ahead and regulate, regulate us.  And then now both sides are fighting and now the focus is off them right off the companies.  It's on now the Congress.  Congress needs to figure it out.  And at the same time, on the side, he has all these lobbyists that are able to like whisper in the ears of what their interest is and try to shape that whole conversation.  So it's a brilliant play by Mark by saying, yes, please regulate us.

Like what you expect Google to fire an engineer just because he said something unpleasant about you?  Come on. I mean, it's ridiculous.

Twitter shares declined 11 percent, even though they reported record Q3 revenue profit that easily surpassed analysts expectations where they didn't deliver is in the number of daily active daily users.  That only rose 29 percent year over year compared to 34 percent the year earlier.  I think everybody's worried that after the election, people are just going to leave Twitter on mass.  I don't know. I don't know. You never know why the market buys or sells.

Transcript:  That's such a terrible thing. No, I'm really bullish on Twitter.  I will say that. Well, for two reasons.  One, with their crackdown on bots, they that they're they have a little modest growth, one might say.  But I would say it's more of a sustainable growth.  Like those are going to be less fake. 29 percent a year is not bad.

But also, they're slowly doing this, but they've revamped their Twitter Twitter API.  And do you remember in the heyday of Twitter where like things were so great and there's all these innovative applications that are built off of the Twitter API?  I think that they will be opening up that market in the future.  And do you remember that hint about subscription services?  And so I think I put those together and I think that they are going to be they have a really, really bright future ahead of them.

If the president of the United States uses it as your as his primary vehicle for addressing the electorate, that's not bad.  I mean, but what will happen? I don't think Joe Biden, if he should get elected on Tuesday.  Knock on wood. I don't think he will. Will he use Twitter?  Can he find his phone? He'll do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He'll do it in a in, you know, there's there's a there's always been a convention with politicians and corporate leaders using Twitter, which is that you have you have people who do that, who do that for you.  And there and there's message discipline. Right.

End time: 3809.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's not the word. That's not that's not the word you're looking for, Leo.  And also, I think to a certain extent, Trump has the same thing. He has other people doing those things.  He is, you know, Scovino, Dan Scovino, doing a lot of those things.  And he's just as nuts as his boss is. So it's it's it's the it's sort of the polar opposite of what you've got here.  But but really with, you know, in the case of Twitter stock price going down, you've you've really we're really in a situation right now where with all tech companies, basically they are priced for perfection.  Everything, you know, everyone's been piling money into there because where else can you put money right now?  You know, interest rates for everything else are down in the in the fractions of a single percent fractions of below one percent.  And so, you know, everyone's loading money into those things.  And so at the first sign of any tiny problem, the the crack in the perception of perfection disappears and some of the institutional money disappears from it scares out some of the retail investors.  And then a few days later, you know, everyone starts piling back in again.  But everything's priced for perfection.  So any kind of problem perceived or otherwise that comes in there panics people and scares them away from a stock.  That's why this week you saw even a lot of the, you know, even the big companies that had done well were getting hammered, you know, just with in terms of their stock price.  And a lot of it is just because, you know, there's just no margin for error in that anymore.

Transcript:  If you compare the S&P 500 index to the tech stock index, it's pretty clear that the tech stocks are what's powering the S&P 500.  That there are major that, you know, you take the tech stocks out of the stock market.  It's not nearly as powerful as strong.  It's not not not even necessarily positive.  So that's the other reason I fire Jack Dorsey or Mark Zuckerberg or Jeff Bezos or Sundar Pichai.  I wouldn't be too worried.  I mean, you can regulate these guys, but at the great risk of cutting your economy off at the knees, you've got to be very careful about what you do.

Transcript:  Yeah, but, you know, going after these companies is not necessarily going to hurt technology.  I mean, I think seen plenty of instances before where, you know, if you and I think there's been a lot of good analysis that if you start to split up some of these companies, especially Amazon, you know, break off AWS and and some of the other branches of Amazon that the combined, you know, the value of multiple companies would be vastly greater than what it is today as a single company.  It's a big risk to take.

Transcript:  It's a big risk to take.  I don't know if I'd have the guts to do that.  It's easy.  It's one thing to pose for a campaign commercial.  It's another thing to actually pass a bill or pass a law or I guess the DOJ doesn't really care.  They in theory, they're not political.  They're just going to pursue antitrust.  All right.  Oh, never mind.  Facebook.  How did Facebook do advertising up 22% year over year revenue up 22% income up 12% net income up 29% so not sure the differences income from operations was up 12% but the net income was up 29% Oh, that's partly because of a drop in their income tax.  There was some weird tax thing that went on with with Facebook daily active users on Facebook 1.8 2 billion people monthly active users 2.74 billion people.  How many people are on the Internet?

So it didn't even feature in those results.  Jeff Bezos says who says we're seeing it just it just rubs his hands.  He just rubs his hands and go excellent.  The company plans to hire 100,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.  We're seeing more cuts Bezos says we're seeing more customers than ever shopping early for their holiday gifts, which is just one of the signs is this is going to be an unprecedented holiday season.

And so their their net net profit was you know just slightly it was always just slightly more than zero, but just barely.  And and it was like well you know Amazon's never going to make never going to make a profit.  Well, I guess I guess they did finally.

Start time: 4125.40
End time: 4192.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To an extent, to an extent, but there you know there was a there was a very long period of time where they genuinely were building out their distribution infrastructure for the retail business and their cloud infrastructure for AWS.  So it wasn't like they were they were deliberately you know hiding the profits or or forgoing the profits.  Those were those were necessary investments.  And you can look at that now and say in in a large part of the world, the distribution infrastructure is there.  And it's you know maybe you know they can improve on it, but it's it's mature enough that they don't need to make massive investments.  It's incremental and strategic investments for for those things.  And the same is the same is true to a lesser extent with AWS.  I mean all of the cloud stuff that's happening you know it requires huge capital investment, but they've already made huge, huge, huge capital investments.

Start time: 4193.38
End time: 4264.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, where they're turning their attention now increasingly is on the transportation logistics side of the business.  You know over the last several years they've built up their their fleet of aircraft that they operate.  They've got you know more and more of their own delivery vans not relying on FedEx and UPS and the post offices much.  And you know actually investing directly in the technology itself.  You know they've put something like well over a billion dollars into an EV startup called Rivian and they've ordered 100,000 electric delivery vans from Rivian with the first ones expected by early 2022.  And you know to give you an example of where they're at at the end of 2019 they had 30,000 of their own delivery vans.  They're going to have another 100,000 electric ones over the next 10 years added to that fleet.  So you know they they certainly expect to grow and they're they're building out their own logistics infrastructure as you know.  And on top of that there's their investments in Zooks and Aurora for automated driving.  So they're they're doing a lot of interesting things.

Transcript:  So hey since I have you here Mr.  Ed Bott long time PC man PC world editor Windows magazine editor.  What do you think of Microsoft's and of course now it's ZD net writing about Windows  Microsoft's Windows 10 UI refresh code name Sun Valley Microsoft's getting very active.  They've got Windows 10 X coming out next year and a new UI.  Is this just rumor or.

Start time: 5006.46
End time: 5146.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well of course it's just rumor but it's there's you know there's there's enough fundamental  reality behind it to say that the rumor is basically confirmation of what we've always  known.  So a couple of things about that.  Number one most of what they're talking about is incremental improvements in things that  already exist.  They're they know they've made it very clear they're not getting rid of the investments  that they've already made here.  This is a to a large extent consolidating investments and they've been doing a bunch  of this stuff all along.  And in fact there's something in the current versions of Windows that's very mysterious  they've never explained.  But if you go to you know if you go on a Windows PC and you look at the at the about page you'll  find this thing.  I forget what it's called but it's the the well maybe I'll just look it up and but there's  a there's a Windows interface thing that appeared on the about page is called the Windows  feature experience pack.  Oh yeah.  And it appeared on the Windows about page about a year or so ago.  They've never explained it.  But that to me is sort of the the the the thing that I'm looking at when I see the whole Sun  Valley thing.  The thing about the the the thing about this that bothers me is that they're planning to  do it at the end of 2021.  H2 is the first thing that they're planning to do.  The thing about this that bothers me is that they're planning to do it at the end of 2021.  H2 2021.  And Microsoft made a very very very big deal a couple of years ago with their enterprise  customers changing the support lifecycle for Windows to say they were going to bifurcate  the two releases the H1 release in the first half of the year the H2 release in the second  half of the year.  The and the H1 release would have an 18 month support life and the H2 release would have  a 30 month support life.  And and and then what they've done in the two years since then is to set up a development  cycle where H1 had the big new feature releases and H2 was a very very very minor update.

Start time: 5147.75
End time: 5155.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what happened this year.  2004 was a big deal with lots of bugs and 20 H2 which just came out has been kind of  the stabilizer.

Start time: 5156.47
End time: 5238.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the stabilizer.  It is in fact exactly the same code as 2004.  When you when you install it all it does it shows the same installation date as 2004.  And so they've set it so they've set their enterprise customers up to expect wait till  H2.  H2 is basically the service pack.  Right.  And then you get to run that for.  That's the long term.  Two and a half years.  It's the long term.  It's the Linux long term support version.  When I first wrote about this I said Microsoft just introduced a Linux long term support version.  Well if they release in H2 of 2021 this major feature thing in the 30 month support version  they are basically giving a big giant you know one of these to to their all of their  enterprise customers and you know I'm not sure I'm not sure what they're thinking there.  You know the logical way to do this is to release it as a an early preview in the second  half of next year and then make it you know give it to the 22 H1 make it 22 H1.  But they're not doing that.  And so you know and if they do that they're basically blowing up about two to three years  of goodwill with their with their enterprise customers.  So but but I chime in here for a sec.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they also have this like remote virtualization like allowing your you to use windows on the  cloud for the enterprise business.  And so if there's an application yeah the virtual desktop.  So I think maybe that kind of let them off the hook with this big feature change or this  UI change and hopefully they want to keep the features the same but the way it looks  differently if there is something that is truly broken with this new experience.  Do you think that they would just push their enterprise customers to this virtual desktop  experience instead of worrying about basically putting all of the onus of legacy support  into the cloud.  And so they can try to move their customer base mostly consumer with Microsoft and to stay up  to date in those regular cycles to make it seem like a interesting operating system where it  feels like it's kind of old because of the last time the UI was refreshed.  And if we go back to the earnings announcement if you look at the earnings that were depreciated  it was around the windows and the enterprise business.  So it looks like they might be trying to move that into a service because they are seeing  decreased revenues on that front.  Well the trouble with it that's a good theory and an interesting theory.

Start time: 5321.28
End time: 5413.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The only problem with it is that the virtual desktop is based on the exact same code as the as the  physical desktop product that they're selling.  And so the advantage to enterprise customers is I want to install it whether it's on a physical  desktop or a virtual desktop I want to install it once and then not have to think about it for two  years.  And so if they've got so the issues with major desktop interface refreshes are not just support  but also training.  You know if you if you move people's cheese you know you're going to have to have to have to have  to if you move people's cheese you have to then you know do online seminars where you explain to  people where you move their cheese.  And you know that's always that's always expensive.  But yeah they're they're definitely trying to you know they're they want the big enterprises to do  everything virtual desktop doesn't matter what the client screen is at that point it can be on an  iPad you know a dumb dumb terminal you know or anything.  But it's just it's just a it's just a big massive disconnect in their support story for them to be  introducing a major UI refresh in an H2 release.  And the fact that they're not denying it or or or even trying to to tamp down some of these stories is  is slightly concerning I think.

Start time: 5415.90
End time: 5421.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Interesting.  So it sounds like you two both agree that the future of Windows is virtual desktop.

Start time: 5423.00
End time: 5429.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The virtual yeah.  That's the future of all computing is I mean is very Chromebooks could run Windows now.

Start time: 5429.84
End time: 5430.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So right. I mean right.  Yeah.

Start time: 5432.34
End time: 5477.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But Chromebooks are running Windows in emulation in the VM not in not on the cloud.  I mean I feel like that's we're actually because of the wild wildfires around here and the risk of  power outages and evacuations are editors who normally work on Adobe Premiere on big Dell precision  workstations running Windows.  We've set up virtual Windows workstations for them.  They don't spin them up.  It's nice.  But they're there.  So if they have to work from home if they can't get to the studio they can do it all on the cloud.  And that's actually a pretty darn good solution right now.  It's not cheaper than buying a machine.  I don't think it buying a machine or and doing it on prem but I feel not even close not even close to being cheaper.

Start time: 5477.88
End time: 5526.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's expensive.  But yeah but yeah that's the that is that is absolutely the the future.  Most things are going to be running as either web apps or hosted apps somewhere somewhere in the cloud.  And and the the ultimate endgame is you don't know the difference between these two.  And there's a great thing.  You know I think Bill Gates said it a long time ago or you know if he didn't he should have.  But you know that everyone underestimates the the extent of change and they overestimate the speed of change.  So everyone gets disappointed when you know the magical things don't happen as quickly as they think.  And then several years later the magic turns out to be even more magic than you thought.

Transcript:  Right. Here's my Windows XP desktop.  I'm really enjoying this with this.  By the way this is running on a Linux box.  Here's an IE.  Where's the where's the there's supposed to be a wind turbine on that.

Start time: 5544.86

Start time: 5546.82
End time: 5565.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm even getting the the warning that my antivirus is out of date.  But here's the funny thing.  This is actually in a browser.  This is JavaScript and React.  This is Windows running.  It's not an emulation.  It's a fake.  Probably probably running faster than the other ones.  It's pretty good.

Start time: 5565.98
End time: 5579.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you know I mean if you can if you can stream you know high end video games you know an X cloud or you know Stadia or you know Google GeForce now there's I mean Windows should be a breeze.

Start time: 5580.08
End time: 5595.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah I feel like this solves a lot of problems not not just the the there's even there he's even Winamp.  Look at that.  So there's there's the one of the biggest investments that Microsoft made in desktop virtualization is in fact supporting remote graphics graphics processors GPUs.

Start time: 5602.82
End time: 5635.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  And so and so and so the fact is that you could run on a very very low powered screen any kind of screen and all of the all of the GPU processing is running on a very very low powered screen.  The GPU processing is happening on the back end.  So you yeah so you basically have a you know that's something that's many times more powerful than a silicon graphics workstation from you know from a few years ago.  That's that's basically accessible from any screen.

Start time: 5637.40
End time: 5650.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It also solves a lot of problems with terms of support and security.  I can imagine businesses would jump on this if you can get the price to be comparable to an on prem system.  Is there any reason that isn't comparable right now.  It's just a matter of time.

Start time: 5651.96
End time: 5719.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's just a matter of time.  And also the the administration the administrative burden for these because of the way Microsoft licenses software the administrative burden for them is extreme.  You have to have you know the infrastructure to manage an entire distributed workforce of easily from a you know from a single pane of glass.  And you know and they're very in order to make this affordable and useful.  You need to get it down to the level where a business of 10 people you know of a law firm that wants to be able to do you know video depositions and lots and lots of document management stuff you need.  You need that 10 person law firm to be able to take advantage of that right now and the management burden of this stuff on Azure right now is scaled to large enterprise.  And so that's it's when that gets down to you know mid sized businesses that it really starts to take off.

Start time: 5720.18
End time: 5727.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Will they do the same thing that they do right now with exchange for instance where it's just a managed exchange by some third party or what Microsoft say we're going to manage all of it.

Start time: 5728.84
End time: 5767.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's pretty clear that Microsoft has said they don't want to be that pane of glass for anyone except the very large organizations and they want to hand it off to MSP's.  So yeah I could see companies like you know like Intermedia or or GoDaddy or you know some of the other some of the other partners that are really focusing quite you know with laser like intensity in fact on those smaller markets.  When once they have the tools to hand this stuff off then the pricing will follow from that.

Start time: 5768.54
End time: 5908.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It just makes sense. It's really the only way forward if you ask me for Windows.  Right. It just makes sense. By the way if you want to run this crazy JavaScript react version of Windows XP it's at winxp.now.sh the GitHub project.  It's a it's a it's a big deal. A lot of people involved in this very very cool. Shizuku Kochi or Shizuku Kochi did this and it's it's pretty impressive.  A lot of commits though from 263 contributors he didn't do it all by himself. It's it's cool. It is not Windows in the cloud. It's not even though it might look that way.  Yeah I'm really fascinated about by this is this is the transition. There's as I said earlier what's really interesting about technology is how it's transforming how we do everything and technology itself is transforming.  We've seen we were talking earlier about cord cutting. We've seen the transition from terrestrial broadcast to cable to Internet.  We've seen in music the transition from vinyl to cassettes to CDs to the Internet.  We've seen the transition in magazines from paper stacked next to your bed to the Internet.  And I think it's just a matter of time before cloud computing becomes the dominant way that we compute even though a lot of people's argument against that is didn't we already have we already been through that isn't that the old client server model where you have a big big iron downtown and you're running a dumb terminal.  But I think it's a lot better and a lot more sophisticated than that. And it does all of it to put depend on widespread high quality bandwidth right without without reliable bandwidth none of it makes any sense.  And that's why I think you see people like Elon promoting Starlink. Starlink is now in beta. Anybody got a beta. You're north. You're north enough Sam you could get a beta of Starlink.  Did you apply. I have not applied off to check it out. Yeah they had a page a few months ago where you could say oh hey when it comes out I'd like to try it. I can't remember if I'm hoping I filled that out.

Start time: 5909.72
End time: 5926.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I filled it out. It's ninety nine dollars a month to be a better beta test. Like I know we'll probably eventually go into Tesla self driving but Elon must definitely have it is.  But like he it's amazing how much he allows people to pay him to test out his service.

Transcript:  You know get to eighty two billion dollars in net worth without a little bit of a few eggs being broken. If you know what I mean. Yeah I just think it's interesting they've gotten I think nine hundred satellites out of the twelve thousand that they're eventually going to launch.  It's not just ninety nine bucks a month. Wesley you have to you have to spend five hundred dollars for the hardware. Oh the installer. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Because you've got to put a dish pizza box size dish on your right.  The roof early testers are reporting. Well a variety of speeds have been a number of kind of interesting beta tests in the Pacific Northwest.  A town that was destroyed by wildfire. First responders are able to use Starlink. I think there's a First Nation on the reservation they're using Starlink.  Starlink says expect to see data speeds raining ranging from 50 megabits to 150 megabits latency from 20 to 40 milliseconds.  But that's based on the current Starlink setup and it'll get they say faster and less latent as they also expect zero expect zero latency.

Transcript:  I am a booster. I know there's other companies. Isn't Blue Origin going to be doing this Amazon and I think others are going to be doing this.  But I love the idea of a global Internet of maybe gigabit speeds with latency down in the two digit you know low two digits on every square inch of the planet.  That's transformational and it does seem like they're I mean look they're offering it now.

Start time: 6046.94

Transcript:  And that's the end and that is ultimately the solution to the whole problem of the digital divide which is you know where where people who live in concentrated urban areas where fiber is economically viable to install.  Get all the benefits of digital technology and people who live in rural areas get you know maybe really crappy line of sight satellite technology at best or DSL which AT&T is dropping now.  You know and and and so this is you know this actually has the potential for you know for people who are like you know digital nomads to to go out into the middle of nowhere and continue to be productive.

The only way I knew about it is because on the Apple quarterly results call Luca Mestri their CFO mentioned.  Oh yeah it's rolling out tomorrow.  That was it.  But I jumped on it.  I don't know.  That's probably not a news story.  One dot Apple dot com.  I guess the bundle if you buy if you buy if you're already buying some of these services the bundles probably a better deal because you get a family plan and all that.  But this is so quintessentially.

Start time: 6638.84
End time: 6728.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Xilinx mainly does the interconnects for moving data from one place to the other.  So inside of racks and data centers and also for the 5G towers of doing the interconnects there.  They're really into advanced photonics.  So basically sending light to make sure that they're fiber based.  They are they they're fiber but they have cracked a code really in FPGAs and so they can do AI acceleration.  Basically they can make custom accelerators.  So whatever your task is whatever you want to optimize for is they can make FPGAs to do that.  And you can see from AMD's history that they're moving in that direction to do very specialized acceleration for specific workloads.  And that's why they can easily like make a really fast server computer that does very hard and large workloads and then use some of that same expertise to make the next gen gaming system.  To tackle some hard problems but they're specific depending on the customer.  And so I and they use the same chiplet technology.  They even use the same foundries.  And so the synergy is very, very high for them to be able to use some of each other's IP to make what they do even better.

Start time: 6747.19
End time: 6830.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  The other thing that Xilinx does, you know, they do a lot of SOCs that combine their FPGA technology with ARM cores.  So they have a whole line of these SOCs and a lot of them are actually used in automotive applications as well, which is an area that AMD's never been involved in.  And Nvidia is, you know, gaining a big foothold in there, you know, especially as you get into automated driving and a lot of the infotainment stuff.  You know, they're starting to gain a real foothold there.  And I know I've heard from various people at AMD wanted to break into automotive over the last couple of years.  They haven't done anything yet, but this could give them an entry into the automotive sector with Xilinx.  Recently, Continental, a major automotive supplier, announced a new imaging radar sensor that is powered by one of these Xilinx SOCs.  So, you know, again, this is something that would give AMD another advantage over Intel, you know, both having some ARM capability with Xilinx and the FPGA capability.  And I think it sounds like from what Wesley was saying, you know, these network interconnect stuff sounds like, you know, might be similar to in some ways to what Nvidia got with its acquisition of Mellanox.

Transcript:  Well, you nail it. Here's the slide from AMD and it shows significant revenue synergy opportunities in those three categories.  Data centers where FPGAs are widely used and ARM is coming on strong.  In communications infrastructure, as Wesley was talking about, the interconnects.  And then, as you were saying, Sam, in embedded leverage broad customer base and distribution platform extend AMD CPUs into key embedded segments.  They haven't. Has AMD had much of a presence in automotive up to now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They did. They had a little bit of automotive in the infotainment space with their ATI acquisition.  They had a small, there was more of the graphics in terms of small embedded space there.  But they sold it off. They sold it off really quickly.  Yeah. So they didn't they didn't maintain that space.  And I think that's also a really good example of past acquisitions.  I mean, ATI has come along since then.  But I was there during that acquisition.  The way that the companies integrated caused a lot of friction.  And I know that they said that Xilinx is going to operate differently.  That could be positive and negative as their own separate entity.  When ATI first came on board, it was almost like a firewall between the two companies.  One of the projects I worked on needed like advanced access to their GPUs in order to do some testing.  And we could not get them because ATI would send it to all their OEM partners first.  And so what we had to do is talk to our OEM partners.  And when they got the card, they would just send it to us so we can get it.  And all depends on how they integrate with Xilinx in terms of company culture,  which is going to probably be the determining factor if they're going to be successful or not.

And it's a different company now and a very different.  In fact, they haven't really done many acquisitions.  They haven't even had the money.  I mean, thirty five billion dollars in a way.  That's that's a statement as much about AMD's recent success as anything else that they actually.  Yeah, they're strong right now.

Start time: 6973.12
End time: 7041.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're on the up and up and up and to the right.  And with this acquisition, that's what I'm saying, that they are opening up a whole they can hit the gas tank,  the gas pedal, basically on what they're trying to do and the corner that they're trying to carve out.  It's extremely future focused.  This acquisition, I know what Intel got Altera.  I wrote notes.  Yeah, that's kind of in the same kind of space.  But Intel collects companies and then they kind of just try to keep up.  And there's not a really good integration with the previous CEOs with AMD.  I think that was a real, really, really bad weak spot in terms of not only getting other companies to work together,  but even departments.  I tell this joke.  One CES I went to show up for our booth and there were four AMD booths because we all they all registered differently because no one was talking to each other.  I think Dr.  Sue has really cleaned that up and she has gotten everyone on the same page.  So that's why I'm really excited.  It is. It's really exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they're lying in there.  They're there.  They're wallowing in it right now.  It's very sad to see.  But it's also possible to look back on all of the opportunities that were just absolutely squandered, you know, especially in the mobile space.  I just finally sold a phone.  I think the only iPhone that ever had an Intel chip in it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but they were but they were, you know, just that they they that was the the the runway was there for them.  And they just sort of sat there and did nothing with it.  And I know also from Microsoft engineers that I talked to for over the years, all of the the the failures that they had with, you know, power management and and and the ability to have mobile devices that could run on their CPUs.  And they had essentially a monopoly and took no advantage of it.  So it's hard.  It's you know, it's easy to feel sympathy, but it's hard to feel too sorry for for Intel because it's just a you know, it's a series of don't forget all the exploits in their microcode and security problems over and over and over again.

Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  The one the one Intel acquisition that I think right now is still pretty strong is Mobileye, which they bought a few years ago.  You know, they they've been the leader in the advanced driver assistance space.  You know, most of the forward collision warning lane keeping systems that you find on modern vehicles are still powered by Mobileye.  And, you know, they're they're making some really good progress on the automated driving front doing robotaxes.  And, you know, they're working with a bunch of companies, especially in China.  They've got they've got a pretty pretty strong base in China on the automated driving front.  So, you know, I think Intel has actually been counting on Mobileye to generate a lot more revenue for them going forward.

Transcript:  So it's I mean, it's I mean, people might have written off AMD not so long ago.  It's it's a fluid business, but it does feel like Intel's I mean, they how important is getting to seven nanometers.  Apple's going to be shipping five nanometer parts in their iPhone.  How important is an Intel still can't get to seven.  They're still stuck at 10.  Is that important at all or is that just a number that's easy for me to understand?

Transcript:  No, no, no, no, please.

Start time: 7248.80
End time: 7327.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just that if you went from 10 nanometers to eight, that's 20 percent savings and power and efficient and gain in efficiency just by making it smaller.  And then when you optimize on top of that, then you get all these other gains.  And so in order to keep up, you have to keep shrinking to make sure that your optimizations can be sloppier when you have a smaller nanometer.  And then you can then do a refine refine on top of that to get to help push you.  But with everyone else being able to get smaller, faster, they're definitely getting a leg up and a head start just by doing that one change.  Because they have these foundries that they own that they have to retool, that they have to figure out.  They don't also have the flexibility to go into TSMC or go into some other fab to say, OK, you haven't figured it out.  So I'm going to go to your competition. They don't have any of that leverage.  They have all of the liability, all of the trial and error and R&D.  And also you can see none of the results.  It's really sad that they are.  They said that their fab was their edge for so long, but now it's definitely a liability.

Start time: 7327.90
End time: 7370.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I think that's what in fact I was quoting this from three years ago.  And Stratecari Ben Thompson wrote that Intel made so much money by integrating its fabs and its design and building these massive, you know, $10 billion chip factories.  And we're doing so well with it.  They were unable to leave it behind.  And that's always the innovators dilemma, right?  They were so successful doing it. They were that they that they cut.  They kind of missed the future.  They fumbled the future by being so tied into integration.  And that's and he said this three years ago.  And I think the fruit of that is becoming very clear at this point.

Start time: 7370.82
End time: 7384.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

It's too late.  So, if you've got a ballot, you got one mailed to you and you filled it out,  find a drop box, go to your county clerk.  If you go online, Iwillvote.com, you can figure out where you can drop that ballot off.  It's so important. You must do that by election day,  because already many votes in your state, Wesley, are potentially invalidated  because they changed the rules in the middle of the game.  So, it's really important you get to that drop box and you put that vote in.  It's a little scary. We were talking about this before the show at San Francisco.  Much of it is boarded up.

Transcript:  It will be a week of existential dread, and if I don't get a haircut soon,  it'll be a week of existential dreadlocks, but that's another story for another...  Actually, I don't think I could do dreads.  I think my hair is not going to go in that direction.  No.  No. But I'm not getting another haircut for a while, I think.  Thank you, everybody, for being here.  Wesley Faulkner, always great to see you, even without your bearded dragon.  Developer advocate at Daily Co. at Wesley83.  Anything you want to mention, Plug?

Transcript:  Well, first of all, I've got to say that as a person who ran for office,  I'm very invested in the whole process of democracy.  So I do want to plug my company, but I'm going to do it in the way of some of our customers,  the people who use our technology, and I think they're really great examples  of how you can use this in a really, really creative way.  One is GitDuck. That's Git with an I.  With a lot of people being remote, being able to pair program  and see the person you're working with is amazing.  So GitDuck is a really, really good example of people using the technology to work remotely,  still stay connected, and actually do some work.  And I just want to highlight them as one of the, a lot of the innovation that's happening.

Start time: 7940.84

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It works with multiple IDs.  Oh, neat. Okay.  Also, there is Pitch, which is a really, really great company for developing your own decks  and working collaboratively so that you can figure out who's going to do what and assign tasks to them.  And so if someone's doing the intro slide, someone's doing the graphs,  you can actually assign them and then they turn it into the giant deck.  And then you all can work and talk using revisions, which is really, really great.  It's an amazing tool. I think everyone hates slides,  so I think Pitch is a unique place to disrupt the thing that we all hate and make it something that we not only love,  but we can love together as a group and collaborate.  And our company also released some new features.  We have this thing called the pre-built UI.  So like, let's say you don't want to do all that, but you just want to do like, let's say a Zoom competitor  or your own kind of quick chat function, like if you are running a conference  and you want people to be able to see each other, a lot of solutions, you have to build all that out,  like connect buttons to different calls and just draw it all out.  But ours comes with a free, available to use default UI that you can just click yes  and then go on and just have that deployed on your website or in your application, which is really, really amazing.  Deck.co.daily.co. Yeah, very cool.  And we have a free tier, so like you can use it.  And I think you get like 2000 hours of video time.  And so it's not like you can just test it.  You can actually, if you're a person, you can use this for your own video call.  And it's secure because it's WebRTC, so it goes over HTVS.  And so it's encrypted in both the video and the chat.  So it's a pretty amazing technology.

Transcript:  You know, I was supposed to be on a boat this week.  I was supposed to be on a ship literally at sea with no internet access, with no connection whatsoever.  And that didn't work out.  So I'm just going to try and do some self-care this week.  We did manage to send Windows 10 Inside Out 4th edition off to the printer last week.  All done. Read every single word of every single page.  Found the last few little things in it and sent those off.  So that'll be coming out well before the end of the year.  So that was nice to have done.  And other than that, I'm just going to see if I can put my head down and concentrate on technology for a while.  Oh, hey, it's there. It's pre-orderable.

And this one we really, you know, we really, we really just really slaved over.

Transcript:  No, the Kindle version is great.  You know, has the full color screens.  The thing I love about the Kindle version is that, you know, even though we have great indexers working to produce a great index for us.  Search is so nice.  Yeah, just being able to search for the word that you're looking for in it is, you know, there's nothing better than that.  So, yeah, yeah, I recommend that.

And really, it's for taking notes, but you can also read books on it.  I'm really intrigued by the whole idea.  Not that my handwriting is any good, but as soon as I get it, I'll do a review.  Thank you, Ed.  It's great to see you again.  Hunker down.  I was going to be our plan.  Lisa and I are playing last year.  We said on Election Day, we're going to go to Rome.  We're going to hang out with Father Robert at the Vatican.  This is before COVID, obviously, and we'll be ready to pray.  And if things go south, we'll just stay.  But that didn't work either.

Transcript:  I drove a Miata in 1990 with Gina Smith.  We were in L.A. pretending to work for MGM because that's what Ziv Davis wanted us to do.  And we rented it to drive down the 405.  It was the scariest drive I've ever had.  I've told you this before because you're lower than the height of the trucks going by you.  And I just had these terrors of getting stuck under a truck and ending up in San Bernardino.  Back roads.
