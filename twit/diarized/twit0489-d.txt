Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm still looking for a full-time gig, but I did manage to squeeze something out  of my hard working days here. This thing called the Crowded Rocket. I don't know if you heard  about it.  What's that?  It's a new crowdfunding platform that I helped launch. It's kind of crazy. It's a very soft  launch. It's kind of like, you know that scene in Star Wars where they're trying to restart  the hyperdrive and the Millennium Falcon? It's exactly the sound that Crowded Rocket  is making right now.  But the idea is to make a boutique site that only handpicks and vets and curates a few  campaigns and holds their hands all the way along and then puts them together with VCs  at the end if they're successful.  So we'll see how it does. But you know, I'm obviously not putting all my eggs in one basket  here. It's a bit of a side project, as it were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Last time you were here, you talked about Flux, a 3D printer, which has since... Let  me go to Kickstarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's graduated quite well.

Start time: 224.32
End time: 261.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh yeah. $1.6 million. They were asking for $100,000. I'm not surprised. It's a pretty  cool all-in-one 3D printer, laser engraver, 3D modeler and auto pen, actually, because  you reach the stretch goals of $900,000. There's a pen holder module. There's a gyroscope.  There's Wi-Fi. Wow.  So we were talking before the show and you pointed out this is hard because especially  when you're a big success like this, and I can think of a few examples on Kickstarter,  the pressure's on now.

Start time: 262.20
End time: 290.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, for sure. I mean, you know, when you talk to the folks at Pebble, right? When they  reach that insane amount, $10.3 million, they're like, oh crap, what do we do now? We have  to find a way to make this happen for not a thousand watches, but like 90-something thousand  watches. And they sure did. But a lot of people don't understand that. I just got my InstaCube.  Are you familiar with the InstaCube story on Kickstarter?  No. Tell me about that. We should mention, by the way, Miriam used to work for Pebble,

Start time: 291.46
End time: 293.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  but she also has some direct experience of that.

Start time: 293.08
End time: 314.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I worked at Pebble and most importantly, I worked at Engadget for many years before  that. So that's probably how you guys know me all. But InstaCube was this picture frame  that shows your Instagram feed and you can like stuff by tapping a button on top. And  it's wireless so you don't put it on a shelf or hang it on a wall. It lasts a really long  time because it's got a big battery in there.

Transcript:  This was two years ago on...

Start time: 317.30
End time: 357.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was epic. I pledged my $99 for it and I finally just received it in the mail two days  ago. And the thing about it is that it looked forever like they were going to completely  fall flat on their faces. I had given up about a year and a half ago on these guys because  they were so bad. It was such a disaster in terms of their communication with their backers.  But it just goes to show it's really challenging. And they did manage to pull through. So you  just really never know.  The thing I think you have to do with crowdfunding is if you think of it as you're making a donation  to kind of help a bunch of people get started.  Kickstarter even says this.  Whether you get something out of it or not is a completely different ballgame.

Start time: 358.34

Transcript:  What's the dumbest thing, Mark Millian, you've ever crowdfunded? Have you fallen for this  trap?

Start time: 366.85
End time: 409.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah. I got so frustrated with the experience. I did a number of features about how terrible  this is. It's kind of a scam because these people with no experience in the field go  out and raise a ton of money and then have no idea how to deliver. So the dumbest one  was I spent $50 on this device that has a timer and is also a tea infuser. So I was  like, that's a cool thing. I would buy it at Walmart. And that was three years ago and  I never made it. And finally just a couple months ago he agreed to refund everybody on  Square Cash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow. That's got to hurt.  I got my Pono player. I just got that. Still waiting for the Tem-perfect mug. A mug that  holds coffee and tea at the perfect temperature.

Transcript:  These rings are blown up. I noticed there was also a ring on that Crowd Rocket website  that I was talking about. The Ringly one.

Start time: 429.28
End time: 431.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The gesture ring? Come on. That is weird.

Start time: 432.26
End time: 443.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a little silly. But the wearable sensors that will light up when you get a  text message or an email or something, those are gaining traction. Ringly is the big one.

Start time: 443.74
End time: 444.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ringly is the big one?

Start time: 444.74
End time: 488.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  So the one on Crowd Rocket is like a mood ring. It just senses your emotions and gives  you feedback so you can track how you're doing and change your behavior hopefully to be happier.  It's kind of an interesting idea. But you know, you bring up a good point. You both  do bring up a good point about crowdfunding. And that's kind of what my friends and I started  Crowd Rocket to do, right? You know, Robert Scoble is on board. You'll be Benjamin, Julia  and Blaine, a bunch of really hard hitters. Because we believe that vetting and curating  is the way to go. Because you know, like you can't, and especially if you eventually need  help from VCs to carry on, right? Like it's like you can't just like have potato salad.  It's a lot of fun. But you know, I think people expect a little more from crowdfunding as  it's growing up.

Start time: 488.46
End time: 497.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you see which potato salad was a crowdfunded project?  Potato salad?  He's like, I'll make some really good potato salad.  And did he?  And he raised thousands of dollars.

Start time: 498.50
End time: 511.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Amazing. This one I bid on, but I didn't get it. The Space Folk album, he was going to record an album on  The Moon. He needed $21 million. So my thousand dollar pledge didn't really help much. In fact,  they didn't end up funding.

Start time: 511.36
End time: 512.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a great idea.

Start time: 512.28
End time: 516.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's a great idea. What's the dumbest thing you ever crowdfunded, Nate? Or are you  immune to this?

Start time: 516.34
End time: 542.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what? I actually don't buy into this kind of BS too often. Most of what I've funded  are like comic books on Kickstarter.  Yeah, you can't go wrong there.  I'm a big comic book fan. There's artists that I actually know and support. I did support  Uya.  And you got one?  No, I actually didn't get my Uya in, but it was kind of a mess.  It turned out it wasn't very good, so who cares?  Well, yeah, I guess I really did miss out on that. But for the most part, I mean-

Start time: 543.02
End time: 545.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You never got it? You funded an Uya and you never got one?

Start time: 545.50
End time: 573.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So when I went through the process, maybe I did it wrong or maybe Kickstarter got it  wrong or Amazon got it wrong or something.  They want you to think it's your fault.  I was the wrong tier, so I gave them enough to get the hardware. But because I didn't  do the right tier to check the right box or something like that, I actually talked with  Julie. She emailed me directly and was like, no, you're not going to get a console. It  was kind of a bummer.  But thanks for the money.  Yeah, appreciate that.  They got my money anyways. And I did get my username, which I've never used because I've  never actually played on Uya.

Transcript:  All right, this is from the summer for anyone who missed it. Kickstarter potato salad by  Zach Danger Brown in Clums, Ohio.  How come Kickstarter let that happen?  About this project, basically I'm just making potato salad. I haven't decided what kind  yet.  6900 people contributed a total of $55,000 to potato salad.

Start time: 596.86

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And a thank you note.  I love it.  But you know what? This is an example, Miriam, isn't it? Because now this guy's got to make  a lot of potato salad.

Start time: 627.48

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what I'm saying. That's what I'm saying.  It backfired on him.

Start time: 630.34
End time: 654.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's also a little bit of commentary, like a little social commentary on where we're  at right now. I mean, it's absurd and it's stupid, as many of these projects are, and  yet it got funny. It reminds me of the Cards Against Humanity guys on Black Friday. They  pulled all their products and sold a piece of poop in a box for like six bucks. They  sold out of the poop in a box. And it was like more than 30, I don't know, $30,000 or  something made.  I'm finally too old.

Start time: 655.44
End time: 666.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they actually mailed people pieces of poop in a box.  I knew there would come a time where I would just, as all people do generationally, get  to a time where you just don't understand the world anymore.  Yeah.  And you move into a home and it's over.

Transcript:  But no, but seriously, did you watch the unboxing video of the Cards Against Humanity?  That was amazing. I'll put it in the...  They cracked it open to see if there was something inside with their bare hands.

Start time: 682.06
End time: 684.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that was just dirty. That was just nasty. I can't believe that.

Start time: 684.90
End time: 690.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I'm not going to show that then. I don't want to show that video.  The guy actually...  Oh, it's dry poop.  He cracks it with his bare hands.  Oh, good!

Start time: 691.68
End time: 692.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Bad news, man. Bad news.

Start time: 740.44
End time: 750.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who would pay eight dollars for a piece of poop in a box?  At least they're being upfront about what you're buying, right?  I mean, unlike so many of these Kickstart products that never deliver on their products.

Transcript:  Okay, so I was a little worried, because here we are.  This time of year, usually there's no news at all.  And we're talking about poop?  I shouldn't have been worried.  Actually, the big Sony story continues to evolve, and we're talking about that.  And I want to get... Look, we got experts here.  Speaking of poop, I am calling bull poop on this notion that this is a North Korean hack.  But maybe Mark Millian knows better.  All right, we're gonna find out in just a bit.  Let's take a break, and then we'll come back and talk about that.  But first, a word from our sponsors.  Nothing we sell is actually that bad, so I feel good about that.  That's a low bar.  Our show today brought to you by the good folks at audible.com.  The best place to get audiobooks.  I know, because I've been an Audible subscriber now since 2000...  2000? Maybe 2001.  I used to have a horrific commute, as many of you know.  At least two hours a day.  And it was just a nightmare until I realized, hey, I can actually get some reading done with audiobooks from audible.com.  Audible is fantastic.  I want you to visit audible.com and browse around.  I could just show you.  The Audible app, by the way, on Android and iOS, Windows Phone and Windows is just great.  I'm using it on Android here.  And I can even...  Just in case some of you say, oh, Leo, you don't really listen to Audible.  This is my library on my device.  I've got TuneIn, The History of the Beatles.  This is gonna be amazing, three volume, like the best.  Dracula, which is amazing, dramatized.  Alan Cumming is in this.  Tim Curry.  This is the new Peter F. Hamilton.  I love him.  The Abyss Beyond Dreams.  Love his stuff.  David Byrne of the Talking Heads wrote a book that is perhaps one of the most interesting, insightful books I've ever read about music, how music works.  He talks not only about the Talking Heads, but it's less of a memoir and more about why music is the way it is, why pop music is the way it is.  Fascinating.  Thinking fast and slow.  That's about economics.  Gone Girl.  I still haven't seen the movie, so I'm gonna read the novel and find out how it ends.  This is a history of Manhattan, Dutch Manhattan, the island at the center of the world.  So you can see I alternate fiction and nonfiction.  I really like to do a little bit of both.  This is just a sampling of...  And these are all books I'm in the middle of right now.  This is a bad habit.  Audible.com.  How about this?  Scrum.  The art of doing twice the work in half the time.  Yeah, you've never done a scrum, if you think about it.  Let's see.  Neil Young's new book.  Waging Heavy Peace.  That's on my list to read.  I love reading the Rock and Roll biographies.  A lot of those now, lately.  I want you to go to audible.com slash twit2.  You'll be signing up for the platinum plan.  That's two books a month.  As you can see for me, that's barely enough.  Probably be enough for most people.  Your first month is free.  Your first two books are free.  And you get to keep them even if you cancel in the first 30 days and pay nothing.  You'll also get the daily digest of the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal.  Audible.com slash twit2.  The best audiobooks read by the best readers ever.  And now's the chance for you to try it.  Amy Poehler reading her new memoir.  Yes, please.  Audible.com slash twit2.  I just, one of the things that I have a kind of a,

I heard a little agreement, Miriam, when I said,  so the President of the United States of America,  the Federal Bureau of Invitation,  the Federal Bureau of Investigation  and unnamed federal authorities  have told CNN, the journal, I think,  many reliable news sources, the New York Times,  that Bloomberg, probably Bloomberg Businessweek,  that they think it was North Korea.  Meanwhile, everybody who knows anything about security  is going, it can't be North Korea.  Miriam, you agree with me?  It seems improbable.  Or are we just out of touch?

Transcript:  See, that's my question.  Why would the FBI, why would Obama,  why would they lie?  Why would they say it's North Korea?  The FBI says, we have evidence we're not telling you  that confirms this.  The New York Times reported that  North Korea is centrally involved in the hack  citing unnamed U.S. officials.  But as we all know, with these kinds of hacks,  it's very difficult to know who did this stuff.  The FBI is saying, well,  we recognize the code from previous North Korea attacks.  The code calls home to IP addresses  that we've seen before from North Korea.

Transcript:  All traffic, internet traffic  to North Korea goes through China.  Actually, you're not far wrong, Miriam,  because I was watching an interview  with a fascinating interview.  I was on the Daily Show.  I've got to see the documentary.  A young woman who went to North Korea  to teach English and lived there for a while.  And she was there in a period of time in which  she was teaching kids  or she knew kids from  their technical school in North Korea  and they didn't have internet at the time.  This was just a couple of years ago.  They literally were being taught  computer science without the internet.  It didn't exist.  I find this hard to believe,  especially since this attack also  looks like a typical attack  from an amateurish hacker, right?

Start time: 1274.21
End time: 1310.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've drawn parallels  between this hack and previous ones.  They used some of the same code,  some of the same methods.  There was a hack,  I think it was last year,  on some South Korean banks  which the FBI cited in their statement.  This hack was well known.  I'm not sure that we knew  that it was North Korea behind it,  but the FBI in their statement said  last year's hack of the South Korean banks  was by North Korea and this looks very similar.  North Korea does have internet.  In fact, they have an elite core of hackers, supposedly.

Start time: 1311.02

Transcript:  They do. They have a government division

Start time: 1313.10
End time: 1380.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that specializes in hacking.  And North Korea also has a number of  expats who are  who don't reside in North Korea  but they still  carry out missions  and hackings and all that  on the government's behalf.  But from outside of North Korea?  Yeah, there's this famous activist  in South Korea  who escaped North Korea  and his thing is  to try to deliver  pamphlets by balloon  into North Korea  to try to educate the people there.  So the idea is to send the balloons  and then they pop over North Korea  and the pamphlets fall down and people read  about information they would have never been able to get.  North Korea had sent  someone to South Korea  to try to assassinate him.  And so that was just one example of how  North Korea is not just  confined to North Korea. We reported  that the Sony breach  some of it was executed from a hotel in Thailand.  So it's entirely possible  that they had an operative in Thailand  who was carrying some of this out.

Transcript:  A good hacker is going to obfuscate  it shouldn't be like  oh yeah, that's coming from a hotel in Thailand  I don't know  I'm just some guy  I'm just a schlub  of course the FBI wouldn't lie to us  and the president wouldn't lie

Transcript:  If you  rely solely on where  the IP was coming from  then yeah, that's not a good way to investigate  but they looked at a number  this hack used 6 components  from previously known hacks  and  the South Korean bank example was one  where the FBI said we knew this one was  North Korea and a lot of the code  looks the same  so that's not damning evidence  the FBI claims they have more

Transcript:  it has to go through China  I think there's been a lot of criticisms  over these methods saying that they're very simplistic  that they're not very sophisticated  and that could kind of prove that North Korea isn't behind it  but at the same time  the fact that we have all these questions  the fact that there's so much debate over it  I think kind of says hey, these people did know what they were doing  even if their methods were simplistic  they were effective  and now there's a big question over who was taking part or not  which I mean  if you leave people with questions over  who committed the crime then

Transcript:  exactly  how do you  really get back to them  if you plan to do that  my biggest concern with the whole fiasco  because the word fiasco  represents the best  the fact that the movie theaters  kind of strong armed  Sony into letting them  not show the movie  if Sony was smart right now  they would put this  all over the internet for free  everywhere  you can't stop that  and then it's there  sure they lose on it  but they lose on it now  or even smarter  they hang on to it in 10-15 years  they release it as a limited edition  and make a ton of money

End time: 1706.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  don't you think  so one of the reasons they didn't want to release it  right away  one of our reporters in Hollywood  is  every major movie has insurance  coverage and if the movie  never comes out then they have a claim  to collect their  insurance money if they were to  release it on streaming then  it becomes a little fuzzier and they may not be able  to make some of their money back

Transcript:  this just came in this morning from the New York Post  you know not the greatest source in the  world Sony plans to release the  interview on crackle which is its internet  and they're going to release it on the movie channel for free  first of all  I understand why exhibitors might be  reluctant to show this after the  okay there's a whole bunch of stuff to say  first of all the hackers didn't mention the interview until the media  speculated wildly  oh this must maybe this is North Korea  punishing Sony or trying to stop the  interview and then all of a sudden the  hacker said oh yeah that's what this is about  the interview  oh yeah that's it  and then the exhibit  we're going to  this feels like they're making this up as they go along  we're going to  a 9-eleven style  attack on movie theaters if they show this movie  yeah that's it  and then the movie exhibitors  I think reasonably because it's not  look you got the hobbit you know who needs to show this  they reasonably  said that's fine we'll take that theater we'll put another  hobbit showing in there we'll make more money anyway  they decided not to show  it and then Sony says  is the hobbit a Sony movie?  I'm not talking about Sony the exhibitor  exhibitor doesn't care we don't have to run this stupid  movie we didn't want to anyway  we got Annie  that's a sign  so  so I think the exhibitor  is just you know caved and then Sony  what are they going to do if nobody's going to distribute it so I think  but on the other hand the president said wait a minute  that's appeasement that's caving  to terrorists  I don't know what were they going to do  they're going to put national guard in the movie theaters  and then you'll  oh I'll go see that movie  oh there's armed oh it's safe  there though because there's armed guys guarding  the door  anyway uh according to  the post they're going to put it on

Start time: 1846.82
End time: 1880.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean I think there's some genuine fears  on Sony's part that this  isn't totally over yet I mean  supposedly the hackers if they are the  hackers actually said that there's more  information to release  that they haven't given away all their cards yet  and you know if they can take down  Sony's entire system  like this maybe they could go after people  personally so I think there's some fears there  on Sony's part that this isn't over yet  so I don't know I would be  dubious of reports saying that they're going to release  it on crackle or Playstation video or  or you know just put it up on a  torrent site or something like that

Transcript:  I'm kind of with the people who say  it's not completely kosher to look  at the stuff that was stolen  where do you guys  what's a journalist  as journalists?  some of it of course I think there's  a public need to know when you  find out that the Sony folks  try to get the Mississippi  Attorney General to shut down  Google  that's of genuine public  interest I don't think there's any public interest in  knowing what Amy Lucas said about  Angelina Jolie in an email

Start time: 1976.82
End time: 1998.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would actually totally  disagree I think there's a ton of public  interest in the way that  Sony does business in the way that they make decisions  on what films get financed and what  stars get put in what films  even things you know some of the stuff  that was leaked in these emails was  male and female executives doing  exact same jobs had a  pay disparity of a million or two million dollars

I mean we talk about how much a film  was financed for we talk about its box office  nationally and overseas  how much the main you know the stars  of the film get paid factors into these  decisions and if you're a business publication  the people who read your publication  are going to want to know like Sony investors  like Sony investors okay alright

Transcript:  I guess you're right I think I think the way to look at  Leo is like you know when  all this stuff was leaked by WikiLeaks  right? Of course you know we're not supposed  to be looking at this stuff but  you know as journalists  it's important that we  I mean we're there to find a story and we  have you know we are  allowed to investigate and  uncover things that aren't  right about both our governments and companies  out there and  make opinions on  culture and society and their behavior  and I think that  you know so I can see  we draw the line for instance we wouldn't

No I

I don't think it's right. So if somebody

Transcript:  what it is and what the value  I mean like the decisions that the Journal makes  in terms of what we cover  And we should say I know Nate is not speaking for the Wall Street Journal  I don't want to get you in trouble.  But any newsroom you know  that's a decision that newsroom has to make  right. So I think part of the issue  too is you know something that's stolen  from the 49ers back office and given over to  the news organization is different  than something that hackers took  and then published publicly on the internet anyways  and put out in data dumps and it's  they've already published it. It's already out there

And this is before, of course, the president of the FBI said,  no, no, it is Korea.  Hours before, I think. Yeah, right before.  And yet the arguments in this are not  completely false.

Transcript:  Exactly. So I mean to come out and  make definitive claims at this point  is maybe a tad premature.  But taking a look at the information we have,  there's lots of reason to think it could have been  some amateurist folks.  Maybe it's not North Korea, but we just don't know.  Well, if it's not, then the FBI

Start time: 2359.78

But it was still days before they were  willing to actually put a public statement together  and Obama got behind it and was briefed.  So I mean, I don't  think they just  jumped to conclusions on this one.

And, you know,  like this is Sony, yeah, but what if next  month is Universal, right?  Or, well, I guess that's part of Sony.

BBC does not like Apple  too much. Apple does not like BBC  too much. The BBC  published a video  accusing Apple of failing to  protect its Chinese factory workers. Tim Cook  says, I am deeply offended.  Wow.  That's taking a little bit  personal. BBC Panorama  actually secretly filmed  inside factories  and  they  went to Indonesia where these,  as Apple called it, artisanal  tin mines are operating.  Sometimes with children.  Apple's  response, Apple has publicly stated  that tin from Indonesia ends up in our  products and some of that tin,  well, yes, likely comes from illegal  mines. Tens of thousands  of artisanal miners are selling  tin through many middlemen  to the smelters who supply to component  suppliers who sell to the world. It's a problem  that supply chain goes on and on and on, down  down down. The government is not addressing  the issue in Indonesia and there's  widespread corruption in the undeveloped  supply chain. Our team  visited the same parts of Indonesia, visited by  the BBC and of course we're appalled by what's going on  there too. But Apple has two choices.  We could make sure all of our suppliers by  tin from smelters outside  of Indonesia.  This would be the easiest thing for us  to do.  But  and would certainly shield us  from criticism, but it would be the lazy  and cowardly path because  it would do nothing to improve the situation for  Indonesian workers and the environment.  Since Apple consumes a tiny  fraction of the tin mined there,  we chose the second path to stay engaged  and try to drive a collective solution.  I guess that makes sense.  That's the old, we'll fix it from within.

Transcript:  one of the things that Apple's lawyer  told the BBC was that they've  been working with their suppliers to  improve conditions for workers and that they  found about an average of 93%  compliance with  some of their guidelines like a 60 hour work week and  things like this. I mean that still leaves  a 7% you know that  isn't complying, right?

Start time: 2867.54
End time: 2892.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what is the right approach? Is it to  bail all these folks who you know are treating  their workers incorrectly and maybe  I don't know, spend more money manufacturing  in different countries, getting stuff from different  companies. I don't even know if there are any of these suppliers  that are actually following all the rules.  I mean this is kind of an ongoing story  that's been happening for  years and years and years. This isn't anything new  per se. So what  is the right approach? Inside or  outside? I don't know.

Start time: 2895.18
End time: 2911.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean  the thing is a lot of these companies  like you were talking about the supply chain goes deeper and deeper  and deeper. They don't have direct relationships.  They don't. They're not buying it from these  mines. They might have Foxconn. Foxconn you  buy the tin. Foxconn buys the tin from  a smelter. The smelter buys it from  you know some gang in the Congo.

Start time: 2912.00
End time: 2921.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So then how much influence would  Apple have over tin smelters if they  actually do buy a small percentage  as they say they do and then they show up  and there's all these middlemen in between.

Transcript:  But I mean this is kind of how  things work  all over the world. I mean the  LA Times just had a great series of stories  on Mexican  produce  farms that were treating their employees  and properly making them, having  children work, work way over hours and  those fruits were going to like Whole Foods  and Walmart. This is not  just tech. This is not just Apple. This is  like a global issue with  the way that we do business  as a whole. I really

Start time: 2973.54
End time: 3025.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  reason I think he feels that way is because of  what Nate just said. I mean this is  you know, he's worked really  hard to try to improve it already  and  it's always Apple that's targeted but  what about Samsung and HTC  and Xiaomi and what about  Whole Foods? What about  the textiles we wear?  There is this stuff going on everywhere and it's  always, and I think that's kind of what  he's probably feeling. It's like  throwing his arms up in the air going  not again.  This is not just about us.  This is about the entire consumer  industry. We want  the stuff so cheap that at this point  it's really hard to get it manufactured  in an ethical way, right?  I think the whole system needs to be revaluated.  We all  have to think about this every time we  buy something. That's where fair  trade and all that stuff is really important.

Start time: 3025.90

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And this is the other side of the coin of Apple's  success. I mean  you become this brand  and a brand that is  has a reputation of quality, a brand  that cares, then  you're going to be, I mean of course BBC could  have attacked Samsung and everybody else because  they're all getting the tin from the same place.  But Apple  because of its success is going to be  taking the brunt of this. I think that's part of the  gig but I  think they should fight back and they're right to say  we're doing what we can and we're going to continue to do what we can.  And I think the BBC should continue to hold  their feet to the fire and everybody's feet  and really most importantly us as consumers.

Start time: 3063.06

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean  you could praise Apple for doing  something. There are companies that do more.  Intel and HP tend to have a track  record for being  more involved in their supply  chains and going deeper into the supply  chains and doing external audits which  Apple only recently started doing in the last  couple of years. So in

According to a lot of these  experts they say Nintendo  buys from  bad sources  and doesn't seem to do anything to  try to repair itself.  Most companies just take a sort of  close their eyes approach to it.  And Nintendo has had a reputation  for being one of the worst.  We need fair trade consumer electronics.

I think it's primarily former employees  who really are getting screwed by this because Sony is somewhat  protecting current employees.  But not.  Jury finds that Apple is not  liable for harming consumers  and throws out this case,  the iTunes DRM case,  which has been going on since  Almost 10 years.  Apple could have been on the hook for  $350 million plus  damages as much as a billion dollars.  It was a class action lawsuit and  the jury delivered a unanimous verdict  saying that iTunes  7, released in 2006, was a  genuine improvement, not  just released for copy protection  or to be anti-competitive.  And the judge said  we thank the jury. Goodbye.

Start time: 3333.58

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  of course, there will be an appeal.  Because these lawyers,  they've been working on this 10 years, they don't know  what to do with themselves.  They don't have a job.  So they might as well just keep this going  for as long as you can.  And keep getting paid.  Pay days are coming.  Did you see Apple's new Christmas ad?  I love it.  Did you see the Guardians take on it?  I did not like the Guardians take on it at all.  I think the writer here,  Hannah Jane Parkinson, was a little bit  just peeved.

Harry's was founded by  a couple of folks who think  that razor blades are too expensive.  You know the old adage, you give away  the razor and you make it up on the blades.  Well, obviously, if you've seen the  locked up razor blades at your local  drugstore, you know that's because they're the  most pricey things in the drugstore.  As much as  $4 a blade for that Gillette Fusion,  for half as much you can get a better blade  because Harry's bought the  factory. They actually found out the best razor blades  are made by two  German factories in Solingen, Germany.  They bought one of them.  They own the factory and  make millions of blades. This way, they  sell them direct to you. You get an incredible  blade, but you also get the  incredible price on the Harry's  kit. I want you to take a look at the  they have two, the Truman and the Winston.  I'm not sure what the naming is  here. Winston Churchill and Harry's Truman?  I guess. I don't know. But anyway, the Truman kit  is $15.  You get the handle.  Actually, these are gorgeous handles.  Four different colors. Three  blades. You get the travel  cover, which is very useful.  Put it right in your Dopp kit there.  And you get some of that great Harry's,  either the shave gel or the shave cream. There's the travel  cover. That's so great.  These blades will never cut you.  They are gorgeous. They're fabulous. And of  course, once you get the kit, $15,  you're going to get the blades, the  subscription of the blades and the shave  cream or the shave gel. They also, by the way,  have a nice after shave now. You'll really like  your beard is soft,  feels good. It shaves so clean.  You're going to love it.  Engineered for high performance,  these blades are the best in the  business for half as much.  If you take a look at the Winston,  you can get it engraved with your name. It's  beautiful. Really nice. $25.  In each case, you can get $5  off when you use our offer code TWIT5  at Harry's dot com.

So, I, when I first started  playing with micro computers,  that's what we call them in those days,  and computer programming, it must  be 30 years ago  now. There was this little  kind of newsletter called Dr. Dobbs  Journal, Running Light Without Overbyte.  It was computer orthodontia,  I think is what they called it.  It's been around for 38  years.  They stopped printing a magazine  a little while ago, as most people did, and now  unfortunately, it's  sunsetting. That means  United Business Media that owns the  Dr. Dobbs label will not  pay for any more new content after  the end of the year. However, what's nice  is they're going to keep the website up, and all  the current content will be accessible. All  the links will continue to work.  That's thank you, UBM, for doing that. I know  that costs money.  This was, tell,  did you, so did you read it as a  kid, Miriam? Yeah,

I don't know  if he's home yet or not, but Alex  has been tweeting, and there's a  post on his blog, on his  health situation. So,  Jerry, you know, Jerry's,  Jerry, you cannot stop Jerry Pornell.  He's in his 80s. He had brain  cancer when he first started appearing  on the show, complete remission.  They say a minor  stroke. So, Jerry, we're thinking about  you. Feel better. Take care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe. I don't know.  I don't think of Fitbit as  particularly innovative and pushing  the envelope. And I think of fitness bands  as the dumb phones of wearables.  You know? Eventually the smartwatches  will just install an app. Like on Pebble,  if you want a job on a Misfit, you install an app  and then you're done. Right? Right. Why would you need  a separate band that does  this when  your primary wearable device,  your smartwatch can do it? That's the question  I ask. And then for a lot of people, their phones  are very good with sensors nowadays. Yeah!  They're detecting a lot of that stuff. So  I don't... I maybe  see that as a way for them to squeeze  through with a bit of a...  Before Apple comes out. Yeah.  A successful bump financially so they can all  make money before they get decimated.

I've never worn a watch. Oh, you will.  Tim Cook says you will.  You think so? Dr. Dre says you will.  Well, if Dr. Dre says so. I've tried all  the Android wear watches and I've reviewed  every single one of these fitness bands out there  and tried out some Pebbles  too. But, you know,  none of them really stay on my wrist that long. The one I like  actually the most so far is the Jawbone Up  24. And  that's not a watch. But you're not wearing it. I'm not wearing it right now.  But that's not a watch. I'm not sure if I  want to... If I buy into the smartwatch idea

Start time: 5625.84
End time: 5700.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  on the Pebble and it becomes a Jawbone  tracker. Like, in addition to all the  other stuff it does. It's not an exclusive  thing. It doesn't tie up your watch.  More and more of this is going to happen  when there's an Android Wearwatch that's $99  in super sleek. You're not  going to care that it's, you know,  that you want a custom  dedicated fitness band.  I don't think you're going to care. My Android Wearwatch  is a job cure. I think it's the dying breed.  I think that... Ooh, fancy.  It's going to be available.  You know how you go to 7-Eleven right now?  When you go to 7-Eleven, you can get  a phone in a blister pack prepaid, right?  Well, the Jawbones, the  fitness bands are going to continue to exist for $5, $10  bucks in blister packs at 7-Eleven.  But I don't think they're going to stay.  I think much more sophisticated  sensing bands are going to come out  that is fitness optimized.  Like, what Microsoft tried  to do with the band, but failed.  Eventually, we're going to get  some really, really high end and not very  expensive bands that are  much, much, much beyond just an accelerometer  sensing some stuff, right? And if  you look at what Jawbone and Fitbit are doing,  they're adding more and more functionality to their bands  to the point now where they have displays,  they have heart rate monitors.  So you're turning them into a smartwatch.  So they're doing exactly what I'm saying is going to happen.  Well, to back up what Miriam is saying,

Start time: 5701.72
End time: 5717.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  there was a Gartner  study that came out recently  that said that basically wearable  sales are going to nosedive.  And that 50% of people are going to consider  buying a smartwatch over  just a fitness tracker on their band.  But what about people like Jeff in the chat room

Start time: 5735.64

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So maybe there is a mark. Maybe there's a bifurcation in the market.  By the way, how do you pronounce that, German people?  Is it Tog-Hier?  Heer?  Or Verst? Heuer.  So this,  I think this is a problem for Google.  In fact, some of my watchmakers say we're going to sue.  I don't know if it's Google's fault,  but the Android Wear watches is a brisk market now  in Rolex,  Tag Heuer.  Heuer, really?  Wake up.  Look at that.  See, this is what Apple is going to have a problem.  Because I think this is the greatest thing  about Android watches  is they can look like anything.  Right?  This is a copyright violation.  No one would mistake this for a Tog.  It's cool that you can have that Rolex oyster watch logo on there.

Start time: 5786.08

Transcript:  You can have anything you want.  I think the person in the audience that has a very fancy watch  and also a second hand on their wrist,  I think that's also going to go away  because look at the company,  look at what Withings did with their watch.  It's an analog movement.  It has all the sensors in it.  It has great battery life.  There's nothing that stops Tag Heuer, Rolex,  and in fact, there's rumors that Tag Heuer is going to announce something at CES.  I think it's going to be inevitable that these watch manufacturers in Switzerland  incorporate these sensors even if they don't put an actual display on their watch  and continue to have a purely mechanical watch.  It's going to be inevitable.  People are going to expect it.  It's going to be so cheap to do that it might even come as a band.  It's a band you put on and the band has the electronics.  It's completely unrelated to the watch and it's luxurious.  It's made of gold, whatever.  I don't think people want to wear two bands.  I don't think so.

Transcript:  Hey, we had a good week on Twitter.  We like to take  the best of everything that happened this past week  and mush it into a minute.  And we thought we'd play that for you right now.  This is what you missed this week.  On Twitter.  Fresh. Like a boss.  Merry Christmas!  Wow!  Security now.  What Sony is saying is stop publishing our private emails.  Those are private. I don't think they should be published.  I'm not sure that the message would have gotten through to the degree it has.  You have to embarrass people for them, for others to take security seriously.  This week in Google.  Google News fame right now is dead.  As of 8.30 Eastern last night,  less than 12 hours later,  Spanish publishers have gone to the government asking for help.  Be careful what you wish for, amigos.  All about Android.

Transcript:  Interpretive dance.  We are going to take the week off.  Christmas is Wednesday.  Hanukkah ends Tuesday night.  Christmas is Thursday.  Hanukkah ends Wednesday night.  What we do on the Christmas week,  starting tomorrow, going all the way through next Sunday,  and the next week,  is specials.  Most of our shows will be doing best ofs.  Those are really fun.  Just to look back at the best moments from the year,  the biggest stories.  So most of our shows will be doing that.  Some of our shows like Tech News Today will be doing some,  I think, very provocative and interesting specials  about specific topics in the news.  So keep watching.  All new content coming up for you throughout the week.  But we will not be here live.  Don't forget that New Year's Day,  New Year's Eve and New Year's Day,  we are broadcasting a very special 24-hour marathon.  We did it last year.  It was so much fun, we decided to do it again.  Starting 3 in the morning Pacific time  on New Year's Eve.  So 3 a.m. Pacific is 1100 UTC,  New Year's Eve, December 31st.  And going all the way through 3 a.m. Pacific time,  New Year's Day, 1100 UTC.  So we will be doing that.  So we will be doing that.  So we will be doing that.  And we will be starting 3 in the morning Pacific time,  New Year's Day, 1100 UTC,  on January 1, 2015.  We call it 24 Hours of 2015.  We have, actually I have a list,  we have almost every time zone covered.  We have a few more, where did I put that list?  A few more time zones that we'd like to get,  here they are,  we'd like to get people from,  so that we can, I want to do everybody.  I want to say, Happy New Year to New Zealand.  Begin the show and end the show with Happy New Year  in Samoa.  But we're missing four, including Samoa,  or Midway Islands,  or Jarvis Island, that's all the same area.  That's UTC minus 11.  UTC minus 2,  Trinidad,  South Georgia, and Sandwich Islands.  You can see why we're missing people in these.  These are the far corners of the world.  But I want to do, I think we're going to do it.  The Azores,  or Cape Verde, that's minus one.  And plus six UTC, Bangladesh,  Bhutan,  and Kyrgyzstan,  and Kazakhstan.  Kazakhstan, the stans.  Actually we have Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Pakistan.  Zeeshan is going to join us from Pakistan.  So we've got some really amazing stuff.  Would you?  This is part of your portfolio.  And now look who we have online from Kazakhstan.  It's Mark Millian, yay!  Wow!  Who would have thought?  I'm so excited.  I'm so excited.  Wow!  Who would have thought?  It was so much fun last year.  Many of our hosts will be coming in.  None of them will do things that they're known for.  We've got musical acts.  We've got weird stuff.  They have literally not told me most of the stuff  because they're afraid I'll say no.  I think that sounds like there will be explosions  in open flame, but I'm not sure.  We are taking over the street.  Am I going to end up riding the Mechanical Bull?  Oh god.  Can I do that later in the show?  I don't know if I'll survive.  And we're doing it for a good cause.  We're going to raise money for UNICEF,  the United Nations Children's Fund.  I'm hoping to get a lot of money.  I feel like it's one thing for us to do this.  We're doing it because we're a global operation.  We want to really celebrate that.  It's New Year's for 24 hours all over the world.  But I think also a good way to raise a little bit of money.  We'd like to do this every year from now on,  but this is our second annual New Year's Eve party,  and you're all invited for the 24 hours of 2015.  If you'd like to be here, the space is limited  because we have a lot of people who do want to be here.  So email tickets at twit.tv if you want to be here in person.  But all of you can watch, and I hope you'll tune in  at some point in that 24-hour period and join us.  It is going to be a lot of fun.  You don't have to give up your New Year's Eve.  You can come early and be with it.  So that's coming up a week from Wednesday.  Make sure you put that in your calendar.  I really want to thank our guests.  Mark Millian, great to have you.  Nate, so nice to see you.  Miriam, you're the best.  Thanks to all of you for joining us.  We do Twitter every Sunday afternoon, 3 p.m. Pacific,  6 p.m. Eastern time, 2300 UTC.  If you can watch live, do, if not on demand,  audio and videos available on twit.tv, of course,  on iTunes and wherever you get your podcasts.  And don't forget Stitcher.  We're on TuneIn Internet Radio,  where you have the great twit apps created by third-party  developers on every platform, including Roku, by the way.  So there's going to be a way that you can watch,  and I hope you will watch each and every week.  Thank you for joining us.  Thank you to our great live audience.  We'll see you next time.  Another twit is in the can.  Happy holidays, everybody. Bye-bye.
