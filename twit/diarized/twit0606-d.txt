Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  You sure you don't have a supercomputer behind there  that you're planning to take over the world with?  Shh.  Good to have you guys, we were just talking  before the show, not much happened this week.  Actually, the biggest story happened just minutes ago.  Kara Swisher and Ricode says  that the president of Uber is quitting  after less than a year on the job.  Now, I'm not talking about Travis Kalanick, the CEO,  this is Jeff Jones, who joined Uber less than a year ago.  He came over from, where was he?

Start time: 299.60
End time: 300.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Target, he was at Target.

Start time: 300.72
End time: 333.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Tarjay.  Tarjay.  And of course, Kara's, I love Kara,  she subheads this, he's leaving after apparently  deciding the current controversies are too much to handle.  I don't know if he said that,  Uber has merely confirmed the departure  and is sending a statement along.  Sources said though, he said,  this isn't the situation I signed on for,  especially after Kalanick announced  that he was gonna hire a COO to coach him  to be less of a jerk.

Start time: 336.80
End time: 341.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right?  And not the first executive to leave Uber  in the last couple of weeks, even.  Certainly the highest.

Start time: 343.04
End time: 366.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He was the CMO at Target, so the idea was bring this guy in  from a squeaky clean operation where he's,  and so he can help us kind of clean up our reputation.  My mother, my 83 year old mother,  I put Uber on her phone so that she doesn't have to ask  my sister for rides, so she can be a little independent.  She won't use it, she says, oh no,  my friends tell me they'll rob you.

End time: 368.40
Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What?

Start time: 371.35
End time: 378.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I said, mom, they're not gonna rob you.  You've got their name and picture on your phone.  That would be a dumb crime.

Start time: 379.96
End time: 382.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, they don't have the app tip, so I mean, they're.

Start time: 383.24
End time: 388.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's the other thing she said,  but I don't have to tip them, right?  I said, well, no, actually you do.  Well, I don't want to tip them.

Start time: 390.12
End time: 392.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because they're gonna rob, well,  maybe that's why she's concerned.

Start time: 393.40
End time: 394.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They'll rob her app.

Start time: 394.24
End time: 395.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Maybe if you tip some people, you wouldn't get robbed.

Start time: 396.44
End time: 411.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it's what I think though,  the reason I bring that up is I think that the kind of,  the zeitgeist is kind of going against Uber.  Like people, the brand reputation is getting hurt,  even among people who are not geeks.

Start time: 413.20
End time: 423.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, if you're not paying close attention to this story,  you hear there were protests,  there was a driver who murdered somebody,  there's sexual harassment.  This sounds like something I don't want to be involved with.

Start time: 423.76
End time: 431.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I said, mom, cabbies are even worse.  She said, well, no, I won't take a cab either.  So anyway.

Start time: 433.32
End time: 434.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  At least she's consistent.

Start time: 434.16
End time: 446.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, at least she's consistent.  So Uber's got a lot of money.  They've got a, I mean, is it the beginning of the end  at Uber or what?  What is the future of Uber?

Start time: 446.96
End time: 485.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's the beginning of seeing a lot of people  step down and leave.  I mean, there's even weeks ago,  there were calls for Travis to leave  and I doubt that will ever happen.  Someone's with, like you said,  with a squeaky clean reputation to help them  and be the COO,  but we haven't seen the end of high level executives  leaving from there.  And a lot of people are waiting for their shares to vest  and to get out of there as soon as they can.  It's just, you just hear constant stories  about people upset with the culture there.  So, this is the latest in just a handful of top executives  that are gonna step down.

Start time: 487.66
End time: 499.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think if it's gonna be a decline,  it's gonna be a long decline.  It's something where certain number of people  have already stopped using it  because of all of these reasons we've talked about.  Last week on the Twitter panel,

Start time: 499.32
End time: 507.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  every single one of them,  I asked how many of you have deleted Uber?  All three of the panelists said I've deleted Uber.  Anybody here deleted Uber?  I haven't deleted it, no.

Start time: 508.33
End time: 512.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I cover Uber so I don't really have a choice,  but I use Lyft exclusively.

Start time: 512.40
End time: 514.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By the way, that's my excuse for using Windows, I have to.

Start time: 516.30
End time: 519.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why is it using Lyft because you can tip people in the app  and it's so much more convenient?

Start time: 519.96
End time: 526.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Exactly, I like the idea of being able to tip you in the app,  there you go, you're a good person,  it's expensive to live in San Francisco.

Start time: 526.84
End time: 536.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because I told my mom you have to tip them  and she said, well, I don't have any cash.  So, she has to go to the bank to get some $5 bills  so she could tip them.  It should be in the app, come on.

Start time: 537.04
End time: 576.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, you ask them about it  and they have roundabout answers,  as they do for everything  when it comes to tipping in the app.  And Lyft just put it in there  and I'm very surprised that two months ago,  Lyft didn't sort of succumb to Austin's demands  for fingerprinting of drivers.  Because if we had had Lyft in Austin,  they would have had a huge jump in the sort of people  who go to South by Southwest, Interactive,  and musicians, the gamers,  I mean, that would have been a super smart move  on their part and they did it.  So, we all used some other apps  and for me, I'd had zero problem getting around Austin,  but I don't whine.

Start time: 577.40
End time: 579.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, you were just back from South by.

Start time: 580.58
End time: 582.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I got back Thursday.

Start time: 582.60
End time: 592.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We had heard that a week ago, last Saturday,  that some of the local rideshare apps in Austin had failed.  Their servers went down because of the demand on Saturday.

Start time: 593.20
End time: 598.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, so there was a rainstorm  and so then everyone, instead of,  That's what you want.

Start time: 598.20
End time: 600.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A taxi system that doesn't work in the rain.

Start time: 600.48
End time: 621.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, so instead of using the taxis,  which were available, or the, I don't know, the Metro line,  it's also the light rail system that's available.  Everyone did what they do in San Francisco,  New York, and LA, is they tried to use their phones  and when you hit a service,  it's only really scaled up to the size of Austin  and even if it's scaled a little bit more  for South by Southwest, it went down.

Start time: 622.92
End time: 628.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are we hearing from Uber employees, drivers particularly,  that they don't like working for Uber?

Start time: 630.22
End time: 645.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I've heard from drivers  that they have a better experience with Lyft customers.  They prefer Lyft.  They prefer Lyft customers, actually,  because the quality of customer,  I've heard that sometimes the Lyft riders are douches.  I'm allowed to say that, right?

Start time: 646.14
End time: 647.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Uber riders are douches.

Start time: 647.84
End time: 648.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Are Uber riders, I'm sorry.

Start time: 649.28
End time: 669.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, no, you are allowed to say this  because apparently when Travis Kalanick heard  that Jeff Jones was quitting, he said, what a b***h.  So, no, he didn't.  He should though.  He could bleep that out.  That's the kind of thing Travis might say though.  You could see him saying that.

Start time: 670.28
End time: 709.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I could totally see him saying that.  That's the old Travis.  Oh, the old Travis.  That's the old Travis.  It's easy on the go.  I'm waiting for an Oprah.  I'm waiting for some sort of rehab.  A company's culture comes from the top down  and if you have a very toxic person  who's running a company who's more than likely to yell  at his drivers, or not his drivers,  the contractors who are driving for his company,  it makes you wonder.  And so, yeah, if I were the president of Uber,  I probably would have left too  because that's going to tarnish you  if you continue to work at a place like that.  And like Steve said, I mean,  people are waiting for their stocks to vest.

Start time: 709.52
End time: 727.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's interesting though,  and I don't know if it's different in tech  than it is in the general world,  but you see companies that really have tarnished reputations.  I'm thinking of Samsung with a Note 7 debacle,  I think then of Uber.  And it really, it's an interesting question.  How much does that hurt a company?  Can it put them out of business?

Start time: 728.92
End time: 741.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, it didn't put Apple out of business  when they had to, oh, I'm sorry.  Apple's had problems.  I was just interrupting everyone.  No, go ahead.  I mean, come on.  No, I mean, Apple,  they had their exploding batteries in the 90s  and they were in dire straits at that point.

Start time: 741.68
End time: 743.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They didn't have to do a massive recall though.

Start time: 743.28
End time: 761.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  So that, for years you heard,  oh, you had a Apple laptop.  Oh, is it gonna blow up?  Or they would back,  they'd do a little joke or whatever.  And so, you have Exxon with Exxon Valdez.  I mean, it depends on how that company,  it navigates those waters.  Yeah, Exxon, good example.

Start time: 762.00
End time: 763.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they survived Valdez.  Tom, what were you gonna say?

Start time: 764.66
End time: 820.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I was just gonna say,  I think we overestimate how much people understand  about some of these companies out there.  And your mom's perception of Uber  is one example of that on the negative side.  But a lot of people who have good experiences  using it in general,  may not pay attention to these stories either  and keep using it.  So that's why I think it's a long decline  if it's a decline.  And that's why they're working so hard  to gussy up their image right now,  because this is finally one scandal too far from them.  Eventually people forget, right?  And people start going ahead and using the service  because it's out of their minds.  And so yeah, it can hurt them,  but I don't think it's the kind of thing  that puts you out of business.  You have to do a lot of different things  to get put out of business.  I mean, look at Toshiba.  They're declaring bankruptcy  of the Westinghouse division in the United States.  They're trying to sell off  their solid state drive department to pay for that,  their division to pay for that.  And they're still going to be in business after that.  It takes a lot to kill a company.

Start time: 820.40
End time: 893.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and I think-  Well, let's not forget about the other piece of this,  where let's say the cultural issues  get hammered out at Uber.  There's this whole other piece with the Waymo lawsuit,  and that could affect,  if it is determined that Uber's VP Lewandowski,  if he did in fact steal all those documents  and use those documents to create LiDAR for Uber,  that could totally hose Uber.  That is the future of Uber.  Now that's like several years down the road, of course,  but I mean, they see this as the future.  They're going to get rid of drivers  and be almost fully autonomous.  And if it turns out they use stolen technology,  they're either going to have to pay a huge penalty to Waymo  and start licensing that technology  or start from scratch and develop it again,  which puts them even further behind.  And as we saw this week with those leaked stats  about how often they, with their self-driving cars,  how the disengagement rate is way higher  than it is at Waymo.  So they're a little bit behind already in self-driving cars,  which is the future of the company.  And this lawsuit could derail them even further.  So let's say they hammer out the cultural issues.  This is even more important.

Start time: 894.40
End time: 902.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Although I have to say Uber's self-driving technology  is not completely awesome.  We're starting to see some of the stats out of this.

Start time: 905.24
End time: 907.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that leaked reports that came out this week.  Exactly.

Start time: 908.34
End time: 914.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So for instance, they averaged 0.8 miles driving  before somebody, that a human had to take over.

Start time: 916.14
End time: 936.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I forget what Waymo was at,  but Waymo improved significantly year over year.  You can probably find the stats.  They released, I even wrote about it,  I already forgot what it was,  but they released their stats too,  and it was looking really good.  I mean, they're improving, improving, improving.  And if Uber just gets smacked with this lawsuit  and they have to start from scratch,  that puts them even farther behind.

Start time: 937.60
End time: 952.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, and Uber's getting a little bit better.  That's, yeah, I have to say though,  I think we're kind of selfish.  I think in the long run,  people will just go back to the Uber app  because it's convenient.  Yeah, of course.  They'll put it behind them in a couple of months,  they'll forget anything happened,  and they'll just say, yeah, it's convenient, it's easy.

Start time: 953.24
End time: 957.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But if they've downloaded the app  and they started using Lyft,  Lyft is literally the exact same service.

Start time: 957.98
End time: 959.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's an opportunity for Lyft, isn't it?

Start time: 959.98
End time: 994.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, yes, it's an opportunity for Lyft.  So it's not like they deleted the app  and then they don't have any other option.  It's not Chick-fil-A where you're angry  because the CEO throws money at, you know.  Right.  Yeah.  But you know, where you're like,  oh, where am I going to get delicious chicken?  Well, I guess you can still get  delicious chicken at other places.  Across the street.  Right.  Yeah, with Uber, Lyft is there.  Lyft is ready.  Lyft is, you know, and a lot of the drivers  are Uber and Lyft drivers first.  So for them, it's not that big of a deal  if someone deletes the Uber app.  They're like, oh, well, they're going to lose Lyft.  I'm a Lyft driver.  Everything works out for me.

Start time: 994.90
End time: 1003.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've never used Lyft.  I don't know why.  I just used Uber and I really liked Uber.  The Uber experience was very positive.  The black car experience was very positive.

Start time: 1004.88
End time: 1014.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So.  Lyft doesn't have as many different options necessarily,  but most of the riders double.  So every time I use Lyft,  I don't notice a difference from using Uber.

Start time: 1014.70
End time: 1033.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's the same people basically.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I guess it also comes down to how easy you can get one.  Like are there lots of drivers or not?  And that really.  Depends on where you are.  Yeah. You guys all live in metros,  so it's a little easier for you.  Up here in Petaluma,  your driver will be with you in an hour and 15 minutes.  It's not.

Start time: 1033.42
End time: 1037.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, now that you've got that new Sun Country route,  maybe there'll be more Lyft drivers.  Yeah.  You guys are.

Start time: 1037.78
End time: 1067.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was telling people before the show,  Sun Country Airlines, which is a Minneapolis based airline,  just put out a press release that once a week,  they're going to come to Santa Rosa from Minneapolis.  Once a week.  So I'm pretty excited about that new milk run  between Santa Rosa and Minneapolis.  I think it's really a wine run.  That's exactly what it is.  They say it's for people from Minnesota  who want to visit the wine country.  It comes out Thursday.  I presume it goes back.  They don't just park the plane.  Maybe they do.  They park the plane and they go back Sunday.

Start time: 1068.56
End time: 1081.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, a plane has to be flying.  They gotta go back, right?  That's how you make money.  Once a plane starts flying,  it usually doesn't stop until it breaks  or until they throw it away.  Yeah, but they didn't announce,  like, okay, maybe then they're going to go on

That's the most important factoid.  And we will not rent a movie that's under 70.  That's your limit, it's 70.  Yep.  And boy, I was in a movie, Collateral Damage,  I wanted to see this, Will Smith, it looked really good.  12% on Rotten Tomatoes.  I almost want to watch it to see how bad could that be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, well, now wait a minute.  It sounds like Orson Well's went to Kickstarter, he did not.  Right.  So it was a movie called The Other Side of the Wind.  Orson Well's took years, he actually died I think in 83  with it unfinished, he'd been working on it for 13 years.  John Huston is the star of it.  He'd been shooting forever.  It was never finished.  It was about a director, John Huston plays a director  of attempting a comeback movie after years of wandering  in the desert of the filmic deserts of Europe.  Everybody's wanted to see this.  This is on a level of Jerry Lewis's  The Day the Clown Cried.  That's so bad.  That's one that I hope never gets resurrected.  Supposedly Jerry Lewis carries around an attache case  with the film in it.  It's the story of a clown that gets.  Oh God.  Should I not talk about it?

Transcript:  Yeah, I read Patton Oswalt's last book.  He talks about that.  They try to do a reading of it  because they had the script and Jerry said, no, you can't.  The Day the Clown Cried, never released.  Same era as this Orson Welles movie by the way.  It's about a clown in a concentration camp  whose I guess job it is to make the children laugh  before they get gassed.  It sounds horrific.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I think that it's.  This is, I don't know how much Netflix is putting into this  but this is a really interesting example of Netflix  just saying, I mean, I don't,  this is a niche product, The Other Side of the Wind.  People like me will get very excited about this  but I don't know if you're gonna generate new subscriptions  but it's interesting that they're willing  to spend the money on this.  40 minutes of footage were edited by Welles  before he died in 85.  There are additional 1,083 reels of footage  kept in a warehouse in Paris.  Peter Bogdanovich appears in the film.  Netflix is working with Frank Marshall  who is a line producer on the film  as well as Peter Bogdanovich and a producer  and basically they're gonna edit the remaining reels  and create a movie out of it.

Start time: 1559.00

Transcript:  So who is the editor on the film?  Did they have a name?  Is that person called Lyle?

Start time: 1569.62
End time: 1617.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it's gonna be Frank Marshall  because he was the line producer.  Line producer.  Yeah, so he has, I guess the theory being  he has the best insight as to what Welles  would have done with it.  Welles always said the edit is the key  creative act in filmmaking.  It is.  Josh Karp who wrote a book called Orson Welles'  Last Movie the Making of the Other Side of the Wind  said this is like finding a lost Shakespeare play  except no one wants to read a new Shakespeare play  so this is better because it's a movie.  Karp has seen the 40 edited minutes  as well as other footage and thinks that Welles  would be thrilled by this.  We won't know obviously.  But I think this is really interesting for Netflix.  Not the first time of course they've foot the bill.  In fact they've got a number of movies in production  including I think there's a new Will Smith movie  they're gonna produce.

Start time: 1618.86
End time: 1632.50

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  90 million's less than they paid for House of Cards.  Really?  Yeah, that was $100 million for the first season alone.  So they got deep pockets.  House of Cards was a big success.  Got them a lot of subscribers.  I imagine Bright will do the same  because that's the kind of thing appeals to geeks.  But I have to think this Orson Welles  is more like a labor of love than money.

Start time: 1662.90
End time: 1686.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh yeah, it's funny because I talked to Netflix  way back when they were just launching House of Cards  and I asked about feature movies and documentaries  and they were like, you know, we get way more bang  for the buck with a television show.  So at that time they were just like, eh, about movies.  But now I mean they just, I guess enough people subscribed  and they're doing well enough.  Yeah, no, I'm a big fan of Netflix.  Yeah.

Start time: 1694.94
End time: 1730.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Absolutely, I feel like their strategy here is twofold.  One is to fill the niche of the person  who likes this kind of stuff.  They do all kinds of TV series that now  that you're probably not even aware is on there.  Kids shows, anime, all kinds of genres  because it'll show up in the right people's  recommended viewing and they'll only be able  to get it at Netflix.  And I think that's the other thing with these movies  is that, you know, down the road,  especially with something like Orson Welles,  if this becomes a cult classic, people will say,  oh, I wanna watch that, where can I watch that?  It's on Netflix.  So they're trying to make it that library  that you just have to have access to  because they have everything.

Start time: 1731.48
End time: 1752.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The thing about Brights, which is I think  a little different than House of Cards,  House of Cards was produced by Trigger Street,  Kevin Spacey's company, and then they auctioned it  to different, you know, to HBO and others.  It sounds like Netflix is, this is like entirely  a Netflix project.  They paid $3 million to get the script written,  for instance.

Start time: 1752.72
End time: 1765.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they're doing that more and more  now that they are in every country, except China,  and a couple of others, because they want to have  the worldwide rights forever, right?  They wanna have all the distribution.  With House of Cards, they really only needed it  in a couple of months.

Transcript:  I think Netflix wants to get away from the windowed stuff.  They need enough of it like they have with Disney  to put some big names in front of you,  but they're more about being HBO,  which is, we have access to some amazing content.  Original creating content.  That we only have.

Start time: 1812.70
End time: 1846.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Nobody else has, yeah.  Well, that's one way to solve their problem,  which is that, and this is the same problem  that the streaming music services like Spotify have,  which is they don't make their own content.  They're beholden to the movie industry and the TV industry,  and these companies can squeeze them,  as they are squeezing them.  And they squeezed Netflix famously.  They said, you can't have these movies  for your streaming service.  So this is a smart move.  If you could pull it off  to create your own unique exclusive content,  then you can say, see ya to Hollywood.

Start time: 1847.60
End time: 1861.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now, and then they're getting the talent in there to do that.  I mean, they're basically, yeah,  they're recreating the HBO, where they're like,  well, I don't have HBO now because I want to watch movies.  I have HBO because I want to watch Game of Thrones.  I don't want to watch their documentary series.  I want to watch, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So we see, it's interesting,  because we see Spotify and other streaming services  attempt to find their way in a similar situation  where the record labels could just squeeze them to death  and are.  Spotify is turning to original content,  like podcasts and other original content.  Audible's doing original content.  Even Google is doing podcasts now.  And you figure, well, Google and Amazon and Apple  are probably okay, because that's not their main business.  They can run these music services as a loss leader  to get people to buy their other products, et cetera.  But boy, I really worry about Spotify.  And now Pandora's getting into the mix.  Pandora is about to launch Pandora Premium,  another $10 streaming music service  with the same 40 million tracks that everybody else has.

Start time: 1976.34
End time: 2007.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't like this.  The CEO in this interview that you're showing right now  made it sound like, oh, we.  Yeah, we cracked the code and our app fixes  everyone's big problem with it.  It's like, no, it's the exact same thing  as all these other services.  There's nothing that truly differentiates them.  It's that you sign up for whatever you have.  I use Spotify just because it was the first  and I used it and a lot of my friends use it,  so it's kind of fun.  But there's no discernible major difference  that makes one better than the other.  And they all claim they are.

Start time: 2007.80
End time: 2017.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What Westreggren says is we're gonna be easier to use.  The problem with these other services  is you don't just open the app and press play  and you've got the music you want.  So here's the comparison.

Transcript:  I mean, Apple, when they hired Jimmy Iovine,  what Jimmy Iovine said with Beats Music is human curation.  That's the key, human curation.  What Tidal says is exclusives.  That's the key, exclusives.  RDO had social.  That's the key, social.  Here's the three screens.  On the left, Spotify.  On the right, Apple Music.  In the middle, this is the new Pandora streaming on it.  You're right, there's no differentiator.  And you're missing Google Play on that too.

Start time: 2053.88
End time: 2083.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And Google Play, right.  Having the recent playlists there,  right as soon as you open the app is a big advantage.  Recently played here?  That's one of the frustration I have.  I always wanna see the thing I was playing recently  show up there so I can get to it fast.  But that's easy for other,  if that turns out to be a differentiator somehow,  really easy for other companies to do.  That's not proprietary.  What Pandora's trying to sell is,  we've got the algorithm and it's great.  And maybe it is,  but that's really hard to convince people to switch on.

Start time: 2084.38
End time: 2107.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, okay, they have a lot of users, right?  A lot of people, Pandora Prime,  or whatever the Pandora One users pay money for Pandora  because it's the radio station.  It's using that algorithm.  That's a very popular streaming service.  Close to number one, I think,  in terms of paying subscribers.  By the way, the other thing they've got going for them,  paying subscribers get six months free of this new service.

Start time: 2109.32
End time: 2129.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's a great way to convert existing.  Yeah, it converts some people,  but it's not gonna get them anyone new.  And most Pandora people are using the free product  that has an ad in the middle of it anyway,  and they're not gonna start paying for it  just because of that.  How sticky is a music service?  It's pretty, I don't know.  I think it's pretty sticky,

Start time: 2129.64
End time: 2151.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  but I don't think that there's a lot of,  there's as much conversion  as these music services would like.  I mean, Spotify, you ask them about conversion rates,  and they sort of change the subject.  People sign up for free Spotify accounts,  and they're like, oh, I'm fine listening to ads  every once in a while.  And then they're like, well, will you pay $10 a month?  And they're like, well, why would I pay $10 a month  if I could just listen to it like this?  It's, you know.

Start time: 2152.04
End time: 2166.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Spotify is supposedly negotiating with the labels right now,  and agreeing to do exclusives for paying subscribers.  So that would be one way they would try to get you  to move from the free tier,  is the newest albums would only be available  on the paid tier for the first 30, 90 days.

Start time: 2167.96
End time: 2216.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, this is where these guys have no negotiating power.  They've got to do whatever the record labels wanted to do.  The thing the record labels hate the worst is the free tier.  That's why Taylor Swift wouldn't be on all of these services  because she didn't want her music to be given away.  It's gotta be tough.  Now, Apple has some clout,  because Apple is the number one music retailer, right?  Plus their app is on all Apple devices.  So you have kind of this automatic entree.  They also are trying to do exclusives.  Chance the Rapper, I don't know, he leaked out.  I don't know if this is true or not,  that Apple said, in order to,  we want to have exclusive for two weeks, two weeks only,  to your new digital mixtape coloring book.  We will give you half a million dollars for two weeks  and a 30 second commercial, which is worth even more, right?

The first independent to win a best,  what was it, best record?  I can't remember, record of the year.  That's really impressive, really impressive.

This genius, this marketing and musical genius  and he talked about working with brands.  If you can get in on movie, that's amazing.

I mean, whether you like it,  it doesn't matter what band you are.  There's other bands that sound like you.  And that's what the labels are supposed to do.  But, I mean, if push comes to shove,  there's enough small independent labels  that'll give you distribution and will help you out  and won't take as big of a cut  because most of them are doing it for sort of this love  of music, this passion of music.  Or you can do it yourself.  I mean, you can put it out there.  You can put a mixtape out like Chance the Rapper.  You can put an album out on your own.

You could talk about the playlists  and the social and all that, but really Discover Weekly,  which is a new playlist that's created every Tuesday  around your interests,  is to my mind, the single best feature is Spotify.  Do you pay it? Oh yeah.  Do they pay it, the labels pay to get on that?  Oh, like Payola?  Well, there's a lot of value.  And yeah, maybe, yeah, that would be Payola, wouldn't it?

Start time: 2523.14

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Tours are where the money's at.  I mean, most people don't sell a lot of albums.  You get a pittance from Spotify, from Google Music,  from Apple for streaming your music.  You have to go on tour.  You have to be able to perform live,  and you wanna be able to make a profit on that.  And that's really where you're making money.  That or if you get a commercial,  or if you're able to get into a movie or a television show.  I mean, I remember in the 90s,  it was like, oh, this band's selling out.  That was like sort of our sort of Gen X  snobbery about bands.  Now, if one of my favorite bands,  if TV on the radio is on a TV show, good for them.  I'm so happy because I want them to continue to make music,  and selling albums probably isn't cutting it.

I mean, I will never make money in any of my bands.  Even if my band gets moderately successful,  my original band, I'm gonna be losing money on that.

Transcript:  I had hoped that this new thing would make it possible,  make it harder to be a super platinum artist,  but make it possible for a lot more smaller bands  to make a living, but that hasn't happened.  I looked at somebody like Jonathan Colton,  and I thought, look at that, he's unsigned,  he goes direct to his fans.  I think he makes a very decent living selling his own music.  He does the cruises, right?  So he's made a business out of it,  and he can make a living.  And I thought, this would be great if 100,000 bands  could make a living instead of a dozen  multi-platinum artists,  but I don't know if that's what's happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I wonder if you still don't see more people  able to make a living doing this,  and fewer people being able to be a platinum artist,  but there still are those artists,  it hasn't eliminated the old structure,  but it does seem to have flattened it out.  It makes me think of publishing,  and publishing, publishers are still necessary,  and you see a lot of authors deciding sometimes  to do an indie book self-published,  and sometimes to go with a publisher,  depending on what the book is and what the market is for it.  And maybe music can be used.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And this is more based on what I've,  talking to authors on Sword and Laser,  what actual people who have agents  and get major publishing deals do,  is they go to a publisher  because they provide better editing,  they provide better marketing,  they can do the book on the shelves.  But you could hire a copy editor.

Transcript:  You could, but it's actually,  and here's the beauty of Inkshares,  which is what I did with PilotX,  Inkshares does all of that publisher stuff.  The only thing they changed was,  we don't have a slush reader who decides  is the gatekeeper of what we publish.  We let the audience decide that.  So it's kind of the living in both worlds.  And I think, I look at publishing  and I think there's a way for music to be like that  where you can self-publish,  put out your own music now easier than ever.  There are places where you can get a little bit of help  with production or hire some producers  to polish things up.  And then record labels still have a place to say,  hey, we can actually handle the scale  if you start to get incredibly successful  or have that potential.

Initially, 20 years ago,  we thought the internet was gonna really be a boon  for independent creators, for writers and musicians.  It was gonna be a boon for people who wanted to make video,  who wanted to write magazine style articles,  they could blog, who wanted to do radio, podcasts.  And it's to some degree been that,  but it hasn't been the utopia that we might've thought.

Well, that's the thing, I mean, the thought is that-  I wouldn't have my career if it wasn't for the internet,  period.  If it wasn't for the internet, I don't know,  I'd probably be digging a ditch somewhere.  But you still have to, the people who write,  the people who, they're still,  I mean, there's not as many talented people.

His wife, Natalie Dawn, great YouTube band,  we've had them on.  They did a tour and they lost their shirt.  Jack wrote about it.  It just was ridiculous, it was a terrible idea.  It really ended up costing him a lot.  Now he went on to form Patreon,  you still use Patreon, right?  To finance your podcast because he saw  that there was some need for this.  He wrote an op-ed that says-  Oh, I remember this.  You can make money touring, but not if you're Pamplemousse.

Even the Beatles did, right?  Yeah, you sleep on, I mean, I talk to bands  and they're like, oh yeah, or promoters who,  the members of big bands now used to sleep on their floor.  That's how you would go on tour.  You would talk to the promoter, they'd get you a gig,  you're a semi-successful band or you're up and coming,  and the promoter would let you sleep on the floor for free.  So that's how you were able to go to that show.

Songwriting is tough.  You worry about, do I sound too much like this song?  What are my feelings?  And you're writing the music and the words  and you're trying to create this image  and it's heartbreaking how much goes into each  and every song and then to have that song come out  and be like, oh, it's not as good,  it's super difficult compared to, I mean,  and I'm sorry, but.

In fact, a French advertising,  the sixth largest advertising agency in the world,  Havas, has actually pulled their clients,  including the Royal Mail, the English Mail system,  O2, which is a big English phone company,  and a few others, some other big names as a matter of fact,  including Domino's, Emirates Airlines, and the BBC,  they've pulled their advertising from YouTube  because they can't be sure  that it's not gonna appear on hate videos.  It's a real black mark against YouTube.  YouTube says we're gonna figure this out.  We're gonna stop it.  But Havas said, YouTube has been unable  to provide specific reassurances, policies, and guarantees  that their video or display content is classified  either quickly enough or with the correct filters.  This is a problem.  Buying an ad on YouTube is a crap shoot  because you don't know where that ad's gonna end up.

With so much content being uploaded to YouTube  and all these platforms, it's impossible to vet everything,  and these are the smartest people  in the world saying this.

You didn't tell us it was gonna hurt our better line.  Yeah, now all of a sudden, they're smart enough  to work on this problem.  That really upset, that just annoyed the hell out of me  when all of a sudden, they ignored these hoaxes  spread on their platforms that continue to be spread  on their platforms and really influence people,  and then all of a sudden, that people who pay  to run ads against this content start waking up to it,  and then they start doing something about it.

And now DoubleClick, their programmatic ads  sometimes end up against things  because the algorithm isn't perfect,  so we need to put a little tweak in there,  and oh, we need to go in and moderate news  because some people believe things that aren't true,  and even though there isn't a lot of evidence  whether that really affects people or not,  we don't like the idea of it,  so let's have Facebook step in,  and these platforms that have succeeded  because they were able to say,  we're just providing the place where people publish,  are now being pushed into taking over,  and while I agree in every instance, right,  I agree that intellectual property needs to defend it.  I agree that we actually don't want ads  showing up next to extremist videos,  and I agree that we don't want bad news  being presented as if it's authoritative.  I wonder if we really want these platforms to be,  as Justin Robert Young calls it,  hashtag portal to hell, the ones deciding what we see.  Careful what you wish for.  Yeah.

Transcript:  Well, Justin's a friend of mine, you know,  and I vehemently disagree with him on that too  because this is what media organizations have done all along,  and we need to start treating these platforms  as media organizations that they are.  This is how a lot of people consume their media,  and you are a gatekeeper in a lot of ways.  It's journalism school 101.  You do have to discern what's true and what's not true,  and what's valuable and what's not valuable,  and I think they're finally now realizing  that they have a huge role in this.  It took a while, and it took, in Google's case,  it took some advertisers threatening to, you know,  take their money away.  But yeah, there's a huge responsibility  that goes along with being a disseminating,  being a portal for a vast amount of information.

Start time: 3560.62
End time: 3611.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, but what this does is just take away the money  from those videos.  I mean, it doesn't necessarily stop them,  and then you have to determine, you know,  Facebook's algorithm is a piece of crap.  I mean, it doesn't work half the time.  We constantly have, you know,  Facebook pulled this video because it was,  I don't even know what, it happens so often,  it's hard to remember which one.  The trending topics they always have trouble with.  Yeah, like, yeah, the trending topics,  and where do you draw the line with hate speech  and with satire?  I'm like, is this, well, the algorithm didn't understand  that this Dave Chappelle bit was satire,  so we pulled all the ads off of it, and yeah.  So it's tough, and on one hand, I think, you know,  any idiot, even, you know, hateful idiots  should have their chance to say what they want,  but, you know, if they gotta understand  that they're not going to get paid for it.

Transcript:  But to tie back to our earlier conversation,  all of the progress for independent artists, musicians,  publishers, video people, has to do  with permissionless access.  The big leveler is I don't have to make sure  I meet someone's approval to reach an audience.  This doesn't change it much, but it is the beginning  of I do have to meet these standards,  and with Content ID on YouTube, it's a big problem  where people won't do things that they have the right to do  because they're afraid of going afoul of that robot.

If you're gonna buy a new home  or you're gonna refi your old home,  and by the way, interest rates are going up,  so maybe you ought to be thinking about a refi.  You're gonna go to a mortgage lender.  You can trust a mortgage lender  that's loved by its customers.  There is no better place to go than QuickenLoans.com.  Quicken Loans.  Just look at all those JD Power customer satisfaction awards  year after year.  Number one in customer satisfaction.  Well, now they have a product for us geeks.  It's called Rocket Mortgage.  It is an entirely online mortgage approval process.  So you get a great lender  and you don't have to put on pants.  You could just do it from your couch on your phone,  no going to the bank,  no going through paperwork to find your check stubs  and your bank statements and all that stuff.  You don't just submit it all with a touch of a mouse.  Because it's the internet, friction-free,  you can adjust the rate and length of your loan  and get exactly what you want,  and you will literally be approved in a minute.  So last time, Lisa and I bought our house,  took us what, six weeks, eight weeks?  Took forever.  We were on vacation.  We were still four weeks.  We were still sending paperwork from vacation.  Not with Rocket Mortgage.  You'll get approved in minutes for a mortgage  that's just right for your financial situation.  From a mortgage lender you can love and trust.  Rocket Mortgage from Quicken Loans.  Skip the bank, skip the waiting.  Go completely online.  QuickenLoans.com slash twittwo.  That's QuickenLoans.com slash twittwo  and the number two equal housing lender  licensed in all 50 states.  NMLSconsumeraccess.org number 3030.  Rocket Mortgage from QuickenLoans.com slash twittwo  and the number two.  I love this.  Apple clearly fixes prices of its phones, of its Macs.  You can't buy a discounted Mac or a discounted iPhone,  not by more than a few bucks.  So I guess that's legal in the US,  but Russia has now found Apple guilty  of iPhone price fixing.  They're gonna face fines that could reach as high  as 15% of their Russian revenue.  The Russian Federal Anti-Monopoly Service says,  Apple ordered retailers to set prices  and threatened them that if they sold the iPhone  at an unsuitable price,  they would be either have to change the price back  or risk losing the right to sell iPhones.  No comment from Apple on this.  I just find it ironic that you can't,  you could do it in the US apparently,  but you can't do it in Russia.  Any comment?  It's Russia.  It's Russia.

Pennsylvania court ruled the company had to hand over  emails stored overseas in response to an FBI warrant.  Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft stepping up  to help their frenemies at Google  with amicus briefs saying no.  Now I might be a little weird on this one  because I know the tech industry and everybody says,  oh, you shouldn't have to hand over data  held on international servers.  But honestly, in this day and age, data is everywhere.  Why shouldn't you?

Start time: 4338.54
End time: 4347.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

End time: 4356.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

End time: 4383.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay.  But first of all, they won on appeal.  You got to recognize, you know,  law enforcement needs to be able to subpoena people's emails.  When you use an email server and you're an American citizen  and you're sending email within the United States,  just because Google puts that email  on some other country's servers as part of its kind of system,  should that let you off the hook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Sorry, sorry.  I mean, you raise a good point, Leo,  and I think another way to look at it is,  if, say, China says we would like emails of a dissident  and we don't care that they're stored in California,  Google, you have to give them to us.  That's the other direction of this principle.

Start time: 4418.02
End time: 4442.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I guess the question is,  and it's not clear from the articles I've read,  but I presume this is because it's the FBI.  They're investigating a crime that occurred  in the United States and these emails are not emails  to international recipients,  but emails that went on within the United States,  but because of Google's own network system,  they end up sometimes stored elsewhere.

Start time: 4456.44
End time: 4498.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I guess, why is it being stored in Taipei?  That's my, why is it, why are, you know,  US emails being stored in other countries  because I mean, the whole reason for putting servers  and in other countries is to reduce latency.  I don't know.  I mean, I guess, I mean, if it's still,  if you have a valid warrant  and it's, you know, you're not trying to break encryption  and if Leo and I are emailing each other about stealing,  I don't know, a million dollars from, I don't know,  let's say the Humane Society,  we're just really evil people, then yeah, sure.

Start time: 4501.74
End time: 4558.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a matter of practicality versus precedent.  And the judge is using the reason that you're using Leo,  which is if you're opening the email here,  where does it matter where in the world  on the internet it was stored, right?  Like if I'm in the US, I open the email,  the email is now in the US, it's now under our jurisdiction  and the warrant should apply.  What Google's saying is, well, hold on though,  that's not what's happening.  We're not opening the email here.  You're asking us to access it and bring it over here  and that's an illegal seizure  because that data is over there in that data center  for a reason because it's closer to where people need it.  And so you need to get that country  to allow this data to be accessed.  I think the judge makes a good practical reasoning,  but there is a precedent here that you might not wanna set  because for emails that aren't necessarily going to be  in the US, you can suddenly say, well,  anything in the world now is subject to FBI jurisdiction.  And I don't think anyone would think that's the way it should

Transcript:  work.  a crime that occurred on the US shores.  The Microsoft case, Microsoft stored the emails in Ireland  only because the person whose account it was  said he was in Ireland.  And so they did that for convenience,  but I don't think the person was in Ireland.  It was an unverified statement of residence.  I'm not sure why Google was storing these emails offshore.

Start time: 4582.84
End time: 4625.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think you wanna set the precedent  that the US Department of Justice can go anywhere  in the world and get any data stored on any server  because they can make an argument that it somehow relates  to the US.  What you probably need is an international treaty.  So to the shared data privacy rules that the US  and the EU have been working out that says, okay,  when it's stored in Ireland, let's say,  there should be an easy way for the FBI to apply overseas  and say, here's why, here's the justification  for why we need this.  It's a person in the US who committed a crime in the US  and communicated with other people in the US.  And the Irish courts can rubber stamp that.  Sort of like Interpol or an extradition treaty for data.

Start time: 4626.42
End time: 4651.88

Transcript:  Yeah.  I guess it would come down to why the email  is stored overseas.  And if all the...  I just don't think the FBI,  if the FBI is investigating a crime that occurred  in the United States between two parties in the United States  with emails that were between those two parties,  the fact that Google, for whatever reason,  stored that data overseas shouldn't impinge  on the FBI's ability to investigate that case.

Transcript:  Yeah, and I'm trying to find that.  In the case of the Irish case, the Microsoft case,  the defendant was not an American citizen.  So that might be the reason why Microsoft won that case.  I don't know.  Just wondering.  Just asking the questions.  I don't wanna automatically assume that Google,  Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple are right.  Let's see.  Also, I'm basically grasping at straws here  because there's nothing else to talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They were collecting the data on when  and how the toy was used.  They didn't admit any wrongdoing,  but they did settle $3.75 million worth of settlement  because they had your login.  They knew who you were and they were collecting  how you were using their device.  So was it animized at all?  No, apparently not.  They were in effect tracking their customers' sex lives.

The lawsuit alleges when a WeVibe was remotely linked  to a partner, the connection was described as secure,  but some information was routed through WeConnect  and collected.  Temperature and intensity.  Temperature?  300,000 people bought these things,  but weirdly enough, only 100,000 connected them to the app.  Why would you buy a Bluetooth enabled vibrator  if you didn't connect it to the app?  Price?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know.  Maybe it was on sale.  Maybe you were like,  I'm always going to connect it to the app.  It's doing its job without having to use the phone.  Plus, I mean, do you want to be holding a phone  while you're using it?  You're usually pretty busy when you're using that.  Hold on, let me get my phone,  and then you're getting Twitter replies.

I mean, it was wrong, and they know they were wrong.  That's why they paid all that money  without admitting wrongdoing,  which is sort of a legal way of saying,  well, here's a bunch of money.  We want it to stay in business.

End time: 4929.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This company didn't send this anywhere.  We don't know what they did.  They collected it.  What else would they do with it?  My point being, it doesn't matter  if the carving company sends it anywhere or not.  They should not collect it without your approval.  That's right.

Transcript:  Good news.  Kurt Eichenwald, who is an editor at Vanity Fair,  writes for Vanity Fair,  apparently wrote an article that somebody didn't like.  That person tweeted him, allegedly tweeted him  a strobe message trying to induce epileptic seizure.  The FBI arrested that fella  after a three-month investigation this week.  He faces federal charges for cyber stalking.  They kind of got the smoking gun  because not only did they figure out  that he sent the tweet,  but they looked at his direct messages,  and he had messaged to other people,  I'm going to kill this guy.  It's going to really, you deserve a seizure for your post.  They kind of got the smoking gun there.  Interesting that that is a crime.  Yeah.  Well, if I were to send something in the mail  that would cause you harm,

Start time: 4981.74

Transcript:  I would be charged with a crime.  So this is the same.  My mom has epilepsy,  and the idea that someone would send her something  that would give her a seizure,  knowing that someone has epilepsy  or any other seizure situation,  and then to use that because you don't agree with it,  you don't agree with it,  and then to use that  because you don't agree with an article is ridiculous.  You should be in jail.

Transcript:  It's not the first time it happened.  He said it happened twice before.  In October, he had been to send a tweet,  or an epileptogenic cartoon,  and he dropped his iPad before a seizure was triggered.  Yeah.  So that's all about intention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's a look at just a few of the stories  we'll be watching in the week ahead.  First, the Nintendo Switch has been on short supply,  but apparently Wednesday, March 22nd is a magical date.  And that GameStop will get an influx of fresh new  batches of consoles, meaning you too can get in on the fun.  Oh, who are we kidding?  They'll sell out before you get there.  On Friday, March 24th, Samsung's next big tablet,  the Galaxy Tab S3 will hit store shelves  and will set you back a cool $600.  That gets you a premium 9.7 inch Android tablet  complete with an S Pen for when you feel inspired.  Finally, if you're like me, life was too busy for you  and you missed Star Wars Rogue One in the theater.  And who are we kidding?  Because that's no damn excuse, but still have no fear  because the digital HD version will hit your screen  on the 24th as well.  Who knows, maybe it'll hit the screen  of your fancy new Samsung Galaxy Tab S3  that you bought because GameStop was sold out  of Nintendo Switches.  That's a look at a few of the things we'll be tracking  in the coming week.  I'm out next week on vacation,  but you can join Megan Moroney and Nathan Olivera's Giles  on Tech News today, every weekday at 4 p.m. Pacific,  7 p.m. Eastern here on Twitter.

We talked a lot about it this week  on this week in computer hardware with Patrick Norton  and Ryan Shroud of PC Perspective.  I have been rooting for AMD.  I want them to do well.  They are trying to make a processor that can beat Intel.  And while according to Ars Technica and others,  it's still not quite as fast as Intel, but it's close.  And Ryzen has some interesting benefits.  Of course, it's lower cost.  They have six core and eight core.  In fact, their eight core 16 thread is under $500.  So it's a great price.  And there's a whole movement to get it to work  with Libre Boot and Core Boot,  the open source boot firmware,  so that Ryzen, and I think this could actually help AMD  a lot if they did it, and I hope they do.  Well, we're looking at you, AMD.  Ryzen might become the choice of open platforms,  open hardware platforms.  People a little bit troubled  by Intel's master control program, MCPs,  code that's in all Intel chips at phones home,  and we don't know exactly what it does.  And it would be nice to have an open processor.  So according to Ars,  Ryzen is actually a pretty good gaming processor.  And at this price, you might see these  in some lower cost devices.  The Switch has a really excellent Nvidia K1 in there,  and it really is pretty amazing.  Don't know what to say.  Do you have a Switch, Robbie?

And I see what Intel's doing with Mobileye,  I see what Nvidia's doing with Bosch  and partnering to create an auto platform.  And that's really where you need to go  for the future of processing.  And Intel missed the boat with mobile,  they're working very hard not to miss the boat  with other platforms like auto and internet of things.  And I don't see enough of what AMD's doing in those markets.  So AMD's fighting for a market that's dead or dying.

Transcript:  Anything, anything?  The one, one of the rumors that I really liked  was that it might have a 1000 frame per second camera.  Ooh.  Which would be a super slow-mo camera, right?

Start time: 5774.36
End time: 5789.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's great for cats jumping at things.  Oh, that would be so awesome.  Dogs, I mean, literally,  that's the only thing tech reporters own  that's exciting are cats and dogs.  That's a dogs.  We don't do anything.  You're not gonna see a video of us jumping off stuff  and doing backflips.

End time: 5802.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Samsung's Galaxy S7 had actually an excellent camera,  as do really all the, the Pixel's excellent,  the Apple iPhone is excellent,  but I think a 1000 frame per second super slow-mo  would be pretty cool if they do it.

Start time: 5803.14
End time: 5815.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Even a year later, the S7 camera is still just as good.  It's amazing, isn't it?  I think it still outperforms the iPhone 7 camera  in a lot of ways, and just,  it'll be great to see how they improve on that this year.

Start time: 5815.58
End time: 5849.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  The S8 will have, according to rumors,  because we don't know until the end of the month,  but the 12 megapixel camera,  they're gonna add DRAM to the sensor.  That's how it's gonna do 1000 frames a second.  It'll record into its own memory in the sensor,  which is pretty amazing.  Also an eight megapixel front-facing camera  with auto-focus and a 3.7 megapixel RGB scanner.  So there'll be three cameras in this,  and that will be used for iris scanning  and facial recognition.

Start time: 5852.19
End time: 5863.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Are they gonna have like an SD card,  like a micro SD card on this?  Because a 1000 frames a second  is gonna fill up your phone super quick.  You're like, I shot a 10 second thing  and now I can't send a tweet because my phone's crashing.  Because my phone's crashing.

Start time: 5864.02
End time: 5874.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, they didn't have an SD card.  Did they have an SD card in the S7?  Yes, they did.  It was the S6 that did not.  They had abandoned it, and the Note 7 did as well.  Everyone got mad at them for that.

Start time: 5874.34
End time: 5882.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the S7 and the Note 7, before it exploded,  the same little slot had it.  So they'll probably do it again.  There's no doubt about that.

Start time: 5882.68
End time: 5901.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I don't know why, I really hate it  that Samsung does this,  but they always augment the Google apps in Android  with their own version.  They're gonna have a voice assistant.  They used to have S voice.  Now it's gonna be called Bixby.  And actually Samsung apparently confirmed that  on its Italian website.

Start time: 5902.58
End time: 5925.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and that's based on Viv,  which is created by the guys who made Siri.  And so now you're gonna get a smartphone  that has both Google Assistant and this Bixby thing  all in one competing with each other.  Meanwhile, other Android phones are putting in.  So it's just a mess.  It's becoming fragmented all over again.  It's not user friendly.

Start time: 5925.98
End time: 5934.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, users just want one assistant that works.  And I can just imagine Bixby saying,  you talking to me?  You talking to me?  No, I'm talking to Cortana.  You talking to me?

Start time: 5935.94
End time: 5941.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I had heard that Bixby wasn't based on Viv.  Oh.  Oh, I thought it was.

Start time: 5941.92
End time: 5948.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But S voice was based on Nuance.  Samsung bought Viv.  And you would think that they would replace Nuance.

Start time: 5948.18
End time: 5958.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, yeah, and I heard Bixby was continuing  to be based on S voice, not Viv,  which was Nuance's other separate thing.  Interesting.  But maybe it's something lost in translation  in that overlap.

Start time: 5959.02

Transcript:  Right, it's finally getting the OLED screen.  Things like that, wireless charging,  things that have been around forever in Samsung phones  and they're finally putting that in the iPhone  and they're waiting for this 10th anniversary  to stuff in all this cool stuff that we've wanted for years.

Start time: 6038.98
End time: 6091.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What a novel idea.  I do believe they are.  I just got a HTC Ultra and it doesn't have a headphone jack  and it's like why wouldn't you,  and a big phone too, why wouldn't you put a headphone jack?  Although it has something.  That's USB-C, right?  Yeah, it has something really cool.  It comes with USB-C headphones  and if you use their headphones and you put it in your ear,  they have this button you push  and it blasts about a second worth of white noise  in your ear and then it magically, I don't know how,  generates a sound curve for your hearing  and it looks pretty accurate to me  based on, because I've had audiologists  test my hearing recently.  It's pretty much my curve,  falls off on the high end and the low end.  There's a little notch at one frequency  and then it says you want to use this equalization  for all the music on these headphones  and it sounds much better.  And it does it instantly.  Samsung does this but you go through a whole hearing test.  This just goes, kk, and then it somehow magically knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Nice.  Pwn2Own, it's the big Vancouver hackers convention.  Lots of money, big prize money.  They put out computers with stock installs  and they challenge hackers to hack it.  It used to be you'd win the computer.  Now it's like hundreds of thousands of dollars.  In fact, the members of Qihoo360, a security team,  I'm thinking they're out of China with a name like Qihoo,  won $105,000, the highest price so far at Pwn2Own,  for pulling off what many thought was impossible.  They compromised Microsoft Windows  with a hack against the Edge browser running in VMware  and they were able to get out of the virtual machine,  escape to the hardware running it and hack it and own it.  And that's tough.

Start time: 6159.46
End time: 6183.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's insane because whenever you talk  to security researchers, you open everything in VM  and a virtual machine because you don't want  whatever you're working on to escape.  It's like a little quarantine area.  You're running Windows or Mac or Linux or whatever.  You have this little quarantine area  where you're testing this thing, you're seeing what it does.  And the idea that now it can escape.  That's terrible.

Start time: 6184.14
End time: 6188.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 6188.86
End time: 6194.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is great news.  It's great that they found it.  It's great that they don't have to do it.  Why is it great news?  Exactly.

Start time: 6194.26
End time: 6203.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because we so often do this with hacking stories  where security researchers found this vulnerability,  isn't it awful?  No, when the security researchers find them,  it's great because it means we patched them.

Start time: 6203.88
End time: 6258.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Although because Pwn2Own has such big prizes,  you know that these companies find these  and hold onto them for months  so they can exploit them at Pwn2Own  and get that $105,000.  They used, so this is a wild,  they founded a heap overflow bug in Edge,  a JavaScript engine bug,  which achieved code execution outside the Edge sandbox.  Then they used a Windows 10 kernel bug  to escape from Windows 10 and the virtual machine  and fully compromised the guest machine.  Oh no, they're still in the virtual machine.  Then they exploited a hardware simulation bug  within VMware, the virtual machine,  to escape from the guest operating system to the host one.  And it was all started by going to a controlled website.  You're surfing in Edge to this website  with a malware on it and you're owned.  All the way down.

Start time: 6259.66
End time: 6292.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because if they found this,  that means people have already been exploiting this.  Well, that's what worries me.  How long have they known this?  At this point, yeah.  There's already more nefarious hackers,  nation states who have been exploiting this bug  probably for years or at least months.  And now we know to patch them.  Every time something gets exploited,  it's great that we find it.  It's bad that the company missed it.  But yeah, like Tom was saying,  it's great that we know that that's something  that you can get out of VMware.  That's insane.

Start time: 6292.86

Transcript:  Well, with this one at least, with this exploit.

Start time: 6305.62
End time: 6330.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There actually were three days of exploits  over the three days.  Day one, they paid $233,000.  Day two, $340,000.  Day three, that $103,000, $105,000 prize.  So lots of exploits.  Yeah.  We accept that, again, I have that fear  that people are holding onto the exploits  longer than they should  because they want to make money at Pwn2Own.

Start time: 6331.94
End time: 6338.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 6338.48
End time: 6354.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So at least there's that part.  So day one started with 360 security teams  successfully using a JPEG 2000 heap overflow,  a Windows kernel info leak,  and an uninitialized Windows kernel buffer  to gain remote code execution through Adobe Reader.

Start time: 6356.78
End time: 6363.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Start time: 6364.06
End time: 6425.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They should really broadcast this.  This sounds great.  Next up, Samuel Gross and Niklas Baumstark  earned some style points by leaving a special message  on the touch bar of the targeted Mac.  They employed a use after free exploit in Safari  combined with three logic bugs  and a null pointer dereference to exploit Safari  and elevate their privileges to root in Mac OS.  Wow.  That's awesome.  Then Tencent security team Ether  targeted Microsoft Edge succeeded  using an arbitrary write-in chakra  and escaped the sandbox using a logic bugs  within the sandbox,  letting them accrual $80,000.  $15,000 for the team that leveraged a Linux kernel heap  out of bounds access bug to own Ubuntu.  They actually popped Excalc apparently.  So I guess they opened Excalc.  I don't know.  It really is.  This would be great.  Somebody's got to dramatize this as an event.

Start time: 6427.42

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What about these E-sports casters for this?  Yeah, I would watch that.  I would watch that before I would watch E-sports.  Just because the mindset of the average hacker  and security researcher is amazing to me.  The idea that it's like when you lock your front door  and you think you're safe,  but someone comes up and is like,  well, I can just go through the window  or I can tunnel under here or I can climb up over this.  And that's the sort of idea of security researchers  finding other ways around the locked door.

Start time: 6466.66
End time: 6470.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Our show today brought to you by FreshBooks  that I want to talk about at Dyna Minnesota  and why you don't want to do your searches there anymore.  FreshBooks is the ridiculously easy cloud accounting software  that saved my bacon when I used to go up to Canada  to do the TV show.  I had to invoice them, you know, expenses,  and I had to do it in Canadian dollars.  And I put it off and put it off.  Amber told me about FreshBooks.  It was just starting up in Toronto in 2004.  And they saved my life.  They now have 10 million small business owners  use FreshBooks to do their cloud accounting.  It's invoices, the easiest way to do your invoices.  In fact, because FreshBooks invoices have payments built in,  your clients can pay you online by credit card  with no setup on their part.  They just pay straight from the invoice.  You're gonna get paid an average of 11 days faster.  11 days faster!  And if clients view your invoice but say,  oh no, I didn't get it, you can say, no, you did,  because you can see when your invoices have been sent,  viewed, and paid.  You'll also see overdue and outstanding invoices.  You can brand them, you can set recurring invoices,  you can even set recurring payments if your client says,  hey, let's just forget this whole back and forth.  I just, you invoice me automatically,  I'll pay you automatically.  And if people are slow, you get automatic late fees,  auto payment reminders.  FreshBooks time tracking, it's built into the web  or their app, they have great apps for iOS and Android,  it will let you build for time by client,  by specific projects, track your time down to the minute,  manage team time sheets, you will know what you did,  when you did it, and here's the best thing,  this new dashboard they just released to FreshBooks  shows you whether you're making money or not.  I think a lot of small businesses really don't know  till tax time, did I make money?  You'll know every moment because you're tracking expenses,  you're tracking income, you're tracking outflow,  you'll know exactly what you've been paid,  how much, how much your expenses have been.  And it integrates with all the apps you already use,  Stripe, Shopify, Gusto, Acute, Scheduling,  and more and more and more.  Ensure a smooth tax season, save 192 hours a year,  just use FreshBooks, try it free, 30 days,  await at freshbooks.com slash twit.  Make sure you put this week in tech in the form  where it says how did you hear about us,  that's freshbooks.com slash twit.  Save the paperwork, you didn't get into business  to do billing, you got in business to do the thing you like.  Let FreshBooks.  Sleep in.  Yeah, sleep in, that's why, right?  Let FreshBooks do the billing for you.  It's awesome, freshbooks.com slash twit.  I do not know what to think of this, this is wild.  Edina, Minnesota.  The Edina Police Department are trying to find somebody,  Douglas Blank, we won't say his last name,  who created a fake passport and attempted  a fraudulent wire transfer of $28,500.  It was stopped, it was stymied,  but they're trying to track the guy.  So they went to a judge and said, your honor,  if you give us a warrant, we can go to Google and say,  give us the name of everybody in Edina  who searched for Douglas Blank  between December 1st, 2016 and January 7th,  more than a month, and we could catch this guy  because if they searched for him, they must know him.  The judge, Gary Larson, aptly named,  not the cartoonist of Hennepin County, said yeah,  approved a search warrant that looks into any or all  user or subscriber information of anyone  in the town of Edina who looked up the name.  The investigator then filed the warrant  with Google's custodian of records.  The warrant says, I want not only the day and time  of the search, but I want the name, the address,  the telephone number, the date of birth,  the social security number, the email address,  payment information, account information, IP addresses,  and MAC addresses of the person who completed the search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google will not let this fly.  It's way too broad.  I mean, what, tens of thousands of people  are affected by this.  They're gonna have their search history snooped into  to see if they searched for this guy.  Then on top of that, all their other information  like MAC addresses and everything you just listed.  I mean, it's just way too, it's so broad.  There's no way it's gonna fly and they'll appeal it  and it'll be fine, but that's just insane  the judge even considered it.

Start time: 6787.56
End time: 6809.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, so what they're trying to do is say  in this false passport, the guy used this image.  We know he was in a diner.  If we can find out who searched for the results  that come up with that image,  then we'll be able to pinpoint the guy.  Do I have that right?  Yes.  That makes perfectly reasonable sense, right?  From that perspective.

Start time: 6810.14
End time: 6813.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, but you have to look at everybody's search records.

Start time: 6813.82
End time: 6826.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And the idea is like, you'd have to be signed into Google.  First of all, you're searching yourself or your fake name.  Then you have to be signed into Google.  You're just searching.  Or you're signing your fake.

Start time: 6826.88

Start time: 6828.82
End time: 6843.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I don't even think you have to be signed in.  They're just looking for IP addresses, right?  And then if you're signed in, they could get more.  I see the logic of asking for this, right?  Which is like, hey, probably only one person in a diner  looked for this image.

Start time: 6843.20
End time: 6875.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is the problem, though.  This is what happens with police departments.  And God bless them, they're trying to solve crimes.  They know if I could just get into this phone  or I could just get those search results,  I would have the guy.  I know I would.  That's all I need.  And I guess it really isn't their job to say,  but that would be unconstitutional  or that would be overly broad.  They should ask for it.  It's the judge who should say, guys, you can't do that.  Sorry.  That's what the judge is there for.  So who is this?  Get it together, guys.  Get it together.  Of course they want that.  I understand why.  Yeah.

Start time: 6876.32

Start time: 6895.58
End time: 6920.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know the legal system doesn't work this way,  but it would be nice if you could say, Google,  tell us how many searches for this happened from a dyna  on this day.  And if it turned out to be one, then a judge could say,  all right, that's a pretty good likelihood  that that's your guy.  Hand over the information for that one search.  If it's 50 who searched, then you've got a different matter.  But just this wide net of like, just give us all the data  and we'll work it.  We want everybody who searched.  Yeah, everybody.
