Transcript:  We can tech is provided by AOL radio at AOL.com slash podcasting.  This is Twit This Week in Tech episode 101 for June 18th, 2007.  Moon over Google.  This Week in Tech is brought to you by Audible.com for your free audio book.  Visit Audible.com slash Twit.  Welcome to Twit 101.  I feel like it feels like the Twit 101.  It's the second class for those of you who took Twit 100.  The Twit School.  The Twit School, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to have a good time today.  It's a Steve Gibson suggested he was up in Vancouver this week and he suggested  that we get the old the new Twit crew together, folks who host other shows on  Twit.  So we'll start off with you, Steve, Steve Gibson from Security Now.  Hi, Steve.  Hey, Leo.  And we'll have some good security stories for you, actually.  Some really interesting security stories from this week in law.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Well, we'll talk about it in a sec.  There's identity theft.  There's safari security holes.  There's a lot of good security news.  Denise Howell is here from this week in law.  So good to have you on, Denise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Great to be here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Finally have somebody who actually knows something about law on the show instead  of those of us who fake it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A particle here and there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And there's some privacy stories that are actually very interesting.  We also welcome Merlin Mann from Mac Break Weekly.  Hello, Merlin.  Hello, Leo.  Always good to have you on.  And we were going to have Paul Thurotte.  He's out of town from Windows Weekly.  So filling in for Paul Thurotte, Will Harris.  Hello.  So just pretend you're a grumpy middle-aged white guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love Max.  No, wait, I hate Max.  No, I love Max.  No, wait, I hate Max.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Poor Paul.  You know, I think he's very honest, but he, but he gets hated by both sides  because sometimes he'll say something nice about Mac and all the Windows people hate  him and then every once in a while he says something bad and John Gruber will slam him  about Mac.  So it's just, he can't win.  But I figure if you're widely hated by just about everybody that like Devorak, you  must be a star.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, then it'll help that I'm British.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  Well, now that you're getting rid of Tony Blair, we have nothing to hate you for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway, I think that the key with Paul probably is that people care what he thinks.  And that's the dilemma he's in is that it matters what he says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, and there are worse dilemmas.  You could, it could matter not what you said.  Yeah, exactly.  We've, we've been talking before the show a little bit about Facebook because, well,  I guess Will, you and I are the Facebook.  Well, Merlin, you use Facebook too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just started about a week and a half ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I've become a Facebook whore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought you were picky.  Aren't you picky about your, about your.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, this is the first social network I've ever used where I am in fact not adding  anybody who asks, but only adding people that I actually know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm being extremely promiscuous.  That's what I found out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was all excited that you, that you were my buddy and now I find out you're  promiscuous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I'm going to put you in my super top like three or four super secret group.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That might matter not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Leo, I have to, I have to say that you're pretty fickle though.  Cause once again, I was standing with you in Vancouver when you first discovered  Facebook all of five days ago.  Yeah.  And now you've, you're completely converted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now I'm, well, I'll tell you why I'm interested in, and we're actually going to  get to a news story on this.  Cause there's a, a, Denise has raised an interesting issue.  Uh-oh.  Is Nemo over?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they found Nemo.  They found Nemo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm going to mute and go off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We won't start the story without you.  You won't miss much, Denise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's father's day, but Denise's husband is in the Bahamas that I guess that was  his father's day gift.  So she's on childcare duty today.  Um, but no, uh, uh, Facebook, um, it started adding applications about a month ago.  And that's really what kind of finally attracted me.  And for the first time I'm using a social network as it's supposed to be used,  not adding everybody, but rejecting people.  So were you watching me?  Yeah, you were going through, you, you, you had like, I don't know, thousands of  people, literally infinite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's infinite.  And, and, you know, and you were asking people in the studio, okay, now what's  the deal with Facebook?  Why is this better or different than my space?  Blah, blah, blah.  I mean, you were, you know, you were, I watched you like really get into it and  then how you've announced you've become a whore.  Well, at least for now, we'll see that may, that may change, but it's interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  to actually use a social network as, as a space for people to connect with.  I mean, I think we need to actually use a social network as, as it's supposed to  be used with people I know and, and have worked with.  It's kind of fun.  And that, you know, and the reason I'm keeping it private is because there's  private information on there and my cell phone numbers on there.  Now I'm asking him to hack me.  Aren't I Steve?  What?  Things like that, because I want my closest friends to know that so they  could say, Hey, I'm in town or I'll come over or you wanted to have dinner or

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  whatever.  You know, it's funny though, Leo, I, I've been, I've just wrote recently about  how like a lot of people I've been having a terrible time keeping up with email,  on public accounts.  And I kind of like the lightweight nature of the, Hey, how's it going?  Sort of a connection on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I agree.  I think that's the appeal of Twitter.  Jaiku Facebook is there quick ways to stay in touch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right.  And we know the, the nice new feature now on Twitter or I'm sure Jaiku has this  as well, but they have now whenever somebody says at your name to respond to  something, you can now go in and see all the people who've replied to something  that you've written, which makes it a lot easier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was used ad hoc before you would, you know, kind of informally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now you click on that username and it'll actually push you to see the response.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The nice thing about Jaiku, and I know we'll never get you to use Jaiku, so I'm  not, I'm not trying to get you to use it.  You're good friends with everything, but it's not about that.  Oh yes, it is.  It's, it's loyalty Merlin and you're all about loyalty.  But the nice thing about Jaiku is, uh, they have comment threads on every post.  So instead of replying in a separate post, you comment on that and then people  comment on the comments.  In a way, it's almost more like a kind of ad hoc forum for you, Leo, for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I will look at it this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You might like it.  It also allows you to put all of your content.  And then we're getting into the conversation about Jaiku, which we've had  before, but it allows you to put all of your content, uh, RSS feed content on  the presence as well.  So it kind of keeps people up to date with everything you're doing.  By the way, I should mention, we are streaming this via a stick them as well.  So that we're also visible on the internet during a taping of this.  Normally this isn't a live show.  So I'll watch it.  Actually, Shuby, you're going to watch the, uh, the, uh, chat.  Uh, if anybody says anything of interest in chat, Shuby, will you just chime in on  that? I've got America's favorite, uh, high school sophomore, sorry, junior here  with me today, helping me out.  Go ahead, Denise.  You're going to say something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was going to say, doesn't it just drive you nuts every time you have to set up a  new profile in one of these things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So that's where we were talking about open ID on security.  Now that's where open ID really could save us a lot.  Right.  Just one ID.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you guys know, uh, Mark Cantor?  And have you looked at his people aggregator application at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I do know Mark and I haven't, I haven't heard of this.  What is he doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, he does one of these, uh, networks for building social networks kind of  thing where you can, you know, my space in a box, I guess is an easy way to say  it that makes sense to a lot of people.  Uh, but the cool thing about it is if you, uh, go and try and sign up and you  already have accounts, uh, and identity information or profile information with  companies that have open APIs like Flickr, he can just, or their application  can just suck that information in.  So you just say, you know, sign in, sign in with my Flickr account and it imports  everything you've already put elsewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It supports open ID, I see.  And skip as well.  So that's neat.  Yeah.  Um, yeah, Mark is great.  Mark's Mark was the guy who really started in a way, started Macromedia.  He did the first, uh, what was it?  Comic book creator?  What was the name of the program?  I can't remember.  Animated program.  And, uh, and as a great guy, he's been around for a long  time.  He's on my Facebook.  He's one of my Facebook friends.  He's a friend.  Yep.  But you know, there's also Ning and ING, which is the same idea.  It's a social, uh, social site builder.  And I've been thinking about using Ning for something.  I don't know the radio show or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  According to Mark Andreasson's blog, uh, Ning now has a way to, I'll probably  mangle this, but Ning has a way now to kind of insert content into Facebook.  They've added something new.  Oh, see this is where social network within a social network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is where it gets very interesting is these open APIs and the integration  of all of this stuff.  And that's to me, that's what made, that's what put Facebook over the top for me  until it had this, and it's not completely open because you have to be an approved  application, which I guess they did in response to MySpace, which is out of control.  So, uh, let's get to the stories.  Uh, of course, the, uh, the week began with Steve Jobs, say nothing, do nothing  keynote at the worldwide developers conference.  Uh, he disappointed developers by not announcing third party application support  on the iPhone by saying, no, no, you can just do it all in Safari.  Uh, he did show some leopard.  The biggest surprise though was he announced that Safari would be available on  windows and we talked about this Merlin on Mac break weekly a little bit.  John Gruber had an interesting insight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, he did.  Uh, John had mentioned that, uh, what, what he's hearing is that they're apart  from all of the, what he's calling excellent secondary reasons for putting  Safari out.  One primary reason might be that there's a lot of revenue associated, uh, with  doing search in that little bar up there.  So, you know, even getting a glancing blow in terms of windows uptake could  mean significant income for Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Mozilla has never admitted how much they make, uh, off of the fire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to estimate metric, but loads,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  wild metric guests.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you know, I can really understand Apple's decision to want to keep the,  the iPhone closed from a standpoint of stability.  If you really start having not well executed apps that are installed and,  and have an equal share of, of, of screen space and time, and they end up  destabilizing the phone, people are going to be really unhappy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, I mean, at least, but every phone, I mean, look at the trio, every other  phone supports that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but look at it this way.  They, they don't want it to be a phone like user experience.  They want it to be an iPod like user experience.  You pick up your iPod, any that's the same every time and you click the button  and it works and that's exactly what they want the iPhone to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have you guys been seeing the ads that they're running now all the time?  I mean, it is just the sexiest looking thing and the sexiest UI.  It's just beautiful looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They just saw a recent survey that said two out of three Americans knew about  the iPhone, knew when it was coming.  And, uh, that doesn't mean they're going to buy it, but that's a huge awareness  ratio. I mean, a two out of three is amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does it have a gravity sensor?  So it knows when you turn it from.  From upright to portrait.  Oh, that's just beautiful.  I mean, that's, that's, you know, typical Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have to say though, those ads are highly misleading.  They edit out all the time it takes to do any of that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly.  Well, and as you know, Leo, that's my problem with it is, is it's on a, it's  on the slower network.  I moved from the singular slash AT&T network, the GPRS over to Verizon  specifically because the maximum digital link, you know, the, the, the, the so  called broadband you can get over on a GSM network is 135 K and you can get  700 over on Sprinter Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We, uh, uh, the Safari, by the way, yeah, and they don't support HSDPA, which is  available on AT&T in many markets.  And that would be, that's very fast.  That would be very nice.  But one of the stories that you might be interested in talking about a little bit,  Steve is, of course they announced Safari for Windows and within one day, actually  within two hours, a number of security experts said, oh, well, here's a security  flaw. Here's a security.  I think the total count at the last was over a hundred.  Now the Microsoft, I mean, Appy update 3.01.  I don't know how many of these is fixed, but does this mean that when Apple  enters the windows world, they've, they've, you know, they've got the same  problems windows has?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I haven't taken a look at it closely enough to see whether it was a  consequence of them using any of the, the foundation stuff in windows or whether,  you know, their own stuff in that environment was having problems, but you  have to, you have to imagine that if they brought all of their code for Safari  out of, out of the Mac and into windows, that, I mean, that just recompiling the  existing code for the windows platform wouldn't introduce this level of new  instability. So it must be that they, that they were relying on some things,  maybe they didn't understand as well or there or weren't as mature over on the  windows side. So, I mean, it's, I mean, that strikes me as a, as a substantial  drop in security, unless it was as a consequence of much heightened scrutiny.  For example, there are lots of tools for testing and finding exploits over on  windows that are more mature than the similar platform over on the Mac.  So it may just be that, you know, that in fact,  that's what I'm thinking. I'm thinking that as soon as you move to the windows

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  platform, you're suddenly exposed to all these hackers who have all these  sophisticated tools are going to find it. Here's what they, here's the initial,  the patch fixes a command injection vulnerability that may lead to arbitrary  code execution and out of bounds memory reissue that may lead to an unexpected  application termination or arbitrary code execution, a race condition that may  allow cross site scripting. I mean, that sounds like, you know, the traditional  windows flaws.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And I have to wonder though, whether if in fact this, these things also  exist over on the Mac side, then the Mac version of safari ends up gaining from  it's, from, from it's, you know, sticking its foot in the water over on windows  and having all the windows people say, look at all the things that are wrong,  because potentially Apple can fix that once and, and, you know, on the, on the  common safari and win in both platforms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's interesting. We'll see my suspicions. Now remember that this is based,  the browser itself is based on the K browser in Linux.  So it's very possible that there is some sort of code being sucked in that Apple  didn't know about, but I think it's much more likely that these tools are just,  you know, more sophisticated and hackers are more active on windows side and they  found, and there was a little challenge really in a way. Okay. Here's, here's,  the vaunted secure Apple browser have added, and it took them two hours to find  flaws.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  At what layer or what level does that kind of security stuff come up? I mean,  where, where, where, you know what I mean? So in other words, you're building it on  top of, of this other, of the K browser, as you say, but where, where, where's  that actually happening? Where is that insecurity?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you know, conqueror is, is probably not the problem so much. I mean, that's  an engine. It's like Gecko, the engine used in Firefox. I'm sure Apple has written  a safari layer, you know, a windows interface layer on top of it. So,  Apple would be responsible for the UI. Does it, do you know Steve?  I guess it is the engine if it's something like a overflow in a URL or  something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and, and, and those things that you just enumerated, Leo,  those are all very common sounding problems that we've seen over on the  windows, you know, like, like race conditions in, in, in JavaScript handling.  So, you know, it may well be that, that they've, that, that, that existing  problems that were not found over on the Mac have been found by moving it to the  windows platform and allowing people to attack it there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, any, we talked about WWDC to great length on this Mac break weekly this  weekend, also this weekend media talked about it. So I'm not sure we need to  talk much more about it, but anybody else have anything they want to say about,  say, leopard or safari or any of the Apple announcements?  Uh, going once, going twice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just want the new I life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah, they didn't even mention a new I life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We forgot to say anything about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And also the other downside was that I think a lot of people were  hoping that they do something with dot Mac this time.  Well, the only thing they are adding in leopard is, uh, this back to my Mac,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  which uses dot Mac. They at least are adding some functionality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's well worth my hundred dollars a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Have you guys been seeing all the stories though?  That it's just at the rumor phase now that Apple and Google are going to do  something on along those lines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that started when Steve invited Eric Schmidt on to on stage with him in  January at Mac world expo. And they virtually said, we're going to do stuff  together. I don't know. You know, the Google map application they're bundling  is the same one that's on my Blackberry. I don't think it's any different.  So I'm not sure what they mean by that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they were also Steve jobs was quoted an interview the other week is saying  that he knows that like dot Mac is not what it should be in that something is  coming, but didn't reveal what.  So that's your speculation is that it could be like a Google gears enabled  version. Like you could get Google writer and stuff. Well, to me,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  if you're going to be amazing,  if you're going to base stuff on Safari and you add Google gear capability to  Safari, then you have this offline capability,  which is what Google gears ads it allows at least for now.  It works with the Google news reader,  but presumably will work with the other Google apps to let you use them offline  and automatically sync when you get back online.  That's the kind of thing the iPhone needs if it's going to base its third  party apps on Safari.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I also, I wouldn't be surprised at all to see, well,  basically the implication of what you're saying, which is that seeing OS 10  wrappers for applications, there's already one out, I think,  independent of Google, there's already,  I think it's called mail plane that will let you use Gmail as a Mac app.  And that wouldn't surprise me at all. And to see that happening.  And as you say, to see the gears coming for everything,  because that changes the game completely. If you can take, you know, beyond your,  I guess the reader now you can use with Google gears,  but taking your mail and your documents work on a plane. I mean, that's,  to me that changes the game completely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And in an iPhone, that'd be spectacular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Steve, Steve Gilmore did an awesome post on this called the iPhoneomics on  his blog that talked about how you're going to need some kind of offline  capability to make your iPhone and all your rich media that it can play  work just in light of its battery issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, there you have it. I mean, that would do it. Google gears. All right.  We've got it. We figured it out. That's the, that's the announcement.  We broke the code. So the other shoe drops with Microsoft's announcement,  if you know, I'm actually great to get you on to these,  to talk about this a little bit. Microsoft, of course, a couple of weeks ago,  and as we've talked about ad ad nauseam announced that, oh,  there's 243 patent violations in open source software.  And we're not going to tell you what they are. You get to guess. Clearly,  it was FUD, Brad Smith, Microsoft's chief counsel,  must've known what he was saying in that interview with fortune. And I don't,  have you guys talked about it on this week in law?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, we haven't. And, and patent is not really my forte. And you know,  when that's the case, and this is such an interesting issue,  I do know people who are really skilled in that area.  And we should probably do a show around that with someone like Dennis Crouch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or even Moglen, who was just fantastic on, he's amazing.  We interviewed him on floss. I have to say it looked like,  and Steve, you and I have talked about this. In fact,  we did a segment on the lab about this. It looked like app,  Microsoft merely trying to spread some FUD, some,  some fear among Linux,  not only Linux distributors and open source software authors,  but among their end users, cause they would be liable as well. And I imagine the,  I thought at the time the idea is, you know,  if they can just convince a few major CIOs and fortune 500 companies that Linux  is a bad idea, that their job here is done. Well,  Lynspyre has now made a deal. The second following on Novell's SUSE deal,  to collaborate and probably indemnify Lynspyre users against Microsoft.  They're actually starting to win over Linux distros.  Microsoft, Lynspyre is also licensed to a Windows media codex,  which makes a lot of sense since they're trying to pose them,  position themselves as a Windows alternative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. So they partner up with Microsoft and they're able to give their users  some assurance, but there's no,  no telling whether there's any legal basis for any of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're indemnifying against something that doesn't, that isn't really a threat.  Right. Mark Shuttleworth,  there was a rumor that Ubuntu might be in discussions with Microsoft.  Mark Shuttleworth said, for the record, this is in his blog.  Let me state my position.  I think this is also roughly the position of Canonical, the Ubuntu folks,  and the Ubuntu community council,  though I haven't caucused with the CC on this specifically, he says this in bold,  emphasis marks, we have declined,  declined to discuss any agreement with Microsoft under the threat of unspecified  patent infringements. They're not talking to Microsoft. He says,  allegations of quote infringement of unspecified patents and quote,  carry no weight whatsoever.  We don't think they have any legal merit and they're no incentive for us to work  with Microsoft. He's in effect,  chastising Novell and Linspire for doing a deal with Microsoft.  Right. Zandro's doing the same thing. I understand. I mean, this is, you know,  the Linux world is now lining up and it, in a way you,  you almost feel like Novell and Linspire are,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  hello,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  are kind of the, the, the, the collaborators, they're kind of,  like the French who worked with the Nazis, they're going over to the other side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I really do think that this backfired on Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Maybe not though, Steve, I know you think that, but look at this. You've got,  now you've got Linspire and SUSE are giving it some credibility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Except that if,  if Microsoft ever does enumerate these patents and it,  and the fact that they're,  they haven't done so continues to annoy people and sort of stand out as a glaring  lack of forthrightness from them.  If they ever do enumerate these patents,  the patents will be engineered around or challenged.  And so they can't enumerate them.  It's just very likely that Microsoft could not substantiate this claim.  So it's literally, it's, it's, I mean, there's no,  I can't imagine a better example of FUD factor than what Microsoft is doing.  And sure, they're big. No one wants to get into a legal battle with them,  but it also really upsets the industry that, you know,  the major players in the industry that Microsoft is doing this. I just don't,  I don't see how this is, you know,  a warm fuzzy thing for Microsoft to be doing,  even though they've got some companies that say, well, you know,  if you don't make it too expensive for us, we'd be happy to enter into a deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I have to say, I mean, if, if they continue with this thread,  there's a lot of people,  and I include myself in this who would pretty much write Microsoft off. I mean,  that'd be it. I'd have to say, no, I'm not going to use any more Microsoft  applications. I'm getting rid of windows. I'll stop covering it there.  That's suicide. I'll stop covering it on my TV and radio shows. Cause I, you know,  I just don't want to give them any credence at all.  These guys deserve to go down if they're going to do that kind of thing.  That talk about anti-competitive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we've talked a lot about, I mean,  the whole industry knows that that many patents are being issued now that are  bogus. And unfortunately,  the patent office gives the patent holder then this quasi legal right to go  rattling sabers. And,  and the problem is that that anyone who wants to challenge the patent has to do  so. It's very expensive to do so. If the patent didn't exist in the first place,  all that money being spent on attorneys would be saved and things would be  clearer.  So the fact that the patent office is issuing patents that they probably should  not really creates a problem for the industry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Apparently LG signed a deal with Microsoft.  LG is not known as a Linux distributor,  but they use Linux in some of their consumer hardware. So,  man, you know what? Maybe Microsoft knew what it was doing. Look,  they've got three big players at the table anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Patent law is pretty interesting in that too.  It doesn't require you to have notice that something is patented.  You know,  if you go out and you invent the same thing in the same way,  you can still be prevented from using it simply because,  you know, someone got there first. So even,  even though all the people that contribute to Linux have to represent and warrant  everything that they contribute is their own individual,  unique, not stolen from anywhere creation.  That doesn't really prevent Microsoft from doing any of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You have done some stuff on patent law and this week in law,  but I can't wait to hear an episode on this subject because I,  I don't think many of us understand the legalities involved in all of this.  And I would love to get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And actually a very small percentage of attorneys actually do because it's  such a specialized area of the law. And there's a lot happening there right now.  There's a whole movement to reform and a pending statute whereby the U S patent  laws will be reformed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's hope so. This is a perfect example of what's wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, in fact, yes,  there were just recently some higher court rulings that, that,  that toughened up the law in some ways that are, that are significant too,  which I think that's right. The Supreme court kind of said it. Yeah, that,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  actually let's leave this for Twill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or we could just get my son back in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  With Denise and listening, I'm not going to say a word.  I don't want to sound like an idiot. Speaking of idiots. No, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a terrible thing to say. There's a new editor at Valley wag.  Does anybody know Owen Thomas? He's a, an editor of business 2.0.  He's a new Valley wag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, I didn't realize I knew him. I met him at a party the other night. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Seemed like a nice guy. Yeah. Yeah. I love Nick Douglas.  I thought Nick was a hoot and I thought he made Valley wag just this most  scurrilous, wonderful piece of trash ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll see. There's a, there's a pull quote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We'll see. We'll see what, what Owen can do. He's going to take over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo, I'm curious. Do you like the, uh,  do you like the more businessy kind of behind the scenes stuff?  Or do you like the straight up like Jack?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what Nick Denton's been doing with it kind of. It's been, yeah.  Nick Denton's been making it a business, you know, kind of business gossip sheet.  And I don't think anybody wants that. We want to know who's Sergey Brant,  Sergey's going out with and, and, and, and, you know, that kind of thing.  That's what we want to know. Who's sleeping with whom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, they put the numbers up and since Denton took it over and made it more  businessy, the traffic had gone up. Oh, shut up. So,  so maybe, so I don't know.  You're just a gossip queen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They need, they need the princess die story of Silicon Valley and then they'll  see their numbers go up. Yeah.  The problem is there's not enough sh***** going on. That's the problem.  And kids don't run and ask your parents what sh***** is or they won't let you  listen to twit anymore. So Michael Moore,  who is of course a very controversial director and who,  at one point said, you know, he was,  he's been very outspoken that go ahead, steal my film,  got his film stolen. Sicko, which is his newest film,  is widely available on BitTorrent according to advertising age.  And I haven't tried downloading it, but,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm reliably informed that there is a high quality version on Usenet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I don't know how you would know that, but so how high quality is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Reliable informants, something by 320. It's okay. All right.  So it's not HD yet. Yeah, but it's, it's out there two weeks before,  which is really interesting. I mean, that's, it's, it's one thing when you get,  you know, indie rock bands, you know,  and somebody in the studio slides something into the, you know, uh,  into the stream. Yeah. But it's, that's kind of,  I think that's kind of unusual for, you know, big time movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think Michael walked into it. I mean,  remember that Fahrenheit 911 was shared not before the movie came out,  but after the movie came out and Michael Moore at the time said, I don't,  he said, share away. I don't agree with copyright laws.  I don't have a problem with people downloading the movie and sharing it as long  as they're not trying to make a profit off my labor.  I make these movies and books and TV shows because I want things to change.  And the more people who get to see them, the better. That's great.  But this is before the movie even hits theaters. Yeah. I wonder how,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  what is it Harvey Weinstein? I wonder how he feels about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It certainly does create buzz though. I mean, apparently by all,  by all reports, it's a really interesting, really substantial movie,  maybe a little more so than the things he's done before. It had,  it got some really live fun. Yeah, he's barely in it for one thing. Yeah.  It's got a lot of bipartisan support too. He said that he had, you know,  Republicans who he's normally not attracting, uh, coming up saying, wow,  fantastic. I'm so glad you made this movie. So, I mean,  I can see that all it would do is drive people who are not as  wired as, as this group, you know, out to the theaters to see it.  Well, exactly. I think it would create buzz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'd go out on a limb here and I'd say that no,  nobody's ever lost money because a movie is available on BitTorrent. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Only this reminds me a little of those stories that you hear about, you know,  the marketing department of a television program uploading to YouTube at the same  time, the lawyers are writing the demand letters that come down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what they say about the daily show, right? In particular. Hell yeah.  It's good. How could anybody?  The producers are uploading it and the lawyers are taking it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How could anybody think, first of all, nobody watches the whole daily show on  YouTube. You don't, you can't, you don't want to. You see a clip, you go,  that's a great show. That's funny. Uh, it's good for the daily show.  And we've said this before. It's obvious. Do the lawyers have to do this,  Denise, do they have to do it, uh,  just because they have to protect the intellectual property? Is it,  is their heart not in it or do they really mean what they say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean with copyright situations, there,  there is the potential to have an implied license spring up.  You know, if Michael Moore had all the rights to his movies,  and I really don't know, you know, how his production system works,  but if he does, and he goes around making statements like that, um,  it could have some legal ramification.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's giving a license, you're saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, it's certainly not an express one and it would be difficult to  prove up and show. But you know, if he is the,  if the buck stops with him as far as who owns the copyrights, then yeah,  that can have a legal impact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Very interesting. Also, I mean, isn't he, I don't know,  I don't know if it's other people that have said this or just him,  but I feel like I've heard him saying, you know, I've, I've got money, you know,  he's, he's, he's made a lot of dough.  And he's basically saying that at this point it's more about getting a message  about, which, which puts him in a really, that's kind of disruptive economically.  If you're, if you're out there raising the money for this stuff,  you'll probably recoup a lot of your budget. I mean, he's gonna,  the movie's going to be successful probably in the sense of making a lot of

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  money. And all of this just helps it. It doesn't hurt it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It seems like it. Yeah. I mean, I,  the way that this stuff has matured now to the point where, I mean,  I know a lot of people who do things like they have an RSS feed of stuff like  this. It's virtually like having a TV subscription for TV shows and music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And you know, Hey, I ordered a hard,  I ordered a hard drive from my Apple TV.  Franklin Harris showed us how to hack it on the TV show. I am going to put,  not only am I going to put a bigger hard drive in,  but I can't wait to put the there's a, there are plugins for YouTube.  So you can watch the most recent YouTube videos, the most popular.  There are plugins for BitTorrent.  I'm going to turn my Apple TV into the ultimate. I use it all the time now.  I use mine all the time too. Awesome. I do it a lot by hand.  I buy whatever I can on iTunes. And then if, if I can't buy it,  I sometimes will download it from various sources and I'll convert it using  visual hub. And that's, it takes a, it's a little bit of a process,  but it's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And just think about like, you know, all these people, you know, I mean,  I guess I probably shouldn't even say this, but I mean,  I'm going to download sicko and put it on.  It's my preferred way to watch DVDs too, especially for episodic TV.  I'll buy the DVD. I'll actually go out and purchase the DVD.  And that's how I'd rather watch it. And then what does that mean?  It means also that you can start having your own library of this stuff that you  have actually paid for and you don't need to go take up, you know,  shelf space for all your stupid DVDs. I mean, it's just, it's just nonsense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's why I want to get QI. And this is,  this is my perfect example because the BBC spends a lot of time saying, Oh,  you're going to make it possible to watch this stuff streaming and stuff.  But the only way to get Stephen Fry's show QI legally is to buy a  region two encoded DVD that I can't play back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Try Dr. Who. I mean, everybody in the UK is flipping out over Dr. Who. And,  you know, why not capitalize on that butt by putting, yeah, anyway.  You just encourage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, of course the flip side is that, you know,  over here Apple TV is absolutely useless because there's no TV that you can buy  from the iTunes music store. So like, we want all your stuff,  but we can't buy it and you want our stuff and you can't buy it.  And it's like, I thought we were living in global economy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's go to our British Bureau right now for word on the Sony problem with the  church of England. Will Harris reports.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So what the Manchester cathedral is featured.  That was a great song by the Manchester cathedral.  La da de da da. It was feet. No, that's, I'm just joking.  It was featured in resistance fall of man on the PlayStation three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On the PS3, right? So the bad news is, so of course, obviously, you know,  fall of man is a big kind of like sci-fi game and it's aliens invading us stuff,  lots of gun toting,  but Manchester itself actually has a pretty bad gun problem.  Oh, it's a gun control.  So there's more to this than meets the eye here.  And so the various church officials in Manchester were criticizing Sony saying  that it was very insensitive of them to set a gun toting epic in Manchester  cathedral when it was, um, a,  they hadn't asked permission and B was a, uh, uh,  sort of social hotspot.  Well, I think we had the same thing happen here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The mall owners of America were complaining about a dead rising saying,  you know, what are you having?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And then of course Tony Blair jumps in and says, well, you know,  certainly we're a bit irresponsible about this and blah, blah, blah.  Uh, it's just kind of crazy because it's like, well, you know,  you're talking about fighting off alien invaders in the streets.  Now here's the question. It's not, it's not really the same thing, is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is Manchester cathedral kind of, it's sitting there on the street.  Are can you, could you copyright images of Manchester cathedral as a church of  England? Isn't that kind of just, it's out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think you could actually.  I think they're unhappy, but there's no legal grounds for them doing anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So this, this brings us to Google street view, which,  Patrick Norton, by the way, is featured in a, you know,  this is the new feature on Google.  If you go to maps.google.com and you click on an urban area, uh,  new button that says as a street view, I think it says street view, uh,  a little yellow guy will appear.  You position the guy and then click on them and you'll get a picture of that  street at street level.  Yeah. It's very cool. I really like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If anyone wants to get sort of the quick overview of,  of all the cool stuff that you can see with street view,  there's a great blog called street viewer with no E before the R in great,  2.0 tradition. Yes. Uh, which, which is aggregating, you know,  all the outrageous things you can see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Uh, I've seen a few, you know, there's a guy coming out of a strip club,  a guy going into an adult bookstore, you know,  Patrick Norton jaywalking is one. If you, if you, if you, if you go,  isn't that funny if you go to a right in front of the ZD building in downtown,  uh, San Francisco, I think it's on first or second street, you'll, it's,  it's clearly Patrick from the back. And, uh, I said, Patrick, what did you,  did you know the Google truck was there? He said, well, yeah,  I saw this weird truck driving down the street.  I didn't know they were taking pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that's how they're doing it with trucks, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. It's the same thing Yahoo did with a,  Yahoo did this first where they'd have a picture of the storefront.  So if you were looking it up in a Yahoo listing,  you could see a picture of the storefront. I really liked that feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought that was pretty cool. It's cool.  You're going somewhere and you know,  especially in San Francisco where you go somewhere and there's lots of little  stores jammed up together. This will show you like exactly where it was.  They took that down, didn't they? They stopped doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did they? Oh, cause now Google's there big time.  There's a I'm at street viewer.com and the very first one is the Google van  getting pulled over. They got the CHP behind them.  What are you guys doing? Taking pictures. So Denise,  do they have any obligation to set kind of say, Hey, we're taking pictures.  Or is it just, you know, enough to drive down the street?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When you're out in a public place,  the privacy laws all try and sort of coalesce around this concept of  reasonableness.  And if you have any sort of reasonable expectation that, you know,  the world can see you or a good deal of the world can see you,  then, you know, I think Google's in the clear where,  where it gets a bit more gray is when you use the zoom feature  and you can get into the detail in those shots. You know,  there was a woman who was featured on Boing Boing and then a couple of days  later in the New York times who, you know,  you could see in her living room window and see her cat on it in the window.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now that raises an issue cause that's, I mean, is that publicly viewable?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, she's got her drapes open and you know, I mean, there's,  there's definitely a point at which the law would say,  okay, you've gone too far, but you know,  looking through an open window probably is,  but I mean, so,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so somebody on the street with a telephoto lens standing in front of your  window shooting into your house, that's, that would be legal too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, because you wouldn't have an expectation that, you know,  a telephoto lens coming into your house is happening. So maybe that is where,  where it starts to get interesting is the zoom feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So there are pictures of people urinating in public.  I'm looking at a guy playing with himself, but he's doing it in public, right?  On Guerrero street. He's just hanging out on Guerrero street. You see it. Yeah.  I guess that happens a lot. Doesn't it Merlin? It does. It does. We have,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  we really believe in a genital comfort.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It could be, it's, you know, it could be a scratch, not a pic. We're not,  we're not sure really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Talk to tell from that angle, Leah, we're going to need to watch it on the replay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean,  you guys remember when camera phones first came around and people started  sneaking them into the gym and taking pictures in locker rooms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The first time I appeared in the New York times was cause I took a photo of this  dude totally taking a leak in the park by my house,  like in front of like a bunch of kids. Good. And no, I mean, I, you know,  now of course, embarrassing, humiliating,  shaming has become the official purpose of the internet, which I kind of loath.  But I was like, you know, there's just,  there's a whole bunch of little kids here and this guy's just whipping it out in  front of the library. And yeah, it ended up being in the New York times.  And now it's like everywhere you go, you go into gyms,  into gyms and you go into offices and there's all of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I'll tell you next time I go to the lussey lady,  I'm going to look for a van. I'll be, I'll be honest with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Wear your hat and glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, Patrick's for the first guy I know that's been caught on this,  but you know, it's pretty new. I think we're going to find more. I'm amazed.  There's 383 different things on street viewer. So there's one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wish I had the Earl for this, but a guy who works at EFF,  it can be seen smoking a butt. Oh dear. You're kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  CNET did a great story on that. I forget his name too. He's one of their lawyers.  Oh dear. That's not good. It's like the second time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like the second time that he's been nabbed by some kind of, uh,  public graphical photo dragnet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He must spend a lot of time out there. If that's the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have to imagine too,  that after people recognize what the Google van looks like,  they're going to be going out of their way to get into these photos.  And you can see them staging this. Oh, I didn't even think of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're absolutely right. I'd immediately disrobe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or whatever. Yeah. Get a lollipop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wouldn't you want to be tempted to moon them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Google staged a couple of themselves on that street viewer blog.  There were a couple of pictures of, you know,  when you zoom in on the Google campus there, there's the team from street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's funny. Yep. Perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So we were talking about Facebook early on Facebook isn't a little bit of a  copyright dilemma. There's some of these applications on the open platform.  Well, at least one, uh, involve copyright violations. That right?  It's a, is it called rock you? Is that the one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not. Oh, well let's see. Or is it audio? I don't know. I don't,  audio is the one that I've read about. Yeah.  I'm not sure what rock you does.  And as I was saying before we started recording, I'm not on Facebook yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I will go and I will take one. I will take a bullet for the team.  Would you please pirate some music on your Facebook profile?  If I can steal music with this,  I know you guys are talking. What's it called? It's called audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's audio application. So that's a very generic name,  but allows you to embed music on your now on my space.  You've been able to embed music for a long time. I mean, that's not,  I don't know how they get around it on my space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. I don't, I don't know either. Um,  and I do think that people have attempted and complained about, you know,  all kinds of copyrighted material on my space, music, video, et cetera. Um,  so this, this though, I found really, really interesting because, you know,  it sort of takes, you guys remember the Grokster case a couple of summers ago,  which, uh, which said that, you know,  if you are intentionally encouraging others to infringe copyright,  then you may be liable for their infringements,  even though you are not infringing yourself. Um,  and this sort of removes it yet another step because Facebook isn't doing  anything, right?  It's just providing a platform and an ability,  an ability for developers to build their own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Opening it up themselves because they're saying we have to approve the  application. So they do have control over what's being posted there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. And what people are,  are sort of looking at scans that concerning this particular application is,  is a recent change in Facebook's terms of service that, uh,  allowed developers to, um, let's see,  where's the language here to offer an index of copyrighted material to  other Facebook users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Interesting thing about, about, so this, just quickly looking at this,  it looks to have basically the same functionality as something like the video  application, which lets you also put in video. But I mean, maybe I'm being naive,  but how is any of this different from anything that gives you a text area and a  submit button? I mean, I could,  I could put the full text of a Steve Stephen King novel in here and,  but nobody seems to mind that it's just, you know,  this is the flavor of the month is worrying about all this stuff. But yeah,  the audio, uh, I'm looking at the, uh,  information page for the audio plugin and this guy's got a little bit of a  screed about, uh,  the music industry and how he feels like he's not pirating with this application.  It's kind of interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, we'll watch. I mean, this stuff is happening so fast. It's,  it must be fun for you, Denise. I mean,  your background is in intellectual property law.  Right. It must be fun for you to watch this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it is. It's like a candy store. The internet for me.  Why there's lawsuits everywhere. In so many ways. Yes. But, uh, yeah,  the fascinating thing I thought about this Facebook thing is just, you know,  I don't think anybody thought that far ahead, um,  to what software and platform makers would actually be doing in a couple of  years, um, that this kind of thing would be possible where, you know,  you're not actually building the application.  You're not actually doing anything. You're simply, you know,  providing users of your social network.  And yet somebody might be saying that's enough if you're, you know,  enabling applications that enable your users to infringe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It just seems to me that it's almost impossible to try to control content in a  digital world. I mean, it once stopped something as bits. You just, I mean,  you may not know exactly where it's coming from, but it's going to hit you.  It's just too easy to move it around. Yeah, it is.  What are you going to do? How are you going to stop that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it gets so interesting too,  with everything starting to move these days away from happening on the client  side, you know, the way that Napster did all the individual computers.  There's no centralized source anymore. Right.  And then it's just out in the cloud. You know,  the DMCA exists to protect people that are providing platforms for other people  to do their computing on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've got a good one for the new editor of Valley Wag. This is,  this is the kind of gossip story that Valley Wag needs to cover.  eBay and Google and a little pissing match.  eBay actually pulled its advertising from Google because Google scheduled a  party on the same evening as eBay's annual merchants conference. Oh,  now talk about, about petty Google.  eBay spends about 25 million bucks a year on Google.  So it's not a small amount of money they're pulling out.  I don't know what the latest is. For some reason I thought I saw,  and I haven't off to check that maybe eBay's back down on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No. So what happened was that it all starts because Google is really  aggressively going after PayPal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Cause that's really where it's really about Google's payments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google checkout, right? And they want to enable that on eBay.  And so far eBay has said,  we're not going to allow Google checkout on eBay.  Right.  And so Google was holding this campaign. Well, exactly.  And Google was holding this party for some of the top eBayers attending this  eBay conference to sort of rally a bit of like, you know,  support and to sort of needle eBay a bit.  eBay just completely overreacted,  clearly felt incredibly threatened by this, you know,  by this approach by Google and just rung up and said, right,  we're canceling all our advertising.  Which then caused Google to have to say, well, all right, well that's, you know,  I saw a report that put eBay spending at a hundred million.  A hundred million. Wow. Yeah. As opposed to 20. I mean,  maybe it's worldwide versus just the US or something. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And this happens all the time. Yep. This happens all the time though,  with advertisers threatened. I mean,  people threaten to pull ads from our show all the time. It's,  of course they got to buy them first. And that's the problem.  I'll never advertise with you guys. He never did.  Please. I beg of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, I mean, I think it, I think that underlines,  just how serious eBay considers Google checkout to be as a threat to its  PayPal business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I keep looking at Google payments in it, cause you know, we take,  donations via PayPal.  It's just so much easier to implement PayPal right now for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Steve, you're a big fan of Google checkout, aren't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. It's funny you did, you mentioned that,  cause I mentioned it on security now when we were talking about open ID and,  and that stuff. And I'm a validated, you know,  address confirmed PayPal user for many years.  But what I like about Google checkout is that it provides much more information  to the, to the, to the, let's see,  I'm the purchaser to the vendor than, than PayPal. So, you know,  I mean everything on the net is about quick immediate gratification.  You know, press the button and, and, and you've already purchased.  And so I like Google checkout because literally I just press the button  and I've purchased it and the vendor gets my,  my shipping address and,  and the money all in one little burst. It's just really simple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think because I'm not a, I'm not selling something.  I think it's a little trickier for me to sign up for it. I, I,  I haven't looked lately. I should look again,  cause there are a lot of people rightly or wrongly who kind of look askance at  PayPal because of its early history and it's the problems that it had in early  days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's still, I mean, I still, I, I love PayPal. I love the idea of PayPal.  And PayPal is one of those things that's like San Francisco's Muni.  Like it works fine so much time. And then when you really need it,  it screws you. And have you ever gotten those things where suddenly for,  for no apparent reason, your account gets frozen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No. In fact, we've been very fortunate. We've used PayPal for two years.  It's been absolutely reliable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It can be really, it's, it's like, it's big. It can be a lot like, you know,  having your card not work, you know, when you're trying to buy it's,  it's really frustrating and there's a lot of hoops to jump through to get fixed.  I had one thing happen where I bought a Wii off this guy, a friend of mine,  and really simple, you know, thing between two friends.  And it turned out there was some, some, some confusion.  I basically had to like send him a different payment, but I canceled one.  And I guess they thought I did another one a little too quickly.  And like both of our accounts, we couldn't do anything. And it was,  and there are all these, it took several days of phone calls to undo it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would imagine that there's a, that PayPal,  because it's been around for so long, has a superset of the people who are using  checkout. I mean, I'd be surprised if somebody was jumping into Google  checkout who, who wasn't already a PayPal subscriber.  So by supporting PayPal, you've got the, pretty much the bases covered anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The interesting thing that where they can leverage this and they are leveraging  this is when you, as you see, whenever you do searches on Google, you can now,  you know, choose to just show people that will let you use Google checkout.  And you get a discount in a lot of cases for using it. So, I mean,  I could see somebody saying that that's kind of unfair competition.  Not that I would agree, but I could see them saying that, you know,  especially when you're buying a hundred million dollars worth of ad revenue or  whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're going to wrap this thing up in a bit, but before I do,  I want to remind folks that we've got, audible has been so great.  They're supporting all of our podcasts now,  and they're doing it in a way that I think is makes,  makes sense for our audience. They're giving away free books, free audio,  audio books. And I think that they realize that podcast listeners are naturals  for audio books. If you've never listened to books on audible,  you're in for a great treat. I, you know,  I became an audible fan when I had a long commute to a tech TV,  two hours a day reading and I miss that reading time. Be honest with you.  I'll get in the car now to drop the hat just so I can listen to it. Remember,  Shuby, I drove you home cause he missed the train and I was glad to,  cause I had a great audio book and I wanted to listen to it on the way home.  So we're going to give you a free book. All you got to do is go to audible.com  slash twit. They know that if you try it, you'll, you'll be happy.  I'm a happy audible customer for years. And every show,  we're going to recommend a new book.  I have a list of several hundred books I've listened to an audible.  This week I'm going to recommend something called Freakonomics.  Anybody ever read Freakonomics? Isn't it great? I just love it.  Steven Levitt is an economist with kind of a different take. He says,  let's look at the numbers. You would, have you read this Steve Gibson?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've not, no, but I've heard the title a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a rationalist approach. He says, look,  let's look at the numbers and see what this really means.  And he comes up with some amazing results. I mean,  which is more dangerous, a gun or a swimming pool?  What do school teachers and sumo wrestlers have in common?  What do drug dealers, why is it that drug,  so many drug dealers still live with their moms?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You learn,  you learn like how ultimately unprofitable it is to be a low level drug dealer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It doesn't work. Exactly. It's fascinating.  And you, but all of this is available through the numbers.  It's a really great audio book and one you'll enjoy.  And normally it's $20. It's absolutely free.  You just go to twit.com, I'm sorry, audible.com slash twit.  By the way, you don't have to get the book that we recommend.  Any book that audible offers you can get,  but I like to give you something that you might want to listen to.  So my pick this week is Freakonomics.  A rogue economist explores the hidden side of everything.  If you just do a search, when you get to audible.com slash twit for Freakonomics,  you click the button, you do need to give them a credit card number,  but they do not charge you and it's absolutely free and there's no obligation.  You don't have to sign up for audible because they know you listen to it.  You're going to love it. And, and,  and I think many of you have become audible, happy audible customers.  We thank audible for their support of all of the, this week in tech shows.  In fact, Denise, you're going to have to look through audible and find some good  law books for people to listen, legal issues to listen to. Cause you're going to have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, hopefully I can give them something more interesting than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I I'm sure you'll find some good stuff. And there's all,  I mean there's the new Robert Ludlum. I mean, there's all sorts of great stuff.  Grisham do all the Grisham. There's great stuff. Do what kind of books do you like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the one I think I'll do first is I'm right now reading Everything is  Miscellaneous by David Weinberger, which is really, really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I love David Weinberger. I didn't know he had a new book though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He is. And if you said you were going to be up at super supernova, maybe he's  doing a book signing the first night on their challenge day for his new book.  And that's what it is called. That's great. He was part of clutrain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He was part of clutrain, wasn't he? That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And he's one of the four coauthors of the clutrain manifesto.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I heard, and this was on audible.  They have the library of Congress series on digital future,  which was a great series of lectures. He did.  He did I think one of the best fascinating lecture was a few years ago,  but he's such a good speaker. He's great. Actually that's,  I think that's free on audible. I'm not sure,  but I think you can listen to that on audible for free. Good.  So you're going to have fun with that, Denise. That's great. Yeah, I sure am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And supernova is coming up.  I'm one of those early audible people that do you remember the little players  they had that looked like you? Did you have one of those? I sure did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, that's great. Oh, well, you're going to be good for these ads. You'll know.  You'll have a lot of books to listen to. That's great.  Denise will be at supernova. You're going to be on a panel. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm moderating a panel that's called will intellectual property kill social  media? Oh wow.  Maybe we should flip that question around and ask whether social media will  kill intellectual property. Much more likely. Yeah. Yeah. No,  it's going to be a fun panel because we've got just a great group of people.  We have Mark Morrill who is general counsel for Viacom in this corner.  And the other corner we have Sahava Levine who is general counsel for YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I'm coming to this one. What is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is nine in the morning on Wednesday the 20th at the supernova challenge day.  I'm going to get up early just to be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, no. And I'm,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm jesting about this in one corner and in the other corner thing too,  because we're going to try and not have it be, you know,  anything like a slug fest between the two of them,  which I don't think either of them is probably anxious to engage in.  We also have Fred von Lohmann from the EFF,  who is awesome if you've never heard him speak. He's so brilliant.  And Mary Hodder who founded Dabble, the wonderful video search tool.  Oh neat.  Yeah. And then another, another lawyer, a person,  guy named Ron Drebben who did just a wonderful YouTube video a while back on  the tour versus Google case.  And finding Nemo episode two is over, I believe.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Supernova.  Sorry, I'm going to have to go find Nemo one more time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thank you so much Denise. Great to, great to, oh, well,  she's going to come back so we won't hang up on her yet,  but supernova isn't Sanford Town.  Supernova is Sanford Town.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Supernova is Sanford Town.  Supernova is Sanford Town.  Supernova is Sanford Town.  Supernova is Sanford Town.  We do it on every weekend.

I'll tell you exactly.  Think this morning I was in San Francisco, ش it sew inch and Michelin 29°.  All the herring you can eat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Leo, I have something which is is non tech.  We sort of drifted a little bit off of tech stuff.  But because this is about something that I think is so near and dear to  everyone's heart, I just wanted to bring it up.  Today, literally this Sunday is the 50th anniversary of the frisbee.  Oh, that's great.  Isn't that neat?  And the inventor, he was he's now 87.  A guy named Fred Morrison invented it sort of as an evolution from flying  pie tins.  And when he came up with this plastic version that is the design we now know,  he he originally named it the Whirl-A-Way,  which he named after a prize winning race horse that won the 1941 Triple Crown.  Right.  And and then but but then there was the crash at at Roswell,  which people were saying, well, was this a flying saucer?  So he renamed it the Pluto platter.  And so literally people were flinging the Pluto platter around for a few years  until it was 50 years ago that the whammo guys, the two founders of whammo,  bought the rights from him.  And they said, we don't like Pluto platter.  Let's call it a frisbee, which he thought was the worst name he had ever heard.  But of course, that is how we all know it for the last 50 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now, I have a little footnote to add to this, because Yale students have for years  contended that the frisbee pie plate from was the first frisbee thrown on the Yale  campus well more than 100 years ago.  And there is a frisbee pie company.  Yes.  In New Haven, Connecticut.  And in fact, I have a picture.  It's on my it's a private picture on my Facebook, but I'll put it up on Flickr of  frisbees, the grave in New Haven, Connecticut of frisbee of the frisbee pie company.  It was spelled with one E.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  F R I S B I E.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do they do they do they admit or does whammo acknowledge that this may be where  the name came from or is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yes. Yes.  That's all part of the official story.  Okay. There were kids who were who were in in in the university who were who used  the frisbee pie company.  That's right.  Pie tins.  And they were throwing those around.  And so it was sort of in deference to that that they came up with the name.  They just sort of like the name frisbee, but they spelled it with two E's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Exactly right.  And I have a picture of it.  I'll put it up on my Flickr of his gravestone so you can honor the 50th  anniversary of the frisbee today.  Steve Gibson is at GRC dot com.

Transcript:  Dot co dot U.K. is how all the hip kids say it.

Transcript:  Yeah. But, you know, I think Americans don't if I say dot co dot U.K.  aren't going to know necessarily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you certainly wouldn't want to say dot co dot U.K.  That co dot U.K.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
