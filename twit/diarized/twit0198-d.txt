Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is Tom Merritt from Buzz Out Loud. He made his way up to the Twit Cottage with his  lovely wife Elaine and it's great to see you both. Thanks for making it up here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, thanks for having me. It's lovely up here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, just a couple of weeks away.  Yay!  Very exciting. And you're going to be on.  Well, me and a lot of other people I gather.  Thanks for joining us.  Yeah, but I mean there's like a ton of folks.  Oh yeah, yeah. We're going to have Scott Johnson. We're going to have Remy. We're going to have listeners.  Remy Martin? I love him.  No, Remy is one of our listeners. We're going to have a ton of folks. It's going to be an extravaganza.  What day is it?  Thursday, June 18th.  Awesome. We're actually doing two shows tomorrow to make sure it's on Thursday.  Why would that? I don't understand.  Because CNET does a regular third Thursday of the week party and we wanted to like siphon off of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You want to get everybody who's in the studio.  Totally.  Also here, you heard her laugh, Denise Howell, the lovely and talented host of our This Week in Law show.  And just a wonderful person in general. She's the author of the Blogger Rhythms column at ZDNet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You always get me confused with Doug Kay. He writes Blogger Rhythms. I write Logger Rhythms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, I'm sorry. Added a B.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And Bag and Baggage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is confusing. And Bag and Baggage. And we're so glad to have you, Denise. It's good to have you on the show.  Great to be here.  I'm sorry I'm saying you're Tom Merritt. I'm working on that right now.  That's alright. She's a much better picture.  I actually, yeah. She's got a good shot there. This is nice. She took a little time off from her Sunday afternoon to be with us.  Also, you saw Maverick, Jason Calacanis.  Hey, how's everybody doing?  From Mahalo.com.  Mahalo.  And we've got one newbie in the bunch, and that's Jeff Kanata from the Totally Rad Show. Hey, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey. It's awesome to be here with all these tech luminaries. I'm in awe. These people that I've been following for so long. It's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff is just back from E3, so I trust you will have many things to say.  Yes.  About E3. You saw The Beatles, for one thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did. That was, and Steven Spielberg, all in the span of ten minutes.  That's kind of amazing.  That's a big day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow. So we'll talk a little bit about E3 and about Microsoft's Natal, and the worst name. Okay, can I say it? The worst name for a project.  I think they're saying Natal, actually.  Yeah, but it's spelled Natal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you hear about the port for POM? The what?  The prenatal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You should have saved that for Buzz Out Loud.  So the POM pre did come out yesterday, and I am holding in my hands, and I'm very happy to say, loving the POM pre.  I mean, we've got to agree it's the last gasp for POM, right?  Can I ask you a question about that, Poppre?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Screw you, Jason Cattacanis!  Who was going to ask it first?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Screw you! Yes, go ahead, Jason, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I have no question about it. It's fucking no...  Who did you talk to in the PR department to get it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, this is... and all right, I think it's fair to ask where I got this, and I'll tell you, a lot of people were not able to get it at the Sprint store or Best Buy.  A lot of them sold out.  Well, then they had like two or three per store, right?  Two or three per Best Buy, and some stores, Sprint stores 25 to 60 or 70, but most of the stores I think sold out on Saturday, and I understand more will come in on Monday, but, you know, it's not an Apple reaction.  They're not the lines, not the press.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There were lines, but they were short lines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  However, I got to say, having played with it, and I think you'll all have a chance to play with it at some point. In fact, here, let me pass it off to you, Tom.  Sure.  This is an elegant device. If the Apple iPhone didn't exist, people would be just raving about this thing. I mean, they'd be going crazy. It's beautiful, the multitasking, the screen, the touch, it's just incredible.  I think the iPhone still beats it because of the range of applications and just the maturity of the platform, but this is a really strong effort from Palm. I'm really impressed. I really like it.  Are you going to get one, Jason? What do you use? Use a BlackBerry or an iPhone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have both. I have both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And, yeah, see, I use the BlackBerry because of the keyboard, but I have to say the pre-keyboard, it's okay. It's very small. I think I'm more accurate with the Apple keyboard because the pre-unaccountably has no type ahead prediction.  It doesn't even do what the BlackBerry does. You know, so like the BlackBerry, when you get to the end of the sentence, the Apple iPhone, too, it puts a period at the end of the sentence when you hit space twice and then starts a news. This doesn't even do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What I want is a phone that has the size of the iPhone screen with the keyboard of the BlackBerry. I don't mind if it's a little taller than a normal phone. When somebody makes that, I think they'll have reached the singularity of phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like the size of this. I like the feel of it in my pocket. I think it's okay for this. It's this small. It's the same resolution as the iPhone, just a smaller screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All I want from a phone is one that I can use from inside my own home.  I think there should be a... When you go shopping for a phone or a phone service, you should be able to take the phone to your house and see if you can make a phone call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you having trouble? Who's your carrier?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have an iPhone, so I'm on AT&T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you can't make a call out of your house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have to walk two blocks to make a telephone call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't make a call from AT&T in my office suddenly. Like within the past four or five months, I have to walk outside my office door into the common area. Then I get a signal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People hate Sprint, but Sprint has a very good data network. It works fine for me.  Verizon, I use for data on the laptop.  Verizon's going to get this phone. We already know.  That's what I'm waiting for.  The only question is how soon. I guess the question to ask is, okay, so Pree's going to get the weekend coverage. What happens Monday?  Does Apple come back and just knock the ball out of the park?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a lot.  With what?  Well, I mean, there's this rumor of the tablet size.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think that's going to happen Monday.  In fact, a number of people have said, and I think maybe they're right, that this is going to be held off to later in June.  This will be the Steve Jobs comeback keynote that won't be at WWDC.  At WWDC, they'll say iPhone 3, they'll say Snow Leopard.  It's a developer conference.  And then they'll save the big hardware announcement for a Steve Jobs keynote later in the month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you think they'll save the iPhone hardware announcement for later?  Maybe.  That's possible. I hadn't thought about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Has Palm put the pressure on them? Does this now mean that they have to come out with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because I think everybody, there'll be an uproar if Apple suddenly goes to their keynote and doesn't announce the new iPhone.  Even the conservative columnist, Kent German at CNET is always like, well, I don't know.  He's like, yeah, there's going to be a hardware announcement.  If they didn't, I think that would just rock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what announcement does Apple have to make to eclipse the Pree?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think they have to do much.  I think they just have to have cut and paste, which we already know is there.  I mean, it's little things like that.  And video and better battery life.  That's enough to make people go, well, I don't want to switch to Sprint.  Pre-battery life, by the way, is awful.  I'll go ahead and go to the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the battery life on that is horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's what's good for, it may be better for Sprint than it is for Palm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you see this? This is the inductive charger. That's so cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to buy that separate, though.  It's very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's got gecko grease on it.  And it sticks to anything.  Almost anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hell!  Never mind.  Good thing it's a review unit.  Screw you, Palm!

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sorry. Just trying that out. Just trying that out for size.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If they do video on the iPhone, is that a hardware update or a software update?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they can do some with a software update, because I have jailbroken iPhones could do all kinds of video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Quick on the iPhone, and it's very low frame rate, though.  Exactly.  So, if you're going to do decent video, they're going to have to do a hardware upgrade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Quick on the iPhone is pathetic.  And it's not Quick's fault, but the camera is terrible.  What is it? One point?  And the bandwidth is terrible. The battery life is terrible, which leads to a terrible experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff, you were going to say something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was just going to say, you really think that if they just come out and announce cut and paste and a few other minor things, that people...  I think there's an expectation for people to be wowed at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's not going to be a wow. It's going to be evolutionary, not revolutionary.  And I think the revolutionary platform at this point is the pre.  The pre could surprise people. If they move fast, they get applications in there.  They already have pushed out a 102 update, which seems to have fixed some of the sluggishness I was experiencing.  The multitasking is spectacular.  Messages and IMs come in in the background, so you see them.  The UI is beautiful.  You could do other platforms.  I presume Palm is going to do the same thing they did with Palm, with the other Palm stuff, which is make a variety of things around WebOS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree. I think the pre is fantastic, and I think it's going to be very good.  But the reality distortion field, even without Steve Jobs, I think will come into play.  Well, there's also inertia, isn't there?  And it just kind of pulls the wind out of Palm that they've had their weekend and it's over instead of having months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's inertia.  And I think that... Tom Peters used to say this.  If you're going to get people to change to a new technology, it has to be 10 times better.  It can't be one or two or three times better.  It has to be 10 times better to get people to move.  That may be the case with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is the multitasking the killer app?  I mean, is that...  It's pretty good.  How does that actually work?  Do you...  If I have two or three things open, does my phone run slower?  Am I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, it drains the battery is what it does, but I don't think it...  Have you found it to run slower?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a little more sluggish.  Launching is not as fast as it would be, but no, it multitasks pretty well.  And it does it very...  So is that what the iPhone does?  Yeah, I think so.  It does it very...  Yeah, I'm sorry.  I have a picture of your wife on my phone, but that's just sometimes how that happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Screw you, Leo!

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The way it happens is that each background application becomes a card that you can scroll  through and then you can tap to zoom in, make it full screen, and then slide it off the  screen to make it smaller, slide it again to close it.  That is elegant.  That's really sweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's pretty sweet.  They let you run processes in the background, but they don't allow that flip through?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, you don't even know what's running.  You have to kind of figure out what else is going on in the background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the big problem with BlackBerry.  People all the time are like, oh my God, my BlackBerry is running slow, something's wrong.  And it turns out they've just got, you know, sort of like Windows creep on it.  Yeah.  And they get application creep.  And that's what this...  Maybe this solves it.  I don't know.  What's the price point?  Is it $199 for this device?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  $299 with a $100 mail-in rebate.  And that's why Best Buy is the place to get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's you buy to Best Buy.  And then you have to do the instant rebate.  So then you don't have to send any forms in.  Of course, they only have two.  Yeah.  That's why it's easy for them to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They need to get the... the smartphone cost is still prohibitive for mass adoption.  They have to get these things down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, not just the cost of the handset, but when people see the monthly cost, they really  choke.  Too much.  Sprint's doing the $99 everything thing on this, which makes it actually a pretty compelling  buy against the iPhone.  Yeah, you can get a $70 iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's why we're going to hear about an AT&T price change, I think.  I hope so.  Because they're feeling some heat from that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If that's the case, that's why you want to support this competition.  Definitely.  You need to have other smartphone choices.  Now, BlackBerry does very well.  In fact, BlackBerry beats the iPhone, so it's a good competitor.  But I think a three-way race is exciting.  I think it's good.  I think that John Rubenstein...  Yeah, they'll count Nokia out either.  No, no, no.  The N97 is going to be out any minute now.  I can't wait to see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm constantly excited about the N series and then disappointed once it comes out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I saw the N97 at the Deconference.  It looked really ugly.  I'll be honest.  I had the N95.  It's an elegant device.  It's kind of interesting.  But it looks terrible.  It's like a phone that time forgot.  It's like a five-year-old design.  Look, it flips open and there's a keyboard inside.  I was like, wow, I saw that in 99.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a movie tying to land in the lost there.  It really is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That will never work anywhere outside of Europe.  Nobody cares about that ugly-looking phone style.  I don't think kids are going to want that either.  You have an object of art like the iPhone.  Now you have an object of art like the Palm Pre.  You have the utilitarian Blackberry that has an incredible camera on it.  I think the camera, I don't know if you guys watch my blog, but it's a 3.2 megapixel camera.  It's starting to look like my digital rebel.  I can't tell the difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the same on this Pre.  I just took some pictures.  Elaine, you just took some pictures.  It looks good.  The camera is very good.  To have a 3 megapixel camera and of course, what is the N97?  Is it five or is it more?  It's five.  I think it's more now.  I think the N97 is more than five.  The N95 was five.  Yeah, you're right.  These are cameras and phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't have to carry the camera anymore.  When somebody figures out, there are two features that nobody's really figured out.  One is how to make it a Wi-Fi network like that new Verizon, MiFi, whatever.  Yeah, MiFi is so cool.  Like the cradle point.  I have the cradle point that I put my thing into.  Somebody will make that into their phone and then that's it.  It's like game over.  Then two, if they can figure out how to get a flip video type thing working, we can get  HD video and store it.  That's two years out, but when those things happen two years from now, man, the idea of  carrying multiple devices is going to go away again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Denise, let me ask you.  If Apple makes a tablet, is that a compelling product for you?  Is that something you would use?  Is that going to replace your phone and your laptop?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think so.  No.  The thing that I want more than a tablet is an Air because it's a...  It's everything and portable.  I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What if you could get something so small, smaller than an Air that would do all of that  for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'd certainly look hard at it.  Apple has a tendency to make me drool.  It's funny.  I went to the very first D conference years ago now and saw Steve Jobs say, and I'm sure  he said it more than once, but just to hear him say it live was pretty funny that they'd  never ever, ever make a tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  He also said that nobody would want to watch video on anything that small.  In fact, it's pretty much the case that when Steve Jobs says it's never going to happen,  that's when they're about to release it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So ebook reader.  No netbook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  They just said no netbook, didn't they?  Yeah, right.  I'd like to introduce the Apple...  You think they'll do a netbook?  I think they'll do a tablet in lieu of a...  No, you think they will.  Oh, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Guaranteeing...  I'm guaranteeing the Apple TV, which turns out now my intelligence was right on that  from two years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you made a big deal about this fact that they were going to put an Apple TV in  the TV.  In the TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and that's going to happen.  Apple TV is intended to be in LCD TV.  There's no difference between the 30 inch and what they're going to, so that's going  to happen.  But a netbook's got to happen.  In Japan, the netbooks are free.  You get a $40 a month evido plan and you get it for free if you have a two year commitment.  Can you imagine if you could buy an Apple laptop essentially for $300 or $400 subsidized,  $500 or $600 subsidized, what that would do to market share for Apple?  I was on a flight just with this Virgin flight and I would say two thirds of the people were  online on the flight of the laptops open.  Two thirds?  Two thirds.  There were about 15 laptops open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that because it's new or do you think it'll stay like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, people were doing Gmail, people were surfing the web, reading blogs.  I looked at everybody's shoulders.  The other people who weren't were in Microsoft Word, like one or two of them, and then the  rest of them were watching movies.  A couple of them were netbooks.  I'm seeing netbooks over and over and over again.  I went to a couple meetings in New York.  One of the meetings, Guy pulls out that Sony one that's really nice that fits in your inside  jacket pocket.  I think netbooks are...  The P9?  Yeah, that machine.  It's beautiful.  Beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a piece of art.  It looks like Apple did.  It's $800, $900 and it's really slow.  It's not a netbook.  It's not a netbook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't call it a netbook.  But I think the Apple netbook will come.  That's just a no-brainer.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't understand the desire for a tablet because I figure once it's too big to fit  in my pocket, I'm not going to have it with me all the time anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My friend Alex Lindsay says they'll make bigger pockets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They'll re-architecture pants around this device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't that what they said about the Segway?  Cities will be re-architected.  Yeah, totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, so when I use my Kindle, I have the same sort of feeling as I did way back when  when I used my first brick-sized cell phone.  It sort of is made of that same color plastic too, which just adds to the experience.  What was the feeling?  You're right at the beginning of something great.  That you're using sort of a prototype device.  No knock on the Kindle.  I love the Kindle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The user interface work, I'm sorry to bring this back up, but the palm is done in the  pre-shows me that a smaller screen, smaller device actually can be useful.  I think maybe we don't need a big tablet if the UI is designed purpose-built for this  environment and is designed right for the environment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Would you read a book on that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Would you read a book on your iPhone?  I read on the Kindle reader sometimes, but it's more of a stopgap thing.  Oh, the Kindle app on the iPhone.  Yeah, on the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but yeah, it's not as good as a...  But it's wearing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  People don't read this.  Do you bring your Kindle with you everywhere you go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  Do you, Denise?  I do, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But then I'm a girl, I carry a purse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you have a purse.  Well, all right, so maybe this is going to be the beginning of a new era in man purses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was going to say, introducing the Apple man purse.  Steve Jobs returns with a purse.  I'd like to announce my new venture capital company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My line of purses stylized around the Apple logo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it could be the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think if it fits Apple's pattern, what will happen is they'll say, netbooks are stupid,  nobody wants a netbook.  Then they'll come out with a device that is essentially a netbook and they won't call  it a netbook.  But it won't be a netbook.  We've created a new device that fits a whole new category.  And we call it whatever I name they come up with.  It's not a netbook.  Because they didn't want to call the iPod video iPod video.  It was iPod with video.  They made a big point out of don't call it iPod video.  Right, with video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it could wind up being the MacBook Air something.  Like the MacBook Air mini or something.  Air mini or something.  Like a tinier version of the Air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Extend that brand.  Clamp shell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because they could make the Air with a smaller keyboard, smaller monitor, same frame.  And idiots like me will pay $2,000 for it.  The Airpuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Traffic Mike says he read Boiling Point on the iPhone.  Oh, did you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it was a PDF version.  There's two things to get over.  One is I wrote the book.  Second is reading it on an iPhone.  That's a lot of...  We have a ton of stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is one of the busiest news days of the year.  Denise has some things to say about watching porn.  We're going to talk about that.  You can't say the word sex on Bing, by the way, if you're in India.  We are going to talk about...  Dig has a new ad system where you get to vote on the ads.  Don't you dare vote on our ads.  Genius.  Tony LaRusso sues Twitter.  Stupid.  And maybe a conflict of interest in the White House.  Is Google getting too cozy with Obama?  Yes.  All right.  Well, thanks for joining us.  We'll see you next time.  And we're done.  That's it.  Thank you, Jason.  You really just cut to the chase on those.  I think that's really important.  There is a lot of news, and we're going to talk about it all in just a bit.  And I do want to talk to Denise about it.  I think you're going to do a twill on this, about this thumbnail issue on Bing,  because this is a copyright issue that's just fascinating.  Yeah.  And Bing, by the way, took the lead over Yahoo.  A guy who knows a lot about search, Mr. Mahalo, we'll talk about that as well.  But first I want to mention Squarespace.  Squarespace.com.  Denise, have you moved your site over, or are you about to move your site over to Squarespace?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I've been moved over for, gosh, I think it's been more than a month now.  And?  Baginbagage.com is there, and I love it.  It's wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is...  I had never heard of them, to be honest, when they came to us.  And I went over there.  And the first thing you see when you go to Squarespace.com is this amazing ability to create,  you know, take a beautiful template, customize it with Ajax, drag and drop.  I mean, it just is incredible.  It imports all your stuff from WordPress or Movable Type or Blogger or Typepad,  and exports so you're never trapped.  You've got...  It's not a blog engine per se, because you do a forum there, you can do a photo gallery,  a forum builder, they've got Google Maps, amazing stats.  And because they're using this kind of cloud architecture, they could throw more bandwidth at it  at any time.  You never brought down by a dig, for instance, just kind of infinite bandwidth.  So you've been pretty happy with it.  I've been really happy with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was on Blogger forever, you know, since the cooling of the earth when they started 10 years ago.  And liked it, and it was easy.  And, you know, there was some loyalty there.  And I met the people a long time ago and just, you know, I was like,  the people a long time ago and just never really wanted to move.  But it was clear that I needed more.  I needed a blog engine on steroids, which is sort of what Squarespace is.  You know, I was clinging together sites and then linking off my blog to elsewhere to be able to send people to,  you know, other information about me aside from just my blog entries.  So this was able to package it all up in one place.  And it's super fast, too.  Isn't that nice?  Yeah, it's just spoken fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's next generation website design.  And, you know, it's a hosted solution.  So you're getting the hosting and this amazing content management system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did I mention something about Squarespace?  Yes. I didn't know you knew anything about Squarespace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know all about Squarespace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Very cool guys from New York.  They applied for TechCrunch 50 and weren't accepted because it was like a new version.  We try to launch new things on it.  Right. Yeah, they've been around for a couple of years.  I almost fell off my chair when I saw it.  And I just want to take a moment because we do this on this week in startups to tell all the people who are fans of the show, this week in tech, should all say right now on Twitter, thank you to Squarespace.  And then put pound tweet at the end.  This way the sponsor knows that, you know, that's a good thing.  And if they see a hundred people mention Squarespace right now, they're probably going to advertise more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're getting great results.  They're very happy here.  And we're really happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But one out, you know, say thank you to Squarespace.  That's something a listener can do that takes 10 seconds and really helps the show.  Thank you for saying that.  Say thank you to Squarespace on your tweet.  For supporting Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Specifically for supporting Twitter.  We appreciate that.  How is that going this week in startups?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love the show.  Oh, that's very kind.  Yeah.  No, the first time I watched it, I thought this is like King Jason dispensing, dispensing his knowledge.  Come to Jason.  He will tell you or the guru on the mount.  Life is not a bowl of cherries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Poor David Carradine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  OK.  A moment of sad silence.  Moment of silence for Kung Fu.  You just had 47 people in the last 90 seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thanks Squarespace on.  Oh, that's nice.  Thank you, everybody.  But anyway, the show's doing really well.  Thank you for being cool about me borrowing the sort of this weekend.  You've been really a bench about that, I have to say, because I did ask you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You asked and I was glad to do.  You should ask Mel Allen, to be honest with you.  He's got this week at baseball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I also offered like, hey, can I give a tributary or something?  I don't know what the relationship is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But we know we would like to rebroad.  We'd like to broadcast the live broadcast at some point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I feel like I've learned 95 percent of what I know about podcasting from you, Kevin's show as well.  And, you know, anyway, I'm thankful that you're cool about me using this weekend.  And you're doing a new one.  You're going to watch a new one.  We're going to do this week in advertising.  Yeah.  Now, what would that be about?  It'll just be this.  I think it'd be like more like the Twitter format than this week in startups.  This week in startups is me giving advice mainly in an interview.  It's not this week in tech.  But this week in start this week in advertising will be like this week in law or this week in tech,  which would be four people talking about social media marketing, advertising, whatever.  And I'm not the host.  I just did this because I want to watch the show.  Who's going to host it?  You know, my guy Tyler, strategy guy, have hit me the host initially.  And he's just going to bring on three people and talk about advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We do a similar show, but I don't know how similar it'll be called.  Twin this week in media with Daisy Whitney.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so this will be just focused on advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So then let me ask you about this dig thing.  So this thing is brilliant.  This is really interesting.  I'm not sure what to make of it.  So Thursday, Dig announced it was going to start allowing its users to vote on advertising.  Now, now Hulu does it.  We should point out the thumbs up, thumbs down on the ads it shows.  But Dig's going to charge advertisers a price based on the user feedback.  So the more the ad is hated, the more the advertiser has to pay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which was sort of the other way around.  You get a discount.  OK, if it is so they're not going to penalize you for being creative.  Let's say you start at a $10 CPM.  If it's really good, then you might go down to a five.  But it's not going to penalize you up because that would be like short selling a stock.  You have no limit to how much you can lose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Doesn't this piss off advertisers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not if it's a discount.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but I mean, I don't know if I mean, do you think advertisers like the idea of the people voting?  Look, let me put it this way.  You're not going to see this on CBS, NBC or ABC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, but if you're stirring up your audience to I'm going to man, I'm going to show those advertisers.  I'm going to hate their ads.  They're going to go watch them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you're right.  Maybe it's not a bad thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's getting more people like GoDaddy.  Yeah, advertising into content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're going to make people want to they're going to make ads that they hope what people will like.  And that's a good thing, right?  Which is that's usually the motivation isn't going to bother me.  We had this argument on Buzz out loud when I was like, do you like movie trailers?  And everybody who had been just bitching that moment before was like, well, yeah, I'm like, those are ads.  But you you don't think of them as ads because you like them.  And that's that's what good advertising is.  It's something that you don't think of as, oh, this annoying intrusive ad.  We only hate advertising because it's intrusive and annoying.  And it has to be sometimes.  But if you can walk that balance to where it's both intrusive but not annoying, that's a good thing.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I stopped my TiVo in the middle of fast forwarding through ads when I see the Apple versus Microsoft and by the way that versus Mac ad TiVo records all that information and offers that for sale to its both its programmers and advertisers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I remember we saw a tech TV.  They brought in a day.  The screensavers, the graph of rewinds and stuff.  And it's the most amazing information you ever saw because it tells you in a much more visceral way than ratings in a much more granular way than ratings.  What people like and don't like.  You can see there's a graph and it spikes when something interesting happens because people rewound and watched it again.  And it goes down when they fast forward through stuff.  Wasn't it Janet Jackson?  Yeah, there was a good example.  I would round that about five or six times.  I was trying to figure out what the jewelry was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So is this much different than what Facebook does?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does Facebook do this?  They have you vote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Do you like this ad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they don't give a discount to advertisers or do they?  Maybe they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, no, they don't give a discount.  This is tying the money to it is a good idea.  We tried this on Weblogs Inc. and Engadget back in the day where we had ad reposts and we said post a comment of what you think of the product and only one out of 100 advertisers would ever go to it.  Like you were saying, they don't want feedback.  It's too scary.  They can't even change their creative enough.  A lot of these advertisers and the agencies are building it for clients who don't even watch the store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So now if you dig down an ad, does it stop showing you the ad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think that's what happens.  Now that I like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't want to see any more GoDaddy ads.  They're gone.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ironically though, I think some of the most effective advertising is some of the most annoying advertising.  That's always been the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Please don't squeeze the Charmin is famously successful even though everybody hates it or hated it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It might actually be worth the extra money to the advertiser to have something that sticks in your head that you hate.  But so many people hate it that that's kind of feedback as well.  That's kind of something that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The bottom line here is this is exactly what the hope was that new media would be able to do some innovative interactive stuff that would bring some value to both advertisers, content creators and viewers.  And this is an exactly...  I mean, this is wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's another reason why Dig is doing this though and other sites aren't to be honest.  I don't know.  It's not meant to be a dig to Jay and Kevin.  We're obviously all friends.  But the truth is the dig audience is largely like an anti-commercial audience and the dig format.  So they have ad blocker on a lot of the time.  Second, the dig ads, the dig system is the best of the web, which means if you try to put an ad up there, you're competing against the best of the web.  That's a terrible thing for an advertiser to have to do.  Advertising doesn't work on dig.  That's their main problem.  So they don't have a choice but to do something really innovative like this.  People are not going to click on the ads on dig when there's 10 stories about Ron Paul and boobies and seven stories about what's coming out in the Mac tomorrow.  The ads just disappear.  How can an advertiser compete with Mac?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not dig.  I mean, that's a problem everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, but it's specific to meme trackers.  Meme trackers are so good, the content, that it's harder to compete.  It's one thing to compete on the New York Times site or in Gadget when it's a lot of news, but when it's the best news, best of the best.  That's interesting.  Magnitude horror.  I know this because I did the Netscape thing.  I wonder if FARC has that problem.  FARC?  Well, that's why FARC put the ads in the stream.  Right.  They get paid for people putting stories in there and they don't actually label it.  It's a little bit shady.  But dig is trying to insert the ads into the stream and by allowing users to vote them up, they can do that credibly as opposed to FARC, which sort of did it on the slide.  Not that anybody cares.  I mean, it's boobies, you know, whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think this is, look, I mean, advertisers in general face problems.  People don't want ads.  They do everything they can to avoid ads.  Anything you can do to add value to the ads or make it so that people pay more attention is a good thing.  And this is an example of how new media can do that.  I think it's brilliant.  It's brilliant.  Now, let's talk about Bing, Denise.  Bing is Microsoft's new search engine.  It was called Kumo.  It's really, I don't know.  Jason, is it much different than MSN search?  Do they really change the technology or is it just relabeled?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think if you compare what they had before, it was probably they had like a four or five out of ten.  If Google's the ten in search now, they have like an eight.  So the quality is very good.  It's amazing what they've done compared to what they've done previously.  It's not quite Google yet, but they're taking a lot of risks in terms of the design of it.  So for that, they deserve a lot of credit.  It is phenomenally well executed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And by the way, BeatYahoo in search.  Well, that's just kind of sampling.  But BeatYahoo in search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a legitimate contender.  And that is shocking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you've always told me and I've quoted you many times, each percentage of the search markets about a billion dollars in value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, that's why they were going to spend 40 billion, 30, 40 billion to buy Yahoo's 20 percent.  I mean, they were going to pay a little more because Yahoo has extra things attached to it like their investment in Japan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Denise has a really good post on her logarithms column, the June 2nd post, in which she asks, is Bing paying playing fast and loose with fair use?  What's going on? What's Bing doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, Bing is providing live video previews.  As many a 14 year old has just learned, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, you know, when you go and do a search with the safe search controls turned on, you'll see that when you mouse over one of the video thumbnails that you get in the search results, it's not just a screen capture of what's going on, but the video starts to play.  And there's an interesting interview.  The person who flagged the fair use issue was Andy Plesser of Beat TV.  And he asked me if I'd taken a look at it and I did.  And then I put up my post and Andy continued to look at it as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The problem is, it was a didn't Google get in a little trouble for the thumbnails in the search?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google has had many and lots of search engines have had lots of litigation over how much of something you can display in a search engine in order to index and then point people off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Google won that case.  The porn thumbnail case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There was a porn case that involved still images that were in line linked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Perfect 10. That's right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Perfect 10 versus Google.  Google won because even though they were showing full sized images and that's that's problematic under the fair use analysis under fair use.  You're you're not allowed to detract from the market value of the original or to do something that basically replaces the need to go and see the original.  So that's why this being video search is somewhat problematic.  They don't.  It appears play the full video of everything that's included in the search engine.  Although, you know, I'm I'm still kind of digging around in it.  And it seems like for short videos, you're getting awfully close to the full thing.  There's an interesting interview that Andy Plesser did with Stefan White's is his name.  And I just put a tiny URL for the interview.  It's Denise dot how old dot net slash Bing.  And there's Stefan talking about how they organized this video search and how they decided which parts of the video to display.  And he goes ahead and says, we actually do try and pull out something relevant so that it's meaningful for you.  Well, that's good.  Well, it's good and it's dangerous from a fair use perspective, because if you're replacing the need and disincentivizing people from actually going to see the original, if they can just sit there and happily watch the best of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, this is brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the only place reaching seconds, right?  I mean, it doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this gets really interesting when you delve into the pornosphere, because if you turn off safe search and you just do a search for porn, you can watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can watch all that porn without leaving Bing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And if they're pulling out what they think, what is the best salient salient or salacious?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's just say, can I just say the mission can be accomplished.  The Bing search result, if we just leave it at that mission will be accomplished.  Yes, right.  Which means there is no reason to go to the porn site.  Right.  Therefore, as a legal test, Denise, you would say if the mission is accomplished, therefore it's infringing upon their ability to do trade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I don't know that the mission accomplished test was actually raised.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How about how about Emission accomplished?  I'm sorry.  I should have gone that way.  I don't get it.  I don't get it either.  I have no idea what you're talking about.  I don't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I made the joke up.  No, this is this is going to be shut down within a couple of weeks.  Guaranteed.  This is way unfit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I was honed in on the copyright issues when I posted about this.  But you know, the real outcry about it is parents and educators and libraries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I wasn't too pleased when I saw this because I do have I'm using open DNS to block, but you can't you can't block being well.  You could block being I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but maybe you maybe I should go into the porn stuff right away.  You have to go in and turn off the safe search.  But anybody could do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I can't force my kid not to use safe search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't force kid not to use or you could force your kid not to use the Internet, too.  So I mean, it really is a safe search in Google for if for images as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm just saying I can put open DNS on my router and the kid can't change it.  And then he's got a hard time going to porn sites.  On the other hand, if he figures out he can Bingham, we can Google images.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it's it's I guess it's a matter of a little different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's it's significantly different than looking at a still image.  Oh, really?  Folks are so inclined to go check it out.  I think that I wouldn't know.  I wouldn't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is.  Try try one of these.  It is kind of amazing when you see these thumbnails.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like if you turn off the if you turn off the safe search, it turns it into the bottom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's like DJ kind of a thing because when forget about the porn search,  but anything you pull up, if you just sort of roll over it in a row, you sort of get this weird montage of.  Yeah, because they don't turn off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They they they keep going for whatever seconds they're preprogrammed or selected to do.  So if you just swipe across, it becomes a cacophony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I use somebody saying in the chat room, I seem a little paranoid.  My kids are going to search for porn.  They actually I'm just using them as an example.  They're good kids and they don't search for porn.  You're using the metaphorical metaphorical kids.  Henry search for boobies once, but that was it.  He actually searched for Ron Paul's boobies, which I thought was a little strange.  Who has it?  Who hasn't?  After all, he found it on dig.  So but here's an interesting thing.  Dig, for some reason, has decided that you can't search for the word sex if you're Indian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, Bing, you mean?  What did I say?  Dig, dig, dig, Bing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm you know, don't disrespect the big don't disrespect the Bing.  So apparently sex is a high volume search string from India,  ranking above 60 on a scale of zero to 100 since 2004, according to Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's easy to change your country, though, with Bing.  Apparently, you can just say, oh, I'm not Indian.  I'm in the US and you can search all you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You say you're from China or Hong Kong or Singapore.  No luck.  Arabian country.  No luck.  But you say from the US, they say anything goes.  Oh, you're from France.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then searching for sex is much different than searching for boobies on porn.  You could be searching for health information or gender and typing.  There's a whole lot of other things.  I know it's not as fun to imagine that you might be including that search term on that.  It's now blocking.  Is there a legal reason, Denise, that they might want to do this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, do they have to do this for certain countries?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, the different countries have.  And some countries are more restrictive than others as to what they will permit search engines to deliver.  And then it's up to the search engine if they want to do business in that country,  if they're going to comply with the local laws.  And I'm sure that's why Bing has made this decision.  They'd rather not be blocked.  They'd rather not be sued.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you think this Yahoo! lead is meaningful at all?  I mean, it's just everybody kind of...  Bing became the number two search engine on Thursday with a 16.28 share of searches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just went to Google.IN and searched sex and I got a lot of results.  Now, maybe it's because my IP address isn't masked.  In other words, Google's not doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Do you have SafeSearch turned on?  I do.  Because you have to turn on SafeSearch on Bing.  A lot of health returns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I didn't.  Full free porn videos and DVDs is the first result on Google.IN.  Thank you very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So as long as we're talking about international things,  somebody DMed me right before the show with some breaking news from the EU.  And that is that the Pirate Party has just got elected to a seat in the European Parliament.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What did they get? 7% of the vote? They got a huge...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it proportional representation there? Is that how that works?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  19% between 18 to 35 year olds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what the good news about this is?  They're no longer going to have to cam the proceedings.  They're actually going to have them straight to DVD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So is this a response to the Pirate Bay prosecution?  Are there real candidates being fronted or is this just kind of a protest vote?  What's the story here?  They got a seat.  So they're going to have to have a candidate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. I think it's a combination of both.  I think that this is a big enough issue and has been public enough there  that people have finally just said, you know, let's get some new perspective on these issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Deep Tears says the EU has been boarded. Arrrr!

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I'm reading the stories on it.  It says votes are still being counted and I think they might have had another candidate also from the party.  So who knows?  Wow. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wonder if the candidates are the Pirate Bay guys or if they've got somebody else that they're running with.  They're running with me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it's somebody else.  The Pirate Party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that sounds like a great party to be a part of.  In related news, Boing Boing is running for Senate.  He's doing well in Somalia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who's running for Senate?  In related news, Boing Boing has just been elected to the Senate.  Jenny Chardin will be representing the Boing Boing contingent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, let's keep on with the legal news.  Tony LaRusso is suing Twitter.  Fail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sign stealing, right?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He says an unauthorized page that used his name to make light of drunken driving and two Cardinals pictures who died damaged his reputation and caused emotional distress, filed a suit in Superior Court of California in San Francisco seeking unspecified damages.  He's basically saying you didn't bother to authenticate that it was the real Tony LaRusso.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In related news, he's suing Gmail for Tony LaRusso 17.  Hail, well, it's the passenger, LaRusso 14.  Let me give me a break.  I'm sorry, stupid thing I've heard.  ARF is handling this case, the Animal Rescue Foundation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's saying that this is because of the, he doesn't want a bad name.  For ARF.  That's his big cars, his big charity.  Yeah, it affects their ability to get adoptions if people see this Twitter account and think that Tony LaRusso is saying all these horrible things, they won't want to support ARF.  What I don't understand is he says he tried to get Twitter to take it down and they wouldn't.  And Twitter is usually very responsive in these sort of situations when they receive a request.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's worse because this lawsuit includes a screenshot of tweets with the heading, Hey there, Tony LaRusso is using Twitter with a picture of the manager.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then it says bio parodies are fun for everyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, he didn't miss that part.  That's the page you see if you went.  If you went, it's the site, the account is down now, but if you went to that twitter.com slash Tony LaRusso, you'd see that.  Anybody would see that though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know if that's.  The problem with the lawsuit is Tony's probably sued the wrong party as Jason was pointing out that we have broad sweeping immunities in this country for intermediaries, like Google and here Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're protected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they're they're they're carrier.  But it raises a really interesting issue because Twitter is becoming more and more like some sort of domain name registrar.  Well, yeah, that's true.  Yeah, that's true.  Names there actually have some meaning and, you know, as far as there certainly could be trademark issues that could attach one way or another.  You know, if someone is using your trademark or your name and likeness without your permission, you've got some claims.  But to go after Twitter here is a little bit difficult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Didn't you say that at one point, Jason, on the show that if eventually everybody will have a Twitter, this would be like the phone book for the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, my premise is it's going to be the global login system.  It's sort of and they're also going to launch a payment system.  So it's going to sort of be like if PayPal and Facebook login were together.  Or did I say they're going to launch a payment system?  Can you edit that out of the show?  Yeah, they're going to launch a payment system and when they have a payment system.  I hear you're going to launch a payment system.  But are they going to launch one?  They're going to launch a payment system.  And when they do, I could be like, you know, what would you pay for anything?  Just like PayPal.  I could PayPal a donation to a charity.  I could send you 20 bucks that I owe you.  That's a good business model.  You could send me the 1500 bucks you owe me from the poker game.  Finally, three months later, screw you, Jason Kelley.  It's been basically I'm invited on the show until Leo pays off his poker debts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, Bill Stone has a post up on Twitter right now saying screw you, Tony LaRusse.  No, seriously, it's called not playing ball.  He says, with due respect to the man and his notable work, Mr. LaRusse's lawsuit was an unnecessary waste of judicial resources bordering on frivolous Twitter's terms of service are fair and we believe will be upheld in court that will ultimately dismiss Mr. LaRusse's lawsuit.  Then goes on to talk about a new business opportunity called verified accounts where celebrities at first and maybe businesses down the road will be able to get a verified account by paying.  They're going to announce verified accounts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, which goes to the concept of a payment system, which goes to the global login system.  I like the payment system idea.  This is where they're going to go.  I think the logical progression of that is really exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that if all of a sudden I have, you know, at Jeff Kanata on Twitter and you can send me money that way, you can get to my telephone that way, you can get that is just the way the internet knows me.  It does raise this issue though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If a Jeff Kanata or at Jeff Kanata isn't Jeff Kanata and I send you money, that's not good.  You have to have a way of making sure that the people who are who they say they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it also means that if Twitter loses this case to LaRusse, that business model is not as good.  By the way, that post you mentioned squelched rumors that the case had settled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was all over the headlines a couple days ago that the case had been filed and then immediately somehow worked out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sounds like it doesn't that there's not much merit to this case.  There is not a chance in heck that this will ever get anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wouldn't want to be Twitter.  You know, it's got some some difficult choices to make.  Maybe going down the monetizing your verified account is sort of the best scenario for it.  But if they've got to put an infrastructure in place that manages this for everyone.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They don't they don't have to put an infrastructure in.  And what they'll do is, you know, if it's unverified, then there's a reasonable expectation, you know, just like the rest of the Web that you don't take it too seriously.  I mean, I get spam all the time from celebrities or this or that.  I mean, you know, no big deal.  That's true.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can send an email right now that says, this is Bill Clinton.  What this is is my cigar and nobody doesn't have to be real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm guessing that this is some sort of a PR play by this guy because he's got a book coming out or he's got his own.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Tony's genuine here.  I know, Tony.  I think he's genuine here.  I think he may not get Twitter and he may not understand.  He's not getting good legal advice, perhaps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And he's a lawyer.  Is he is he desperate for cash or something like what lawyer would ever.  No, I think he's I think he's I think that Tony is understandably angry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He doesn't really understand what happened, as a lot of people don't understand Twitter and thinks that he's been impersonated in public and send a letter and turn off the account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, the fact that he's going for a lawsuit and he says he did that.  He says he did that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He says he tried to get the account turned off and it wasn't turned off.  How did he try to turn off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that maybe that would give his case some merit if that's the case.  Right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that gets back to my infrastructure point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How does Twitter respond to they don't have the staff if they're getting a thousand messages a day saying, hey, that's not my account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They could easily have the infrastructure.  There are companies that you outsource this to handle it for you.  You just they can easily get through hundreds of these a day and it would probably be under a hundred a day even for a service like AOL.  Do we know?  I only know one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mostly Lisa tried for a long time to get mostly Lisa back, was able to get it back finally.  But it took a while.  Do we know many cases of people saying that's hey, that's not my name?  Jennifer Leggio at ZDNet had it happen to her recently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How hard was it for her to get her name back?  It was easy, but she knew folks at Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Almost that doesn't count.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've helped like a dozen people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, if you've got an in, you've got an in, Jason.  You can go to Ave and say, hey, dude, hey, it's not just that they have they actually respond to the general email.  I know people who've emailed the general email and have this taken care of.  You know, maybe there was a window during the peak of Oprah madness that it took a day or two.  But send a certified letter to their office.  I guarantee they handle it.  You know, and sending a certified letter to an office is a lot easier than filing a lawsuit.  Denise, I think would not be the proper protocol.  I'm not I'm not behind this lawsuit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Always better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It would be the proper protocol if somebody doesn't respond to an email to it because emails can get lost, you know, misplaced.  Isn't the proper protocol before you file a lawsuit to maybe send three certified letters to before you file it?  Something that's off the Web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, something in paper.  We actually had we actually printed up letterhead.  We never had letterhead for these kinds of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We actually had to make what do you mean?  We have to send we have to send snail mail.  So we print up letterhead like letterhead is some guarantee of authenticity in these days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you have to have it.  I mean, you can't just send it to one of a line notebook piece of notebook paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Put something in mail.  People take it very seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Very well, because nobody does it anymore.  Yeah, I've sent literally handwritten letters to the general email office.  Literally handwritten.  I've handwritten notes on pieces of paper like, by the way, I am going to sue you like sign Jason in a FedEx envelope.  Like literally two sentences.  Stop.  I am going to sue you.  Sign Jason Calacanis in a FedEx envelope to people.  Once you do that, people behave themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the problem was that Tony LaRusso just stood across the street and then patted his head three times and rubbed his nose.  You didn't see the signal.  But come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you blind?  What are you blind?  All right, we're going to take a break.  Come back with more stories for you in just a second.

We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just wanted to give you an update.  600 people have thanked Squarespace on Twitter.  I'm not kidding.  600 people have thanked Squarespace.  You need to send two checks, one to Leo, one to me.  I think so.  Two, I just want to encourage everybody to do a second tweet right now saying thank you to...  Citrix and go to mypc.com.  Go to mypc.com and put pound twit at the end and specifically say go to mypc.com.  I really appreciate you supporting user generated high end media that has Jason Calacanis in it.  I mean...  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  With anything with Jason and it's good.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But really certainly it needs a lot to support the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want to ask Jeff Kanata because he was at E3.  Anybody else go to E3?  I think Jeff, you're the only one here that was at E3.  The big gaming convention was this week.  You've been to them in the past.  Is E3 getting bigger, getting smaller?  People seem to think this was the best E3 in a while.  I think I would agree with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's definitely on the upswing as far as big to small.  Last year was really much more subdued and low key and it was back this year to being a little more bombastic again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not what you expect from conferences in this tough times.  You kind of expect them to be sluggish and slow and people going, oh, but gaming is hotter than ever.  Maybe bad economies are good for gaming.  I'm sure they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're hitting the stride of all these consoles that came out a few years ago.  It takes a couple of years for the software developers to catch up on the new hardware.  Now we're hitting really where these projects that started a couple of years ago, they're about to come out.  It's really showing off what these next generation systems can do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Something happened that doesn't usually happen at E3.  Mainstream media really picked up on the Microsoft story for two reasons.  One, because they got Ringo and Paul together.  That always helps.  That's pretty big.  They were.  Steven Spielberg.  And Steven's all on the same stage.  Yoko.  And Yoko was there.  A moving moment.  And Mrs. Harrison.  Mrs. Harrison?  No one ever remembers her.  What is her name? Is it Patty Boyd?  No, no, that's the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Son was there too.  I don't know his name.  Something Harrison.  The son.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the big announcement for Microsoft was Natal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they're calling it Natal.  Natal?  Yeah.  Not natal.  Not pre-natal, not post-natal.  It's a pretty spectacular bit of technology.  And they pretty much blew everybody away with their stage presentation.  It's taking the controller completely out of the equation  and letting you communicate with the system using your gestures  and a three camera system that includes an infrared camera.  It's pretty awesome stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But is it a product? Will it ever come out?  And is there anything more than just a great demo in there?  Paul Thurado does their Windows Weekly program.  Kind of went off on it and said, and he's a Microsoft guy,  this is ridiculous.  Come on, they didn't even announce a product.  A release window?  A release window. There's no product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Peter Mollenew came out and showed what Linehead Studios has been working on.  And he claims that will be a product.  This Milo and Kate, I think it's called.  He says that will be a game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you use it? Did you get to play with it at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't get hands on with it, no.  But I saw the presentations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it looks cool, but demos can be so deceptive.  They also had Burnout up and working on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they had an actual pre-existing game working with the technology for people to use.  What did Brian think of it?  Brian got to actually try it and he said it worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He was limited in the games he could use, of course.  But he was able to make it work on him.  Well, Felicia Day used it and looked good with it.  They didn't calibrate it for him in advance.  They could have calibrated it for Felicia.  I'm not saying they did.  But he just kind of showed.  But he just walked up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what do you think, Jeff?  I mean, is this going to be on our system soon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I don't know about soon.  I think it's far off.  But I think that's kind of a great thing about these kind of press conferences is that it shows you.  It gets you excited.  It shows you what the future holds.  And I think that they showed two applications for the technology.  One was kind of that doing pantomime in front of the screen to pretend like you're doing stuff, you know, which I would admit was a little silly.  We've seen that before.  I mean, the iCAM for PS2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, isn't that the same thing?  The iToy, yeah.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And interestingly enough, PlayStation announced their own motion controller, which has been completely overshadowed in the mainstream press by Microsoft's announcement.  I'll get to that in a second.  But then the second application of the technology, which is what Peter Molyneux was showing off, is really something that allows completely new take on video games.  And I think that where people get a little stuck with this from an imagination standpoint is going, oh, I'm just going to it's just going to be a replacement for my controller.  So I'm going to be doing the same types of things except I'm going to be pantomiming and there's going to be nothing in my hand.  And that's certainly one thing they were showing.  But the the Natal also has voice recognition technology built in.  And Molyneux was showing off this thing where you literally walk up to your television and treat it like you're looking out a window and talking to another person.  So it's it's cool games in a completely new way.  And that that person, this Milo character's a little 10 year old boy that that they had mocked up for the presentation, recognized people, carried on conversations with them, interacted with them.  Would you know they had he was recognizing things they were wearing the color of their shirt, for example.  You could tell by the tone of your voice whether or not you were joking with them or or or talking seriously.  It's pretty remarkable stuff.  And I think that instead of concentrating on, oh, well, I'll instead of a controller, I'll be waving my arm around pretending there's a tennis racket in it.  I think developers are going to take this technology and run with it in a completely new direction where video games have ever really tread before.  And I think that's what's exciting about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  And you think that this game Milo and nerdy will be out soon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I don't know.  I'm guessing probably more 2011.  OK.  But next year, Sony.  Oh, wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's two years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, two years.  My math is correct.  I have nothing to base that on, but it seems like it's a little far off.  But, you know, Sony also showed a motion controller that's more along the lines of what the Wii has been, which is sort of a wand or remote control looking thing and much more precise than the Wii has ever been.  And that was actually pretty remarkable, too.  They were showing pinpoint accuracy and depth perception with that device so that it really could be the kind of thing that would replace in your hand a sword or tennis racket or lots of other things.  And they showed a moment where the guy who was demoing it literally stunned an enemy and then lifted its head a couple of inches with the sword, you know, like put the sword under the chin of the zombie and lifted the head a couple of inches before striking it.  I mean, it's very, very precise one to one recognition of your movement.  And this is going to be out soon.  Yeah, they're saying spring of next year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I think we're going that way, right?  I mean, it's kind of inevitable that we do that we do something like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, there certainly seems to be the Wii's success has certainly started an arms race of arms racing.  You know, it's it's it's clearly the way all these companies are putting a lot of their energies in.  And I think that that's exciting.  I don't think I think the good thing about the 360 and the PS3 approaches is that I don't think they're going to replace your controller.  I think this is going to be a new different way for games to be made.  And they will be parallel to more traditional games, whereas the Wii really aimed to get rid of the controller altogether.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love this video that Microsoft put out of dad being the pit crew so that the girl gets to drive and dad's so happy changing her tire.  And then it's just like it's just like real life.  And maybe mom will be the the Highway Patrol officer who pulls her over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know. Yeah, it's a shame that this stuff looks so ridiculous.  And like I said, it's not a shame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's kind of a fundamental problem is that you look like kind of a look what happened to the segue.  You looked like a dork riding it. It never took off.  If you I guess you could play this in the privacy of your own home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's where you if you imagine a game without anybody else around?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the dance dance revolution in public.  That's true. This is not much different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People who dance much better than any of us.  Yeah, maybe, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I got a Wii Fit.  I got a Wii Fit and I got to say I played it like once and I thought I'm never doing this again.  This was this was awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The motion control from Sony is really good.  Is it enough to pull Sony out of the basement, though?  I mean, because it's like you say, it's pretty overshadowed in the press.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I don't know if that that will be the thing that pulls Sony out of the basement.  I think they're incredibly strong lineup of titles that they showed this year will be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what they need. They need some games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They showed off some amazing stuff. God of War 3 and a game called Heavy Rain and Uncharted 2.  I walked away from that conference wanting to play the PS3 games more than any other console.  Yay! We need, look, I really want the PS3 to succeed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I think it's a great device. It's a Blu-ray player.  I have two, one right there and one at home.  And I just think it's but it's really lacking in software.  It just doesn't have anything great to play on it.  So that's good news. You think God of War will be a good game?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, God of War looks great. It looks fantastic.  Yeah. I mean, if you like really visceral, violent games.  Yeah, baby.  There's, you know, ripping heads off of people.  It's pretty intense in slow motion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the reason that Paul and Ringo and Yoko were there was rock band Beatles.  Yes. That's more my speed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Clearly a large chunk of change was dropped on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you think this will sell? I mean, it's for aimed at people my age.  It's aimed at people 50 and older.  You think it'll sell? Dan is a young guy. Our chat room moderator.  He says, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because the Beatles are popular across a whole lot of demos.  Really? Young people would want to play the Beatles songs?  There's still huge Beatles fans in high schools and colleges.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. That's a relief to hear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Beatles are forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They got a lot of press for it.  It certainly was a successful thing to do.  Well, cool. Thank you for the E3 report.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, let me mention one more game because it's really the Natal thing  and Sony's motion controller.  I think they're a big deal because that kind of magic that it seems like,  wow, we're really in the future.  And there was another game that kind of was under the radar a little bit,  but a lot of the hardcore press is picking up on.  And it really captures that magical idea also.  And it's a game called Scribble Knotz.  Has anybody heard of it? Scribble Knotz?  Yeah, like an astronaut but in Scribble Knot.  It's a game for the Nintendo DS, the handheld system.  And it's absolutely walking up to it.  You wouldn't think much of it, but a few minutes playing it,  it really feels like magic.  What you do is you're a little guy in a two dimensional world  and you encounter a number of problems or puzzles.  And the way you solve them is you pull down a little keyboard  and type in any noun you can think of.  And that thing magically appears in the world, functional.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How would it, how do it know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It has a library of thousands and thousands and thousands of objects.  And they were challenging journalists to come up and stump it.  And it's absolutely spectacular the kinds of things that are in that game.  Outside the box thinking, somebody mentioned they were having a problem  getting past one of the puzzles and they couldn't figure out how to do it.  And they were like, you know what, I'm just going to go back in time  to a point when this didn't exist.  So they wrote time machine and the time machine showed up  and they stepped into the time machine and they went back  and they got a group of dinosaurs and went back into the time machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  Oh, I'm so getting this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This sounds so cool.  It's literally anything you can think of.  People were writing keyboard cat and the keyboard cat would show up.  No.  It's absolutely stunning.  You know, Dracula and somebody wrote a Cthulhu and a Cthulhu showed up.  Wow.  You know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't even know how to spell Cthulhu.  That's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it available now or coming?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's coming in the fall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cthulhu Madness.  I think the DS is a really great platform.  It's really done well.  Now Sony announced its go, right?  Is that going to be important or is that this is the little PSP?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, it's interesting because they also announced the price point,  which is $250.  It's a little bit much for a handheld game.  A DS is what, $150?  Well, you can get the new DSi, I think is $179, I think.  Something like that.  So it's still a little expensive, I would say.  But the PSP Go is a nice redesign.  I think it's much smaller and lighter than the original PSP,  but that price point just seems a little high.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  Oh, well, it looks cool.  It's psychologically high because it's above that $199.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's psychologically high.  We should have made it $199.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  $199 is the sweet spot for something and then you can drop it as the years go on.  $250, it just seems out of the sweet spot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like that scribble nuts.  That is really neat.  Is that for you or for your son, Denise?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm thinking both.  It sounds totally creative for him.  And I would not own a DS but for having a little boy.  And yeah, it seems like, Jeff, too, tell me if this is right,  that they're doing a lot with motion and interactivity  and that kind of thing for those small platforms as well.  We have a Tony Hawk game where you make it move by moving the device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the big Tony Hawk game that was announced is going to deliver a new controller,  much like Guitar Hero gave you a guitar.  They're going to ship with a skateboard.  But that's not for a handheld device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, but even the handheld ones, it seems like, you know,  I saw a commercial on TV with Beyonce for some kind of rhythm game where,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  yeah, it's called Rhythm Heaven.  And, you know, the DS really started this whole revolution of new ways to input  to all kinds of video game systems because when the DS was announced,  the touch screen and the stylus were looked at as a kind of bizarre innovation.  And that really set the stage for what Nintendo did with the Wii,  coming out with the motion controller for that.  And the DS initially seems very similar to me to what this Natal Target video was,  where it was very conventional ideas of what you could do with the touch screen and the stylus.  And then as things went on, developers started looking at it as a way to create games  that were not possible before, that did things that really,  it wasn't just shoehorning existing games into a new control scheme.  It was creating new types of games.  And I think that's the exciting thing about all these motion control devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just had a curiosity. Did Apple show up there?  Because, I mean, seriously, I think the iPhone is turning into a gaming platform.  And I'm wondering if Apple made any presence at all, these three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I didn't see Apple, but certainly there were tons and tons of developers showing off iPhone games.  And that has really been a place for independent developers or low budget developers  to put out stuff easily, quickly and cheaply on a device that can do really pretty spectacular games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would say the capabilities are even better than the DS, but maybe not.  I think it's got a faster processor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They claim that it's capable of better graphics than the DS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, interesting. I like the idea of portable gaming. I really do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jesse, stay in the chat room. The front feed chat room says,  Ray, scribble dots. If you type in Twitter, the fail whale comes up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I love it. OK, that's it. I'm buying it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that was a joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, if it's a joke, I bet scribble knots has it before they release.  It's very, very interesting. Very clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, there's tons of stuff like that. If you type in scribble knots into scribble knots,  another version of your main character pops up.  It's like they thought of everything. And the developers were there as people were challenging it  and writing down notes of things that people found things that weren't in it they were going to have.  So it's just it's really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There must be a lot of extra bandwidth in the DS or extra memory in the DS,  because to be able to include that big a database with all those objects,  there must be a lot of extra memory in there.  Well, the keys to that are very simple.  Yeah. Yeah.  Let us talk about the Obama and Google.  We go back to our stories.  There is a story about Google perhaps getting a little too comfy in the Obama White House.  Two senior Google executives have joined the Obama administration since the beginning of the year.  Eric Schmidt is on the president's advisory board on science and technology.  And now concerned over the company's influence inside the beltway,  two consumer groups are opposing the appointment of a third Google executive of the White House.  Consumer Watchdog in the Center for Digital Democracy asked the president not to move forward  with the appointment of Google Public Policy Chief Andrew McLaughlin  as the nation's deputy chief technology officer.  Is this something that concerns you, Mr. Mahalo?  Look at him with his cigar. Mr. Mahalo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, this is not good for Google because it puts them under more scrutiny.  It would be much easier for them to lay low.  There are two antitrust investigations going on right now, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly. It's just silly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like if they wouldn't be so brazen as to add all these people and then try to skirt any laws,  Google actually is not trying to skirt any laws.  They have a couple of issues they have to deal with,  with some of the stuff that we all know about in terms of these antitrust issues.  But the reason they're adding so many people is because Obama is so tech savvy  that he is bonding with the most tech savvy growing companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And who are you going to go to? You're going to go to Google, right?  You can't mistake cause and correlation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, there's a correlation between the fact that Obama is tech savvy  and Google is the most tech savvy company.  There's not some cause that Google is getting treated any differently.  In fact, what's going to happen is Google is going to be under double the scrutiny.  So Google is, if Google was smart, they can't control their ex-executives,  but if Google was really sinister, they would be not involved and you wouldn't even know.  Yeah, that's the way to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you're the Illuminati, you don't take a role in the White House.  Well, that's a good point. It's so obvious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  McLaughlin is not going to be employed. He's leaving Google.  And this may be where he goes, but Google has said he's leaving us anyway.  The big objection is that he is a former lobbyist and the Obama administration made a big deal about how they weren't going to employ a bunch of lobbyists.  So the Consumer Watch dog and Center for Digital Democracy are both saying,  hey, we don't care if the guy was from Yahoo or Microsoft. He's an ex-lobbyist.  That's what we're mostly concerned with.  Yeah, I understand that. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're going to take a...  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you all see the Brian Williams special where he was cruising around the White House?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wanted to see that. Was that good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, what was so fascinating, it was good. It was very interesting to sort of get those one-on-one impressions from people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to bit torrent that. Now that the pirate party is in power, I'm going to bit torrent that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It looked like a startup in there. Everyone's sitting in an Aeron chair. Everyone's got their mobile device of some kind.  Everyone's got their iPod dock behind them in prominent view.  Well, it's a bad time. We had some young, smart people in there for granted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank God.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I'm sick of the I don't read newspapers party in power.  I want everyone completely tied in at every minute of every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're probably watching Friend Feed even as we speak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think they're in our chat room.  They're in there. They're everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't know they're in there.  I want to mention a great advertiser, a great friend.  Oh, no, don't. No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  No.  Yes, it's time.  I'm taking my glasses off. Are you kidding me?  I'm not kidding you.  No, I'm not kidding.  Really?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it that time?  It's that time. It's the time Jason loves so very, very much.  It's time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can't believe it. I've been waiting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jason, I think you just passed the mission completion test.  Yes.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mission completed for Jason.  Audible, audible, audible. Moving on. Audible, audible, audible. Let me tell you something about Audible.  Yes.  I just got another Audible book that I'm going to be listening to when I go to the World Series of Poker, which I may be playing in.  What? Tell us about that. Wait a minute.  If I can free my schedule up, I'm going to the World Series of Poker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, that just means you started a table. You put 10,000 in and you hope you get farther, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, listen, the last three tournaments I played in, I got in the top 15 to 25, so it's not bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'd love to be able to root for you in the World Series of Poker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That'd be fun. Listen, I had sponsors for the last two. I got sponsored for the last two. Anyway, The Road is a movie coming out.  Cormac McCarthy. What a great book.  Great book.  Now, I haven't read the book, but I see the trailer for this. And the immediate thing I say to myself is, this looks amazing.  I start seeing Oprah's on Oprah's Book Club, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And I say, you know what? I don't have time to read this, but I have Audible.  Yep.  So what do I do? Just two seconds, bang. Now I got it. It's sitting there on the iPhone. I haven't started yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just don't listen to it in the public. At the end, you will cry. You will cry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Listen, I'm sure I'm going to cry. Audible has made me cry many times.  That's why he has the glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know who shouldn't listen to it is you, Denise, because it's about, well, maybe you should listen to it.  No spoilers.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No spoilers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love Cormac McCarthy, but I haven't read that one yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This one's about father and son. It's a beautiful book. Highly recommend it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's available on Audible, and there's two versions on Audible. So if you have the new membership and you get two and you love the book, get the second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, don't get the same book twice.  All right, don't get the same book twice. That's a date.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you can get The Road, and like Jason, you can listen to it in the coming weeks before the film comes out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then get No Country for Old Men, the other Cormac McCarthy, or All the Pretty Horses. You can really do a Cormac McCarthy fest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think this is what it's about, because you can get in there, you can really get into something.  And let's face it, we all have eye fatigue from being on our computers all day, and we all have iPhones or iPods.  Oh, I love it.  It's just so nice to sit back and have somebody else do the reading for you.  When I'm on flights, when I'm like, you know, in the gym, when I'm in the car in the Tesla, you know, it's just what I do.  I'm at the poker table. I listen to audiobooks on Audible.  Can I tell you guys something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  I just completed my third marathon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, congratulations. Wow, that's impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thank you. And the way I train for marathons is I listen to twits and I listen to audiobooks as I run.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's great. What a great idea. I didn't even think of that. Yeah.  Anytime you've got you can't hold a book you want to read.  There's no reason to put your mind on hold unless you need that downtime.  Listen to a great book is just wonderful. It's entertaining, but informative. You can learn.  You could just do it. And this is I thank you for this choice because it is I actually have listened to this on audible.com.  And it's a wonderful book. In fact, I didn't really like the print edition.  I got the audible edition and I loved it. The Road by Cormac McCarthy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Get the unabridged. Is there a sample? Yeah. You want to hear a little bit of it?  Just a little sample because I have it. I haven't listened to it. I can do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tom Stamstechschult reads it. He's really one of their best readers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The soft ash blowing and loose swirls over the blacktop.  He studied what he could see the segments of road among the dead trees looking for anything of color, any movement, any trace of standing smoke.  He lowered the glasses and pulled down the cotton mask from his face and wiped his nose on the back of his.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got to say, it's always better to listen to the book before you see the movie because the book,  especially when you listen on audible, paints a picture in your head that becomes the story.  And when you listen to a book, it's like a movie in your mind. I love it.  Get two books. Get this and let's say No Country for Old Men, another great Cormac McCarthy novel by going to audible.com slash twit to you sign up for the platinum account.  You get two books a month. Your first two are on us. And this is I thank you, Jason, a great recommendation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And also, you don't maybe not know this, but Christopher Walken also read this book.  Here, I just play a little sample here of that. Is it OK if I put the sample? Yeah, go ahead and play this sample.  He lowered his glasses and wiped his nose and looked at the landscape. The world was different.  Wow. That's incredible. It's moving. It's even more moving.  You get the Christopher Walken as your third choice. Reading it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway, we love audible. We love you, Jason. Thank you so much. Audible.com slash twit to thank you.  You know, I got to do this. I have a I don't know if you've ever heard this, Jason, but somebody made a special audible jingle.  What for us? No. Yeah, let me see if I can find it. That's impossible with you in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, while you're looking, I can mention the Sword and Laser Book Club will be announcing their next book.  The next episode is probably going to be George RR Martin, a Game of Thrones. Oh, that's on audible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think all four of those storm of fire and sword of ice and whatever it is on the ice and fire.  Yeah, all four of them are on there. I have. They're great. You know, listen to them and fell in love.  She doesn't like these kinds of books as Roz. Roz Savage is rowing across the Pacific right now.  These audio books are saving her life. And she's a huge George RR Martin fan because I had that book on my on my iPod when I gave it to her.  And she said, where's the rest of them? And I downloaded them just for her. It's about 800 hours.  I mean, it's I mean, it goes on. Yeah, he hasn't finished yet. Oh, you mean there's more to that more that saga.  Apparently, yeah. I think each of them is 40 hours. I mean, it's a huge thing. I can't find the one with Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's so funny. I think it's tinyurl.com slash Jason loves audible. You're kidding. Are you kidding me?  Tinyurl.com slash Jason loves audible. Somebody just posted in the chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That must be I can't remember who made it. Must be the guy who made it.  Let me just type this in here and see if we can find it here. That's hysterical.  Is it like the jingle like audible? Yeah, it's kind of except that it's got you moaning in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can I ask a question about book clubs? So if you're in a book club, if you don't read the book and you listen to the audio book accounts, if you but if you confess that to people look on your way to work on your way to school when you can't read a book, don't be.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, audible over 50,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's another one. There's a one with you moaning in it too. Is it audible? Yeah, you go, oh, audible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's something we didn't mention, by the way, about the Bing search. Full sound. Full sound? Really? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, good call back. So don't go to work and do those searches. And I go, it's in the it's in the Twitter live chat room. Here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's another one. That's the same one. I think you just created the music video for that song. I think I did. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And if keyboard cat shows up, I wouldn't be at all surprised. Why did I do that? All right. Last story. The news is out. Best Buy has leaked a memo that says Windows 7 upgrades will sell for as little as $50.  This is I think exactly what Microsoft should have done. Starting June 26th. We're talking 19 days away. 18 days away. And Gadget posted this Best Buy memo.  The official on sale date is October 22nd. And the memo, which dubbed Windows 7, is more than quote, just a Vista that works operating system.  Is that their tagline now? It's more than just Vista that works. No, we've got even some new features.  Pre-sale of Windows 7 home premium, Windows 7 professional $49.99 and $99.99 respectively. Buy the home premium $50. That's for upgraders from Vista.  That is what Microsoft I think needs to do to make whole all the people who had such trouble with Vista. So that is that is really, really good news. I hope that that's not a fake, but I don't think it is. I think it can just get a really good track record on these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We got an email from a Best Buy employee saying the same thing before that post hit. Oh, around the same time that post hit. So they weren't just reading it. Yeah, that's great news. That's I was kind of I wanted Microsoft to do something like that. And that's actually even a better price than I had thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's the price exactly? $50. But this is what they should make all operating systems should be like $50 and then $20 a year after that and you just subscribe. So for the rest of your life, you have the operating system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't like this like spiky pricing and then goes back down. Just make it like a subscription model. You want sticker shock. I don't know. Most people buy windows by buying a new computer so they never see the price but go to staples and say I want to buy the full version of Windows Vista and you will fall over dead in your tracks. It's like $3.99. It's it's it's insulting.  No, I did that and turned right around and left. Yes. And went and found an OEM version online. Right. Half the price. And that's what's dumb about it is because Microsoft is missing out on some sales by having outrageous pricing, I think. And encouraging piracy. Encouraging piracy. You absolutely. Just make it easy for people. This is why the Android netbooks are going to crush it. Crush it. Well, but this is what I have to say. I mean, you couldn't get Windows Vista on a netbook because it was such a pig.  But Windows 7 runs beautifully. I've put it on a number of netbooks. It is and it's it's made for netbooks. It really runs beautifully. It runs better in virtualization too. Because I've got it on virtual box and Vmware both clean and simple. It's really good.  Really good. In fact, I think I got some ire because on a Mac break weekly a couple of weeks ago, we do picks and my pick was virtual box and Windows 7. And I think a few Mac fans said, what are you insane? But some of us have to run Windows and it's really free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a good deal. What do they do for what does this do for video games? Because you know, that was like the reason I still have my tower PC here to the left. You know, and I have my Mac and I switch them is because of video games. Is it Windows 7 is fully compliant with all the great Mac PC video games? Yes, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought running it on a Mac, I'd probably run it on bootcamp for video games. Yeah, don't run it virtualization. Yeah, right. Of course. No, but the point is 7 really is Vista. Vista drivers work compatibility is 100%. But it's lightweight. So you're going to get much better results with your games. Has that been your experience, Jeff, that the PC games are well? Yeah, they do. And 50 bucks is exactly the point at which I will rush on buy it. Yes. Otherwise, I would have probably waited to the until the next time I have stolen it stolen it. Well, and that's what people got to realize is your competition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is not Mac and Linux. Your competition is bite is Bittorrent. Yeah. You know, if you charge too much, most people who would buy it know how to steal it. Yeah, get a copy from their friend, borrow their friends. And I think I understand that that $50 price is only for the preorder. Like once it comes out, it goes up to 99 bucks. Okay, well, that's good to know. It might not be something worth investigating. I mean, all this is rumor at this point. Right. Right. If Microsoft was smart, they would make this free. Put it on the Internet for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, with a subscription model in the back end or something like that. Yeah, you might be right. Yeah. One year in effect, they have they've given it away free to everybody for a year. This beta is as good as the final version. So they have they did give the first one free, you know, in a way. Yeah, it works until March. March. 2010. It works for another three months, but shuts off every two hours. Which is really outside. Get some fresh. Get some fresh air. This program. Yeah, I like that way to that's a good way to enforce the copy. The copyright is like, hey, listen, you can still get your stuff off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Off of it. But, you know, just you can't work on it for too long. I think this is an important lesson for just pundits and also technology companies. Microsoft makes mistakes. Sometimes they look really stupid because they take a lot of chances and they go big.  And it's a big company. But man, in the long term, they solve things. I mean, Xbox, the next version of the Zune is incredible. Zune 2 looks beautiful. That HD. Yeah, I'm excited.  You know, people criticize Microsoft. Microsoft promised they release stuff too often, too early. But that's a great business strategy. And so why should they stop? The Xbox didn't like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The other thing we didn't talk about with E3 is all of the really cool Xbox Live announcements with fully integrating Netflix, Last FM on your 360. Facebook, Twitter on your 360. It's all smart stuff and it's all free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Microsoft nailed it. Now all they have to do is make an Xbox 360 that doesn't keep me awake at night and I will be very...  You can Twitter, you know.  But if they can get us...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you can hear your movie, you can watch Netflix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a company apparently making, I don't know if they show this to E3, making a Xbox 360 case that has all these heat sinks on it. And so it eliminates all the fans and stuff. And I'm tempted, I have to say. I'd love to have the Xbox 360 in my living room or bedroom, but the thing is just way too noisy. It's in the garage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm with you, Jeff. I'm really excited about that Netflix that you can search the catalog instead of being limited.  Oh, it's not... Wait a minute. I didn't understand that.  That's the big announcement. It's not just that you have Netflix.  But it does have to be a play it now. It has to be a streaming movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it has to be a streaming movie, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they're supporting 1080p now.  But you don't have to go to the web and make your queue up anymore. You can just search the whole catalog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What does 1080p require? Does it require a hardwire or can you do it over Wi-Fi, you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  HDMI, I think would be...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I just mean for the internet access. You'd have to have a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they're saying streaming instantly, no wait.  Yeah, this I don't buy. I don't understand that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know what it does? From what I've heard is it does the little pixelation thing at first.  So it's not HD until it catches up and then it gives... Then it kind of upgrades it.  That's a good way to do it. That's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, I want to thank everybody for being here. You guys are great. Let's go around and give me your Twitter handles.  Here's a chance for you to plug your Twitter handle. Tom Merritt?
