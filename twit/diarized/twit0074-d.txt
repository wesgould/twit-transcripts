Transcript:  Bandwidth for This Week in Tech is provided by AOL Radio at AOL.com slash podcasting.  This is Tweet. This Week in Tech, episode 74 for October 29th, 2006. Memories.  This Week in Tech is brought to you by Dell.  Visit Leo's Picks for some great deals on Dell desktops and laptops at twit.tv slash dell.  Hi, this is Leo Laporte. I want to thank everybody for the wonderfully supportive emails and messages and comments on the website.  We missed a week last week and I think I scared some people. I didn't mean to scare you. I was just a little tired and burnt out and had a hard time putting a show together.  Well, I'm gone on a cruise right now. I'm off with the Geek Cruises Mac Mania.  But Joe Kelly did a pretty neat thing. He sent me, and this really did cheer me up, an edited version of some of the best moments, in his opinion, from many, many Twits.  I think he goes back to some of the very earliest Twits before we even were called Twit.  It's about an hour long show. I hope you'll enjoy these clips and I hope it'll whet your appetite for a future Twits to come.  You bet they're going to keep coming. And we'll be back with a special Twit from the cruise itself next Sunday, November 5th.  And then we'll be back to our regularly scheduled Twit, November 12th.  Thank you for all your support and enjoy these memories from 73 great Twits.  We got a lot of good suggestions for the show name, but one of the ones I liked the best, Patrick, was Sledgecast.  Wouldn't that be great? It's a Sledgecast.  We are going to unveil on the podcast this week our new name.  I'm embarrassed to say that it was none of, as far as I can tell, well there's two possibilities, but the one that I'm kind of in favor with, nobody submitted, probably because it's so boring.  We got so many creative, clever submissions. You want to hear some of the names that people sent in?  Absolutely.  Al Hill said, Saved by the Geeks. That's kind of keeping the screensavers idea. In fact, a number of people did that.  Claudio Flores said, WWSSD, what would the screensavers do?  No.  We'll leave that one out. There was also a G4 Eats It's Young, but in deference to G4, we'll leave that one out.  Are you now or have you ever been a G4 employee? No.  How about this one? I think you'd like this one, Patrick. Those, by the way, were all from Shane. This is from Lance. Return of the Meat Popsicles.  Excellent.  Yeah. Green Megs of Ram. That was from Kevin Davis. I like that one.  Kurt Golick said, Goodfellows, but I think maybe Geekfellows might be good. Geekfellows. What do you think? No?  That's pretty cool.  Kurt also suggested This Week in Geek, which is the closest to the one we're, I think, going to actually use.  What do you think of This Week in Geek?  That's not bad at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We can call it Geek Week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Twig.  Twig. Yeah. T-W-I-G. I like the fact that it rhymes. How about Alex's? My big fat videocast. My big fat tiger videocast.  My big fat geek wedding.  Yeah, my big fat geek cast. Let's see. Attack of the Podcast. There's a lot of them were plays on Attack of the Show, Kevin.  I think that, like Dave said, a hack of the show, which I kind of liked.  A 10-year-old named Sonia suggested Reunion of Tech Support Scholars. She wanted to keep the ROTSS acronym.  Reunion of Tech Support Scholars. John Wilson Geek Weekly. The Pocket Protectors. Ray Bromley. That was a good one.  Here's one from Dustin that incorporates all of our, you know, kind of reputations.  It's the revenge of the dark tipping, sledgehammer swinging, PC modding, lab rat tech guys.  Excellent.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's a little long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Winner.  But I like it.  Hey, the domain name is available. I'm sure.  It is. Yeah, I think we can register that.  Wasn't there a domain name somebody registered that was like, because all the other good domain names were taken, something like that.com?  All the other good domain names were taken.com? Joel suggested four guys and a box of crap.  Ouch.  Robert wasn't here last week. He doesn't know that that's the grand prize for this is we're giving a, Patrick's going to donate a box of crap from his garage.  Excellent.  That's the grand prize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This is incredible, vital, vintage computer technology.  Completely random.  Yes, and it will definitely be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  The mystery prize.  I'm kind of embarrassed to admit that we're going to, I think we're going to go, Robert, you weren't in on this conversation because you were busy finding headsets, but I think we're going to go with the boring this week in tech.  TWIT. And the only reason is I think the podcast has to say in its name what it is because otherwise when people look at it in the directory, they'll have no clue.  Is that so boring that we should just say no?  Oh, thanks for backing me up, guys.  Well, dead silence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think the Skype just faded out again.  Oh, it's, yeah, it's the Skype problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, same here, Leo, same here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, right. You couldn't hear a word I was saying.  So I've registered twit.tv. We are all twits now.  Twit.tv will be the domain.  The email address will be thisweekintech.gmail.com.  And nobody is a winner, but somebody will get a box of crap as well as the forerunners up.  We're all going to receive web hosting from VISAweb and Jinx Hackware thanks to our donations there.  Patrick, you saw that Wall Street Journal article about Corey Greenberg.  You said you worked with Corey?  I used to work with him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I used to read his stuff in Stereo File and a friend of mine, a guy I worked with for a short period of time at Windows Sources who became a friend of mine,  was his editor for a while, a couple different magazines.  I also, somebody was telling me that at least one of our former coworkers is making a fair amount of money.  I know who that former coworker is, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, I'll tell you why. I saw her at PMA, the photo show, and she looked like she was doing TV.  And she's up on a stage and she's doing the thing with the gadgets.  And it looked like it was for, so I said, what are you doing?  She said, oh, it's a satellite media tour.  I said, well, what do you mean?  She said, well, what happens is we feed this to local news stations.  I can't remember who was paying her, Panasonic or somebody.  And I show them all the products and it's never identified as being paid for by a company.  It's very lucrative.  It is very lucrative.  I don't blame her for doing it.  But I get offers to do these a lot.  I've had several offers to do these and I always say no.  And this is the thing that bugs me.  Just for people who didn't read the article, Wall Street Journal kind of outed a number of tech journalists saying that they're getting paid by the companies they're plugging on these.  And the one they singled out was Corey Greenberg, who's the Today Show's gadget guy and apparently does.  Now, what they, it wasn't clear and maybe you got a better sense than I did, Patrick.  It didn't look like he'd been paid specifically for the Today Show appearances, but that those companies had paid him in the past.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, one of the things, yeah, I mean, one of the things it was, one of the things that basically it was, one of the things it was, boy, there's a sentence in here just yearning to breathe free.  Put down the mickey.  Basically, he was never, he maintained that he was never paid to promote products he was discussing on NBC.  However, he had been promoted to do the tours by companies who, ironically enough, whose products he was demoing on NBC.  And there was no disclosure of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  That's the big thing.  It makes me mad, too, that NBC didn't say anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, they basically, they said in a couple of the follow-up articles they read, they said they've adjusted their policy for this, but they also didn't get rid of the guy who got nailed for it publicly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  We had this problem on Call for Help.  Remember Gadget Girl?  Gadget Girl, Gadget Girl.  We found out that her flights were being paid for by one of the companies and we said, sorry, you can't come back.  But the thing that bugs me is I think that people read this and assume that you and I and everybody else are all in the same basket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, I mean, there was also, I mean, there was, I mean, one of my favorite, one of my favorite, you know, because I tend not to read the threads because they make me cry.  But one of my favorite threads of all time was somebody who's like, man, Leo and Pat are totally owned by Intel because Intel advertises them.  And it was on a day where you and I just completely ripped Intel a new elite expletive because, you know, it's like Intel, it's another processor.  It's a little bit faster than the last one.  It's a lot more expensive than AMD.  So why buy it?  You know?  And it was on the same day.  It was like, these guys are so owned by Intel.  It's like Intel pays for their ads.  And we don't even know, we're sitting in the studio.  We have no idea what commercials are running.  Yeah, we have no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I remember ripping, remember the Pentium 3, they had the, that ID encoded into it so they would know, you know, unique identifier.  And I said, you know, unequivocally on, this is on Call for Help, don't buy this chip.  This is terrible.  Intel should be, you know, spanked.  Please don't buy a Pentium 3.  And immediately, like, we'll be right back.  And then, doon, doon, doon, doon, Intel presents.  And I thought, you know, I didn't know this either.  And people sent me a note saying, you're going to get fired, dude.  But to the credit of our bosses, we never heard heat from that.  I've never taken money for that kind of thing.  But I do, and I feel guilty about this.  I do have advertisers on the radio show.  I mean, they pay me to do their ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So, well, you know, are you going to fund it out of your own pocket?  Oh, wait, you have to feed your children and have a house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  You know, I kind of feel like radio, it's kind of accepted.  I mean, you look at, you know, Paul Harvey doing ads for Bose, you know,  Charles Osgood's doing ads.  It seems like on radio, it's kind of an old-timey medium where, you know,  the hosts read the ads.  So it's kind of more accepted.  I just, you know, I feel bad because I think that it's now difficult for  people to tell who's on the up and up and who's not.  And it makes it hard for me to say things like, gosh, I really love Mac OS X  because then I think people say, well, of course he does.  Apple's paying him or something like that, which they're not.  Kevin, how do you feel about it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, I don't really see a problem with accepting goods or  services as long as you let people know that up front.  You have to tell them.  You have to tell the people that are giving it to you because I've accepted  free software in the past, but I say, you know, I'm not going to give you a  plug for this.  I'm not going to rant and rave about it.  Well, that's part of the review process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I mean, we all get stuff in the mail.  Right.  That's different from getting paid tens of thousands of dollars to do fake  television news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, see, it's not that fake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I mean, how much television news is actually delivered?  Once you take out like fires and plane crashes and car crashes and covering a  court event, I mean, how much television news actually involves people going  out and digging and researching and doing hands on?  I mean, there's some good consumer reporters out there, but there's also a  lot of press release.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  No, if you see a drug company, if you see a drug report on local television  news, it's guarantee you it's produced by the drug company.  I mean, inevitably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I got a hot tip for everybody.  Seriously hot tip.  If you're going to stop the fan on your big expensive computer so that the  wine from the really loud power supply you haven't replaced, even though you  have a brand new power supply sitting in the room with you that you haven't  installed yet, when you're using that little removable steel tab that, you

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  know, the card slot cover, don't stick it in too far or there'll be a loud

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  pop and the power will stop.  So you're using the card slot to physically stop the fan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, now I'm not because the power supply is dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Dude, you're shooting for a Darwin award.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You just catch up on that part of my life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Part of the fun of working with Patrick is the risk involved.  Tomorrow, June 6th, Steve Jobs gets up on the stage at the Worldwide Developer  Conference and if the Wall Street Journal is to be believed, if CNET is to be  believed, he will announce that future Macs will not have PowerPC chips in them  but will have instead Intel chips.  That, to me, is a huge story.  Huge story.  You know, frankly, I've been saying this is the end of the world for Apple, that  Apple is, you know, this is Apple shooting itself in the foot, committing  harry-carry.  It's Steve Jobs' ultimate act of arrogance.  And the first person I thought of to call was John C. Dvorak, another member of  the Twit team who hasn't been here because his Skype is still not working.  But so I actually used this technology.  They called a telephone and called John and I asked him what he thought of  about all this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you sure make this sound dour.  I have just the opposite take that you have on this.  I mean, you're making it sound like, first of all, let's go over this.  And I did have this written up in 2003 and I expected it to happen last year in  2004 based on what I heard that was going on.  It's possible that it took longer to do the middleware part, which is going to be  the things that allow some of the software to run on the new platform much the  same way the Power PC made its transition.  Now take a look at the timing on this.  We had a 10-year period of the 68,000, then a 10-year period of the Power PC,  and now we're going to have a 10-year Intel period.  I don't see that this is such a big deal in terms of the progress that the  company has been making.  I think this is going to be one of the greatest benefits for Apple that the  company could ever imagine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, what do they stand to gain?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, what they stand to gain, first of all, is to – and I've been arguing  that they should be doing this – or they should have started doing this maybe  10 years ago, which is that they can bring out a standardized Intel platform  running this BSD Unix that they have – oh, I'm sorry, it's OS X – running on  a kind of a standardized PC platform.  They can also manufacture standard PCs for people who want to maybe still use  Windows, even though I think that there may be a swing toward OS X for Intel,  which I call a Mac Intel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So you think they're going to make a dual boot system that runs both Windows  and Apple?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's doable, and I think also if I had a choice, and I think I could  speak for most PC users, even though you've abandoned the platform, I could say  for most PC users – and I've just written this up for PC Magazine, it'll be  running tomorrow – I think most of these computers that we have on our desks,  and I think most of the PC users have all the appeal of a 1977 Plymouth.  I agree with you.  People will spend a few extra dollars to have a good-looking computer.  That means Apple can sell against Dell and HP the same machine with a premium  price, getting the margins that those other guys will never get, and pretty much  decimate the market.  I think this is probably the biggest thing Apple has ever done in terms of  potentially becoming a dominant computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  What about the Adobe's and the Microsoft's?  Are they going to rewrite their software?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they've done it before, and in fact Adobe seems to rewrite its software  every two years, or every year for that matter.  Anyway, they're all constant.  This is a recompilation thing anyway.  Adobe already has the software running on the x86 system.  How difficult can it be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Oh, it could be very difficult because their Windows version relies on Windows  API, which is non-existent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a middleware company that Apple's involved with right now, and I have  their name somewhere, but this is going to take care of that issue.  This is not going to be as big a deal as you make it out to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So the middleware company I think you're thinking of is ... Oh, I had the name  here, wait a minute.  Yeah, it's a forgettable name.  It's not a memorable name.  Is it transitive?  Yeah, something like that.  In the change from 68000 to PowerPC, these were very similar chips.  They were able to make it possible for the operating system to run both with  something called fat binaries.  The program could run in both modes, and there was a transitional period.  It wasn't a very happy period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, of course, and this won't be either.  In fact, one of the other things that Apple did was bring out that power  Macintosh upgrade card, which they can do again so people can use the old  machines and then put this card in and make a transition slowly.  My argument is this, is that Apple ... This is the time for Apple to do it.  They can suffer through a transition like this, which I agree with that part.  It's not going to be easy, but with the iPod, iTunes thing making tons of money  for them, this is the time to make this move, because this long term is a  fantastic idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, I think it's gutsy.  I think we're going to look at tomorrow as the day Apple committed suicide,  and here's why I think the exact opposite, John.  First of all, they're on a platform that is far from moribund.  I think that the cell chip, which is a PowerPC based chip, is a very exciting  future chip.  I think the Intel platform, on the other hand, has run out of steam.  I think they're moving to a processor platform that is seeing the end of its  line.  Well, there's a couple things there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One is that apparently the story has it that Steve was like stiffed by IBM  concerning the cell chip and kind of put in second place.  That I believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I can see this being an arrogant move on Steve's part, an ego move, but I think  it's going to be suicide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I again disagree.  The other thing is about the cell chip, both jobs have been poo-pooing it as  lousy, and the other guy who's, of course, these are questionable sources for  criticism.  I mean, Steve says this chip is no good, and then also Bill Gates.  Again, I agree that this is coming from a guy who's got a competitive product,  but at the same time Gates is complaining about this chip.  Some of the people within Intel have some issues with this chip.  The new multi-threaded, multi-core Intel chips are nothing to be sneezed at.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  The new Pentium D and the hyper-threading and then dual cores, they're trying to  keep this chip's family alive, but it's not a long-term solution.  You think the G5 is the end of the line for PowerPC from IBM?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, they probably will continue to upgrade the chip for their own  internal uses, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  What about the notion of Intel maybe doing something new for Apple?  You think that's credible?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It's going to be an Intel x86 chip.  It has to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, if they did something like what you just described, which nobody said,  I mean, that's purely just off the top of my head.  Highly speculative, yeah.  Yeah, totally.  I mean, there's no evidence of this.  I mean, of course, you never know.  But we would have known about something.  I mean, when my original thesis, when I first stumbled onto the meetings,  I had thought what might happen that would be interesting, and I thought it would  be kind of interesting if Apple went to the Itanium because they could use it  for the servers and it would be different and Intel's begging for people to buy  the thing.  Well, that at least has a future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  The x86 on their Intel is an end-of-line product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I'm not in agreement with that because I mean, I know where you're  coming from saying that, but in fact, you know, with the legacy out there and the  fact that this chip is just getting faster and faster with the multi-cores...

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  But Intel says no 4 gigahertz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, nobody wants to do 4 gigahertz.  They'd rather do more cores.  I mean, you can double the performance by doubling the number of cores on the  same guy because things are shrinking so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I have two cores in my G5 right now.  I have two processors.  Well, you're ahead of me.  But most people do.  We're talking to John C. Dvorak, columnist for PC Magazine, and certainly a  guy who, if anybody knows what's going on...  So you believe the CNET report.  You think this will happen tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I do, and the Wall Street Journal is also kind of saying it's a done deal.  I mean, there's a blogger out there, which I link to in my blog, if you go to  dvorak.org slash blog, who made this observation that...  He found a language observation.  He looked at the articles and noticed that they weren't...  Neither CNET nor the Wall Street Journal had any weasel words in their stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  They seem adamant, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, it was like, we got this on Good Authority, and the newspapers nowadays  are so gun shy about not weaseling out of some of these assertions that when they  don't have them in there, that's actually a signal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, especially with Steve Jobs.  You don't want to be a rumor monger with Steve Jobs.  You have to wonder if somebody from Apple is actually feeding this story to the  Journal and to CNET.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, he's done that before because CNET looks like it's picking the story up  from the Journal, but Jobs plays favorites with the high-end media, and most of  the people are irked with him about it because he'll put everybody on an  embargo to a certain date and then give the story to Newsweek so they can run it  the day before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Or Mossberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, Mossberg's a big guy.  He's like kind of a stooge for Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  And he's at the Journal, and I could easily see them feeding this to Mossberg and  him feeding it upstairs.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, that's a good point.  Excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, you know, it scares the heck out of me.  It doesn't seem like it's necessary.  I think Apple's in a good position right now.  It is a very gutsy move.  I mean, your scenario is attractive.  If they could start shipping computers that would run both Windows and OS X, I think  there's a big market for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's a huge market for it, and I think the other upside for Apple would be  that they get – one of the problems they're always going to have with only selling one  million computers a quarter compared to the hundred – to 175 million machines that are  sold every year – this is a ridiculously low number – is that you can't get the  developer interest that you can to a market that has 100 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So you think that that's the carrot they're going to offer these guys for rewriting all  of their software?  You think Microsoft's going to play along?  Office is critical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think Microsoft – no, I don't think it's as critical as you think it is anymore.  And besides that, if you bring out a dual-boot machine, who cares?  But the point is that I think Apple's been trying to get out from underneath – I mean,  that's where they've been bringing out products that kind of compete with Microsoft  products.  That's true.  And ever since Macintosh Basic, the product that was killed by Microsoft, the people in  the Mac community would love to just ditch Microsoft and go off and do their own thing.  And there's a lot of good stuff out there that runs on Unix machines.  I mean, some of it has crappy menuing systems, unfortunately, because the Unix guys, they  think weird.  But except for that picadillo, I think most of this stuff – I think you can outfit OSX  machine with no Microsoft material on it at all and do very well for yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Would you get in line to buy one of these machines?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Asking me about buying stuff is funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I know you don't have to.  But if for some reason you didn't get one, would you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the kind of machine that if I was like a computer buyer, which I'm not, I'm  a writer about computers.  I don't go out.  I just basically be testing stuff all the time, so I don't worry about buying stuff.  But if I was a computer buyer and I had the lineup of different machines out there, and  Apple, which has already developed its name as a kind of a – like I mentioned in the  column tomorrow, kind of the Lexus compared to the Fords and Chevys of Dell and HP, I  think I would buy the Lexus.  I have a Lexus.  I would buy a Lexus computer.  I mean, something that's a little nicer.  Maybe you might think it's better made.  It probably is the same company in China making them all.  But definitely a better looking machine with a lot of cachet.  I would get the Macintosh in a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, there you have it.  John, thank you on such short notice for coming on the show.  Anytime, Leo.  You know me.  So there you have it.  John C. Dvorak.  He says it's a done deal and it's a great idea.  You know, you heard me.  I just don't buy it.  Why do you think it's a bad deal, Leo?  Here, I'll give you the three reasons.  All right?  Reason number one, all your software has to be rewritten and it is non-trivial.  I know everybody's going crazy saying, oh, no, the drivers are already there.  Believe me, Adobe, just because Adobe makes a Windows version of Photoshop and a Power  PC version of Photoshop doesn't mean it's easy at all to make a Intel X version of  Photoshop.  That's just a whole new kettle of fish.  And no matter what, you know, you don't just recompile.  You rewrite and it's a lot of work.  And, you know, they went through this 10 years ago.  The only thing that might convince them is maybe there's a giant market.  So maybe we will.  Secondly, why x86?  Why not Athlon?  Why not Optorun?  Why saddle yourself with a company that's at the end of the line?  It's just, I mean, this doesn't make any sense.  Hey, Roger?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was just wondering, did you mean end of the line for Intel or just for the x86 family?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, end of the line for x86.  I mean, you've got to make a decision.  Are you going itanium?  Are you going, I mean, you think it'll be an itanium?  By the way, let me introduce Roger Chang, who's somehow taken the place of David Prager.  I don't know how it happened, but it's magic.  Roger is writing about games for GameSpot over at CNET.  And by the way, Roger, maybe you have some insight.  How did CNET get this story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, actually, I worked for GameSpot and the way CNET actually separates its division,  they keep it pretty much behind closed doors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Let's go, so let's go back.  So anyway, those are two points, and I'm sure there's a third, but address those, if you will, gentlemen.  Do you think it's a good idea, Patrick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I just think in terms of the sheer volume of the chips and the fact that they've got to be able to get the chips cheaper.  They've got to have access to better chipsets.  It just seems like, from Dvorak, had a really good point.  I mean, if you're tapping into an architecture that's going out to 125, 175 million PCs a year, it's a lot easier to get deals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So you think they had to for economic reasons?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think they probably had to for economic reasons, and it's probably getting really difficult to compete.  The reason Intel always held on to the megahertz numbers on the processors is because the marketing people always said,  if people went in and they go for the biggest number of megahertz, even if the performance is unrelated.  That's why Cyrix did branding that sort of upsold from their clock speed up to what their actual performance was.  AMD has done that.  You think Microsoft's going to rewrite Microsoft Office for it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  This is exactly the moment Microsoft's been waiting for to dump Apple.  Well, how important is Microsoft Office?  It's the number one selling application on Macintosh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What percentage of the users actually use it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, you have to have it if you want to live in a Windows world and you want to use a Mac.  By the way, here's my third...  I live in a Windows world and I use OpenOffice. I don't live on Microsoft Office.  And you can use OpenOffice on Mac, but you have to run X-Window.  Here's the third reason. I think it's a very compelling reason. It's the Osborne effect.  They're announcing now that in six months the Mini will be based on Intel, and in 18 months,  all of their products will be based on Intel. They're not going to sell one more Mac for 18 months.  That's it. Who would buy a Mac now knowing you're going Intel, and every bit of software you buy is obsolete?  This is a stupid move. I'm telling you.  We're going to look back at this and say this is when Steve Jobs fell on his sword.  Nah, I don't know about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Alright, Kevin, you just explain it to me.  This is so exciting. I'm stoked. I have two Macs, I have three PCs, and the only reason I don't just have one computer  is because I want OS X and I also want to be able to play my games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I do like a dual boot. I do like, and DeVorek brought that up, a dual boot PC Mac is attractive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's a total fantasy. You don't think that will happen?  It can happen if it's based on Intel chips, and the other thing is you don't have to dual boot at all.  They can run a nice little emulator that runs inside the OS X that will be native on the x86 based processor,  so you really won't see the slowdown that you would if you were running it in like a processor emulation type mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  You're exactly right. You don't have to do a dual boot. You could just have dual boot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'll buy emulatable or hackable, but I don't see Steve ever signing off on doing a dual boot Macintosh system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Why are you so stoked about this then, Kevin? Let's say you can only buy Macintel. Is it the dual boot that gets you excited?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the main thing that gets me excited is that I've always been a huge fan of Apple hardware.  I mean, the way they design things, the way the computer, if you take apart a G5, open it up, play with it, upgrade it, everything is laid out so clean and so well.  The power supply, every piece of that computer is just so well engineered it blew me away.  And I would love to have, I would pay a few extra hundred dollars for a nice Apple that could run my, not only my Mac applications, but my Windows as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Robert Heron, what do you think?  I see this maybe as a first stage for Apple in terms of creating competition for Microsoft in the operating systems suite down the road.  If their software suddenly is x86 compatible, then what's to keep them from maybe making a better operating system and possibly throw more competition to Windows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a great question, Robert, because are they going to release OS X as a standalone product that you can install on any x86? You don't think so?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Apple is a hardware company.  That's true. You're right.  They are not a software company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There's a nightmare in terms of legacy coverage for hardware on the Windows side. They've never had to address on the Mac side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Then all of a sudden they would have to address that. You're right. They own the hardware. They don't have to worry about it. They know exactly what they're running on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think what you do at that point is you do like what BOS did. And that is when you start to release it, you only select, here's 15 motherboards that we're compatible with.  Here's 10 different chipsets. Here's 10 different video cards. Very limited hardware support.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's like an OS X certified motherboard, OS X certified video card.  Exactly.  It's interesting because Apple has a lot of the content creation software. They have Shake. They have a few other 3D rendering.  MotionLive.  Oh, they rule the video space.  So it would be feasible that Steve could be thinking that there's so many people already invested in that software, that technology, and that learning that they had to do for it that they'll want to switch over.  Down the road when they require more powerful hardware and they require updated software to run it, it's like we, granted it's running on a new architecture, but from their point of view it should still feel and look like an OS X Macintosh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I could see this if PowerPC was dead, if IBM wasn't innovating, if it were kind of a moribund processor family. I can see it making the move. But IBM is an innovator. They're the first to use copper. They're doing this cell chip.  I know Steve Jobs poo-poos this cell chip, but I think it's going to be the fruit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But what's the software transition? What's worse, the software transition from the G5 to the cell processor or the software transition from the G5 to the Intel?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  The cell processor has a PowerPC controller chip. Now I'm speculating, but because it's a PowerPC controller chip, it's PowerPC family, I think it's going to be an easier transition, a much easier transition.  Look what happened. Microsoft has gone to PowerPC for Xbox. PlayStation has gone to cell for the PlayStation 3. Apple is going upstream. They're going the wrong direction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, but those are also relatively closed platforms and they're primarily looking at gaming performance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  But they're going to sell millions and gaming performance is very similar to 3D rendering, to MP3 conversion, to digital video. It's the stuff we do.  I think they're going against the trend in processors right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They may be bucking in the trend in processors, but I think what they're really going after here is they've realized that people won't switch unless they have that certain application or that certain game that can run on their Mac.  And the true way to do this, the best way to do it would be to run native, x86 based where you wouldn't have to have a crazy emulator. It could just run right inside of OS X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  But remember that most of these games are written to a Windows API, to a DirectX API. They're more tied to Windows than they are tied to Intel.  So you have to run Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, you would have to have the kernel running with inside there. But just like the way a virtual PC operates right now, how you can launch a Windows based application directly from the task bar, it would be the same thing but without the emulation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So what does Microsoft's take on this? Is this good for Microsoft or bad for Microsoft? Does Bill Gates support this?  Because if Bill Gates says there's no way they're going to be able to run Windows on this thing, they're not going to run Windows on it.  And do you think Bill Gates is going to say that? Or is he going to say, oh good, another chance to make some money? I don't think so.  Well, why would he say there's no way though?  Because it's a huge threat. First of all, if this works, it's a threat to Windows. And I think inherently he doesn't like this whole idea. It's Apple saying, hey, we're going to move over to your side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I think he hates the idea. But the thing is that he can't stop it if it's x86 based, that anyone can put Windows on there. As long as Apple allows it. I know Apple could stop it if they wanted to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, and I just think that if normal users are going to do it, it has to be with the cooperation of Microsoft.  Because they, well, they own, for one thing, they own the EmuLa emulator soft PC.  Would you buy one, Leo?  Oh, of course. If I buy a dual boot Windows Mac machine, I guess I would. I mean, you know, most of us, all of us live in a dual processor world. We have Windows and Macs. And that's a satisfactory solution for me right now.  I do most of my work on Macs, but you know, this tablet PC is great. I mean, I'm using it for, you know, as a date book, $2,000 date timer.  Very expensive date book.  It is, but it's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Big breakable and it won't fit in your pocket.  By the way, it'll last a half a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It's almost as small as my date timer.  It only costs 10 times more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You know, to notice again, I noticed that somebody was commenting on one of the issues Apple had with the cell processor was that there was no VMX Altevec or there wasn't a sophisticated, in any way, sophisticated Altevec board.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Doesn't need it.  Yeah.  I mean, the whole machine is an Altevec machine. It's SIMD and hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, but they'd have to redo all of the code that was made for Altevec.  Oh, yeah. Well, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, they're going to redo code no matter what now.  I mean, there's no question you've got OS X in the lab running on Intel. I mean, they've had that all along.  Yeah, Marker Project is what they call it.  Yeah. I mean, that's easy. I'm not worried about the operating system. I'm not worried about drivers.  I'm just application developers. You know, you're going to leave behind. Maybe you won't leave Macromedia behind or Adobe behind, although none of these companies have much love for Apple anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It would be interesting to know just what percentage of either, especially Macromedia or Adobe, what percentage of their sales are still to the Macintosh platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It's telling that Steve's making this announcement at the developers conference.  Clearly, the announcement is he's going to have to really kiss some butt over there and tell the ISVs, the software vendors, we love you. We're going to support you. You've got to develop for this.  He went through this in 94 when they went from Power to PowerPC. This is even worse.  Now, maybe it's easier in some respects because they know Intel, but, you know, I mean, you don't nowadays you don't write to the processor. You write to the operating system. You write to the API.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And do you think the key here is going to be a suite that he announces saying, Hey, this is the one suite where you'll be able to develop your application and easily port it to Windows if you want to kind of selling them that has to do something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  You know what, Kevin, you hit the nail on the head. I hadn't thought of that. That's exactly what he has to do. He has to say we have tools that will develop. You want right once it runs on both. You're exactly right, Kevin. That's what he has to do.  They may be able to do that. Then that now that's compelling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So will I will I be able to get a G5 in like a shuttle case in like three years?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I don't think anybody will be getting a G5 in three years. If this keeps up, you'll have to get an Xbox. All right. That's it. I think we've done this to death. Let's just go around the horn and cast a thumbs up or thumbs down. Good for Apple. Bad for Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Kevin Rose, thumbs up. Robert Heron. I'd say thumbs down for the hardware side. Roger Chang. I would say thumbs up for software. Thumbs down for the hardware. Oh, you little weasel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Patrick Norton. Hey, if it makes for a cheaper Mac, great. But I still don't believe it's going to happen. I believe it's going to happen and I think it's going to be the end of the line for Apple. I'm very disappointed.  I hope you're enjoying this best of edition of Twitter brought to you by Joe Kelly. I know I am in just a moment. Perhaps the most famous moment in Twitter history. Before we do that, I do want to remind you that Twitter is made possible by the good folks at Dell who are providing their financial support for this podcast and the entire Twitter network.  We encourage you, if it's time to get a new computer, maybe you're thinking about a Vista PC, visit Dell. We've got some great picks on our web page. Just go to twit.tv slash Dell. Take a look at Leo's picks. And then even if you don't want to buy Leo's picks, click the links there because there are some other, of course, many more great Dell deals available.  And every time you go through our page to get to Dell, we get credit. So your support and Dell support is much appreciated. Again, twit.tv slash Dell. And now, ladies and gentlemen, it wouldn't be a best of without this moment featuring John C. Dvorak and Steve Gibson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We're going to toss it to John because John's a little upset about Steve Gibson's spam filtering solution. I hate to use the word solution because it's like the total evil marketing phrase. I like saying solution once in a while because it feels so naughty. But John, you're a little upset about Steve's email management system. Steve, what would you call it? Your filtering tool?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not sure what we're talking about. He wouldn't know because he doesn't get this mail. Let me explain what he's got here. Steve, let me get the message up here. Oh, wait a minute. You're talking about the fact that we don't allow HTML here. Yeah, listen to this. There's a message going around. Everyone out there should know that kind of the inside baseball here when it comes to this show. Everybody sends a memo out on Saturday and Sunday. It goes all over the place. Check this link out. We're going to talk about this, that and the other thing. As if we planned this show.  There's actually a better plan than what Leo used to do. So you send a thing, reply to all, and then you get this message back because Gibson's email being the Mickey Mouse system that it is, instead of actually doing some real work or getting a spam filter, you get this message back that says, your HTML email was refused by our server. Hello. Your email to GRC.com was not delivered because it contains, quote, HTML formatting.  HTML stands for hypertext markup language. It is the language used by the web pages on the World Wide Web. Listen to this one. It says nearly all unsolicited commercial email spam uses HTML. This is bull, by the way, to create the... What about those Nigerian letters? I've never seen one of those in HTML.  Okay, so... It goes on and on and on. So I send it back to him, be saying, what is this BS? And I get it back again because apparently there was a link in there. So this is, to me, is just basically an insult to anyone trying to send Steve an email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't know. My email goes through fine. That's because... But once Steve approves you, because... No, no. I don't send HTML mail. I agree with him. Well, I know, but you can send Steve HTML if he approves you to send an email. Hey, HTML mail is not going away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'd be happy to whitelist you, John. No way that HTML mail is going to appear. If we just put some grease on your email, it slides right in. What's wrong with... Steve, what's wrong with HTML email? Oh, they hide tons of garbage inside of it.  Well, I mean, it really is the case that we're phenomenally buried by email unless we do that. And we've tried it as an experiment to remove the HTML filter, and it's just a phenomenal difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I would think you... I would think you... I get no spam at all. Who would say, you know, email should just be text. Now wait a minute, John, do you get no spam because you have a minion of evil helpers that sort through your mail for you so it all shows up without the spam? Or do you actually not get any spam?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do not... It's GRC automated security. I do not get any spam. How do you do that, John? I don't do it. Who does it? Mark Purcell. He's like a genius. He runs his little service called Computer Time, which is... I've known this guy for 25 years. He started off being like a net-ware guy and had a thing called Mark's Menu back in the 80s. Is this something we can use? Yeah, we could. How could we use this? You just have to go through his system with your mail and it'll show up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It'll just get cleared right out. Does he offer this as a commercial service or do you have to be a friend of his? Is it softwaretime.com? Is that his website? It's www.ctyme.com.  I use something similar. I use server-side email spam protection from MailRoute, which does work very well. CloudMark, same thing, works very well. Bright Mail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. This actually works better than Bright Mail. He actually has my server. He does the whole thing for me. But he can do just the email part of it. And I get no spam.  None?  None.  I still get 10 or 15 a day.  Okay, I'll get one thing or two sneaky in a week. And then you send it back to Mark and you'll never see it again. It's unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  What's the URL?  ctyme.com  Right.  We can't get there, but...  Because it's blocking you, Patrick. You're using HTML.  Well, it's computer-type.  Why do you say HTML email is not going away? I mean, it is a blight. The bitmail is bloated. It hides stuff. It's ugly. You don't think in-credit mail is a good thing, surely.  Actually, you know what? Wait, so this guy's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Even though it's HTML-based. Google's email service is HTML-based.  Yeah, but you can turn it off.  That's true. But I mean, by default...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, all webmail is going to...  It's not going away because the general public doesn't know what the hell anybody... what Steve Gibson's talking about when it comes to this refusal to...  In fact, I think most people, if they were writing to Steve and they got that memo, they'd go, I don't know what he's talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, then that's why he explains it so clearly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He explains it and it doesn't help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I talk about it all the time. I've been saying on the radio show for two years, don't use HTML mail.  I don't know if it's sinking in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  John, not going away.  John, you're now whitelisted, so you can send me any crap that you want to and it'll come right in.  From now on, you're getting spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, all from Dvorak.org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So, Computer Time is your web host, John, and they're using spam assassin to filter your email.  Oh, he's a spam assassin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, spam assassin is only one of the many mechanisms he uses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Okay, well, according to his website, he's using spam assassin and XM rules.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Spam assassin is very good. I think spam assassin is excellent.  And many people have it. They don't know it. Their internet service provider would turn it on if they asked.  So, in your case, John, this... go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We also know many instances where spam assassin falls positives and like blocks people who have...

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, here's what I do with spam assassin. First of all, turn off all real-time black holes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And we should point out that spam assassin runs on your email server. These are all server-side issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So, turn off the black hole stuff because you're right. Maps and orbs will have lots of false positives.  So, I turn that off. The second thing you do is you set the setting fairly high.  You set it to 8, or the default is 6.5, I think, or 6. You set it to 8.  And that way, only the really most egregious stuff gets stopped. But that's 80% of all stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, well, let me tell you another thing that he does which is not mentioned there.  He uses a three-stage filtering system and maybe spam it seriously.  You sound like you're advertising vodka, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Does it have a micronite filter? Because I thought that was really good. That's what made Kent so smooth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what? If you guys don't want to hear about it, it's fine with me. I get no spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Three-stage filter, John. Three-stage filter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My web-based email does me just fine.  Okay, tell us about the three-stage filter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what? I'm not talking about it anymore. I've already given enough publicity for this.  People out there, just go check it out. Seetime.com. Good man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Big story of the week. And it's just making me hoppin' mad.  We covered it on Security Now with Steve Gibson in detail.  I actually did an early security now because it was such a big story.  It first came to light last month, but nobody paid much attention to it.  The F-Secure people said, Sony is putting a root kit on Windows systems.  When you run Sony BMG audio CDs, hey, hey, nobody paid any attention until the fellow from Sysinternals,  who makes a root kit revealer program called Root Kit Revealer, mentioned it in his blog.  And the world came tumbling down. That was earlier this week.  So here's the deal. If you have a Sony BMG disk, they've been doing this since last spring,  that says, content enhanced and protected copy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How many titles or how many albums released?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  You know, it's not clear. Nobody's ever said. Sony's not saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let us stop buying CDs two years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  But if you look at it, you'll know because the CD will say content enhanced.  If you play it on a Windows machine, you'll get a ULA.  You'll get a license agreement that pops up and says, is it okay to install some software?  It misdescribes the software, including it implies that you can remove it easily or disable it easily.  And so most people are just saying, yeah, yeah, okay, I just want to listen to my music.  What it's installing is effectively a root kit, which a root kit, of course, is a hacker tool that hides,  allows software to hide on your computer files, to hide on your computer, hide so well,  because by patching the kernel that no program, not even the operating system, can see these files.  They're just invisible.  In fact, the way that this internals root kit revealer does it is by actually writing its own operating system code  and comparing what it gets with a directory listing to what the operating system saying.  And if there's a discrepancy, if root kit revealers finding files that the operating system doesn't know about, it says you've got a root kit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So but you don't need to you can install that for the fact you don't need to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yes, the system internals, root kit revealers. Great.  There's also one called Blacklight from F secure.  They basically both work the same same way.  But Mark Risenovich, who's at system internals, was the guy on Monday who said this is the Sony that's root kit on here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So is this because Sony decided to license protection like some kind of DRM from British company?  Were they naive and like the company that made this technology?  No, but the company that made the DRM technology decide, hey, let's put this here and make it really sloppily.  Sony just said, OK, this is probably good stuff. We'll put it on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You've got two basic options.  Either Sony went, wow, this looks like an incredibly robust system for protecting our content and preserving our revenue stream.  Or Sony knew exactly what it was doing and was like, yeah, I choose the latter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I, as someone who used to work for Sony a long time, evil.  Hey, I left. I left. OK.  He's he's long before a decade ago before the BMG thing before the beginning.  But I yeah, I wasn't there. I wasn't part of the decision maker.  But I would actually go. I would actually suggest that they may not have, you know, there's a lot of decisions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  There's a lot of decisions that they make that some executive nobody sat down with the executive and said, we're going to use a root kit.  And yeah, it's like the executive doesn't know how to check his email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Great. What's a root kit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  They said the executive is no, don't worry. No one will know it's there.  No one will be able to see it. It hides itself.  In fact, it was possible to remove it.  And they patched it just a few months ago to prevent removal.  And so what I think Sony is culpable for is is that much is somebody said to them, oh, yeah, you cannot install it.  They said, well, we don't want that to happen.  Now, this thing is so badly written that it scans your disk like eight times a minute.  It does. It double scans it.  But worse. And I think the real serious thing is it means that any file that begins with dollar sign, S Y S dollar sign, any file will disappear is immediately root root kitted.  So I, in fact, Mark, Rosinovich, who discovered this, took notepad dot exe and renamed it to dollar sign, sis dollar sign, notepad dot exe.  And it disappeared.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A quote unquote third party hacker could just take advantage of knowing that they could hide stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Funny you should mention that because there's a World of Warcraft hack that's been built around the root kids.  Oh, really? I didn't know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So so somebody's got a hack that they put on your system?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, not on our system.  It's used to cheat in the game.  Yeah. And they use that to hide it essentially.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  And any idiot 12 year old who knows enough to rename a file dollar sign, sis dollar sign can't, in fact, put anything you want they want on your system.  So not I mean, Sony can say, well, look, you know, I mean, there's rootkit technology used in Kaspersky antivirus and Norton, the trash protect.  They could say, look, this is legitimate.  Other companies use this.  But what they can't say is what really a problem is that they're opening this huge security hole on every Windows system.  It's installed now.  Here's the latest that just came out today from Mark Rosinovich as we tape this came out on Friday.  He said it's also phoning home every time you play a Sony disk.  It's calling Sony and saying what songs you're listening to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The marketing people at Sony is going, hey, this is, you know, we're trying to figure out how many people are actually listening to our audio and computers.  Isn't this great?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I think there's like this weird like mismatch because somebody started out as a hardware company and then they decided to get into the content business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's kind of like I think my impression is they got into the content business because they needed they had they lost on the hardware business because they didn't have enough.  They got beta maxed ones and they were like we're always we're going to be self sufficient.  You know, you know, and that's the same way that Apple, you know, had trouble.  And now they have lots of their own software, you know, you know, and that's the same approach in certain ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Really, if they knew what they were talking about, they would be even more culpable because this thing is so badly written.  So appalling. For instance, if you pull it out, if you do on it, if you manage to uninstall it, it breaks your CD.  You can no longer see your CD driver because it's patched.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is just another good reason not to buy any more CDs.  No more Sony CDs.  Certainly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I'm going back to the Apple.  No, but your CD tree opens all the time.  Just randomly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's going that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Going to the Apple store is not the best option because the audio quality isn't as high as it could or should be.  It isn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, I would certainly say stop playing CDs on your computer.  In fact, don't play DVDs on your computer, too, because there's a similar thing happens with this interactual player.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There's a much better lesson here.  Buy a Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  That's a good question.  I mean, we don't know because there's no Rootkit Revealer for the Mac.  I don't think it's actually possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, if you buy music from Sony that has this...  It's possible on any system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  In fact, the original Rootkits were designed for UNIX systems.  It is absolutely possible.  All it is is back-patching the kernel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess it still has to ask you because Apple, every time it goes into that, Apple is going to keep on asking you, are you sure you want to do this?  And do you have to get the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  But once you patch the kernel, all bets are off.  It doesn't matter because they can patch the kernel to stop asking you.  They can do anything they want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But if you take any of these discs and just pop it in your system and have, say, iTunes rip it, you're fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, the whole purpose is to hide the CD.  This is to keep it from being ripped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah.  So, now I don't know if this works on these.  Their use does not extend the CD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's not a digital.  It's an analog thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And by the way, they're trying to plug the analog hole.  We're going to get to that in a little bit, too.  That's a huge story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  This is a bad week for civil libertarians.  It's a bad week for American citizens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I agree.  Whether they respect their rights or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I agree.  So, in the past, remember, holding down the shift key would prevent this software from running because it prevents auto-run.  So, if you want to listen to a content-enhanced CD, hold the shift key down.  I still wouldn't put it on my computer.  And I presume if you say no to the EULA, the license agreement, nothing will happen.  We can only hope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But it's just a problem.  It's just a problem.  They'll probably just spit your CD back out.  There is a patch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Sony, the company that wrote this, XPC or Aurora, is offering a service pack one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because they found a better way to hide it.  Oh, yeah, well, take that one out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I don't trust them, but they say it makes it so that you can remove it.  It's 3.5 megabytes.  It's a huge download.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A service pack for a root kid?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, a service pack for a root kid.  See, that sounds dangerous.  That's all I'm saying.  We'll put links to Mark Resinovich's blog postings because those are really the most complete.  And I urge people also to listen to Security Now because Steve and I talked about it quite a bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Somebody else went out, went to a record store with a list of the name of the CDs that had this on them.  It was like, I understand there's supposed to be a EULA I can read according to Sony's websites.  Which there is.  And then the people in the store are like, huh?  You know what I mean?  It's just not printed on the label.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So I hope there's serious repercussions for Sony for this because this is just bad corporate behavior.  I'm not picking the PS3.  John was playing for us.  You might want to play a little bit of this.  Ted Stevens, who is from Alaska, although I was confused earlier.  He's on the tele...  Is he the chairman of the Telecommunications Committee?  Indeed.  And the guy who is spearheading the new Telecommunications Bill this week of the Senate voted...  Well, actually, they didn't vote to eliminate the net neutrality provisions.  They just didn't vote to include it.  It was a tie vote.  Yeah, 11-11.  Committee couldn't agree, so it needs to be a majority to put it in.  So the net neutrality provision is gone.  And we have, I think, this fascinating explanation of net neutrality from Senator Stevens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What the Senate is talking about is allowing all of these entities that support this to provide streaming stuff going on the Internet.  Now, the Internet, you know, let's go back.  The Internet started with a concept of local-to-local connections across the country.  And you could go for Alaska, but you had to go through local connections to get there.  The industry wisely provided for streaming for, in effect, a new kind of long distance.  And that's what we've got.  We've got a service that's immune to distance.  And it's there for the consumer.  But when we take and really indicate that anyone that wants to use this system for massive, massive commercial purposes, there's one company now you can get, sign up, and you've got a movie delivered to your house daily by subscription, by delivery service.  Okay?  And currently it comes to your house, put it in a mailbox, and you get home, and you change your order.  But you pay for that, right?  This service is now going to go through the Internet.  And what you do is you just go to a place on the Internet and you order your movie.  And guess what?  You can order 10 of them and the delivery charge is free, right?  10 movies streaming across that Internet.  And what happens to your own personal Internet?  I just the other day got Internet, was sent by my staff at 10 o'clock in the morning on Friday.  I got it yesterday.  Why?  Because it got tangled up with all these things that are going on the Internet commercially.  And here we have this one situation where enormous entities want to use the Internet for their purpose, to save money for doing what they're doing now.  They use FedEx.  They use the delivery services.  They use the mail.  They deliver in other ways, but they want to deliver vast amounts of information over the Internet.  And again, the Internet is not something that you just dump something on.  It's not a big truck.  It's a series of tubes.  And if you don't understand, those tubes can be filled.  And if they're filled, when you put your message in, it gets in line.  It's going to be delayed by anyone that puts into that tube enormous amounts of material.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It reminds me of that old April Fool's gag I did some years ago where I said these guys are trying to pass a law saying you can't be drunk when you're using a modem.  Drunk driving on the information superhighway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  You know, I can actually see these guys doing it.  And now look, Stevens is one of the three oldest senators.  He obviously didn't grow up with the Internet.  He didn't even grow old with the Internet.  He doesn't use the Internet, period.  He doesn't even use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, that's right.  He's the guy who was trying to sneak the broadcast flag into the neutrality bill.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's a weenie.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  You did blog this week about Kevin's cover.  We might as well just start off with that.  First of all, Kevin, embarrassed or not, I think it's wonderful.  I mean, you're getting a lot of recognition from Businessweek.  It was kind of the accounting in the article is a little strange.  As they pointed out in the article, your dig is breaking even.  But on the front page, they say this kid made $60 million in 18 months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, a dig isn't even breaking even.  So they got that wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, Kevin, you're taking this out to dinner, didn't I, with all that money?  Yeah, 60 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have no, there's no, I'm not a multimillionaire.  I'm not even a millionaire or a thousandaire.  I don't know how they came up with that cover.  But I guess it was just based on, they put a value to the company.  $200 million.  And you have 40%.  They estimated how much, yeah.  It's all estimates and obviously it's just paper fake money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, I thought, Leo, you kind of liked that piece.  I thought the article read like a slipshod hit piece.  Really?  You think it was a hit piece?  It would seem like it to me.  It was Snyde.  He called him a kid.  I mean, the guy, you know, Kevin's 30 or close to it.  And I mean, if you look on the pictures, you got a six o'clock shadow for God's sake.  I mean, it doesn't even look like he's young in that thing, except for the crazy outfit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  And they called him the Tom Cruise's doughier little brother.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and they had about the tech TV loser, you know, kind of a loser on tech TV, you know,  unknown, I mean, the whole thing just rang.  You know what, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I'm mad as hell now.  I'm mad.  Dang it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was pretty crazy how they came up with that cover shot.  So the whole deal was going into this.  Honestly, it was just an interview for we were going to be one of the companies featured in the article.  We had no idea it was going to be a cover or anything like that until the actual day that it went out to press.  So they didn't even warn you before that?  No, they said there's a possibility it might be.  But they go, we want to take a photo of you, you know, come out.  And, you know, it's for the inside of the magazine.  Just, you know, there's guys walking their dogs.  There's guys with hockey gear on, you know, do something fun.  So like they're throwing some headphones and, you know, just give us a couple of different poses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Did they give you the backwards cap or was that your idea?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, they basically, I mean, they had me like drinking a beer.  They had me doing all different kinds of things.  And they're just like, you know, we'll see which one everyone makes it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Did they get you to try one of those crazy tennis shoe lacings that all the kids are into these days?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I didn't have to do that.  You got to get a handler.  I had to draw the line somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  You need a man. You need somebody to protect you from this stuff.  It is a mixed blessing though to be on the cover of Business Week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Of course. I mean, I'm honored to be on the cover.  But I mean, I was with the whole 60 million.  This kid made 60 million dollars. I didn't make anything, you know, the company.  While we have a path to becoming a profitable company, we are not a profitable company.  You know, we're continuing to work on that with Federated Media and some other companies that we're signed up with to serve ads on the page.  Go Federated Media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  This is John Battelle's company. They sell banner ads, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  Go Federated Media.  And why do you say that, Corey?  Well, because that's what Boing Boing gets its money to.  Oh, all right. Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Is Boing Boing all Federated Media? You don't have anybody else on there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, no. So it's a little complex because John's also personally our business manager.  So I think he occasionally does deals on our behalf with entities other than Federated Media, but it's pretty much all Federated Media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Battelle was a journalist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Well, and an entrepreneur. He founded the industry standard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It's kind of an interesting thing though. Now he's selling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kevin, did you prefer the alternate cover that got posted?  What was the alternate cover?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ah, yes. You mean the 40-year-old virgin one?  Yeah. Yeah.  The comparison? Striped shirt, striped shirt. That was awesome.  Wait a minute. Where is that? I didn't see that. Was that on Dig?  Yeah. There's a bunch of different alternatives out there which are just amazing. They're really cool. A bunch of people with Photoshop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Oh, my goodness. Well, I think in some ways this kind of attention is a bad thing for a company because it puts pressure on you.  Of course, a lot of weasels come out of the woodwork saying, hey, kid, I can help you with that $60 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, the day it was posted, I had someone from Goldman Sachs email me like, hey, if you need money management.  I'm like, I can't even afford a couch. I just moved into my new apartment. Leave me alone. I don't have $60 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I'm sure it's going to be an avalanche at some point of stuff.  Yeah, it was pretty funny.  Bugging you.  Well, you know, after listening to that, it reminds me really that there are so many moments. There's quite a few that are missing from that.  But it's great to hear those. And I thank Joe Kelly for putting that together, JK Software.  You did a great job. And maybe we'll just have to do another one with some of the other great moments. Your nominations are appreciated.  Thank you so much for all of your support. And another 75 twits ahead, at least.  I'm Leo LaForte, and it's just time for me to say, another twit is in the can. Take care.  Too much work. The problem is, there's no limit. My server's completely collapsed. So here's the deal.  I'm just trying to get the thing up, but I have a hell of a time. What what what blue screens like? Forget it. I'm killing you.

Transcript:  Do the twit.  Do the twit.
