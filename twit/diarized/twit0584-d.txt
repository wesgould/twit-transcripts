I guess we should we should update you on the note 7  That's been kind of the lead story for the last month hot story. Well, and now I think there's a word  There's a coda to it. I think the whole thing is over now because as Samsung

Start time: 399.38
End time: 443.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  According to the Journal is permanently discontinuing the note 7. There will be no more note 7s. They gave up on that phone  Which I think was the right call ultimately. They probably should have done it a little bit earlier  But yeah that phone is discontinued they made two and a half million in the initial  Versions of the phone then they recalled those and they brought out some new ones  I'm not exactly sure how many they brought in the second wave  But they started burning exactly and now so all of them have been recalled and they're not making them anymore  So if you have a note 7 don't don't take it back. Take it back to wherever you bought it from  Every carrier is taking it back, you know target Amazon Samsung's offering some blandishments

Start time: 452.90
End time: 455.56

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, it sucks because  you know, I've been reviewing Android phones for for maybe seven years now and  The phones from Samsung haven't been any better than they are right now. They're actually really great hardware. They have fantastic cameras  I still have troubles with a lot of Samsung software changes to Android  But you know, they're at the top of their game and the if you want to stick with Samsung  The Galaxy s7 is great and there are no reports of  batteries starting on fire or exploding or having any of these issues  but  You know the note 7 has these problems and you know, you got us to your clear of that. So  I don't blame a lot of people for giving up on Samsung right now  I think for us were in this mode of they have to kind of win back our trust and and and we're not necessarily  Recommending people stick with Samsung, but we're not necessarily telling people to flee them either  It's it's gonna be a personal choice. But whatever you do  Don't play around with that note 7 because you're literally putting yourself and the people around you at risk  We don't say that lightly  But there's never been a re recall of a smartphone free recall  Yeah, there's never been anything like this and and you know as we know, you know, they're not allowed on US flights anymore

End time: 561.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As of Saturday yesterday noon the Transportation Administration has banned  Yeah, not even if it's off you cannot bring it on they'll confiscate it actually I like the punishment they also said  You're not gonna be able to put it in the seat back or above you have to keep in your pocket. Yeah  Cuz we want to know when it catches on

Start time: 562.58
End time: 582.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hear you screaming. It's better you're saying that you're not telling people to get away from Samsung. I am  partly because of the there was the famous  Misdirected email where they intended to communicate internally when a customer complained and  Accidentally copy the customer and there was a lot of there was a there was an intent

Start time: 582.44
End time: 595.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is shady the the replacement phone that caught on fire on Southwest Airlines. Yeah, that's right  They sent a an email accident or text the accidentally to the customer saying what do you want us to do about this?  Should we sit on it? Yeah

Start time: 597.08
End time: 638.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really shady and this is based on a history and and and Ben can chime in because a lot of this was from  Taiwan but  You know  They were fined more than a quarter million dollars by Taiwan's equivalent of the FTC a few years ago three years ago for astroturfing  Online forums paying fake users to go in there and talk up Samsung  They were fined for lying in Taiwan for lying in ads about smartphone features  They were caught cheating on benchmark tests multiple times and caught lying about the cheating  So this is a company of questionable integrity and I think that I think it's a good idea for people to vote against  Shady business by not buying Samsung phones. That's my own personal opinion

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love the New York Times take on this Brian X Chen writing in the New York Times  Interviewed a number of people including a battery expert Park Chul-won former director of the Center for Advanced Batteries at the Korea  Electronics Technology Institute. He said he didn't think it was the battery  He said Samsung was too quick to blame the batteries  I think there was nothing wrong with them or that they were not the main problem  He said and I think that this is the great way to end this article from the New York Times  The problem seems to be far more complex  The note 7 had more features and was more complex than any other phone manufactured in a race to surpass iPhone  Samsung seems to have packed it with so much innovation  It became uncontrollable. Well, even they didn't know how it worked  Too close to the Sun

Start time: 686.50
End time: 696.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's such a ridiculous  Argument to me. I mean, you know, we are we are pushing these phones  You know further than they've been before we're asking more the batteries and the processors than ever before

Start time: 697.86
End time: 702.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But Samson could not replicate the problem and they released a phone with the same problem thinking it was safe

Start time: 703.14
End time: 758.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly, and I think part of the issue was and I spoke to some battery experts in some stories  I wrote myself was that  The phone start on fire and they destroy a lot of the evidence they would look to to figure out what the problem is  So it can literally be the chemistry of the device  It could be basically there's there's two electrodes  Inside of each of these batteries. There's a separator between the two because of these two electrodes touch  They will catch fire  The batteries themselves could be contaminated during the manufacturing process and there are electronics that control how the battery works  Outside of the battery and and then you know, there could be other issues that prevent the battery from stopping taking a charge and overheating  I mean there's there's there's literally dozens of reasons why this could be the case  but  To say that there's too much innovation  Just it's like, you know, it's a big phone with a stylus. It's not that different than any

Transcript:  Seven which is functionally a very similar phone. It's damn near the same thing is not bursting in  This is true. I mean if you look at if you look at the the iPhone

Start time: 768.84
End time: 787.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What does it call the iPhone touch disease problem where some iPhone 6s and 6 pluses?  We it's not that there's too much innovation  I think that everybody's acting so hard that is true that everything's turned up to 11 and they're trying to be thin and small  And maximum battery life and maximum and so I think we're gonna see a lot more of this kind of thing

Start time: 787.56
End time: 967.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But what's the consequence to Samsung as a company? Well, I was just real quick on the other battery point  I think the one important thing to note is that the  Samsung the iPhone 7 plus the battery capacity is is  Mah what does that mean?  Millie million powers. Thank you. The iPhone or the Samsung note 6 was 3,000  So just just a hundred more whereas the note 7 was 3,500 and that  Given battery technology is largely a function of size and so basically they were putting in a larger battery  significantly larger, you know 17 percent or so larger into this phone and  And this is this is really that I think to me. I'm surprised they haven't  said definitively what it is because when they replace the first one the  The the Samsung SDI batteries where they basically threw their corporate brother under the bus  It was super interesting that happened because Samsung SDI is also an Apple supplier  As he is as his ATL and Apple at the time had this really snarky statement saying  we're very confident in in the the design of our phones and something to that effect and that that's not a problem here and  basically the the  this consumer protection agency said something effect that the the phone the battery was too big for the phone and  Well, no that that actually makes perfect sense because to to to go further on the point of how these batteries are made  They're actually very very thin layers of the of the two chemicals with a porous layer in between and what happens is when they are  And so there's multiple multiple multiple thin layers  And if they are squeezed that is 100% a way to to start a fire  With this battery and so it seems I'm not a battery expert but the given the the the comments by the  Director of the construction agency that he felt the battery was or that Samsung  I believe I told him the battery was too big it would certainly make sense that the  Replacement battery which is presumably the same capacity might also have a similar problem again  We don't know for sure  But to me if we need to have a packing innovation to me that sounds like literally packing in a battery  That's too big to to make the phone competitive from from a battery standpoint again. We don't know for sure what what what it is  I'm not about like none of us are battery experts  But that just from a very quantitative aspect that massive jump in capacity  without a similarly massive jump in the size of the phone itself and  You know, unfortunately with battery technology, we don't have that level of breakthrough  That certainly seems like a possibility as to as to what's happened and really I think  makes this much worse for Samsung than it would have been because  Initially I was never on the like this will be good for Samsung the long run face because that was what was the logic?

Start time: 968.42
End time: 970.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, how would this be good for?

Start time: 970.86
End time: 975.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, there were there were some people saying that right exactly and they're showing that they're they're trustworthy, etc, etc

Start time: 976.64
End time: 985.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They've been on every step of the way they haven't explained what happened to this date  They've had really terrible communication with their customers  You know, you're pretty the choir your business

Start time: 987.56
End time: 1002.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If it had stopped with the replacements in other words if they had been able to fix it and replace it  I think it might have  Possibly redounded well to Samsung's reputation now  Quickly and they did the right thing and everything's good. But then to put out phones that continue to burn. That's it

Start time: 1003.42
End time: 1013.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But even then that was never it's never a good thing it's never ever good in exploring phone  So but my whole point is that that entire and all for example, we're survived its recall

Start time: 1013.34
End time: 1023.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It wasn't Tylenol's Ford survived the Pinto survived right?  So now survived a few laptop battery situation will Samsung survive? I mean why would yeah, I think Samsung will survive but

Start time: 1024.64
End time: 1044.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they've got this reputation that's seeping into the popular culture  I was at a coffee shop a couple of days ago and there was this family had a couple of kids  they asked me to take their picture and they handed me a phone and  It was a it was an iPhone and before I took took possession of it. I'm like, oh is that an iPhone 7?  Yeah, and he said it's the one that doesn't burn

Start time: 1046.66
End time: 1051.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's probably the level of understanding of normal. Yeah, they're gonna be a punchline for a very long time

Start time: 1051.82
End time: 1053.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The one that I doesn't burn. Yeah

Start time: 1054.64
End time: 1205.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  yeah, I think so I think just to just to continue my point the  I  Think long-term damage is is significant  I like my whole point for me was to say that it this was never a good thing and anyone who said so was  Being silly to just to be just to be clear  But you're right there have been brands that have survived recalls like it does it does happen, but  Well, there's a few interesting things on that point  I mean like so one the initial recall was was was bad and anyone who says it wasn't is is is confusing themselves  But the double recall is  Really? I think it's really significant and obviously the short-term  Financial impact is going to be massive as you would expect but the long term. I think there's a really  There's a really  big problem with brand perception and I think it's going to be  It's gonna be pretty significant not just in the US but also in in other countries  I think one area where Samsung really hurt themselves was in was in China where  They launched the phone in China the same day the recall was announced in in the US  And when they said that it's fine because they use a different battery  Yeah, and that in me of course the same day in China and the China  You know internet is extremely active extremely fast and diffusing information true or not  There are mealy account reports that there were  Where there fires in China there were and and the reason why this was so damaging was they were  I think in retrospect pretty arrogant about saying don't worry about it. It's a different phone  It's gonna be fine and dismissing them outright and really I think  Causing it arguably even more damage. I mean it's bad enough in the US you get on every airplane  They say do you have a Samsung turn it off? I mean, that's that's brand publicity  You can't pay money for it. Unfortunately, it's going in the wrong direction  But I think the sort of arrogant attitude they took in China in particular is going to be very damaging and have long-term repercussions  For their brand particularly in China where the the big advantage they have in the in the Western countries is there's not a queer  alternative to prima premium Android  Obviously in the long run Google is a huge threat to them and we could certainly top of that more but in China the Huawei  Phones in particular are doing very well at the high end there  It's the market with the strongest alternative to a Samsung phone and I think they're that's gonna be a massive problem for them

Start time: 1206.62
End time: 1220.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, where there's competition where there's a choice I think consumers probably will just especially Android phones  Which seem like a commoditized product? Oh, yeah that the note 7 was unique because it had a stylus  It was a big phone with a small body. I mean a big screen with a small

Start time: 1220.94
End time: 1256.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a difference in the short term short term. They're gonna be hammered  No question and they're gonna feel this for for a while  the real damage is the potential long-term impact on their brand and the reputation and  Like stuff like this can be hard to recover from I mean yes  I get the point those people were driving at that that we were making fun of that  It's not gonna be a big deal is that yes if you handle it  well  you can establish a certain level of  People will give you a chance and you can establish some level of trust, but they've not only obliterated that opportunity  They've made it 100 times worse by blowing and I still won't eat it jack-in-the-box

Start time: 1257.78
End time: 1260.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so I mean there are there are brands Chipotle still you know

Start time: 1261.48
End time: 1270.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Them a scant as well yeah, and and and what you said the Google's timing with the pixel could not have been that  We're Apple both Apple and Google came out with premium phones

Start time: 1270.40
End time: 1286.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I'm sure Samsung was well aware that this was about to happen that all provided an alternative at exactly the same price  We're I do want to talk about the Google phone at some point because the pixel as attractive as it is  It costs as much as a note 7. It's awfully expensive. I think it's a bit too expensive. I think it's too expensive

Start time: 1287.02
End time: 1289.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think this may hurt them. Yeah, and if you drop it in the toilet, that's it

Start time: 1290.38
End time: 1303.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not water resistant. Yeah, yeah, yeah ever bothered me. I don't drop a lot of funds in the toilet, but  The Huawei is it the honor 8 is that the one that's the one you can get in the US now  Is that the phone that's doing so well in China Ben? Yeah?

Start time: 1304.02
End time: 1338.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, how I has has had a very hard time in the United States in particular  They kind of pin their hopes on the Nexus 6p. I think there was a  Miscommunication about Google's goals with the Nexus it wasn't which I think are  Widely treated as a Huawei phone, right? Yeah, right. Well, it actually Google asked Huawei to  To make the the pixel as well, but they were not down with the no branding or so. I didn't know that  Oh, that's interesting. So HTC won the contract. Oh, that's why I just I mean because HTC is yeah is is their toast

Start time: 1339.12
End time: 1340.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they'll do anything

Start time: 1341.40
End time: 1348.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think there's a  The difference between the next we can get into this but the difference between the Nexus and the pixel I think are

Start time: 1348.74
End time: 1379.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Significantly greater than just a name change. Yeah, let's let's say though because I think that's an interesting conversation. Definitely  Yeah, I do know that Huawei and ZTE both Chinese manufacturers have pretty compelling Android devices  Which they are for the first time selling into the US the honor 8 and the X the axon 7 which are really pretty nice  Devices  And I'm just wondering if that maybe is another reason why Samsung should be a feared  Well, this could be also half the price of the Samsung phone

Start time: 1379.96
End time: 1411.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah  This could be an opportunity for you know  The Motorola is the the even Sony a lot of those companies if they can deliver the right products at the right time  I think what we've seen that I'm really interested in is this kind of mid-range of Android phones that are maybe like 300 400 dollars  significantly  They offer high and like one plus three one plus three even even the next bit Robin  I really liked a lot as well  Motorola's been playing that space and the Nexus line used to play in that space as well  But Google's never really put the marketing effort behind. I'm gonna offer a counter argument

Start time: 1411.72
End time: 1446.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think this could be the end for not just Samsung before Android  Because it comes on the heels of a lot of Android malware a lot of security concerns  Google's fighting a you know kind of a rearguard action with security because most only the Google phones really are guaranteed to have the monthly  security updates, yeah  There is gonna be always gonna be a market for Android at the low end cheap phones  You don't have a choice, right? But at the high end in the flagship market  I'm wondering this if this doesn't give Apple a chance to eat the entire market

Start time: 1447.02
End time: 1468.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You might be right but it seems as though a lot of people don't associate Galaxy phones with Android  I mean you talk to a lot of different brand and  People like I have a galaxy like do you have an Android and they don't even know what you're talking about  Yeah, maybe like half the time. I feel like and you know, this is anecdotally when I'm talking to folks  I don't know what you guys think but Samsung would like you to think that

Start time: 1469.74
End time: 1496.11

Who was it that did that?  Point point anyway  Fascinating was a point pointer was a pointer might have been pointer  And what it scared me in the very first article I said here comes the ad tech  That really worked well for the web why would anyone want to take a nice  pristine thing like a podcast and start doing things like monitoring users and yeah and  Intrusive advertising and all of that

Start time: 1922.98
End time: 1968.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean the the challenge is that I mean you notice it's not an accident that Squarespace is successful because the nature of their business is  They have massive they have two things one. They they have a way to track conversions, which is a very common thing  They have a way to track conversions, which is that code which is why you have the the battle of the affiliate codes  But two they have significant lifetime values  So you see a lot of these purchases are Squarespace the lifetime value of a customer is pretty significant  so the spend the spend is worth it and the  Any of things like Casper mattresses for example is a common advertiser  That's a relatively high price item and you don't see a lot of  relatively lower price  Items that that don't have a easy means of tracking I mean

Start time: 1968.78
End time: 1987.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well they because they want to be on an 80 million down, you know viewer  They want to be on television right where there's a lot of  Reach and we don't offer massive numbers. We offer quality numbers, but if you're trying to sell a million pencils  It's not going to be very useful. That's right. Right quality isn't what you're getting on right?

Start time: 1987.46
End time: 2046.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they're there that means there's a bit of a chasm in in which  Without evidence that there is there is a benefit it's not worth the the effort of doing it and I think that you know  that certainly no one wants advertising tech like like the web, but I think it's  It's not it's easy for people who are established in podcasting to say everything's great. Let's leave it the way it is for forever  But the the reality is is the medium is not going to reach its full potential  and  With the current model like it's gonna be it's gonna be ultimately, you know crimped and I think that would be unfortunate  so hopefully there can be some sort of middle ground where there is a  model that works for more advertisers than a very distinct set that advertises now and  There's a whole world of advertisers as massively larger and has a lot more money that doesn't right now and that's just because  Without any sort of measurement. It's not worth the it's not worth the maybe maybe there's also a big category of the brand

They can't really say well  Let's see how the car sales do tomorrow  But they do a lot of research Bay and they bet they bought podcasts and some brands have I think that's gonna be  Where you're gonna see it and their ad tech isn't gonna help them either  It's it's just a kind of a faith an act of faith that  You can get build a brand on a podcast and they haven't come to that conclusion yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's actually a couple things in the podcasting world that I'm really interested in  That I think might be able to address some of the issues we're talking about  They aren't coming from an advertising centric place yet, but there's an app called 60 DB  That I actually was looking at the other day an early version of it and twits on there  but  It's basically some former NPR folks some former Facebook folks and some former Netflix folks  people who worked on the newsfeed and also the recommendation engine for  For  Netflix and they're all about basically delivering you short form podcasts based on your interest  So they are amassing some data they want to be the Netflix of podcast exactly and then this American life  Came out with something for their podcast where you can share a short like 30 second clip and they're trying to make I think the headline  Was trying to make it as shareable as the GIF shareable would be great

Start time: 2136.06
End time: 2156.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not excited about anything that commoditizes. Yeah our premium product  So yeah, so so 60 DB is not something I'd be looking for but it might help others  I just feel like anything that commoditizes the product isn't gonna be a long-run solution for anybody who's making the content  It'll be interesting that's what's happening newspapers they become commoditized nobody goes to New York Times comm  Yeah, yeah

Start time: 2157.06
End time: 2190.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But one of the problems that you see is that you see a lot of podcasters who are do trying to you know  They're supposed to be doing the kind of ads that you do but you can tell that they don't care  They don't know about the products really they're pretending to they they don't sell it. They don't believe in it  They don't they haven't vetted the advertisers and so they're just like radio in other words  They're simply employees doing what they were told and and it you can you can't fake it  Yeah, right. Yeah, and that's the difference  So sometimes on this network it works great and on other networks the exact same general idea completely fails

Start time: 2191.34
End time: 2244.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a good point. I I will always  fall in favor of not even thinking about advertising but thinking about the community and  And building the community's loyalty because I think in the long run  Advertising works on podcast because the people who listen to those podcasts care about the price and want to support them  And instead of asking you to give us money directly we say well  Here's some products you might be interested in and if we pick the products wisely  And that's a big part of it. Yeah, then the audience can show its loyalty by  By buying those products. That's a very handmade process. Yes, that's not something that's ever going to translate to mass media  Right, which is fine with me. I work in mass media. I know about mass media, right?  This is not mass media and I'm happy about it  Alright, let's talk. Let's see. Where should we go from here? Should we talk about Yahoo? I'd love to talk about

I don't know. Does that really say what the category is virtual assistant appliance about that? Yeah  Really is no, I think no what what my category what my what Mike just said is is is spot-on

Transcript:  well soon advertise  He started by kind of recounting the the history of technology as he as he characterized it  Which was the you know the PC then the internet then mobile and then he said the next epoch is going to be AI  I would quibble with a the I definition a little bit which you can get to in a second  But the the that was the context was Google Assistant  They spent 20 minutes going over Google Assistant before they got to any hardware and and that is the context in which the hardware  was being introduced I think that's that's really important to understand because  You talked about the pixel phone it being expensive and stuff like that. Well, I guess the  The question is what why is pixel different? Why does that new name? Why is it not come Nexus?  Why do they have a deal with Verizon? They never had a deal with Verizon before why are they spending a lot of marketing?  I was watching. What was I watching? I was watching the Wisconsin Badgers game. I'm having a rough football weekend

Start time: 2362.84
End time: 2374.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they had those terrible pixel ads. Yeah. Yeah, right, but  They spent what was it a huge amount of money in 24 hours several million dollars  I know $3.2 million in two days

Start time: 2375.68
End time: 2406.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's money that they've never spent. They've never spent previously and so I to me my reaction to that is is to  figure out why is this such a completely different approach and then you back up you think about the assistant and you know, we I  Expect the Google assistant to be excellent. I've ordered a pixel phone. I'm for trying it and  You think about it. Why wouldn't it be?  That's what Google is good at and Google's technology is very very well placed for a quote-unquote AI future

Start time: 2407.06
End time: 2414.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But this is a very different play by Google because they're putting for the first time ever a feature in their phone that other Android handset

Start time: 2414.42
End time: 2509.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Manufacturers don't yet have access exactly exactly because what's the problem?  The problem is that the future is terrible for Google's business model Google's business model is about providing users a  selection and they pick one and  They put their advertisers in the competition against each other and the user selects the winner of that competition  That doesn't work at all in an assistant world  They don't have a business model for the assistant world. And so you look at what they're doing boy  Well, what's what does Apple do at Apple you don't buy an Apple because you want an iPhone per se although that is a significant  Advantage Apple has that's definitely the case in many markets again, particularly in China  I think is a great example of this but you buy it because it's the only way you can get iOS if you prefer iOS  You only have one option Apple effectively has a monopoly on iOS and you buy an iPhone you give Apple a huge margin to do so  well if Google assistant ends up being the best assistant by a long shot and  If assistants end up being a viable way that people interact with the world  What is a very what is a proven way to make money on a highly differentiated feature?  To sell a very high margin piece of hardware. That's the only way to get it and  Given that context and what they're doing  I think at a minimum Google's at least exploring a pretty significant shift in their business model and  All the evidence of spending lots of money to promote it having it only on their one device all these things at least suggests that they're  Experimenting with the world beyond sort of AdSense and to me  That's why this is one of the most interesting announcements that that we've seen in a very long time in tech

Start time: 2509.52
End time: 2538.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Generally, I completely agree that sounds really compelling but at the Google event  I was there and in speaking with a couple executives and the head of the search team and the head of the home team  That's not what they're doing  They told me that they're gonna make the assistant available  To be built into as many devices as possible and in fact they said to expect at CES that there would be a wave  of assistant speakers  Made by other manufacturers at lower price points

Start time: 2538.80
End time: 2546.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that sounds good adding assistant is a simple thing to do  It's a very simple existing phones and they also hacked and Google approved it

Start time: 2546.04
End time: 2580.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they also spoke about at the event that they're gonna open up an SDK next year to allow other people to create other assistant  Commands, so you might be right and here's the here's the thing is is with Google  You can never really tell what the hell they're doing because they will change their mind  So I think you know  What they're telling me versus what what Ben is saying could be the future are two totally different things and they might be  Flirting with both and to see where they gain traction first might be the direction

Transcript:  To be it's a very and I've also heard with a big question to me is is the phone OEMs. So  One I've heard rumors as well that Google is is making it available in some way form in manner to phone OEMs  What I'm curious about is two things one. It's not a part of Android  It is a separate thing. So are they going to be charging the OEMs for it?  That would be an interesting revenue stream for this and you add on that the fact that Samsung  acquired Viv the personal assistant and it seems  that's a  Surely Samsung knew this move was coming.

Start time: 2697.82
End time: 2739.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it was great. It was great my general observation  This is Obama is that it has been that AI has been seeping into our lives in all sorts of ways  We just don't notice a part of the reason is because the way we think about AI is colored by popular culture sci-fi  Yep, there's a distinction between  generalized AI and specialized AI  All you hear about in sci-fi is generalized AI the kind of thing you're talking about  But that's hard to do  It's not he says my impression based on talking to my top science advisors who are obviously probably pretty good  Is there were a reasonably long way away from that?  It's the specialized AI that we're going to see and are seeing every aspect of our lives from medicine to transportation to the grid. I  thought that was very

I hope it doesn't hope it sounds like scar. Yeah  But essentially it will do three things and there are three and and these three things are essentially all the things  So first of all, it does everything that the public the thing that Obama was talking about the public AI  The Google search type of things the generic things a be it will do  It'll know all your personal data in the case of assistant it will know everything every Gmail  Message everything you do. I will monitor your search results  it'll do all that kind of stuff in purse and also pay attention to what you do and how you interact with it and  Give you a personal Google and then the third thing is to control every object  Every smart object in your world all three of those things simply by having a conversation with this AI  So you just say I want this I want that and what AI enables you to do which  Alexa does not is  It will choose the third-party service  Right because right now with with Alexa you have to you have to install it.

So it's a race and it works the best if it has the best AI if it's the most ubiquitous and if it's the most  Personalization and Google wins on all three of those Walt Mossberg wrote

Transcript:  On the business model perspective the  It's not clear to me one that there is a business model there as an intermediary and two  Even if there is and if there are some categories where they can charge some sort of like affiliate fee to get back to our  our sort of podcasting  Example here Chrome example. It's yeah  It's an affiliate fee model is going to be a significant top line reduction for Google's business right now  Google's search business generates in parts as high revenues  Because there is a lifetime value calculation that goes into a lot of these advertisements where these customers are looking to acquire a user for a  Ongoing relationship not just a one-time relationship a relationship where Google is the intermediary for everything sounds good in theory  But if you actually look at the way they make money in the in the margins that and the rates that they can get on a purchase  It's it's going to be a a cut in revenue now  Maybe they make up in volume because there's so many things but the number of categories where they can actually earn an affiliate fee and  To make up what they have now  I'm it remains to be seen how that's going to work and I don't and again  I'm not saying that it's going to be a pixel sell at a profit model in their future  But it sure certainly seems like they are at least  Experimenting with some new sort of business models that they haven't done before and I think that's if you I think that's appropriate given their  Long-term challenges in that regard

They'll still who knows what the opportunities are going to be in VR  There are lots and lots of things coming you can put billboards inside of self-driving cars  You know, there are lots of revenue models that are coming but the biggest problem  I think is that they realize that both apps and search are going to be replaced to a very large extent by just people talking to  They they're AI assistant. Yeah, and that's what I think we all agree on that

Transcript:  The Google is saying we got to figure out what the future is going to look like definitely  And I think AI seems like a sensible place to look yep, I think part of the thing I worry about is  You and I we know what we want. We want her. Yes, we want this generalized intelligence that can act as a true assistant  It's so funny and daring fireball John Gruber's rebuttal to Walt Mossberg  Says assistant is the right term for this class of software  but I can't imagine how stupid an actual human assistant would have to be not to understand a request like  Find out when the next debate is and put it on my calendar and yet none of these can do it, right?  He's pointing out how stupid they are right now  and I'm wondering very stupid I'm also wondering if  Even though we want a particular kind of AI if from a purely financial  Business point of view if that's not the kind of AI  Google or anybody else would want to give us they may want to say  Look what we'll do is we'll have a bidding war between Yelp and open table and whoever pays us the most amount of money  That's who you'll be calling on when you ask for a reservation and that isn't the world you and I want we want we want  An assistant that is working for us not working for Google  Yeah, and I think Google probably wants to the opposite and I think of all the ones

Transcript:  Well, sorry is not Syria is not AI Cortana is not Google now is not very and and so that this is the thing that I'm  Fascinated about with with with with the assistant which is that you know Google as we know two years ago about DeepMind  Which is just top-shelf artificial intelligence. This is the the system that beat  Humans in go and and Atari breakout and stuff like this is really really good AI  and so I have the feeling that assistant is like  how when it was singing Daisy and  They've replaced something that was a pretty sophisticated non artificial intelligent virtual assistant with a baby  Virtual assistant which will now go through preschool and learn and they took a step back so they could take a step exactly  It's and and they're using machine learning and all the this kind of powerful stuff wouldn't be a bad idea

Transcript:  I think to a certain extent there's a part of that  I think what we're also seeing a lot of here is a bit of a  Real like marketing smoke screen from Google  To a certain extent a lot of what they're doing with assistant as it's built into Android and as it's built into aloe  What you text with?  is  Built on what they had with voice search and what they had with Google now before  That's right  So to a certain extent they're taking these pre-existing products and they're just giving it a new name and they're representing it in a new way  And they're telling you it's something new what it's it's it's it's an evolution of something that already existed  Thanks in large part to like you said the stuff they have from deep mind to take it another level up  but they're still very far away from where they need to be and  And I just want to bring this up because I think there's an echo chamber inside of tech journalism right now that is saying  Assistant is new and it's better than  Siri, it's better than Cortana. It's better than Alexa and assistant is not that new  It's mostly a rebranding and there's a some is it the same as they showed two years ago at IO where they yeah

Yes  Yeah, but but what happens when you tell it you don't like that or you know, I have it starts to wire  I think it does and and there are a couple of things about it that are impressive little things like I was  Texting with my brother-in-law and we're saying, you know, hey check out this picture of this pizza  We're just trying out alo. It's like the first or second day that it was out. I think alo is pretty fun  Yeah, and then it intervened in our conversation jumped in a bun in ski.

Transcript:  The big problem for Google is they have what I've called a go-to-market problem  Like they have great technology and the question is how are they actually?  Get it so that people can use it and it might make this point about about Siri being available on Apple before  Yes, they have Android but that is only a part of the market and it's not the most valuable part of the market because  Apple has them faith. So Apple has the business model. We're not sure what the tech Google has the tech  We're not sure about the access and the business model Facebook has the attention and right there. That's something that's very valuable  And I think that that's I guess that's my quibble about the future being AI  like to me the the I it's not just about the technology is about how you access that technology and  Facebook has  multiple avenues to garner attention and they garner significant  Yeah, they do but they are behind I mean  It was really funny last year when Mark Zuckerberg did a post about Google's AI  Being able to play go and then literally like 12 hours later

We browse the web a lot  but mostly in the context of a feed and  Facebook has some of the best feeds in the industry right and in the future an assistant  We're sure we're not gonna be on a browser in an assistant world  I mean, this is this is Google's conundrum in a nutshell their business model everything with their business is best browser

That is a good guess is your audience is exhausted there. You guys are exhausted  You know what it is more and more the evidence is the best thing you could do for your health is to sleep properly to sleep  Well, and it starts with a great mattress they combine springy latex foam that's on top  But then they give you support with the memory foam and so you're getting underneath so you're getting it's hard to describe  you've got to try it kind of this combination of  Comfort and support it's just what I want because I always slept on firm mattresses, but they were too firm  My hips had hurt. This is perfect. It's a 2016 Business Intelligence Group Innovation Award winner  Just the right sink just the right bounce and lasts a long time. They also are cool  I could tell you from this hot hot summer  The Casper was great  Because it breathes so you're never sleeping hot your temperature is very comfortable all the time  And now the best part is you can try it in your home and not in some shop with  For five minutes under bright lights with a salesperson looking at you funny  But you and and your loved ones can all get on that mattress and really give it a workout for the next hundred days  and  If at any time in the first hundred days you say it's not right  They understand, you know, we're not gonna let him try it. So we've got to make it easy to return you call them up  They will take it back courier will come get it  You don't have to put it back in the box. People say how am I gonna get back in that box?  No, you don't have to you can throw the box out. They'll just come and get it  I think they donate it is what they do. I don't think they even resell it  They just donate it to local charity, but you get every penny back. So there is no risk at all  Free shipping and returns to the US and Canada  They are made in the US and to the highest environmental production standards, you know  I was a little concerned when I got in the box. It's all sealed up  I thought am I gonna open this up and I have to let it breathe for a while before no. Mm-hmm. It smells great  It's cool. It's it's a very refreshing night's sleep. You'll love it and it's very affordable  We're making it even more affordable with $50 off any mattress when you use the promo code twit Casper casper  com slash twit Casper com slash twit terms and conditions apply  $50 off any mattress. I got one also for my son in college because I  Didn't poor guy didn't really wasn't thrilled about sleeping on the dorm mattress and I don't blame him. God knows what's been going on there  And that's a rite of passage. It is I know I did you did  Not comfortable. They're terrible. They're stained. I was worried wonder about those stains that blood and then  And then so I was nice. I was a nice father  I said don't look look for a box and because it comes in that box.

I think we have is probably better than mine is so it's I mean make no mistake  It's super duper impressive.

I don't know who's yeah  Yeah, I mean the the current we blocked by the Great Firewall  Yeah, yeah, it is and it always will be at the current version. I just I think the return is not nearly  What he thinks it will be I think there's a little bit of a we will be different sort of right attitude about it that  Is justified and frankly I hope that it's never allowed in because I like I said, I think it's bad  I think would be bad for the company  I think it'd be bad for their culture to to be a part of that and I don't think it'd be profitable to boot

Transcript:  Even beyond that I mean just it also  it's questionable they're gonna ever really let a a  Foreign company, you know it succeed. I mean the reason why Apple has an Apple  I've used this phrase before but is the sort of exception that proves the rule in this case is  Because there is this model because they're selling hardware that's differentiated by software software will be pirated or copied web services will be blocked  The one way that companies have always been money in China is making hardware  of course most of them were making ultimately stuff with Windows or that could be easily commoditized because  Apple products are not easily commoditized yet are still hardware  That's the reason they've been the one company to succeed but notice as Apple has pushed into more into services  And yeah, it's getting harder and China's messing with them  significantly more than they were before

Yeah, maybe the only way you can control it and now here in the United States  We're moving in that direction as well big land messy hard to control  Ben I'm sorry. We shouldn't be analyzing China with a guy who's sitting in Taipei right now, but  If we're completely off base just pretend we know we have  Actually Facebook launched its at work product product this week to the public's been out for a long time in beta. Yeah  This is an interesting play because Facebook  Is an intranet we should point out this is not a LinkedIn competitor  This is not a business focused social network kind of a slack competitor. Yeah, but slack is so much smaller in capability  I mean it competes with not just slack but base camp and everybody else  Trello  On the one hand I think as a company you might say well my cut my my employees love Facebook  They know how to use Facebook. There's no training involved.

Transcript:  No way they could charge consumers for this and after all the biggest competitor here would be SharePoint for Microsoft and Google  And I don't know do you do you mean you might trust Microsoft in the enterprise?  But I don't know if Google's any more trustworthy than the Facebook in the enterprise. What do you think Ben?

Transcript:  Well, I mean to be to be clear that it is very it is separate  The data is all separate from the consumer app and frankly, I think that's it's fair to expect that will be the case  I mean their credibility and opportunity to be completely shot if that were not the case or ever shown to not be the case  that said  Certainly theoretically again. There's a lot here that makes sense people know how to use it  It's mobile first all that sort of thing  It's a and it's a I think it is much bigger than so I could say whole scale sort of replacement for your communications infrastructure  That's also a problem. I think because  The way you get into an enterprise be given the nature of it and the way it has to be tied into identity  This is a top-down sort of product that's gonna be implemented by a CIO for example or  We're gonna start up or whatever might be and that's that's a challenge that means building a sales force  that means building all the sorts of things that again Facebook has not shown any inclination or capability or or  Willingness to do the big difference with something like slack is slack has two advantages  They don't seem like advantage at first  But the first advantage is it only does chat which is well Facebook does so much more  Well, if you have a company that already has an established communications infrastructure slack is offering a new thing which is community chat  Yes, we've had with IRC, but for most people it's it's a new product  And so it slots in with what's already there and so there's more opportunity for one, but then to  slack's free to try all you need is an email address and  If you like it and you need some of the capabilities a team manager can pull it as company credit card it can pay  For it and so you can have more of a bottoms up sort of infiltration of the enterprise approach  Where slack eventually once they build up a sales team can go to the CIO say oh by the way  70% of your 60% your company's already using our products  How will we put together a product that works for your deal that works for your whole company?  And I think that's a really revolutionary change in selling enterprise software  Be and it's only enabled by being on the cloud and and that's a big shift and Facebook as  Compelling as the product will be and I think there will be some businesses where it's gonna be really successful make a lot of  sense the level of commitment needed and the way it's going to be sold I think are going to be challenges for for the product and  Frankly, it feels like let's do it because we can and that's not a good route to success in business frankly like you you succeed  In business because you align an entire organization incentives in the way you make money around  Making a product successful not throwing something over the wall because well, we're already using it internally. Maybe you'll like to use it, too

Start time: 4509.80
End time: 4597.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I think there is a chance it's well  What if the thing remember is it's it is a great product and Facebook has been using it has been beta testing  And you talk to anyone at Facebook  I've never met anyone who doesn't love that's often their favorite thing about working at Facebook is the way that you can use Facebook  They use it internally groups and stuff  And I've actually had some personal experience here not using Facebook  When I was at automatic we use a combination of what are called p2 blogs  It's kind of a front-facing front posting blog that feels a lot like Facebook plus it was IRC then they use slack now  Along with along with Skype for video chatting and we kind of patched together this multi-piece  Communication layer that was amazing  I've never felt more connected and in the loop about what's going on despite the fact automatics totally remote and people live all over the world  So like this idea of this  Completely new way of doing communications is compelling in the fact Facebook's offering an integrated solution that does that is amazing  I guess the big question I have is again the sort of go-to-market thing  how are they gonna actually get companies using that and  The nature of the product being all-in requires an all-in commitment from companies that use it  And so maybe if you're a startup it might be super compelling to start your company working that way  Going into established companies  I think I think that just by virtue of being a  Single-use product and having a more compelling business model for a small team that slack still has pretty significant advantages

Transcript:  And the you know going even earlier than startups. They are free to educational institutions  So universities might use it theoretically and nonprofits nonprofits might use it  And so this could be a long-term play that could pay off because if they can get people  In you know who need to get a solution like this who can get it for free and then they move into the workplace  And so on then that could work. I personally think it's gonna fail despite how good it apparently is  Most of the things that Facebook has launched over the years have completely failed

Start time: 4632.04
End time: 4699.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so many things. Yeah, isn't it funny? Yeah. Well, that's the case for all of them coming companies  I think I think the incumbents don't generally innovate very well do they?  Well, the the problem is that  when a company is started its initial product is  There is a need in the market that they are fulfilling and everything about the company becomes aligned in fulfilling that need  Would it be the culture whether it be how they make their incentives the structure how they make money all that sort of stuff  Yeah  And in the future when a new opportunity comes up their advantage is they have tons of resources  whereas another startup is  Very much aligned to the opportunity and I think an unfortunate  Mistake a lot of pundits make is they because resources can be easily measured and calculated  They over index on resources when actually it's a lot of this other stuff  It's it's having a very focused company a very focused product that matters more and and so yeah  I'm with Mike my default is is against an incumbent shifting to a new area  Particularly if it entails a new way of selling a new business model  That's that's a lot more difficult shift to make than I think most people appreciate

Maybe I was foolish  But what's apparently the case?  Look Yahoo was there's two big stories  Of course, and we've mentioned them before Yahoo was hacked and it pretty much the entire Yahoo user database leaked out  Yeah, they had passwords hashed but we don't know how well hashed since it was a long time ago probably not so well and  Secret questions were in the clear and emails were in the clear obviously and then the real question is when did  Yahoo know about this and there's some evidence that Marissa Meyer knew as early as July but kept it a secret in order to keep  the Verizon sale alive  Verizon's calling foul and saying hey, that's material information  Information  They could either cancel the sale or probably what they're gonna do is get a significant discount

I've had to say I thought there was a problem with Yahoo for several years because it was Yahoo Mail that was always hacked  It was always Yahoo Mail that you got the email from your friend saying I'm in Europe and I lost my wallet  Yeah, send me a thousand dollars that was always Yahoo Mail  Yeah, and I just feel like it's been insecure at least for a long time and maybe that breach  You know was already stuff was being filtered out of that breach. I just it's  Turn on two-factor do not now. Here's the thing  Do not we had a piece yesterday if you want to we we showed you how to delete your Yahoo Mail yesterday  We had a piece in that but I don't recommend it  a because you got your football and you got your  Flicker and you got your tumbler but B because you may you don't remember you've been using the Yahoo Mail address as a way  To maybe get second factor authentication or a reset  Yeah on other accounts and if you do release your account, they will reuse that email address  They've already started they've done that before. Yeah, so you what you really would behoove you to do is kind of sanitize it  Change the password turn on two-factor and then every month send one email. Yeah

Transcript:  Okay, and then there was one more thing Yahoo did  Yeah, that also loses some faith  now  Yahoo has a checkered past with the federal this is this is even worse Yahoo turned over a couple of Chinese dissidents  Right that was that almost ten years ago. Yeah. Yeah, but this is that same issue  You do business in China. You have to hear the laws of China, right?  Anyway, you could go back and forth on that one  After that they did fight some national security letters, right? They went to court. They tried to protect user data. They lost  Then they got another one apparently  The US government secret order saying you need to search your email all the users email for some specific  Information a signature that we believe belongs to a malefactor Reuters reported that last a couple of weeks ago  It was looking the New York Times reported the government was looking for a specific  Digital signature of a communications method used by a state-sponsored foreign tour terrorist organization. Hey, they should find that Yahoo initially said  Oh, it was easy. We just modified our spam filter. That's already going through the mail images said hey look for this too  While you're at it, but then apparently that's not the case  Anonymous sources and again, you always have to consider the source anonymous sources told the New York Times  that  Actually told motherboard I apologize that it was not  Spam filtering or child pornography filtering, but the tool is more like a root kit. Yep, and  It was discovered by Alex Stamos his internal security testing team during one of their checkups  They thought hackers had put a root kit on Yahoo  Until they got a memo from upstairs saying oh, no, no, that was us. It's okay  If it was just a slight modification the spam and child pornography filters the security team  Wouldn't have noticed and freaked out said an ex-yahoo  Employee it definitely contains something that did not look like anything Yahoo mail would have installed the back door  Was installed in a way that endangered all of Yahoo's

Yeah, it was so bad that after this happened Google Microsoft Twitter Facebook  Basically all these major companies came out and said we're not doing this same sort of thing, right? And don't worry  we're not doing that and you know and I  Whether or not you want to believe him is one thing but the fact that that all these companies  Have to come out and acknowledge that I think says something about the weight and the seriousness of of this  It's it's this is even worse to me than that than the hacking thing  This is just one more reason to if you have a Yahoo account to question  What the hell are you still using it for and do you really want?

Transcript:  This is this is the big thing. I mean because Yahoo  the reality is is that initial Yahoo was was  Yahoo was doomed in their competition against Google from the beginning because they were a  They were a media company really from the beginning  They were creating a list of links that are on the internet never search it's right  Exactly Google was Google was using the links the very structure of the internet to to create its index which meant as the web got bigger  Yahoo increasingly didn't work and as the web but as the web got bigger Google got better and  And that was it that was something that they really in the water got impedance  The one thing they have is this massive user base like to to our points about advertising and stuff. It's hard to change  Consumer behavior, but no I agree for both of these things  I mean, I mean at a minimum I object to the fact that they had to install anything  Like this, but at a minimum at least do it in the most possible secure way possible in the least damaging  Constrained way. Yeah, frankly. No, I agree with you. I mean frankly there is I hope the message gets out to the general population  That you should not be using Yahoo period  it's like and if that ruins their value to Verizon good like they they deserve it and frankly we need some examples of  companies just utterly selling people down the river like this and I  Think the the upcoming shareholder lawsuits all sort of things are gonna be very fascinating and deserved and to a certain extent Yahoo's whole entire business

I think they've got a better map now  All right Twitter Oh women I'm gonna do an ad then I'll do Twitter. How about that? I was very skeptical  I have to say and I've tried, you know kind of enterprise grade  systems like ubiquity and  You know the top-of-the-line routers hundred dollar multi hundred dollar routers  And nobody had solved this big problem which was getting the very simple problem but fundamental problem of  distributing Wi-Fi over my entire home and I'd actually put in power line networking and repeaters and all sorts of stuff like  Wireless distribution system and then Eero sent me this  This is the Eero system and it is solves it really the single route router model is dead  Eero is the new way and and you just start you could buy an individual Eero  in fact, if you were in a studio apartment, this would be a great choice for your  Your base unit like any router it has Ethernet in Ethernet out  You could attach that bit. It works fine and I do this to a switch or a hub or a  PlayStation or something. Yeah  Yeah  Well, actually what I do is I put it on a switch and then I can have everything be wired to the Eero  But then it also has the Wi-Fi you fire up the Eero app on your iPhone or your Android device and you then add  Another Eero and another Eero and as many Eero's as you need each one  Distributes it to a larger area and this is the first Wi-Fi system  I found that actually gets to every point in my house without a dead zone without complaints from Lisa and that's a big one these  spousal  Spousal approval factor very high. Yes, no more buffering  Wi-Fi, you know, it's funny. I was just showing a Nathan the Eero app on my  iPhone and it said hey, there's an update. This is one of the other things that euro does  It's awesome. You create an Eero account and it updates  Automatically. Hey, there's an update we can wait till later tonight or would you want to do it now?  I said, well, nobody's home. So I just updated all my routers from here. That's cool. It's really cool  You can see if you go to the your network settings you can it does constant bandwidth checks  So, you know the status of your network shows you all the devices on the network currently and  Previously by name you can reserve devices and then here it is some additional smart stuff for instance  And I talked to the founder of euro about this it looks at the device  It knows for instance that that's an Apple TV and it says okay. Well, we're gonna give you QoS on that device  We're gonna improve the streaming on that device because you're not gonna really need it so much on your Nexus  6p, it's  Amazing. That's it has great guests networks. This thing really works  You don't have and the thing is it's simple. It's easy. You can give this to an unsophisticated  member of your family or friend and  Suddenly they're gonna have Wi-Fi that works. But Leo, what about all the exercise I get holding the laptop in the corner of the room where the Wi-Fi is?  I can't help you with that Mike. I'm sorry  By the way WPA to encryption, of course nothing less they wouldn't dream of it  Customer support night and I tested the mat on this I called them and I said I am trying to set up a I have a  Server I'm trying to set up on my euro and I can't I need to pay  Port forward and you know, I gave him a typical kind of geeky question. They were great. They walked me right through it  They said did we help did that work and he sat with me?  Maybe an hour on the phone and reboot it through reboots and everything  It is an enterprise grade Wi-Fi system that really works  We're partnering with euro to offer you free overnight shipping if you go to euro comm and use the offer code  Twitter so what you do is you go to e er o  calm by your euro system  And then at checkout just check the boxes as overnight shipping and enter the code tweet and they'll boom that'll be zero  Eero comm offer code tweet if you have been suffering and I know so many people are  With dead spots with Wi-Fi that just doesn't work that speeds that fluctuate up and down  This is such a great solution  Eero  Comm and don't forget the offer code  Twit for free overnight shipping put down there. I love that euro thing. Love it  I don't know if I look I have I should I should always recuse myself from any conversation about Twitter  I was an early adopter got on at first December 2006  Even in the first six months I quit  At the first I quit because of the confusion between Twitter and Twitter  And I remember interviewing av Williams and I said ev why did you name it Twitter?  You knew we because he'd been on our shows. He said I didn't think either of us was going anywhere  I thought both would be small companies to be no conflict double burn. Well, he went somewhere Twitter went somewhere  But I always had these mixed feelings and then of course with it with the free speech issues the trolling issues  At the same time you can't I can't quit you right if some if I hear a rumor that celebrity is passed away  I don't turn on CNN you go to Twitter, right? You don't go to Facebook you go to Twitter  Still my favorite social network to use, you know, I'm not crazy about 140 characters makes people talk like they're having a stroke  This is true. I don't I think that that's a problem now there  I know they've done some things lately to change that I also feel like it's disjointed  So you'll be following, you know, everybody's talking about the debate and then somebody says something about his sandwich  It's like what it's like

Transcript:  And then also and this is the thing that's growing gnawing away at me. I I blame Twitter a little bit  for what's going on in our country right now because I  This sounds terrible  But I think we have a little too much democracy  I was a big believer at the beginning of the Internet. This is gonna be great. Everybody's gonna get a voice and  the bad voices light shine the light of day on it and that will  you know disinfect and  Ultimately, what we're gonna do is get rid of these  Elites who control the media and everybody's gonna have a voice and I was a real utopian and now I feel like it's a little  dystopian well

Transcript:  You know you've had some great conversations on multiple twitch shows on this I know I bang this  No, but it's important and this is the moment to talk about it  I think that to me personally I think that the solution is somewhat obvious  So people talk about real names versus anonymity. I think you need pseudonymity  I think you basically have to have a real name  Facing Twitter behind the scenes and then you can call yourself anything you want  But the point is you can't create a new account every 30 seconds  Yeah, and I've had so many arguments in the last three months political arguments with  People with zero followers or five followers and an egg avatar  And so it's the people just creating this funny account

Start time: 6325.02
End time: 6362.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What I would say the biggest problem with Twitter is is that everybody is equal on Twitter and every account however dumb  however few followers has equal voice with every other account and so  brands especially  Fall for this and they see stuff on Twitter and they take it seriously. Yeah, it's as if oh my god, you know  Jane Paulie just said something bad about me. That's a bad choice of person  You get what I'm saying that everybody's equal on Twitter. So it's a little too much democracy. Anyway, none of this matters  It does matter I want to stipulate you could fix this now go ahead I

Start time: 6363.62
End time: 6409.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't know first off I will push back against any argument that that says  everyone is equal as a problem because  frankly  The fact that internet makes everyone equal is the entire reason why I've been able to build the career that I've been able to  And I get a little me and I get a little I get a little irk like that that Norwegian editor writing about Facebook  Demanding special privileges because he's an editor on Facebook like that to me. That's very problematic and  Return to a world where yes, there was it was simpler and there was more defined what we saw  There's lots of stuff. We didn't see we didn't see police violence. We didn't see  You know this sort of wouldn't we have seen all that without others like that

Everybody knows where you work what you do what your thoughts are what your laptop is what you this who your family all that  said they know all about and then some anonymous creep will come along and  Get into this war with you and you too are not equal. They have a huge advantage  They might have 20 fake accounts. So it's 20 against one

Transcript:  I should apologize because you know, we've had this conversation so many times. There's no point in belaboring this  I will stipulate Twitter's fixable  The issue today is will anybody buy Twitter and if nobody buys Twitter what will happen to Twitter Twitter?  Announced it was for sale. It had some suitors all of whom every one of whom has said never mind  For reasons I think this conversation illustrates. Yeah, so now what it well, it's it's there's no place for real-time

End time: 6540.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To Mike's point the Mike Mike's point is exactly right  The fastest easiest way to fix this is to figure out a way that one person can only create one account  Obviously, there will always be holes in that but Twitter doesn't do anything to restrict that and  Why don't they do anything to restrict that well there it could be stupid or it could be that the single most important number driving?  Their stock is the number of monthly active users

Start time: 6540.72
End time: 6556.98

Transcript:  Well, and also Twitter was founded as the free speech wing of the free speech party quote unquote  Yeah, so there's a historical genetic thing in Twitter that we are not  And by the way, look at 4chan and look at reddit as two other companies with the same attitude  Who are suffering as well

Start time: 6557.54
End time: 6603.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but you know, I think for for for you know, Google for Apple for Disney for Salesforce  I think the question is okay. What is Twitter and how does it fit into our business and Twitter?  interestingly enough like Yahoo has never been able to  really articulate what it's about and and and  Some of the frustration that comes with it  I think is a reflection of us as people who use it is we all use it for different ways, right?  Trump uses it for his thing other people use it to find music other people use it to  To help organize like the Black Lives Matter movement other people use it to talk about sports and fashion or whatever  So there's all these different things that people are using it for but there's no clear, you know  Like like what is it? Is it is it is where you go for news?  Is it where you go to talk to your friends? Is it where you go to?

Transcript:  Problem with it being many things but I think it's hard for these other companies to figure out how it fits in and what to  Do with it. Well, who is somebody gonna buy it?

Start time: 6618.60
End time: 6631.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why well first of all before we get to who might buy it? Let's talk about who's not buying it  And why I think each of these companies has a completely different reason  I mean for example some have talked about Bloomberg buying it. This is a private company. They could probably use the data

Start time: 6631.92
End time: 6634.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They say I'm not sure I think any company is looking at is looking at the data

Start time: 6634.84
End time: 6665.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah anything else, but that's a completely whack business for them and it's really expensive for Bloomberg  So you look at Google Google doesn't really need the data and don't they though?  I don't think they do they have such superior data the problem with Twitter  Well, it's not just that Twitter already gives them number of people who are identifiable  But the number of people are identifiable that were okay. This is Leo Laporte  This is the same little report that has this yacht this YouTube account that that's the same person  It's a tiny number of people on Twitter. There's so much and Twitter has that three million monthly active users of which

Start time: 6666.12
End time: 6683.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No more than half probably significantly less than half are not spammers right so let's say a hundred million active real active users  That's a small number compared to a million and a half Facebook interest has more right now  Yeah, I think we ran a story on Instagram has three times that number exactly

Start time: 6683.68
End time: 6711.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a completely out of left field business for Salesforce  Disney doesn't want to be associated with all the vitriol and profanity and pornography and all that stuff Apple doesn't really want to be in  The social networking business and so each of these companies that has the money has a different reason for not wanting it  so I really buy into the the  Inevitability that some financial no-name financial company nobody's heard of it's gonna buy it strip it for parts  Turn it into nothing and it'll be the end of Twitter. I like this article from John Hempton. He's a

Start time: 6712.68
End time: 6755.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  hedge fund guy at Bronte Capital  He says you're right it'll be an investment company  But the reason it'll be an investment company is because in order to make Twitter work  They have two billion dollars revenue. You've got to cut a significant amount of the costs  Well, here's and it's gonna be so brutal. They're gonna go ugly. Yeah that no  Company with a public face really wants to buy it. So it's gonna be some  Yeah investment company like Carl Icahn or somebody who doesn't care what you think  He says literally a Wall Street bastard. Yep, and that person can do the job needed  To turn Twitter into something useful not to shut it down not even sell it off for parts  But just to to clean it up and make it when you need one, you know, does that make sense?

Start time: 6756.21
End time: 6770.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It does I mean a lot of folks  You know that that I was going to and you know  Talk to you on some of these sorts of things say that there's too many people over there who don't know what they're doing  And the staffs too big and it's kind of a bloated company. Everybody talks about how there's mismanagement

Start time: 6770.82
End time: 6799.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think that the best example of that is that their costs have gone  Way way way up and their losses have remained constant  So no matter how much and the revenue has gone way up to the Twitter is a company that you they could have continued to run  On a shoestring budget and it would still be 95% as good as it is now, but they've had Facebook envy  Everybody's telling them you got to be Facebook your public company. You got to go out for the money  You have to be like Facebook. Yeah, and so they they've twisted it and changed it

Transcript:  Bronte says if you can't have a 40% operating margin, then you're inadequately brutal personally  I think 50% as possible. What about you Ben? You what do you think you follow this stuff very closely and you're good in the financial  markets you think that's what makes sense I

Start time: 6815.10
End time: 7011.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  do the the problem for Twitter is it it goes back to  Horrible management in that the horrible management is impactful in two ways  so first off the product stagnated and did not improve any meaningful way for like four years and  The the problem is the initial Twitter concept was so good  it got a huge number of users and they never had to go through the trouble of  figuring out what make Twitter compelling and selling that to other people and so right now it's this sort of like  Unfinished rough product that does a ton of different things and it's not focused on on really any of them and doing in doing them  Very well  the second problem with mismanagement though is  By virtue of the mismanagement by not figuring out the product and not building a business they  Compensated by raising an absolute epic ton of venture capital  Twitter raised seven hundred and sixty million dollars worth of venture capital, which is  Way more than Facebook raised for a much smaller  Business that frankly doesn't do very much and the reason was they were too busy fighting with each other to actually build a business  and so the problem is  Venture capital is makes a ton of sense for social network  It's really the only way to build this this sort of product or media company where you want to call Twitter  it's the only reason to call to build this sort of company because you need all the costs are upfront and you want to  Generate a scale engine on both sides on user side where the user generated content and on the advertising side where you want to build  Sort of a self-serving sort of business that scales along with the users  The problem is that the user growth capped out and they never got the scale advertising business model off the ground  I know the vast majority of their advertising is selling is selling it directly  So you have this company that the way I analogize it in other podcasts was it's like your kids  They get a little chubby before they grow tall Twitter got really really really chubby and they never do call  And so they have this massive cost structure  That is huge bloated company where they could be a very nice five billion dollar company with their current revenue model  Maybe even higher, but I completely agree with John Hempton. I think it was a very astute article  It was very well put that that right now the company like we still talk about Twitter in this ridiculous way  Oh Twitter is so much potential. Oh imagine what they could do this. I'm sure that it's a they're ten years old  Like the time to talk about them and their potential is past  They are what they are and I increasingly agree that the appropriate route is to embrace that  Are they gonna lose all their engineers and lose all their talent? Yes, they are  but unfortunately, they have their chance it's past and  And hopefully they can build something about what's there and to your point  I think happens point is well made they will be a much more attractive acquisition target once that process is over  Yes, they might die the surgery might kill the patient. But at this point  To buy Twitter now is it would be full hearty  Why would you want this company?  The only one that makes a possible passable sense is Google just because they don't have any sort of feed product on mobile for all  The business model reason to talk about before but the fact is Google  Twitter inventories on double-click and they get the firehose of data because Twitter made this deal this desperate deal  That Google would save them and now Google has everything they need from Twitter without having to have paid a dime for it  So yeah, I'm I'm a pessimist as well

Start time: 7012.24

Transcript:  I also I also hate the fact that every Silicon Valley company has to make a trillion dollars of yeah profit a year  Otherwise, they're nothing.

Start time: 7032.70

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's the problem with all the venture capital that they raise and this goes back to management  They they put themselves in weight. They can't tread water at this point  Yeah, well the only way out of their predicament was to grow hugely and now they're paying out all these stock options  This is a ridiculous number of stock options to keep talent there and it's only deepening the hole that they're in the only way out  For Twitter as it's constructed is to dramatically increase their user base and that's not happening. We've seen  It's going the other way  I wrote this one their IPO in 2013 that the company was in big trouble because their user base because they have this user this user  Growing problem and especially as advertising gets more and more concentrated and they never built a scalable advertising model like I  Mean, this has been apparent for years that this was a problem  I think what's increasingly apparent now is just how toxic an asset this would be and why no one would want to buy them  and  the  second is paradox right now the the  The value of Twitter is almost assuredly much less than its current market cap  The problem is its current market cap is inflated because people hope someone will buy them  But they won't be bought until the price goes down  So they're stuck in this paradox where they will only be bought once everyone gives up on the prospects of them being bought  The problem is that might only happen when they die and that would be unfortunate. Well, I think we're getting close to this happening

The problem is their GNA and their in their compensation  Prices are so out of whack with the reality of the business. Can they get out of those?

Transcript:  Well, yeah, well but just because it's a dramatic shift in the way the world works does also not mean it's a bad thing  again, I think it's really easy to  Particularly for people in media and in journalism who've had their business models decimated by the internet  It's really easy to pin the blame on whoever is winning now  right and  The fact the matter is the world is significantly different a major theme for me writing in general is that you know  The internet is is of a level of the Industrial Revolution where everything about society is going to change though our political institutions  are going to change the way our media system is gonna change everything the way people works gonna change all these things are going to  change and  And that's a lot one. It's gonna be really hard. It's gonna be really painful and then to be clear  This is very different from tech. This is very different from the first tech 1.0  Which was you know, like ERP solutions and all that stuff which made business way more efficient  But didn't change the way business worked the way business works is fundamentally changing and that's by definition going to entail a lot of pain  And a lot of upheaval, but I don't want to go back to the Middle Ages before the Industrial Revolution  but I but it's hard like and  My concern is not that word that we stuff a genie back in the box or we close Pandora's box or however  Metaphors I can mix in one sentence  The the question is  What's our level of awareness of the reality of this change and how quickly can we?  Get our society and our institutions  in a in a way to handle this change and and  It's not gonna stop like it's just it is what it is  And I think once we accept that and can figure our way forward will be in a healthier place

Yes  Interesting one of the things Twitter and others have done and the internet has done is made it possible to  Spread disinformation as easily as quickly as information and when it's spread at a rapid pace  It's almost so fast that you believe it. Mm-hmm  So what I think what Google's doing in my opinion and I'd love to hear what you think you wrote the article on this Nathan  Yeah, they're gonna add a fact-check label  to

Yeah, basically in Google News now for for for listings to news stories  Oh, it's just in news just in news so far  You know, this is the sort of thing that could that could bleed over news makes better sense though  Yeah, but basically there are there are more than a hundred websites that they've identified that are dedicated to fact-checking  Wow, there's PolitiFact. I know PolitiFact full fact. They have a lot of others. There's actually  I

Start time: 8048.78
End time: 8164.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and what I found is that the that certain I'm not gonna get political here to political  But but certain political groups have pre-inoculated their idiotic users  Followers, whatever you want to call it  Against fact-checking itself right? Yeah, the fact trust the fact-checkers the fact-checking sites are just a smoke screen for the for the for the  Power's that are it's a nice test exactly. And so that's that's a real problem. But I think that  My message to the world is no most of these fact-checking sites are very good  That the politicians have learned to speak in a way that's fact-check proof  So for example in my article, I give a couple of examples  But essentially speaking vaguely and categorically instead of specifically enables them to have nothing to fact-check  It's like quicksand. Yeah, I would like to say one thing on this there the the different fact-checking sites do different things  So the political ones like politifact fact-check org and so on are  Great for politics. They there are ones for you know, urban legends and so on and also politics like Snopes  About comm and so on hoax slayer is a good one  But there's one that's for tech mostly. It's very good. It's called emergent if you can throw that on the screen  It's called urgent emergent. Yeah, it's called emergent info is the em erg  That's right. And they have this they have this you see if it's green. It's true if it's red  It's not true. And and if it's white, it's not clear if it's true or not. Yeah, and oh, this is good  I'm gonna add this to me isn't this great. So it's a real they call it a real-time rumor tracker. But again, it's very heavily  You know spun toward technology and it's just a fantastic resource  That where they just get to the bottom of it. They explain they talk about the originating source  It's tagged so you can search by tags or keywords and so on and it's just a great way to separate the BS from the truth

Start time: 8165.92
End time: 8208.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it is, you know Google doing this and labeling  Emergent info by the way, just a little hard to find on Google News is kind of a responsible thing to do  I mean, you know, because like you said there are those that are known for doing legit stuff and and and Google is taking a nonpartisan approach  On this and that matters. It's basically just calling it out and saying hey, this is someone's verified someone  That's legit that has a history of doing this, right?  And you know if you don't believe  the media, you know  And then you probably don't believe Google's little tags either  So this might not be for you and that's I think I guess okay, but again there are forces out there that want

Start time: 8209.80
End time: 8286.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're in opposition to actual facts  Of course a shena actual reality and they want to convince everybody that facts are  There's no such thing as facts and there's only opinion or bias or whatever and that's simply not true. They're in fact our facts  yeah facts exist and  And so, you know we we need to and and here's my general tip which I think really resonated with a lot of my readers  instead of using fact-checking sites as  As places where you go and look up things that people are disagreeing with use them like their publications use them like their blogs  Go to them preemptively and get the truth before you get the lies and and just browse them  They're they're actually the way that they tend to format content is actually a very readable  Way to get the news to get the information that's out there and  You know follow their Twitter accounts follow their social media accounts and they tend to tweet out or send out  What they've concluded and you can just see it go by and you're like, okay  So that's that's not true. And then when you actually see the falsehood later on you already know that's not true  Yeah, and so it's really it's a really powerful thing  The internet has made it super easy to spread falsehoods  But they've also made it easy to identify what's true and what's false and we should all be active and yeah

Start time: 8286.30
End time: 8293.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Figuring that out. This really to me isn't isn't a new problem  I mean this has been you know an issue as long as there's been a media as long as there's been

Start time: 8300.30
End time: 8422.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  but I think ultimately  kind of on talking on some of the things that Ben brought up with Twitter is  You know, there's there are more people engaging in these conversations and never before the business models for news outlets and  journalist organizations and things like that  Have been hurt incredibly by the internet but more people are reading the work than ever before that we do  Yeah, and I think that's ultimately a good thing now. We do have some folks maybe who are in certain camps  You know who who might want to believe their their you know  Political heroes who say that all media is bad and there are no facts and there is no truth  But I think that most people  Know that that's BS and I think that  Just as before  Before the internet if a responsible  consumer of news of  Responsible person who just wants to learn about the world around them is gonna look to more than one newspaper  Is gonna look to more than one news website is gonna look to more than one fact-checking website is gonna  Constantly be challenging what they know to be true  And to read more than one book and all that stuff. So it's the same sort of problem. It moves quicker  I think sometimes it feels amplified and more emotional because we're we're just it's being thrown in our face every day when every time  We got on Facebook and Twitter every time we turn on, you know  Cable news or look at the home page of any news website. It feels bad  I think it feels a little heightened right now because it's an election year  but I think  There's something good underneath all this in the fact that we're all participating in these conversations and maybe a  larger and more public way than ever before and  And I think more young people  And and and communities that maybe hadn't been included in some of these conversations before are getting included nowadays  So that's also something that is a threat to a lot of the the stakeholders  And old power structures and all those things. So ultimately I think this is gonna be good  But I'm glad that Google is making this move me, too

I  Thought Nathan made a really important point that  Whether how effective this is gonna be I questioned it just how effective it will ultimately turn out people believe the facts  They were the facts they want to believe well one does it's more it's more how does it get in front of them?  you have to actually search for the the  question in in an issue and then there will be a label in the search results and I guess  The thing I would take here is I think Google does deserve a lot of praise for here because the real company that needs to  Make a move here is Facebook.

Transcript:  I think I think your point about the trending stories and they their Facebook's response to accusations of biases to fire the entire team  It's preposterous and it's it's frankly it's not taking seriously their role in society  and there's no indications that they care or that they they understand that and  so by all means let's praise Google to the skies and by implication, let's shame Facebook because their  Facebook's  Yes, I this whole thing that Facebook's a media company is dumb. They're not a media company  They are like the reason why they are valuable is they are a platform and they live on user generated content  but that's the at the same time their role and their impact on society cannot be denied and their  Refusal to take that seriously and to put their head in the sand and pretend that they will fix it with an algorithm is  In the long run, I think it's gonna be bad for Facebook because there's gonna be a backlash eventually  I've been denying your points the other about a backlash, but there will be one and the concern for Facebook  We saw what happened with that picture, you know in in Norway  like at some point the government's gonna get involved and that's not gonna be good for Facebook's business and  They need to take it seriously. And so I would praise Google with the clear undercurrent. That's that's not no longer implicit  it's very explicit that what a welcome counter to what we're seeing from from kind of the
