Patrick's treating you good, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  It's good to have you both on.  It's a little mini Tekzilla.  And also a special guest on the show today via phone from his home in some undisclosed  location.  It's Kevin Mitnick.  Of course, we gave out his phone number earlier and I apologize for that.  Hey, Kevin.  Hey Leo, how are you?  It's really good to talk to you.  Kevin Mitnick is a good friend of the show.  In fact, it was after your jail time that you did for hacking some years ago.  We got you on the screensavers.  Your first appearance, well first of all, your first appearance out of jail, but then  after that, your first time on the internet when you were probationary.  That was cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I remember that.  I remember that like it was yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Woz gave you a notebook computer.  You still have that MacBook?  Yeah, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't use it.  I have the new MacBook Pro and I understand this month they're going to announce even  a newer MacBook.  I don't think it's been announced yet, but I'm excited.  I always like to keep up to date with the newest technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And your security firm, you can go to kevinmitnick.com or what is the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mitnick Security.  Mitnicksecurity.com.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's what you're doing these days is consulting on security.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, pretty much traveling the world, speaking at, you know, still doing the same old same  speaking, doing a lot of pen testing, security assessments.  But a cool thing you might not know of is I just was commissioned in July by Little  Brown to do my life story.  So I'm working on the new book and, you know, the true story of Kevin Mitnick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm really looking forward to that.  Very cool.  Two books written already about your exploits, but to hear it from you will be very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think I'll have a different viewpoint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I know we talked the other day about, I know there's one you don't like, one it's  OK with you, but this one will be this one will be your your your official biography.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so I'm excited.  It won't be ready for like a year.  And then of course, the editors will probably take another few months.  But I'm excited to finally be able to pen my own story because I have a government restriction  for so long.  Yeah, yeah, I have no restrictions whatsoever, except maybe when I fly into the United States  from Bogota.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's what we were going to talk about.  What an interesting story.  And you may be in the market, I think, for a new MacBook.  Two weeks ago, you were in Colombia.  You were giving a speech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I was I was in Bogota, Colombia for about 10 days.  I was there giving a speech for El Tiempo and visiting a girlfriend.  And and and then I flew out around September 16th.  And that's when the whole thing happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  So you had with you, you were coming from Colombia into the US, into Atlanta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and I do it all the time.  I go to Colombia like every two months, every every month and a half.  OK, so it's like I'm constantly going back and forth.  I've been traveling internationally since 2003.  So what are those five years?  I've never had an incident.  Are you on watch lists?  I don't think so.  Well, maybe now.  Maybe now that I'm on your show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So let's get down to the details of what happened exactly, because I've been claiming for the  last couple of weeks that nobody ever gets stopped under this proviso that they could  take your laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I'm looking at we're still here.  I'm going to turn them up for you.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, actually, John, that's the people.  People are getting stopped.  Some people are getting stopped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's what we say.  I'd like to hear the actual details of this stoppage or the stoppage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It all started when we talked about the law that they're trying to enforce that gives  customs officials the right to take anything if they think there's something stolen on  it.  What happened to you, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK.  So I landed from Bogota into Atlanta.  I go through a passport control.  I do this all the time.  It's second nature.  The guy scans my passport, and all of a sudden, he's reading something on the computer.  His eyes are moving.  And right then, I knew that was a bad sign.  And then not only did his eyes start reading some text, but he started typing on the computer.  And that, of course, gave me a very uneasy feeling.  And then he started to smile.  This guy had a big smile on his face.  He goes, hey, Kev.  I go, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's a bad sign right there.  Hey, Kev.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  He goes, there's some people downstairs that want to have a word with you.  But don't worry.  Everything will be OK.  He goes, go ahead and get your bags and just follow the way out.  And they'll be there for you.  And I'm just going, oh, my god.  So I go over to the baggage claim.  I'm waiting for my bags.  And all of a sudden, I get a call from my girlfriend from Bogota.  And she goes, honey, honey.  Yeah.  She goes, the policia just called me.  There's a problem.  And I go, what?  She goes, you know that package you sent to the United States a couple of days ago?  Well, they found cocaine.  They need to open the package.  They found cocaine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, Colombia is a big cocaine country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't do drugs, right?  I don't even smoke pot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You do tuna fish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Tuna, yeah.  Tuna fish.  Tuna fish.  Yeah, that's it.  Tuna fish and MDC.  So like I'm going, oh, this is what the tell is all about.  Somebody put some contraband in some of my equipment at one of these mailbox sending  places.  And now I'm getting jerked around.  And I'm going, oh, my god.  How do I prove my innocence?  I had nothing to do with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait a minute.  I have a question.  They accused you of sending cocaine to Colombia?  No, from Colombia to the States via FedEx.  OK, sorry.  That was a little unclear to me, and I thought that would be kind of original.  And next, Kevin will take hold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I sent a package and the police called her from FedEx going, we detected cocaine and  they wanted permission to actually break open the electronic equipment I was sending.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What were you sending?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was sending a Maxster hard drive.  I was sending some stereo equipment, souvenirs that I purchased in Cartagena and Medellin.  So I just sent a box of stuff because my luggage was heavy.  And when you have heavy luggage, they ding you at the airport for like 200 euros, and  I didn't want to get dinged.  So FedEx was much cheaper.  So it was just a bunch of electronic stuff and souvenirs.  So I'm sweating it.  I'm going, oh, my god.  What happened?  As I'm waiting for my luggage, it's taking a real long time.  I power up my MacBook.  I check my mail because I have a Verizon wireless card.  To me, I was thinking, well, if it had something to do with my computers, they certainly wouldn't  let me be using them in between the time of getting that message from the passport guy  and then being spoken to.  So then eventually I get my luggage.  I go down to downstairs.  They redirect me and they hand me this like Manila folder that was green with some paperwork  in there.  And they instruct me to put all my baggage on to this conveyor belt because I knew they  were going to do a search.  So the first thing they pull out of my carry-on bag was this thing called an HID card spoofer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I demonstrate that's not a good thing to have with you.  What is that for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's when I go around the world doing security demonstrations like a security magic show.  So I bring all this equipment.  This demonstrates how you could spoof HID cards.  So if I get close to you, I could read your card and I can push a button and spoof it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if I have one of those little cards that you get into doors with, you don't have to  steal the card.  You just get close enough you can read it and copy it.  Yeah, exactly.  And are those legal to own?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, 100%.  Okay.  Yeah.  Well, probably any electronics that you use for illegal purposes may be illegal, but there's  no crime against possessing one of those.  Or probably if you used it illegally, you'd be breaking the law.  So he pulls this out and the guy's eyes widen and he's going, what is this?  We got one.  Yeah.  And I'm going, well, that's an HID card spoofer.  He goes, a card spoofer?  He goes, it reads cards?  And I go, yeah, like the one dangling around your neck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right?  And then they're getting excited, you know, because they're like think they're going to  be rolling in the big fish or something.  So then he's searching some more and I'm skipping some of the story so I don't go on and on.  And then he finds my southward lockpick set.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now those are illegal, aren't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, not in Colombia, not in Atlanta, not if you're...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought you had to be a locksmith to have one of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, maybe you're not probably allowed to have them drive them around in your car  like in California.  Right.  But if you're at an airport, it's in your checked luggage.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's legal.  What are you going to do?  Pick the bathroom lock on the airplane?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, what are you going to do?  Go into the baggage area of the plane and like pick open the door?  I mean, it was in the checked luggage.  Okay.  Yeah, I didn't put any...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, this is post 9-11 so...  Well, they're a little suspicious.  ...schools for unlocking doors in planes is a little sketchy to some people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but...  Trying to do the search, they didn't know what they're going to find, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but I mean, there's certain things I put in my luggage simply because I do not  want to get into a discussion about them with anybody at TSA or Customs ever.  Yeah.  Me too.  And I would put lock picking equipment in that particular category.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I put it in my checked bag because I actually show this with my Art of Intrusion  talk.  Yeah, no, I mean...  You need the stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You need the...  Yeah, yeah.  Physical security is critical to have a secure site, end of discussion.  How easy is it to do it?  No, it totally makes sense, dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, most of the cockpit doors are push button locked, so I don't think that  would apply.  Can I bring something up because Patrick mentioned it earlier?  This doesn't sound to me like some random check of the laptops that we're all so fearful  of.  There was somebody tipped off, somebody else, and they decided to do...  This is like a normal stop that you would have had any time if somebody was suspicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, but no, actually the ICE agents, and that's later on in the story, told me they actually  had no suspicion.  They just...  They stopped me just because they can, that they had no probable cause or suspicion that  I had done anything wrong, but they have the power to go through all my stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But with anybody coming through, they can look at you and say, hey, this guy, I'm going  to go through his stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So was it a flag on your name or was it just because you happened to be an American leaving  the country?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Obviously it was on the computer I was flagged.  And they knew all my history.  Like, I was in Italy last month and I brought some kosher salami in, and what I did is I  declared it because it was on the customs form.  And I actually knew all about that too.  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's also part of tracking activity and customs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They got a dossier on you.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But don't you think coming from Colombia maybe makes some, has something to do with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But he does it every two months.  Is this the first time you've had any trouble?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  First time.  And later on, I brought like five kilos of coffee.  They didn't even look at that.  They weren't interested in the coffee.  But don't forget, as I'm going through this, I'm thinking that this whole search and seizure  thing had to do with this package in Colombia, right?  I wasn't thinking that they wanted to search my electronic stuff until it started becoming  more clearer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but can I bring up, I'm sorry, can I bring up one other thing?  Don't you think you say that you would make regular trips?  Regular trips is what a drug dealer would do and you would get stopped on occasion.  It doesn't make a, I mean, I'm not completely stunned by this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, you've got a convicted felon, hacker.  He's got lockpicks.  He's got a card reader.  He's going to Colombia every two months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, I know, but they found that out later.  I'm just saying he's going to Colombia on regular trips.  They stop him once in a while.  They stop me for going to Canada.  The point I'm making, this is not that what we're so fearful of is that they're going  to randomly grab anybody and just to look at our laptop and see if we've got porn.  That's what we've been talking about for weeks on end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But if they, oh no, they asked me about that.  When they specifically got to the point where they're going through my electronic stuff,  they were specifically asked me like five or six times, do I have porn on my computer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, but did they grab the laptop?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh yeah, there's a whole story.  Yeah, of course.  Okay, well let's get to that part.  That's the more interesting part.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So eventually, I got to tell you this because this is where it got funny, is when he saw  the lockpicks, I go, listen, I got a better lockpick kit that will open any door and it's  much more compact and you can't even see it unless you know what to look for.  And the guy's eyes widened, you know, as if I was going to make a confession.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because that's going to help you, given the guy a hard time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no, but I was like serious and sincere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Was it a card in your wallet or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it was my business card.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've seen his card.  Yeah, it's a little lockpick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So my business card is a lockpick set.  So right away, they realized that having a lockpick set was now no big deal because it's  in my business card.  So eventually, they called in ICE agents, which is Immigration Customs Enforcement.  And they told me they were asking me, well, why am I in Atlanta?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So was this the TSA that was talking to you initially?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, this was US Customs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what is how is ICE different from Customs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're Immigration Customs Enforcement.  ICE are the ones that actually know how to do forensics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're the police.  They're the police arm of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. OK.  So after waiting like 45 minutes, finally ICE shows up.  This guy was a single ICE agent.  And, you know, it's like, why are you in Atlanta?  And I felt like saying, well, I am kind of a US citizen.  I figured I could be in Atlanta without a passport.  But I didn't say that.  So instead, I told them the truth that I was moderating a panel for the ASIS  International Organization.  I have an FBI agent of the cyber crime division that's actually on my panel.  And I'm doing this on Thursday.  This is why I'm in town.  And they said, well, can you prove it?  I said, well, yeah, I have an itinerary.  Would you like to see it?  They go, yes.  And then I said, well, hand me my MacBook.  I got to go on the Internet because it's on my Gmail.  So they hand me my MacBook.  I plug in my Verizon card.  I power it up.  And the first thing Firefox does when I boot it up on my Mac is it asks you to clear  private data and just instinctively, I click yes.  And then right away, they grab my laptop back thinking, destroying evidence.  Yeah, which I wasn't.  But that was besides the point.  So they grabbed it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, so you claimed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Believe me, if I was going to hide something, my whole the whole hard drive  would be encrypted, there'd be no forensics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, no, no, I guess what I'm saying is like, like it's this is this is  this sounds more like a comedy of errors and a bad run of luck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you can't see how the agents might have thought something was going on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I can see it.  I mean, I was I was a, you know, I was a funny looking kid who occasionally  wore Rasta beanies and I got pulled over constantly in the state of New Jersey  because they profiled, you know, and I had my car searched probably over a dozen times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait a minute. You had Rasta hair.  You had like dreadlocks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is that what you said? No, no, no, Rasta beanie, a hat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I don't think I fit the profile.  You know, I come into customs. I'm well dressed.  I'm not like in a T-shirt and jeans.  Well, what's I mean, because I can actually I can handle more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've been hassled more in customs and by the TSA when I'm in business dress  than I am in, you know, like scary skate rat clothes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's kind of funny. Every time I go through TSA and they always do a bag check  because of my business cards and they love them.  They always want they always want one.  So a lot of TSA agents are walking around with my lockpick card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're like was you just you just like having dangerous cards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, yeah, so anyway, they grab it back and then I have to call  had a call to the main number for the FBI and DC.  I tracked down the agent, put him on the phone and then right away,  they think it's a big social engineering scam.  They don't believe he's an agent. They believe he's a comrade.  So that took another hour for them to figure out that it was a real agent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  An hour. Doesn't he carry ID?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's on the telephone.  Oh, telephone. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't they have a secret question?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Anyone could be anyone on the telephone.  You never know.  So I never know.  Never know you're a dog on the Internet, right? Right.  Never know it's a dog. So.  So he and then the ASIS organization also has a lot of ex agents.  In fact, the guy that was the director of airport security  was actually at the conference.  So he was also calling to find out like, why am I being detained?  And so on and so forth.  So all this stuff was going on.  And again, in the back of my mind, I'm thinking this has to do with the pack  cocaine or whatever that the Colombian police here are looking into.  So eventually I get moved into this like  interrogation room, like a really Kafkaesque interrogation room.  It's all bugged. It's all camera, audio recorded.  And then they start inventorying everything, going through my bags.  And it surprised me how much electronic stuff I carry because I'm kind of a pack rat.  I don't even think about it. I just throw it into my bag.  And I never clean it.  So I'm carrying like I was carrying like four Nokia phones, three iPhones,  you know, maybe maybe about 30 USB drives, you know, for Bluetooth dongle.  I had I had like a Acahabara, you know, if you know that place in Tokyo.  Yeah, that was in my bag. Acahabara in my bag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So why do you have three iPhones and four Nokia phones?  I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the three iPhones I used to have the other.  I have the one 3G that was on my belt that I use.  Then I had two 2G's.  And the reason was that I have one 2G beyond the US network  and the other 2G beyond the foreign network.  So I'm not getting killed with roaming right now.  That makes sense.  Yeah. So and then when I got the 3G phone, I just kept the 2G's in my in my bag.  I didn't even think about, you know, leaving one of the 2G's at home.  And, you know, just threw them both in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they do.  Patrick, are you typing, Patrick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's John. Is it John?  I'm moving into this room and I'm sitting there.  I'm a tattle.  And I decide they're going to inventory everything,  which would take maybe about 18 to 16 hours to go through all my stuff.  And eventually, ICE agent shows back up and he's very apologetic.  He goes, listen, we got a call from the Atlanta FBI.  They said that you're a good guy, that you're helping out,  that you go around the world helping people.  And, you know, we're sorry this happened to you.  As far as we're concerned, ICE has nothing to do with this anymore.  And prior to doing this, this was the same guy that told me that all my equipment  will be seized probably up for 90 for up to 90 days.  So they could do like a forensic analysis of all my equipment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, that's interesting. What does it take to trigger that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I basically said, well, why?  And he says, because we can.  And I said, well, you know what? You're right.  I read the court case that you guys have the power to take all my electronic  equipment and search it. So if you do so, there's nothing I can do.  There's electronic equipment.  Then a custom agent goes, well, why don't we see if this guy's going to cooperate with us?  So he hands me my ASUS 900, a little notebook that I used in my pen testing demos.  And it's a little, it almost looks like a CD player.  It's a pretty small notebook.  And normally it boots off an SD card.  If you don't put off the SD card, it boots off the firmware on the ASUS 900,  which is like a bastardized Linux that I never use.  Right. So I had the SD card, actually, my laptop case.  And so he booted up. He says, OK, let's see if you're going to cooperate.  I want you to log us into this computer.  I'm thinking to myself, God, if I was in, I'd be asking them to log.  I'd be asking me to log into my Mac. Not to that thing. But OK.  And I told him, I said, listen, there's two accounts on there.  There's one, Kevin.  The Kevin account only has access to Kevin's files.  And then there's another account called Root.  And the Root account has access to everything.  I go, which one do you want me to log you into?  I guess. And he said Root.  And I said, fine. And he handed me the computer.  I put in the password, which is Root backwards.  Tor as it comes, you know, this default on the firmware.  And then they were looking on this.  There's nothing on it.  900 for a good 20 minutes. Right.  Looking for pornography.  They go, where do you have pornography?  And I go, well, I don't have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where do you keep your part out, dude?  Were they just maybe they were just after the porn for their own collections?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know, but they're really into this porn, you know, stuff.  And I go, well, you know, I'm sorry to say I don't have any on there.  But but you're welcome to look.  And so then so then, you know, then that ICE agent came in.  He apologized, said that the Fed said I'm, you know, that they vouch for me,  that, you know, I'm legit.  So then then he says, well, I'm done with you.  But customs is a different federal agency.  So you have to, you know, I'm clear of you.  I'm done. He left.  And he will apologize.  He's a nice guy, actually.  And then the custom agents continued inventoring my stuff, you know,  and pulled out something from my laptop like, what is this?  Oh, that's a Bluetooth dongle.  Well, what does that do?  I said, you see your PDA on your belt?  And he goes, yeah.  I said, well, I could like take your address book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, why do you say stuff like that?  That's inflammatory. Tell the truth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Tell the truth.  Because that's what I use it for. Right.  But I do it legit.  And they were they were very interested.  You know, he turned off his phone, though, after I told him.  I bet he did.  But you usually have to plug in the dongle into something.  You know, the dongle doesn't work without.  Of course. Into a device. Right.  It's not going through the air.  I told him the application for what it's used for,  I had no reason to hide anything. Right. OK.  So so then eventually, after about 30 minutes, they let me go.  And I got to leave with all my computer equipment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is there is there a big child porn traffic to Columbia?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, what's the deal with all the porn?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did they ask you if you had any stolen movies or music?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, they did.  And they also asked me  whether the computers were all mine, were the phones all mine?  Of course, they said I wouldn't be carrying them unless they were mine.  You know, I mean, it's a no brainer.  I don't even know why they'd ask that question. But a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, because if they find something on it, you can't you can't say, oh,  oh, let's make my girlfriends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're offering you an out when they do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they're all offering you to incriminate yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. So but I mean, it was like four hours.  And then OK, so as soon as I get, you know, customs is letting me go.  I call my girlfriend and Bogota and I go, hey, what's happening with this thing?  And she goes, oh, yeah, FedEx.  They drilled your drive open.  They drilled, you know, they used a drill to drill it open,  of course, damaging the drive. Right.  Because they thought there was cocaine in the drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They weren't looking for data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No. And they said there was nothing there.  There was no drugs.  And they just shipped the package back to the states.  I have it already.  And and what I suspect that happened is I took it to like a mailboxes,  et cetera, in Bogota.  You know, it wasn't called mailboxes, et cetera.  It was called something else.  And they probably had they packed everything up.  So maybe there was some cocaine residue on the paper.  Something tripped the alarm at FedEx.  And then that's when this whole thing happened.  And of course, I didn't think it was a coincidence.  I thought it was related.  It was a coincidence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think now.  Do you think it was a coincidence now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Just bad.  I never got my equipment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  They would have looked for cocaine in that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And there was nothing on that drive.  It wasn't like it wasn't even encrypted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was I think the point here.  I mean, look, obviously, it's a bad circumstance all around.  Maybe they had maybe they knew a little bit about your history.  That might have encouraged them.  But the point here is they're looking for what pornography,  pornography and stolen music and music and movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what they were looking for.  They asked that several times.  What movies do you have?  What music do you have?  What pornography do you have?  And that seemed to be a real interest on their part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is porn illegal there or something?  What's the big deal?  He's in Atlanta, Georgia.  At this time, I just don't understand why they keep  making a big deal about the porn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're looking for child porn or illegal porn of some kind.  I don't know what else is illegal.  I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  And anyway, I have a security procedure  that I've done for the last two years  that I've traveled overseas.  Any of my client data and any of my private data  is encrypted and sent to the US via the internet  and wiped from my machine before I even get on the plane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't carry data across the border.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I don't.  And if I do, it's encrypted.  But that's lightweight data.  If I'm working on a pen test for a client  and I don't have the opportunity, it's a time issue.  I got to land.  I got to go to the client's office.  Then while I'll use TrueCrypt or PGP or something else.  But now I'm going to up my security protocol  where I'm going to buy a new MacBook.  It's going to be a clone of the one I already have.  I'm going to use probably Mac PGP's whole disk encryption.  So that way, I'll have it at a family member's house.  And any time if my machine gets seized,  because I won't give up my encryption keys to anybody,  they don't have to talk to my lawyer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They can compel you to give the keys.  No, there was actually a court case in Vermont

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  where a guy did say, I'm not going to give you the password.  The names of the files sounded like child porn.  He said no.  And the judge said no.  He doesn't have to give it to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wow, so that's turned around already.  That's fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But right now in the United States of America,  the law is you don't have to give up the keys.  What they do is they just seize your equipment.  But I won't really care because I'll  have a complete backup of everything.  And it's really the data.  And eventually, they'll have to send me the hardware back.  Because I don't have an exception in my nondisclosure  agreements with my clients.  And I do a lot of security testing  with some Fortune 500 companies.  I don't have a disclosure.  And they're saying I could disclose it to customs,  or I could disclose it to federal agents.  I don't have that in there.  So I could legally be sued if I don't  protect any information that's held under the NDA.  I care more about that than my private email.  So that the truth be known, a lot of my email  goes through Gmail.  And I'm sure a lot of employees at Google have access to it.  So it's my client stuff that's encrypted or private  that I care about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Kevin, I'm glad we could get you on.  It does sound like something that maybe some people should  pay attention to in the future and follow your protocol  about being at least very careful about what  they carry across the border.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and of course, I don't condone  taking anything illegal like child porn  or any stolen information.  I'm just saying your civil liberties  and protecting your privacy, I think, is important.  And if you have any data that's under a non-disclosure  agreement, you could be sued if that ends up  in the wrong hands.  And I think by encrypting it, you  could show if there is a court case later  that you took reasonable measures to protect  your client's information.  If you don't take any reasonable measures  and you knowingly go through a border,  then is it arguably that you're not  protecting the information under the NDA?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's the new book going to be called, Kevin?  Your memoir?  I don't know yet.  Have to come up with a good name for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The best title is taken.  I can't take it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's the best title?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Catch Me If You Can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kevin Mitnick is at mitnicksecurity.com.  And he's always been a great friend.  And it's really good to talk to you.  His books, The Art of Intrusion and The Art of Deception,  are out and available.  Intrusion talks about the real stories of hackers.  Fascinating stuff.  The Art of Deception is all about social engineering.  And both are very valuable.  And I guess if we go to Mitnick Security,  we can get a schedule of your upcoming speaking engagements.  I know you're very busy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I have a speech.  I'm traveling all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're going to stay in the country for a while now?  Or are you afraid of crossing the border again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  I actually have to travel out to Mexico in late October,  later this month.  So hopefully the new MacBooks will be out so I could  cut mine up before I leave.  Good luck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you a little nervous about crossing the border now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  No.  Because I really, even if they see my computer  and did forensic analysis, I mean.  There was nothing on it.  What would have been the worst thing?  With my gig with ASIS, I had all my notes for my panel.  And those would have been gone.  And then I had a speaking gig in New York.  And all my whole presentation would have been gone.  So it would have really been a disaster.  But now I know to make sure I have a backup of anything  important before I go through a US border stop.  And I'm really, I have to say, I'm really thankful.  They could have made it a lot worse for me.  They could have been nastier.  But they weren't.  They didn't take my equipment.  I guess they were just doing their job, probably based  on my criminal history.  But it was a really scary experience.  And why it was scary is because of that coincidental incident  happening in Bogota, Colombia.  So I actually thought somebody had put drugs  in some package of mine.  And I was going to be the victim like that Australian  girl in Indonesia or Bali, where you  heard these horror stories.  And that's what I was really afraid of.  I wasn't really afraid of anything on my computer.  Because yeah, I could get sued if there's stuff disclosed  under NDA.  But it's probably unlikely if it was a search  by a government agency.  I don't know.  But that's what really made me worried.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go ahead, Patrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was going to say I'd rather be sued than go to Turkish prison.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree.  Yeah, pretty much.  Midnight Express, right, Patrick?  Well, in case blogger Bob's of the TSA is listening,  that's been Kevin Mushnick.  And Kevin.  What?  Mushnick?  Just in case blogger Bob's listening.  Kevin Mishnick.  No, Kevin, thank you for joining us.  Mitnicksecurity.com.  It's great to talk to you again.  Stay in touch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Leo, when are we going to travel  internationally together?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nah, never.  Come on.  I'm right behind you, Kevin, in the line.  Right behind.  I don't know that guy.  I don't want any adventure.  I don't know that guy.  No, I wouldn't mind having that experience.  If I've got some time to kill, it'd be better than waiting  for a plane in a hard seat in the airport lounge somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Depends on what country you're in, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you're right.  Thank you, Kevin.  Have a great day.  All right, take care.  Bye bye.  Bye bye.  Kevin, Mitnick, we're going to get to the news of the day  in just a second.  There's quite a bit this week.  And of course, Patrick Norton, Veronica Belmont,  both of Tekzilla are with us, as well as John C. Dvorak.org  slash blog, who's writing his memoirs even now.  But before we leave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't stop writing my memoirs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you ever going to do memoirs?  I'd like to read your memoirs, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're in, Leo.  I'd like to hear the fictional memoirs of John C. Dvorak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that'd be more interesting.  Maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  John C. Dvorak is fictional.  He's a fake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He died four years ago.  He's been played by an actor ever since.  This show brought to you by Gobi from Qualcomm,  the global internet, global mobile internet.  The new Gobi device is a wireless network card  built into many new notebooks from the leading manufacturers.  And the beauty of a Gobi is it allows  you to access multiple wireless carrier networks,  whether it's HSDPA, EVDO, anywhere in the world.  So you don't have to worry about which wireless carrier you're  working with.  It works with them all.  And it's built in, so no external little antennas  to snap off or lose.  The world is your hotspot with multimode support.  And if you're a corporate network manager  and you've got to buy, you get one device  with multiple carrier support.  So there's only one SKU for your notebook purchase  anywhere in the world.  Gobi, the world is your hotspot.  Gobi-powered notebooks are now available from leading notebook  manufacturers.  Go to gobiennywhere.com slash devices.  That's G-O-B-I-anywhere.com slash devices for the Gobi notebook  for you.  And when you're there, by the way,  you can also subscribe to an RSS feed  so that you can be notified of new Gobi-enabled laptops.  I already put in my order for a Panasonic Toughbook  with the Gobi.  I'm really excited about this.  Gobi, the world is your hotspot.  Gobi from Qualcomm.  Thank you for their support.  This week in tech.  So let's see.  There was so much to talk about.  Last week we ended the show.  We were a little bit worried because the copyright board  was about to increase the royalty fee paid  to the publishers of music from $0.09 a song to $0.15 a song  for online music stores.  Apple on last week said, hey, if they do that,  we're closing the iTunes music store.  Can you believe that?  We're closing the iTunes music store.  There'll be no profit in it.  We'll never find out if it was an empty threat  because on Thursday the copyright board said, all right,  we're going to freeze the fee at $0.09.  Veronica, have closed iTunes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I said I highly doubted it at the time.  I thought it was just a bluff.  But then thinking about things they've done in the past,  especially with NBC and taking all their shows off  the iTunes store, who knows?  I mean, they have the power to do this kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Jobs is known to be crazy.  You could see Jobs saying, ah, screw them,  and just saying, we're shutting the doors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It would have been a huge deal.  Can you imagine that?  Well, I wonder how.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Go ahead, Patrick.  The RIAA would have freaked because if the recent rounds  of statistics are correct, the iTunes  is the number one retailer of music in the United States.  And they would have just effectively,  through their lobbying program, killed iTunes.  And what a lot of people have said  is that the RIAA, after the last copyright royalty board  debacle, was actually telling them  to keep it a little tame this time,  keep it a little more relaxed this time, no more Pandora  events.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and that's good news, too, for Pandora,  because Congress passed that bill saying,  we're going to wait till the sound exchange negotiations  are through and let them determine the price.  Remember, again, this is another case where,  it's confusing because it was the publishers who  were asking for the increase on music sales online,  and it was the RIAA asking for the increase on internet radio.  The labels were asking for radio.  The publishers were asking it for online stores.  But both of them wanted the copyright board  to raise these royalties.  It's just plain greed.  And I think the key is on this is they  want to squeeze until it breaks, to get right to the point  where either the iTunes music store closes  or every internet radio station shuts down,  and just pull back a little bit.  So now what's happened, they pushed the copyright board.  They pushed the copyright board.  Fortunately, Congress said, OK, we're going to step in.  We're going to kind of say, hold on, negotiate a deal  with sound exchange.  We don't want Pandora to go out of business.  Tim Westergren has said, this is very good news for Pandora.  They've saved internet radio.  Thank goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it took a lot of work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That bill's been online for some time, I think.  I'm actually surprised, given everything else  Congress has been doing, they managed to get that through.  Now, the president hasn't signed it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Once that first $140 billion report gets taken care of,  the rest of it's easily out.  Can you believe that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everybody's crazy because it's $700 billion bailout.  And then they just tack on more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then it's OK.  Free money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Get it while you can.  I just hope this election, they just  throw the sons of guns out.  Just throw them all out.  That happens.  Apparently there are more, we're not  going to get political here, but apparently there  are a large number of seats now that are at risk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I should point out, when Leo says throw the sons of guns  out, he means the entire House and Senate.  Let's start over.  Fresh start.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they're not all up for a re-election.  That's one of the rare times I'm in total political agreement  with Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But who do you elect that's going to be any better?  That's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Come on, who's going to say it?  Leo for Congress.  No, I'm not running.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you should.  Did any of you guys order a G1 phone, the Android phone,  the Google phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can't switch back to T-Mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Amar, fortunately I already have a T-Mobile SIM  in my Blackberry Curve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm in the process of trying to get one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I sent an email to Google.  They said that we will try to get you one under embargo.  But don't worry.  The embargo will be lifted before October 22.  That's the day I'll be getting one anyway,  because I did immediately order one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, you know, Ryan actually got his hands on one for the day.  I saw.  And he loved it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He loved it.  Ryan Block of gdgt.com has a review.  Tell us a little bit about what he got.  He seemed to really like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, do you want to tell them about the Google Android?  Look at this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look at this, an instant guest appearance.  Ryan Block.  Hey, Ryan.  How are you?  The GDGT going great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's going well so far.  We haven't actually launched yet,  but what we have launched, namely the podcast.  I love the podcast.  The podcast.  Yeah, it's doing pretty well so far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I listened to your Android cast.  But you got your hands on one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You got a G1.  I did for a short amount of time.  About a day, I got to hang out with it  and put it through its paces.  I mean, it's not enough time to really know.  I mean, I couldn't do a review of a product like that that's  got so much about it to know and so many nuances to discover  in such a short amount of time.  But having spent the day with it, I really, really did like it.  Why?  Was that John?  Yeah, of course.  Why did I like it?  Well, it's very snappy.  It's very responsive.  It didn't feel sluggish or doggish in any way.  The browser is solid.  I mean, it's a distant number two to mobile Safari  on the iPhone.  Really distant?  Yeah, it's just not quite there.  The usability is there's some really annoying things  about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We've all played with the emulator in the SDK.  I mean, that gives you a pretty good idea  what the browser can do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's very simple stuff.  Like if you're loading a page, you have to,  and you want to stop, you want to hit the stop button  like you would on any other browser.  And this is an especially important thing  when you're on a mobile device.  And going back and forth can take longer than on a desktop.  Having quick access to a stop button is very important.  Android hides that behind a click.  So you have to click the browser buttons and then hit stop.  Very, very small, very simple thing.  It drove me absolutely crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You said that the shelf didn't bug you either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it didn't.  It was not that bad.  I mean, if you've ever used the sidekick,  it either bugs you or it doesn't.  It's like the sidekick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact, it slides up a little bit like the sidekick.  It kind of looks like a sidekick a little bit.  Yeah, a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Andy Rubin, who's the lead of Android at Google,  he was one of the original people on the site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's right.  Yeah, so that's not a surprise.  Although HTC, which makes this handset,  has a lot of experience with the Tilt and the Mogul  and all these other phones.  Does it feel similar to those?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It does feel like a very high quality handset.  The mechanism, which I was actually  a little worried about, it feels very strong.  It's very sturdy.  Yeah, it doesn't feel weak or flimsy.  It doesn't feel like it's going to fly off or anything  like that, especially considering how much spring they  put into it.  And the whole handset just feels really solid.  I mean, considering that, unlike the first gen iPhone,  it's not a big brick of metal.  There isn't glass or chrome or metal on this thing.  It's all pretty much plastic.  But for a largely plastic cell phone, it feels really solid.  Keyboard?  It's flat, which is a little bit of a bummer.  But not bad.  It's got a good feel to it, good tactility.  And it's large enough that I have really stubby fingers,  really stubby thumbs.  It's large enough that I was able to type on it very easily.  Good, because I have stubby thumbs.  I think you'll be OK.  And it's a thumb type.  If you're like me, you probably don't like the iPhone keyboard  very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I hate it.  I can't type on it because I have stubby fingers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I can't either.  I found the G1 keyboard to be pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Predictive text, T9, or something else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, there isn't really any predictive text  that I saw just because you've got the keyboard.  You don't need it.  Most phones that have a keyboard like that,  including Windows mobile phones, yeah, they don't really  bother with the predictive text.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I ordered one just because I think  that it's going to be a pretty strong competitor.  Well, yeah, OK, that's the real reason.  But it's a very interesting contrast  between this phone and the iPhone.  It's almost exact opposite in many ways.  As much as it looks the same and has similar functionality,  it's open in almost every way possible,  except for the T-Mobile network.  But other companies are going to make handsets,  and other carriers have already announced  they're going to carry it.  So it's really an open operating system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, well, the interesting thing about that  is because it's so open, they basically  can't stop people from unlocking it.  Well, that's very intriguing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  T-Mobile saying we're going to block tethering, how?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, well, they're paying that lip service.  They don't want to encourage people to do it.  But a lot of journalists, including some of my friends  at Engadget, kind of cornered them  after the Android event in New York and said, look,  level with us.  You're not going to be able to stop anybody from doing this.  And they said, yeah, we know.  We're saying we don't encourage that behavior.  But they know.  I mean, they're not stupid.  They know there's no way they can prevent people  from tethering this to the laptop or unlocking these devices.  And that's something that they are aware of  and that they just have to deal with that if they want  to have this kind of a device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's interesting, because the Sidekick on T-Mobile  was more locked down than even the iPhone.  It was the ultimate in lockdown devices.  Do you think Andy Rubin learned his lesson  and said, let's not this time around?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I mean, the Sidekick was never  meant to be a power user phone.  It was never meant to be a smartphone.  It was a completely different kind of device.  It was locked down the same way that most, quote unquote,  feature phones are locked down.  And that is they don't really have an app ecosystem.  They don't, you know, they're not really meant to be expanded.  They're kind of an out of box experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you could buy apps, but a very limited subset.  Right.  So T-Mobile is going to have its app store.  But then there's still the Google apps that you can,  you're not tied to T-Mobile's app store on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's not actually T-Mobile's app store.  It's just called the Android Marketplace.  And so there's not going to be a separate hand in it.  No, I mean, I'm pretty sure that no matter what  Android device you're using, this marketplace,  yeah, it's going to work on all of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can actually, according to what we had,  one of the Google guys on Cranky Geeks last week,  and you can actually just develop whatever you want  and put it on your own website and sell it that way.  That's the app, this whole lock down, you know,  onerous lock down system that Apple has is out.  So there'll be Flash, there'll be Skype,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  there'll be everything that you can't get on the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, yes and no.  I mean, Flash is one of those interesting and peculiar  things where you actually have to kind of build that  into the browser, especially on a mobile device.  So it's going to partly be up to them to have that.  But there's nothing to say that Mozilla team couldn't  develop a version of Firefox for Android  that incorporates Flash from the ground up, right?  But yeah, I mean, John is right.  You don't have to use the marketplace.  That's kind of the thing with Apple  is you have to use the marketplace.  There's no way that you can't use the marketplace.  Well, on Android, you don't have to use the marketplace.  Even if you want to use the marketplace,  they're not really going to be checking to make sure  that your app isn't evil or anything like that.  I mean, it's going to kind of be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's no vetting process as there is on the iTunes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that there is a smaller vetting process,  but it's more to the developer and not to the app.  Basically, their vetting process is you must prove  that you are who you say you are.  So if something bad does happen, we can get a hold of you.  And that's pretty much it.  I mean, as far as I know, that's more or less the extent  of the vetting process.  But you still don't have to use the marketplace.  There's an option deep within the G1 settings,  within Android settings, which allows you to enable using  unsigned apps, apps that were not downloaded  from the marketplace.  So you can just grab apps from the internet.  It gives you a little warning.  It says, well, we can't really keep  track of what you're doing with these apps or whatever.  If you do that, it's going to be a little bit more unsafe,  but you can do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's going to be very interesting.  I mean, here you have the lockdown phone  with seamless user experience.  That's the Apple idea versus something wide open where,  yeah, users are going to put stuff on.  Stuff runs in the background.  They're going to crash.  All sorts of stuff can happen.  And yet they have freedom.  And I'll be very curious to see who's  attracted to which way of being and which one does better  ultimately is really the key.  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's a good alternative.  It's not meant to be the iPhone.  I think in many ways it's meant to be the anti-iPhone.  The anti-iPhone, yeah.  Yeah, I mean, I think a lot of people are kind of,  there's a certain set of people with the iPhone who kind of get  those limitations and they're looking for a good alternative.  And I would place myself in that group.  But I think most people, the vast majority of people  who have an iPhone are probably not  going to look at the G1 and say, oh, I really want that.  I mean, this is really, it's a phone that when it launches  is going to be targeted towards the geek set, in my opinion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why I ordered one.  Can't wait.  Cannot wait.  Ryan, thank you so much.  Yeah, thank you so much.  I appreciate it.  Talk to you guys soon.  All right, take care.  Nice to get you on.  Ryan Block from GDGT, which doesn't say anything.  It doesn't mean gadget.  It's just gdgt.com.  It does actually mean gadget.  It does?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you can also say it gadget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can?  I thought Ryan said we shouldn't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He prefers GDGT.  Oh, OK.  Don't listen to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a lot easier to say gadget.  GDGT is hard to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right, I got my headset back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yay.  You were very nice of you, Veronica,  to let that guy interlopers just kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it was actually perfect timing because I  aimed him for one of the remaining Guinnesses  in the fridge because it was getting  to be about 200 degrees in the office.  And he came in and you asked about Android.  And I was like, well, this is perfect timing.  I'm going to go get a beer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'm glad you keep your Guinness cold.  Very important.  Indeed.  All right, we're going to talk in just a bit about how  Craigslist can be used to, I don't know, set up bank heists.  Turns out to work quite well.  Before we do that, I want to mention the folks at GoToMe.  They are supporting this podcast.  And we support them.  I've used GoToMeeting for years to do online meetings.  They've been advertising with me for something like five years  now.  And I'm really proud of the relationship with Citrix,  the makers of GoToMyPC and GoToMeeting.  Now on Mac or PC.  I want to tell you how you could try it free for 30 days.  But first, let me tell you what it is.  If you're setting up conference calls, online meetings,  and you really want people, let's say you got a PowerPoint  presentation.  You got a client across the country.  You do not want to spend money on an airplane ticket.  You do not want to go through what Kevin just went through  at the airport.  You do not want to get the middle seat for four hours.  You just want to show them the PowerPoint.  Simple as can be.  You set up GoToMeeting.  It takes just a couple of minutes to set it up on your  computer.  And then you call your client and say, I'd like to show you  something.  Go to GoToMeeting.com and enter in this meeting ID.  And there's in the, what is it, six, eight digit number,  something like that.  And all of a sudden, he's seeing your computer on his  screen.  He sees your PowerPoint.  You can show him documents.  You could show him drawings.  You can collaborate on stuff together.  I've done it for, I just used it a couple of weeks ago for a  speech.  We had to rehearse a slideshow.  And GoToMeeting is so lickety split fast that we could  rehearse in real time.  This slideshow that had 60 slides in 60 minutes, it was  boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  Worked great.  GoToMeeting.  Now try it free by going to GoToMeeting.com slash twit.  GoToMeeting.com slash twit.  You get 30 days unlimited use.  That's a month of unlimited use.  That's a month of unlimited online meetings free.  And by the way, you're going to get used to this.  And you'll be glad to know it's still every month one low flat  monthly rate.  So you don't have to count meetings.  You don't have to count minutes.  Meet as much as you want.  You're going to find a lot of uses for this.  GoToMeeting.com slash twit.  We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.  So I love this story.  It's all, this is, there's going to be a movie made out of  this.  It's just too good.  Bank of America branch, Monroe, Washington.  Guy comes in dressed.  Did you hear about this one, Patrick?  He's dressed in a vest, a yellow vest, safety goggles, a blue shirt and a respirator mask.  He looks like, I guess, a construction worker.  He goes over to the guard.  Actually it's not in the bank.  It's at the curb of the bank.  He goes over to the guard who's supervising the unloading of cash from the truck, sprays  the guard with pepper spray, grabs the bag of money, runs off.  OK, but get ready for this.  So the cops come there.  They, you know, the guys are chasing after him on foot.  All of a sudden they run into a gaggle of people dressed in yellow vest, safety goggles,  blue shirts and respirator masks.  There's dozens of them on the street.  They were responding to a Craigslist ad.  The ad in Craigslist said that there was a good job paying twenty eight fifty an hour.  They were looking for road maintenance workers.  They say wait near the Bank of America wearing yellow vest, safety goggles, a respirator  mask, preferably a blue shirt, a dozen show up.  The cops run into them. They can't find the crook.  He's gone. Eventually they did find this.  I don't know. This gets a little weird.  They found the getaway inner tube.  Apparently, yeah, that's what I said.  What? Apparently he jumped in a creek at the Skyecomish River near Monroe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Without a paddle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  With an inner tube, a respirator, a blue shirt and safety goggles goes down the creek  and his inner tube gets away scot free.  And according to this story on CNET News, Craigslist founder Craig Newmark was not  immediately available for comment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love that story.  Well, the guy's not available for comment on anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know. Craig, did you hear people use Craigslist?  Now, doesn't that sound like I mean, you'd make more money writing the movie script  than you would robbing a bank on that one.  That's a brilliant idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And all those poor saps didn't get paid either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I bet. No, they didn't get their $28.50.  Not a damn cent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're probably it's it's it's.  It's a job they came out for.  No, it was a good job.  Exploited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's exploiting the workers, taking advantage of our economic crisis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I mean, you could you could do you could post an ad like that  and get a bunch of people any time outside of like San Francisco  during the dot com era.  But it would have had to have been like $400 an hour. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, what is what is what is office space in San Francisco going for now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A lot is not not as not as.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think the commercial markets is tanked, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it's tanked so much that they're building all kinds of new towers downtown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but they made those deals months ago.  They're really sorry now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're not on Wall Street, Leo.  I mean, there's certainly financial services in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a lot of empty offices, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did they ever fill the what was it, the fashion center that we were in?  Where tech TV was, it was empty when we got there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But that was also but that's I mean, it was empty when we were gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's a difference, though, between building class A office space  in the financial district. I suppose, you know, they're building a lot of towers

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  down in South San Francisco and Brisbane. Really? Yeah.  There's a lot of construction going on in that area.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, there is.  And there's and they're still building all the all the medical center stuff  down on China Basin, just right.  Right. Third Street, just north of our studios.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And as I'm told, Karen tells me is the Skycomish.  You should have corrected me, John, the Skycomish River.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, there's so many screwball names up there.  Snow home ish, skycomish, skowamish,  she is the snow home ish.  I mean, you go nuts looking at these crazy names.  I mean, I didn't know that many American, right? Yeah.  Everyone of them is some little tribe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By screwball, I'm talking about my friends, the Native Americans.  Mafia Boy is writing a memoir.  I should have asked Kevin about this.  Kevin's writing his memoir. John's writing his.  Michael, I guess his name is Kalsy, Kalsy is writing a memoir.  He's the guy.  You remember this, Patrick, because we were we were on the air  February 2000, who shut down CNN, Yahoo, Amazon, eBay.  It was the first time I think most people had ever heard of a distributed  denial of a service attack.  I remember calling around, calling experts, saying, what is a DDoS?  How do they do it?  Learned about sin floods.  So his book is going to be called, I'm not buying it, by the way.  His book is going to be called Mafia Boy,  How I Cracked the Internet and Why It's Still Broken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, can I, can I, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  Can I, I'm still looking over this rubber hires decoys.  Yes. Story. Yes.  Did they ever mention how many people they managed to attract?  I'd say about a dozen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's it. Well, a dozen's enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was just thinking it might be an interesting way to harass companies  you don't like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, what you say dress up as a giant rat and stand outside and walk over here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He probably would have had better luck just announcing some kind of flash mob.  I come down sometime in the afternoon.  It's going to be hilarious.  Your camera phone. Yeah.  It'll go up on the Internet. It'll be huge on YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that's when Veronica began writing the core themes for Hackers 2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Veronica's got everybody's got a script in their rollerblades.  Their little drawer there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You have a script kept in my pocket. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, there's been a bunch of interesting rumors floating around recently.  I've got one that's kind of funny. All right. Let's hear it.  It says that the ATM machine, because of our financial crisis  and they had these banks are all screwed up, that all the ATM machines  will be out of money this week. Wow.  So you go to an ATM machine is going to say, no, I'm out of money. Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a guaranteed way to start a bank run.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, guaranteed people were saying that, though, but people were saying that, John,  because if a lot of people were saying if the seven hundred billion dollar  financing, if the American people not paying for the Wall Street screw ups  doesn't go through.  And I understand there's some viable reasons for wanting to keep credit flow  and then, you know, blah, blah, blah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But boy, I mean, if you wanted to, I mean, that's remember I saw.  I saw it's a wonderful life.  I remember all the guys, you know, all the people saying you can't  you can't have your money at the bank and it's shutting the doors.  And I mean, that's how you start to run on the bank is you see you go to the ATM  and nothing comes out.  Don't you think you'd immediately go in and demand all your deposits?  And of course, the bank doesn't have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you're OK. You're insured.  You're insured. Right.  Nobody in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We don't have bank runs anymore.  That's the reason they have that insurance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That was the John.  The stuff I was hearing from from guys in New York were like, yeah,  if things get squirrely, you may want to have a few hundred put aside  just to buy groceries and stuff under the mattress.  Yeah, because they expected they expected, you know, it to go old school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. So let's say the bank goes under and I've got, you know, whatever  my 50,000 in the bank or whatever.  She doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not even I'm not going to get that money tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not going to get that money next week.  I'm not going to get that money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  50,000 dollars tomorrow. Any money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do you think they're going to do?  FEMA is going to set up a card table out in front of the bank  and give me ten dollar bills.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you just have a bad attitude.  You know, they have had bank runs in London and Amsterdam, I think Ireland.  And now I think Iceland is out of money.  You know, most of this is because they bought our crap, our loans.  I think we're the only ones in good shape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Whoops. Was there now IndyMac?  How did that it wasn't there?  I mean, that kind of what happened at IndyMac is that people said,  I want I want my money. Yeah, that was a bank run.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  You know, these bank runs come and go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I thought you said we didn't have bank runs in the United States, John.  You know, they go mostly when they happen, they go some

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because you get a bunch of dummies that don't realize that this money's secure  and they, you know, do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, there's a difference between secure and, you know, I mean, everybody.  We got to buy groceries next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, you use your, you know, you.  You can. I mean, it doesn't mean the money's not there.  You're still in the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The voice for reason reminds all twit listeners  do not run on the bank at FDI insured and not all banks,  especially if you live in an urban metropolis  and speak a foreign language as your primary means of communication.  Not all banks are FDIC insured.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, I'm taking all my money out tomorrow.  See, you see, you see, that's how it happens.  You panicked me now. Yeah, I panicked.  Totally panicked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'm trying the voice of reason here.  Do not panic. Do not panic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Citizens, citizens, stay off the streets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So there is no cause for alarm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm going to Japan tomorrow.  Are you really? Yeah.

Transcript:  I have never gotten mad about you talking about.  Not even a little bit.  And the last time you said something like that,  we both got like 400 emails about how we hate each other.  We have to tell people they love each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They get real mad. They love each other. Who?  I love you, John. That's what we're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, Veronica is basically like the Mike Scott, like the office.  Like, what's his name?  The guy, the star of Off the Office, Mike Scott,  who goes off to make his movies while everybody at the. Yeah.  And you're going off to make your movies and everybody just kind of wait  until you come back so they can do a show.  You're like the big star.  No, don't say that.  You just do it without her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Life goes on without Veronica.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apparently that's that's kind of discouraging, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it's awesome. It's good.  Because then I like to watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not everyone, Leo, can chain themselves to their desk,  you know, produce 20 hours of television a week, 52 weeks a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can only do it because I'm sitting on a rubber ball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what, Veronica, I can tell you this.  If we take a choice between you on 24 7 or Chris Perillo or even Leo,  I think you'd get the big numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's big science fiction.  It's big, as always.  I've been touched in a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  With Neal Stephenson, it's always about ideas.  Vec even says in the prologue, look at this is just a thinly veiled excuse  for giving you some of the most interesting ideas.  And that's where I was looking when I read it.  And I just I loved it. 32 hours on Audible.  It's a wow. It is a long read.  Yours free. Now, that's a deal.  A 32 hour book free.  By the way, it's multiple narrators, which is useful for this  because there are a lot of different people, a lot of different voices in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe I should do that for the flight tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, Veronica, I think so.  That get to get you right through your flight to Japan.  How long is that? 12 hours? 11.  You get it there and back and you still have some leftover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm on page almost I think I'm almost 400.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Yeah. You've gotten the meat of it now.  Yeah. Yeah. It's so good.  I want to read it. I already read it in paper.  I get back. I gave my copy to Patrick, but I but I want to download it  to listen to it again, because I just it's Neal's.  The couple of Neal's books blow me away.  Cryptonomicon, Snow Crash.  And this is, I think, in that category.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just brilliant. I know the Baroque cycle is pretty amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you like that, Patrick, and I couldn't get into it.  They now have it on Audible.  I might do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's worth it just to watch him characterize all these pivotal characters  right in science and actually the formation of banking.  And that's right. All together.  And the and the fundamental changes in religion during the road.  All right. It's fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You talked me into it because I trust you.  I remember when Quicksilver came out, you and I were both like first in line  to get it. I think we were flying somewhere.  Yeah. And that's my pick.  Go to Audible right now. Audible.com slash twit to get your Audible book.  Two of them. Absolutely free.  Look, it's a whole world of listening.

Transcript:  Well, I have an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  iPhone. Perfect.  Mine's full of Audible books. Audible.com slash twit to.  We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.  Now back to the news.  So Steve Jobs is not dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that ran the market up and down a couple of notches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What the hell's going on?  OK, is this the death of citizen journalism?  What's going on here?  So let me I'll give you the story real quick.  It was, I think, on Thursday,  some anonymous person uploaded to CNN's I report website,  a so-called first person report.  I just I'm at the Apple campus.  I just saw Steve Jobs hustled off in an ambulance.  He's had a massive heart attack.  No vetting, nothing.  It's up on CNN site.  The stock tanks, of course, and goes, I don't know how many.  It's three or four percent, right? A huge amount.  Before somebody at CNN thinks to call Apple and Katie Cotton,  Apple spokesperson says, no, he's sitting right there.  What are you talking about? He's fine.  It was completely bogus.  Now everybody and their brothers saying, see, we told you citizen  journalism sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know. It's just because it went through I report.  It's kind of different.  I mean, yeah, it was a citizen journalist reporting this to CNN,  but they really should have vetted it before they published.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's who's to blame here. CNN, you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I wrote an extensive column in last Friday's Market Watch  about this specific episode with the numbers and 10 percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apple lost 10 percent of value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we gained a 10 percent five minutes later.  I mean, it was the fastest move in 15 minutes.  I think that Apple's ever had SEC is investigating, though,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  because what a great way that you short Apple.  You put that rumor out.  Apple stock tumbles, you sell it and you're back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They'll never find the guy.  If the guy if this was a stock scam, I'm sure it went through proxies.  They'll never figure it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They say, in fact, same guy tried to place the same story of Mac rumors  and Mac rumors turned it down because he was using a proxy  because they couldn't identify him.  They had the good sense to say, we're not going to publish that.  What are you crazy?  Hmm.  It's what it really shows to me is that mainstream media,  when it attempts to be cool and hip, completely fumbles it.  They don't get it. They don't understand this.  I report thing is, you know, they get it and they understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They just don't apply anything that would logic,  remotely considered standards or responsibility throughout the standards  and practices book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what do you do, John? What's the fix for this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you have people that are reasonable and sharp technologists  that know how these things work.  And they would like the guys, like you said, the rumor site,  they look at the proxy, they say this thing's kind of phony,  you know, just to spend the you know, this happens all the time.  It's a stock scam thing, you know, pumps and dumps and all these other kinds of tricks.  And that's what you need. They obviously are just like sucking anything.  This is like these newspapers that, you know, they like the Washington Post  for did this for a while.  First, they let people do commenting, then people comment and they get really nasty.  And they said, oh, my writers don't like so they stop all the commenting.  Then they implement it again, but make you register.  And then they leave those things like they never moderate.  I mean, the guys who do blogging today, I think, have got more on the ball  than people running these newspapers and news organizations  when it comes to Internet related stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you know, yeah, I think Sena said journalism is a great thing.  I think it gives an opportunity to see a lot of stuff out there  that the major news organizations might not have a chance to cover or see.  You know, they have people or worse, maybe filtering, maybe maybe hiding.  True. But I think CNN at this point definitely had a responsibility  to check with their sources and to double check.  I mean, they have the ability to call Apple and find out the truth.  A lot of citizen journalists don't have that ability.  So they probably before they started reporting on that should have,  you know, taken that step.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or maybe they should just have a button that they put on it that says unconfirmed  or, you know, you know, just a warning.  Because, you know, the thing is, it's different if it's on a CNN site.  Then people take it with a little more certainty.  So CNN has a higher responsibility to vet it.  Very true. Just say unvetted.  This is unconfirmed. This is a rumor.  It went on dig.  I love this. Then our friends at 4chan, the Lulz kids,  decided to promote it as a prank.  They knew it was bogus, but they really promoted it.  This is the same place where Sarah Palin's email accounts,  contests and contents and password were posted.  4chan, I think 4chan increasingly.  You're hip and young, Veronica.  You must be in touch with this whole thing.  You love the LOL Katz.  Doing it for the Lulz.  You're doing it for the Lulz.  We mocked this when New York Times did a whole story on it  as if this is some sort of movement.  It's 4chan. It's a forum.  It's not a movement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's kind of a movement. I wouldn't deny that.  Is it a movement?  Anything? Anything movement is not a movement.  I mean, Anonymous is out there.  That's a movement. That came from 4chan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anonymous came from 4chan? Yeah.  I would definitely classify them as a movement of some kind.  It's not a movement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can't deny the power that they have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry. Power is power.  Movement is movement.  I mean, you know, it's like saying George Bush has got a lot of power.  He's not a movement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, he's not a movement.  There are. But I guess when I let me think how I could say this,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  how would I? Well, one person isn't a movement necessarily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No. How would I characterize this?  It's a movement if you've got a place where people gather  and in concert attempt to create, you know, pranks like this  or maybe not pranks.  I don't know if the anonymous movement, the anti Scientology movement,  would be considered a prank.  It might. I think it's probably a little more serious than that.  But this clearly the Sarah Palin thing, that's a prank  promoting the Apple story, even though they know it's not true.  That's a prank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A prank's not a movement. It's just a one shot gag.  Well, it's only OK. You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's not like it's not a one shot.  They're not doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, OK, got one guy who's a OK.  So you're telling me a comedian who does a lot of practical jokes.  I guess Kusher, what's his name?  Well, the punk guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What makes it what makes it a movement is an ideology behind it.  Right, John, would you say that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That would ask to Kutcher.  Ask the Kutcher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, he's not a movement and he's got an ideology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, what's interesting, John, is what makes something a social movement?  Right. And you forget not your poly sciat or your, you know, soft sciences hat.  It's a large grouping.  It's individuals working together to force political or social change.  Right. Yes.  There you go.  Trying to ferment.  You know, or foment political changes, foment another.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If they ferment it, it'll taste like aardvark urine.  Yeah, let's see about movement as the resident alcoholic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You'll excuse me.  Pardon me.  You're fighting the phone for the  I'd say resident recovering alcoholic.  That's right.  But I mean, I mean, it's like, you know, is is 4chan, you know, I mean,  are they trying to change order?  Are they trying to ferment?  You know, I mean, are they anarchists?  Are they, you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, an anarchist or a movement, right?  That's a movement.  I think there's a certain anarchic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Anarchists tend to be self-absorbed.  I can't say that word.  OK, but that's but that's your personal opinion.  Say it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nimrods. But that's but but but that is a movement in that sense.  And I think that that's probably a pretty good, accurate description  of what 4chan is kind of about.  They're basically they're they're the monkey.  They're the trickster. They're the they're the anarchists.  They're trying to foment

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  society's collapse, because they collapse, not collapse,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but they love messing with the mainstream, messing with the establishment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, OK, whatever their counterculture.  Yeah, OK, OK.  I'll give in on this if we can change the topic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's your dreadlock hat on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And by the way, that reminds me of Pat's earlier,  the Patrick's earlier comment about wearing that crazy hat  and getting pulled over time and time again.  Why don't you just stop wearing the hat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It actually it only happened a couple of times with that particular hat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You get pulled over because you were wearing a Rasta hat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I got pulled over all Rasta hat, baseball beanies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm going to make him wear the hat and the kilt on the show when I get back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Cut off leg of a BDU.  That was another very popular piece of head gear for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait a minute. What's that? What's a BDU?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  BDU battle dress uniform, basically combat fatigues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you would take the leg of it and you put it on your head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I made a pair of cut offs and turned one of the legs into a hat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This I got to see this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got to see that have cuffs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No ear flaps.  They they tie up at the end.  It's the part that goes down by your booth.  There's a little is there a picture?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is there an extant picture of you in your BDU hat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think so, but I will check.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One incredibly rambling twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the yeah, it got off to.  This is a great twit.  Now, let me wait.  Not with the premise that you had at the beginning, which was we've got  so much news to cover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got more news. You want more news? I got more news.  So I got you.  I got you. It was over.  Shows over.  Oh, I guess you're right. It's kind of over.  So Obama leads in election related spam.  The amount of spam that mentions Barack Obama beats out that of his arrival,  John McCain, by six to one in the month of September, according to Secure Computing.  Sarah Palin outranked Joe Biden by a ratio of six to one.  You want to get spammed.  You want to get spammed by Obama or Palin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, are they just spam by from them?  No, no, no, no, no.  These are spammers using the names Obama and Palin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Spam being a litmus test for our political atmosphere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know what it means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What it means as the subjects to lure people into opening the crappy, you know, Viagra ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Obama Viagra ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Huh. OK, that's a lousy story.  All right. I got another one. I got another one.  Windows XP gets a reprieve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Woohoo!

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Geez.  That's really, that's going to the bottom of the barrel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's not. This is this is huge news.  Can't you be happy for me, Veronica?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I said woohoo at the same time.  And then you went, what?  No, I didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You got to go. Oh, because we both did it at the same time.  Jinx, you owe me a Coke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought it was. I want you to get a room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We do. It's a Texilla set.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a Texilla set.  It's got it's got nice brick walls.  The option to buy a quote fact.  They call this a factory downgrade when you buy when you buy an XP on a machine nowadays.  They don't want to admit that you they really people prefer XP.  So they say, well, we've taken a machine and factory downgraded it from Vista.  So you weren't supposed to be able to do that after January 31st.  Microsoft was just going to stop giving Windows XP discs to people like Dell.  Now they say, oh, all right, demand is still there through to July 31st.  We'll do it.  PC makers will be able to sell the factory downgraded machines online  as well as in stores.  Microsoft's statement, as more customers make the move to Windows Vista,  this is worse than the campaign.  As more talk about spin, as more customers make the move to Windows Vista,  we want to make sure they're making that transition with confidence  and that it's as smooth as possible, providing downgrade media  for a few more months as part of that commitment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What? Well, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  180. Give the people what they want because they said they're not going to buy anything  if we don't give them what they've been asking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As part of the smooth transition to Vista,  we're going to make sure you could still use XP for a lot longer.  180 millions of copies of Vista have been sold,  which is far fewer than the number of PCs sold in the last two years.  What do you have? I haven't ever asked you guys.  Patrick, how do you feel about Vista?  Are you a Vista fan now? Have you come around?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Vista with SP1, Vista post SP1 is a lot more usable.  I still I still have issues.  Vista pre-installed on new machines is fine.  Vista post SP1 is a huge leap over the original Vista.  Service pack one just solved a lot of problems.  I'm still having issues with it on,  on, you know, like DIY machines where it's just unhappy  or doesn't want to do the service pack upgrade and stuff.  So 90 percent of the time at this point, yeah, I'm fine with Vista.  But I still run it on.  I still run XP on two of my machines at home right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I nowadays I look at XP and I go, that's kind of funky.  I don't really want to look at XP anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a little depressing to look at, but I use it for my gaming PC also.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't I don't find Vista that there's there's some elements in this  that I really like, but overall I don't find Vista  that compelling, nor do I find OS 10 that that visually compelling design.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they're looking old, aren't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know that either one of them is ever particularly brilliant to begin with.  What do you like then?  Man, I just maybe I'm just thinking that if they only could have taken the BOS  to the next step, I think my frustration with OS 10 is that Apple walked away  from you remember the member, the human interface manuals  where they where they kind of write everything consistent across all applications.  That was what made Mac. Yep.  And I you know, there's a lot of things I absolutely love about OS 10,  but inconsistency in the interfaces on applications is not one of them.  Yeah. And that was one of the things that, you know, after my long Mac hiatus  coming back with OS 10 and being like, it's a new operating system.  Wow. They threw it out a lot of what I thought was core to the,  you know, to the to the Apple operating system experience.  And this is just like this, you know, it's just a lot of stuff  in Vista that's shiny for the sake of being shiny.  And when you see what some when you see what some fairly progressive  interface hackers have been doing with like XP in the past.  And I'm with Vista now makes me think that maybe we just don't deserve  for maybe Microsoft or Apple aren't ready to give us a really serious leap  over the existing interfaces.  I don't know. It's it's it's, you know, I'm waiting for like an operating system  that feels as different as Windows 95 did from Windows 3, one or, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what you need, Patrick?  You need a quick shot of Windows 7.  Yes, the new windows.  You're going to love it. We call it Mojave.  Oh, no. No.  Microsoft's already kind of, you know, PDC is coming up and when next month,  actually this month now, it's October and Windows 7, they're going to.  In fact, they're giving everybody who goes to the PDC,  the developers conference, a 300 gig hard drive  with Windows 7 on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A beta of what I didn't know there was enough room on a 350 gig hard drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. I got to say, I'm with John on that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you didn't say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So well, you laugh, but you can't you can't install the whole you didn't  for for even the downgraded version of XP that's available on a lot of the  on a lot of the netbooks.  Yeah. He's trying to do an upgrade and everything goes to heck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which netbook do you use?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have sampled several of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, I'm still waiting for one to grab me by the throat  and say, I am the best iteration of this.  And they all they just they're all they're all a little  I've played around with I've played around with three of them so far,  and they all seem a little cheap and really, really slow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a it's a sacrifice you you make for the lightweight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I got to say that the cell processor based ones are, you know,  huge, the battery life improvement with the cell processor is phenomenal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are some netbooks with cell.  Is that Sony that's using doing that or who's doing that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I absolutely basis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. I would be interested to try that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or am I using the wrong term? Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sells the Sony processor that's in the PS3.  No, as you would know, Ms. Core.  What are you going to be for Halloween, Veronica?

Transcript:  Well, I mean, I'm starting to lose confidence in my own beliefs.  But, you know, I've had this happen before.  I still think McCain's going to win it.  But the fact of the matter is, if he doesn't win it, I think it'll be  actually kind of more interesting in so far as being a writer is concerned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, I think you're right.  It's either what you know what?  McCain becomes president. That would be interesting, too.  Yeah, actually, either one.  I don't know. One's going to be dramatic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm taking bets, but I don't really care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If.  What was I going to ask you?  I don't know the brain tonic kicked in.
