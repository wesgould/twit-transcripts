Transcript:  Hi everyone.  Welcome to This Week in Tech.  This is Alex Lindsay and I am sitting in obviously for Leo who is still out and enjoying some  part of the world.  And I'm joined here with Greg Farrow.  Hi Greg.  Hey, how are you doing?  I'm doing well.

Start time: 161.66
End time: 202.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  Yes.  So, but we've got lots of news and lots to talk about.  So we'll just jump right back into it.  Now this is something that is a little bit California centric, but it is affecting a  lot of places around the world.  One of the articles here from New York Times is why $4.5 billion from Big Tech won't end  the California housing crisis.  Now housing is becoming, in urban areas, is becoming almost unworkable.  What is the, I guess the real question here is, what can we do, Greg, about, what can  we do?  This is all up to you.  Yeah.  What can you do about the housing crisis from a tech perspective?

Start time: 202.28
End time: 249.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that these tech companies that talk about doing remote working should actually  just do that.  Why would you put houses here at all?  I think in any realistic world, Silicon Valley is an improbably bad place to do business.  It's prone to fires.  You've got structural challenges around electricity.  It's an earthquake zone.  And the cost of buying up land and the government resistance, like the bureaucratic process,  which can either be hijacked by people, by the community, or by the government themselves,  means that I don't think there's any answers here about what we're doing and what, you  know, like why would you do business here at all?  I'm a bit baffled by that at all.  I can't understand why you would even build another house here.  Why not just go somewhere else and set up an office in London or New York?  Here's the problem.

Start time: 249.52
End time: 303.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, here's the issue that a lot of folks will bring up in this situation is, number  one is for if you're not at a headquarters, a lot of times it's seen if you have a if  you want to move up in a corporation, it's hard to do that from a satellite office.  And so a lot of folks aspire to moving from, you know, get to the headquarter office because  that's where you're going to be running and running into the right people, quote unquote,  that are going to help kind of move you forward.  Also in the competition for programmers and staff and so on and so forth, there becomes  this issue of can you find people that want to live in Kansas?  You know, and I think that that argument is slowly sliding with this expense.  I think that the argument is starting to slide against there's a lot of people that would  love to move to Kansas because they're tired of spending so much and dealing with the traffic  and so on and so forth.

Start time: 303.76
End time: 311.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a couple of things there.  I think one is that attitude of you have to be in head office to get ahead is an old attitude.  It's not something that's true anymore.  There's certainly a lot of organizations for whom...

Start time: 312.56
End time: 318.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's pretty accepted at a lot of these...  It's not so much whether it's true or not.  It's whether people think it's true.  Exactly.

Start time: 319.26
End time: 326.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And increasingly what we're seeing is there's a turn away from that.  So if you're still working for a traditional organization with traditional managers, with  traditional approaches and little silences...

Start time: 326.60
End time: 333.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm talking about like, those are sensitivities at like information companies.  Yeah, yeah.  It's not like we're not talking about like a steel company.

Start time: 333.60
End time: 368.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Your household brands are still run like that, but increasingly that's no longer true.  I mean, one of the interesting things about this is that the challenge around the immigration  policy in the US has actually seen a substantial rise in remote working.  And this idea of we used to bring all of the people in from all around the world, from  India, from Europe, from Asia, and they would all come here and get visas and work here  for two years.  And as the immigration policies change, a lot of these companies have actually just  picked up all the divisions that used to be based here and sent them back to other countries.  So they're now basing them in those countries.  And if somebody from India needs to move to somewhere in Asia to get that team together,  that's what they're doing.

Start time: 368.76
End time: 371.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  What are your opinions on this?

Start time: 372.34
End time: 418.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I love working remotely.  Everyone that I work with, we all work from wherever.  I mean, basically I work just all around the world and constantly, but I think there is  nothing that can replace passing off a hard drive to somebody and knowing that that's  actually going to get there.  You're not going to have to wait for download speeds.  So I think being in the office is such a huge advantage like you were talking about because  you actually see the people, you meet with the people and you are face to face with them.  And me as someone who is so into tech and loves it so much, there is really nothing  different than just actually being with a person and having those conversations because  that's when a lot of things do happen when you can actually sit down and look at somebody.  Because even though we're doing this, it's virtual, it's great.  But I think sometimes you really do have to be in the room with somebody to really get  a feel for a person and to get the vibe.  So that's what you're losing.

Start time: 419.16
End time: 450.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I admit, I thought about this looking at this article.  Last week I was in the East Coast and I had a bunch of meetings and then they're just  discussions, just talking to folks.  But I did it in person.  And I went from Boston to New York to DC because there was a need to at least have that first  conversation in person with them while you're...  And a lot of times you're talking to a handful of people and it's just...  And I think part of the problem also is that some of our virtual conferencing as we talked  about before the show is it can be a little rocky.  And so there's...

Start time: 451.04
End time: 507.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't use those comments.  I agree with you.  There's certainly value in face-to-face time and there's a very powerful, high density,  information-rich conversation that happens when you're face-to-face, right?  And it can be very valuable and it's also very useful to establish a baseline relationship  between two people, a professional relationship that happens very quickly, if that makes sense.  The challenge after that is when you start getting people working in four or five time  zones, so our business runs and we have people in Australia, East and West Coast of the US,  we've got some in Europe, and a lot of us are moving around all the time.  And what we've now found is it's much easier to talk asynchronously once you get practiced  at it.  And this is the challenge.  If you spend all your life face-to-facing people and going eyeball-to-eyeball with a  high density conversation, you get comfortable with that mode of communication.  Does that make sense?  And if you go to remote working, then you have to change your habits.  You have to change...  The metaphor I've sometimes used for it...  Do you remember reading books and then you started reading from the screen?  Do you actually read a book now at all?

Start time: 508.68
End time: 520.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't before.  Yeah.  I've been listening to books since the late 80s.  It started on tapes and everything else.  The idea of sitting down and actually reading a book and monotasking is just horrible.

Start time: 520.80
End time: 523.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Justine, does the metaphor apply to you?  Do you still read books or do you do everything on e-books?

Start time: 524.92
End time: 535.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's all...  I listen to a lot of audiobooks as well.  It's just like I can be doing something else and also listening.  So driving or traveling, it's like I can be listening, I can be writing or doing something  else.

Start time: 535.96
End time: 542.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me ask you, how long did it take you of listening to audiobooks before you started  to absorb that correctly?  The first time you listen to an audiobook, you would have had struggled to listen.  Now I listen.

Start time: 543.64
End time: 549.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For me, it's mostly how long did it take me to get the 2X in my listening speed?  Oh yeah, that's a great point.  Yeah.

Start time: 550.08
End time: 589.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm more of like a...  I mean, I'm also a visual learner, but I feel like for me, I retain things much better just  listening to it.  So even if I'm trying to memorize something, I can't look at it.  I have to hear it.  So I think a lot of people...  Again, going back to this, a lot of people learn different.  So there's so many aspects of personalities that also kind of play into this.  Whereas I would work much better in a situation that I'm in now.  If you give me my tasks, I will go off by myself and get them done.  But some people can't work that way.  So I think it's kind of tailoring to the way that people learn and the way that people  work is one of the most important things I think that when it comes to hiring is like,  how does this person work best?  What can I do to help this person perform the best work possible?

Start time: 590.54
End time: 624.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do also think our current workspaces are very much targeted at extroverts.  They say something like 70 to 80% of the population is extroverts.  And they are people who thrive on face-to-face communications, thrive on a room full of people.  But the people who actually do get the job done is the introverts.  They're the people who'll go off and sit in a room quietly and just grind away at the  task and bring it back completed.  And remote work works very well for them.  And it's going to be a challenge for the extroverts to change their mode of this face-to-face,  drawing energy from a room, standing around a desk.  But I think that it's also, I mean, I think that one of the challenges that was brought

Start time: 625.56
End time: 659.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  up in the chat room is that our video conferencing software still stinks.  So you know, like, and you know, for me, you know, I taught, I was teaching classes in  Rwanda at a school that I built there.  And the, so we're teaching classes and I couldn't be down there and I got frustrated.  So I ended up building a bunch of hardware that makes that go away.  It makes it much, much smoother.  But that's still, you know, tens of thousands of dollars of hardware that all makes that  work.  You know, it's not something that you can just put into every office.  It's better than a classroom, but it's not the same.

Start time: 659.56
End time: 663.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're hitting on a real sore point, which is why is our conferencing software so abysmally  awful?

Start time: 664.76
End time: 665.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I can tell you.

Start time: 665.78
End time: 708.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can I tell you?  Go ahead.  I have an opinion here.  It's because we want to make it easy.  So like, the thing is, is that we want to make it cheap and easy.  Like that is this.  And this is the problem with content in general.  But it is like, let's make it easy for everybody to do it.  And the problem is, is that when you, as you drive down that ease of use, you limit, you  keep on limiting what you can actually get done.  And as you make it something that can just go everywhere, then it, you know, then it,  the problem you end up with is that now it can't do anything because it had to work on  every platform and it had to work on, you know, the reason mine worked was because it  was really hard.  You know, like it was really hard to make it, you know, and it was really.  But when you're actually using it, it's super easy.  But building it was expensive.  I'm having really good luck at the moment with Zoom.

Start time: 709.56
End time: 733.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We've left Skype behind years ago.  Webex is a crime against humanity.  Microsoft Teams is a load of something.  And we're finding Zoom not bad.  I wouldn't say it's good, but it's mostly stable and mostly works.  I think the biggest thing I found about Zoom is that it has this habit of defaulting to  the bad microphone and the bad video camera.  And a decent microphone is excellent, actually.

Start time: 734.28
End time: 750.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we built some overrides for Hangouts that made it much better.  Like basically there was there used to be an API for Hangouts.  And so we built it in where we could do what we call soft selecting, which let us basically  ignore certain people if we needed to.  Could you build us a camera lock for Zoom, please?

Start time: 750.68
End time: 763.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because the one thing I dislike about Zoom is there is it's automatic switching.  Yeah, it makes conversation very jittery.  Now this person is talking, now this person is talking, now this person is talking.

Start time: 763.42
End time: 782.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't remember what the official external name was, but there was a thing on pinning  or make sticky.  That's what we used to call it for Hangouts where you could just click on someone's screen  and it would at least hang on that for the broadcast.  It still did a free run, but a user could also just click on it and only see those things.

Start time: 784.00
End time: 795.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But again, your point is that Zoom is suitable for a small group of people, five to ten people  getting together works pretty well for that.  We use it for live streaming to YouTube a couple of times and it kind of works okay.

Start time: 796.26
End time: 800.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it still gets into that dumbed down to a point where it's compared to what it could  be.

Start time: 801.72
End time: 806.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think Zoom is even, I mean I really like it, but I would say it's even more dumbed  down than Skype.

Start time: 806.82
End time: 813.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's so funny, these things are dumbed down, but yet I'm a very tech savvy person.  I'll build you a computer, but I sometimes can't get Skype to work.

Start time: 814.92
End time: 820.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No sense at all.  That's not you, that's Skype.  Don't blame yourself, blame Microsoft.

Start time: 820.30
End time: 830.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Seriously, that's because you don't have, if something goes wrong, you don't have options  to fix it.  There are many problems we have with Skype that we used to be able to fix.

Start time: 830.32
End time: 831.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll send you guys a link.

Start time: 831.78
End time: 860.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then the problem you get into is the latency.  It's all this low latency, I mean the best solutions that we've seen have been private  solutions as you said, which are people building on top of WebRTC.  So people will build a custom solution for letting people do it within a company or for  broadcasters and they're sitting on top of WebRTC and that has been super successful  for a lot of them.  But that's not something that right now is a scalable, it's not what everybody's doing.

Start time: 860.20
End time: 875.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think there's a couple of other things too.  One of the things that we find is we get people come on our shows and they'll use the rubbish  camera that comes inside of their Dell, you know the five cent camera that came out of  the factory.  And then they'll yell at the screen and there's a microphone underneath the keyboard and expect  that to work correctly.  But they won't consider...

Start time: 876.26
End time: 883.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the eyesight camera on the iMac right now, I mean it's definitely not the best,  but as long as you have decent lighting you can still get...

Start time: 883.84
End time: 908.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is where I was just going to say straight after that is why are not people taking responsibility  for themselves and thinking I've got to have a space in my study which has got a background  that's pretty...  Like this is just a background behind me, right?  And there's some nice lights here.  You know my home studio, which you've seen a couple of times when I've been fortunate  to be on the show before, all I've got is a couple of lights that shine on my face.  Right.  And a bit of a backdrop there that doesn't look like I've just...  You know...

Start time: 909.14
End time: 948.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  We had a kit.  I don't know how we got into this from cities, but we'll keep it for you.  So anyway, but we had a...  We used to have a kit because we did about 1200 hangouts for Google and we had this kit  that we would send out that was just an IFB and it was an Ego light.  You know there's a...  Yeah, yeah, a little...  It was an Ego light with a Logitech C920 and a little tripod for it and a little tripod  for this and that was it.  And the thing is it was literally triple the quality of the person's look and it was just  like...  And we'd send it to them with a return address and a little video on how to put it together.  I agree.  This is what we're doing.

Start time: 948.34
End time: 975.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it just worked.  We're doing that.  I just did that.  I did some live...  Logitech C922.  Made them buy a decent $50 microphone.  And then taught them how to put the lights in front of their face instead of buying ads  and it was fine.  Crazy.  Crazy stuff.  They were not right over the top of their head.  But that's a learned experience.  People who work from home have to learn that and the people aren't used to thinking for  themselves.  They're used to going into an office where that's done for them.

Start time: 975.72
End time: 1003.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And usually not done for them very well.  The IT team is usually the ones managing that and I mean no offense to the IT teams but  they're not camera people and so it's kind of a goofy little problem.  Justine, I got a question for you.  So is there a way...  Apple and all these folks are spending billions of dollars on cities.  What could they be doing with that money that would actually make a difference as opposed  to just building more of the same?  Do you have any thoughts there?

Start time: 1003.92
End time: 1053.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For me, just even in my neighborhood, I've moved to LA in 2007 and just seeing the changes  in the homeless population just increase where I'm afraid to even walk my dog now in my own  neighborhood.  It's hard because I'm completely sympathetic for this because I know these people are in  terrible places to be in this situation.  But it's like how do I feel safe in my own town?  I think a lot of it unfortunately comes down to mental health.  So it's like how is that something that needs to be taken to a place?  And a lot of these people don't want to go to the shelters because they are not able  to either...  They have to be clean or they're unsafe so they can't take their families there.  I don't have an answer but I just wish that there was something that we could do to just  further that because they do need help but there's not really a place for them to go.

Start time: 1053.40
End time: 1083.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If only tech companies paid taxes, we'd have mental health.  So I agree with you Justine.  I think the other thing that's happening here is this 4.5 billion they're giving is not  a gift.  They're trying to make it into a virtual signal and say like...  But what they're actually doing is investing it in a fund and they're trying to make money  out of it.  So they're not actually giving it or anything.  All they're doing is putting 4.5 billion dollars into an investment fund that will build properties  that they will take profits from in a few years time.  So it's not even a gift.  It's not even helping.  It's making it worse, right?

Start time: 1083.94
End time: 1107.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, like Google, I think I'm not sure 100% of...  But this is what I've heard like as far as like in Playa Vista, they've bought up a bunch  of properties there.  So it's like the housing market in Playa Vista and Los Angeles has just quadrupled over the  past year because Google put their offices in and now they own a bunch of those properties.  So even that for just people who were looking at buying just a home for their families,  it's unattainable at this point.

Start time: 1107.50
End time: 1159.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I think that there is...  I'm not clear that the current cities can be fixed.  We talked about this on MacBreak the last week.  I think that there is a argument that it's not changing the cities.  It's not that these cities will go away.  San Francisco is not going to go anywhere.  LA is not going to go anywhere.  But I think that if we think about reorganizing for the population growth that we have, the  projected population growth that we're probably going to have, continuing to grow cities the  way that they're being grown, where they're largely subservient to cars, where they're  largely single family houses or all that silliness, that's not sustainable and it's not scalable.  And I think that there's...  And I think that a lot of the tech companies are thinking about this.  I think that this is...  We're starting to see this.  I'm wondering when a company like Amazon decides to do City as a Service.

Start time: 1160.52
End time: 1167.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well the challenge here is that I see this as $4.5 billion that they should have paid  in taxes and then the government would have it and then it would be able to say...

Transcript:  No, what they were actually doing in the original plans for this particular estate, one of the  ones that's got $2 billion worth of funding, 50% of it was designated as low cost housing  and the developer would have to give it away at the low cost.  But they could make it up in the other part, right?  But now that the big companies are throwing in $4.5 billion, they're going to get the  planning rights to it.  They'll change it all to high end housing and there'll be nothing left at the low end.  And that's the problem.  Because the government doesn't have a profit motive, it was going to be able to do it for  the good of everybody.  This investment, which must produce a return to Apple and Google and whoever's putting  the money into it, must be high end housing and it's going to displace people and it's  going to make the problem worse.

The plans that Google has for San Jose, the housing that Facebook is building, I don't  know, Apple hasn't shared their plans for what they want to do, but they're trying to  at least build housing near where they are.  And I think that-  So that people in suburbs don't have to deal with, then their housing does not get taken  over by Google.

The reason it's going to go down is because these companies are going to figure out-  So here's my favorite question-  But here's what these companies are going to do.  They're going to figure out how to move to Kansas, and they're going to build big, they're  going to buy hundreds or thousands of acres, and they're going to build it-  Now you're talking about a science fiction dystopian.

It is a function of lowering their overall cost because the premium that they pay to  bring people into the state at this point is so high that it would be much better for  them to be able to have a lot more.

I mean, just even now, it's like even my parents, you know, they hadn't used their insurance  for years and now that they finally have to use it, they switched off the old insurance.  It's like such an incredible hassle.  And it's just really unfortunate that that's what we are in right now.  But will the tech solve that?  Maybe we need just better conferencing and then everything will be solved.

But my uncle invented some medical stuff that did pretty well.  And I was talking to him.  This is when the first single payer conversation was happening in the 90s.  And I asked him, like, what is the...  How would you fix the health care system?  And he goes, oh, we just have to realize his opinion was and he builds tools that keep  people alive, that people die.  And he goes, the problem we're going to get into.  And he just predicted this 20 years ahead is that he said, you're going to spend all  of your insurance money in the last six weeks or the last six months of your life.  Everything you put into the system is going to get used up at the end, which means that  doesn't the insurance process doesn't really work because you're just going to burn it  all up.  And so he says, at some point, we're going to have to start making really hard decisions  because our technology, he was a technology company, technology is going to get to a point  where we can keep a lot alive forever.  And we don't want to make that decision.  We don't want to be the one that is a US and that is a United States problem.

The answer is a community health care system.  I think Pete Budakic gets it completely right where he says Medicare for those who wants  it.  I think that I think that makes a lot of sense.  That makes sense.  So that is if you want health care and you can't find it anywhere else, there's a Medicare  system.  And if you don't want it, that's okay.

I mean, don't they have just regular delivery systems?  Like, do they have to have the drones?  I also think a lot of it has to do with expense.  Yeah, that's I guess that's a good point, too.  But this was specifically talking about UPS and CVS partnering together.  And I thought it was very interesting having a drone delivering your drugs.  But I also feel like you could just catch that drone very easily.  And I feel like if there's people out there that are trying to get these drugs that are  flying around in the sky, they're going to figure it out.  So I don't know.

I guess they decided it's a little box.  It's not very heavy and it probably won't hurt anybody if it hits him in the head.  But I but that was kind of my like, I don't know how to do it.  I can do it.  The doorstep like where you can't really land it.  I mean, I understand that you can't really.  You don't want to be trying to land the drone because that's really where the 20 feet,  as you said, you could get a hold of the drone.  I mean, the question is, is it worth it?  Is it worth trying to steal something from a drone that you don't know what's in it?  I think, you know, that's like you don't know whether that that box is worth it,  you know, to get to go to jail packages all the time.

There's part of me that wants to do it.  My wife has told me I'm not allowed to, you know, she's but but I really want to do  when we put cameras in it and we and we do something where we, you know, like  and people like somebody did it once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wasn't really a couple of them were done for just to do.  Yeah, anyway, I think the interesting part about the drone delivery thing here is that  it's an interesting test of an idea.  And it comes back to this idea of trialing out the idea to see what works.  Can you drop a parcel?  I just wish these companies would go and do it without trying to make a media circus  out of it and lean us in a direction of something that's pointless like for this.  But what I did see the other day was a hospital that straddled two sides of a motorway  and they were sending the pathology samples from one side to the other using a drone.  So literally a pretty good possibly go wrong.  Well, this is the point is, is this is actually working for them because for them to drive  between the two took 45 minutes, but it takes five minutes for a drone because they don't

When I see a drone flying, even though I know that they probably can't see me, I still get  a little like, OK, there's a drone.  Like, what is this? So like, I just don't understand, like, who's going to say that this  is OK and it's not OK.  Like, how am I going to know that's a good drone and not just me out?

Transcript:  The FAA stuff's worked out.  The medical stuff is as long as the pathologist is willing to sign off on it.  So having the chain of medical custody and if you can put it, there's not much difference  between a drone and a car.  And if you can keep your sample, if you can cut the transport time between taking the  sample and getting it to the pathology lab from they were talking about an hour, because  by the time they took the sample, got it downstairs, put it in a car, person drove the car out  of the pathology around the car park onto the motorway, across the other side and, you  know, went and apparently the drone's doing it in five to 10 minutes.

You know, they're working with it, but I think they're doing a couple of different things  there and they they were difficult.  Like we brought I brought a drone to Rwanda.  It's been a lot of time in customs.  And so, you know, they weren't so excited about it, but now they're starting to get  it figured out.  Africa is a good example of a place where it really works because the roadways at night  are dangerous, not because of crime, but because of just drivers.  You know, trucks drive down the middle of the road oftentimes.  There's no street lights.  And so the the so getting from one rural area to another becomes something that becomes  much more useful.

Start time: 2022.64
End time: 2038.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, there's so much more and it's so much easier too, because there's nothing else in  the air in the airspace.  And again, it just comes down to the chain of custody because they have to monitor the  temperature of the parcel in flight to make sure the blood doesn't exceed a certain temperature.  But that's all solvable.  That's not something we can't easily solve.

Start time: 2039.51
End time: 2045.52

End time: 2073.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It won't in Europe because everybody lives in highly, highly packed, dense housing and  there's nowhere for them to land or to drop.  Like my house opens onto the street and my back garden is basically the size of this  table and your drone delivery, unless it can land in my back garden exactly and very, very  precisely, that's not going to work.  So it may work in a limited number of circumstances.  This is what I'm saying.  Most of this is pointless because it's only going to work for a certain small number of  use cases.

Start time: 2073.70
End time: 2084.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

So I mean, I would have a whole fleet of drones over my house just dropping every 24 seconds.  So I mean, especially like the airspace, like in Los Angeles, I mean, it would just be so  incredibly crowded and then you're going to have to worry about like noise.  What happens if the drone crashes?  So I don't think it's entirely ready for that.  But in remote areas and things like that, I think it's incredible.  But it's you're also going to have to deal with like flight times.  But it's not going to work for sparsely populated.

You know, I have to go to my iPhone and look and see, OK, they've delivered it somewhere.  Now I've got to go around the house to find it.  What?

Transcript:  I said it's in the bushes.  I found packages there quite often or in my neighbor's house.  I was like, like, you'll send a photo proof of where it is.  I'm like, OK, well, now I got to go dig over here for it.  But it is really cool that they do at least do that.  So it's you've got that proof of delivery.

Start time: 2269.86
End time: 2280.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think there have been some where they take the picture and then they take the  package. You know, they've had some issues with, you know, like they, you know, they  not very many isolated issues that made it onto social media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm fine with the package being wherever it's going to be, as long as you decide where  that is. You know, and like it doesn't, you know, I feel like I should put signs up that  just have little Amazon arrows like go here.  But then I'm afraid then people would come and take my packages.  So it's a very complicated situation here with delivery.  Now, Google had, you know, they came out with Cardboard a couple of years ago, which  I think is brilliant. I'll just say it right out.  Cardboard, I think, was a brilliant idea.  And but it didn't work.  It's like, well, it didn't work that.  And being Google, they've decided to Daydream BR obviously got dropped.  And what happened?  What happened with this? Did you use?  Justine, did you use Cardboard much?

Start time: 2339.40
End time: 2383.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I thought Cardboard was cool.  I'm actually working on a series of three videos right now that are one eighty videos  and we're shooting them stereoscopically.  So there'll be three days. So if you have a headset, you can watch it.  But you can also view it on YouTube.  And one of the interesting things with Google, too, is they found that a lot of people  were watching YouTube videos with a headset, just regular YouTube videos.  So I feel like creating one eighty content, I think, is something that I'm looking more  into doing in the next year, just because you kind of do have that interactive  experience. But with VR and 360, I personally get motion sickness.  I want to kind of sit and watch content, not like me looking around.  And it's so difficult to even start creating 360 content that's engaging and doesn't  make people sick. So as far as cardboard and one eighty content, like I'm definitely  super excited about it.

Transcript:  We use one of the Z cams.  And then I also just for myself personally, I use like the Insta360 cameras a lot just  for little like easy things for social.  But now I'm pretty excited about it because it looks really good and it's just sort  of a fun kind of thing.  But I'm not a big fan of VR right now.  Like it's just I feel like it's still too early.  Like the headsets are heavy and big.  But with like the Oculus Quest and the Oculus Go, like that's on the way to what we  need. We need that standalone stuff without having cords connecting to computers and  things like that. So I'm excited about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that the challenge with the small going smaller is that we're moving by moving  away from the computer, we end up with less power.  You know, and so one of the things that is problematic, I'm working on some VR stuff  that is has a lot of polygons.  And and and so, I mean, I just did that.  I have to decimate and decimate is getting rid of the polygons.  The first pass at part of the project I'm working on right now is three hundred and  forty three million polygons.  And I was like, it's not going to work in a headset.  So so we're going to figure it all out and get it down to, you know, something more  manageable. But the problem that I run into is that I want to build it.  There's part of me that just wants to build it for Oculus, the full headset so that I  can keep my polygon count, my texture resolutions up much higher than what I want to  put on a quest. You know, I think that the thing that I found really interesting about  about the cardboard was less of a long experience and more of a casual experience.  And I think that their expeditions was a great way to to kind of deal with that, which  is a minute. Expeditions was kind of like you're in a classroom.  You're we're going to talk about some certain location and then we're going to throw  you're going to throw you into it for a minute.  You know, like not not for a long time, but it's something that's casual that you can  kind of put up and look at.  And I always thought that that there's there are there were a lot of use cases for that  process, which I'm glad that what they what they've done here, by the way, is that  they're open source in it. So they're going to make these API, you know, make it  available so that it's easy for you to still for developers to keep on developing  these processes and building these out.  Now, there's a lot of this is I think that they're mostly just not leaving people who  have already done development out in the cold, which is good because Google is not  always great at that. You know, like it's the problem that Google has is it's hard to  get as you start to quit things, you know, because they're not working.

Start time: 2529.20
End time: 2608.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think Google's problem is it's building up a reputation for being a quitter  and a failure. The more things that they build and fail at, they get their reputation  suffers and they don't seem to care so much because, you know, 90 percent of the revenue  comes out of displaying ads. So that's one thing I think at this particular point in  time, my whole sense of VR is that it's got failure written all over it.  And I suspect the real signal for me is that we've seen so many VR companies go under  and Oculus really hasn't come back, reached any of the promise.  But more importantly is that Apple's moved completely away from VR and they're going to  this augmented reality. We've got some we've got some topics we might get to later on  about AR and whether you can have an interesting debate around things like the new  Apple AirPods Pro as augmented reality because they're modifying the sound that you  hear around you and the Apple Watch is sort of a version of augmented reality rather than  a visual thing. So I think one of the challenges that people are failing to understand is  that VR, virtual reality, is only visual at this point in time.  But there's so many other there's five senses that nobody seems to be thinking about the  rest of those. And there's a key technology inflection that has to happen for VR to  work. CPU graphics processing power, battery reduction, localised power, power  consumption, that sort of stuff. And there's no signs that that is on the horizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and I think that actually, you know, one of my problems with Oculus  in general was my glasses. And I felt like, you know, Samsung figured out that if you  just put like a little wheel at the top, take my glasses off, I can throw a gear on  and I can sit there and scroll it and get everything into focus. Right. But I can't,  you know, I couldn't do that with Oculus and I didn't want to go buy extra lenses.  I didn't want to do anything else. I just wanted to have my little wheel. And without  that little wheel, I was left with this having to put my glasses under my glasses, get  pushed at a certain angle. So there's this whole process. You put the glasses on and  now you have to figure out how to turn, you know, you have to move them inside the  Oculus to get to get them to work. This is what I mean. The technology is just so immature.  But the worst part was, I was like, how many people are how many people in the  computer business wear glasses?  Most of us. Sony figured that out. At least 50%. Sony figured that out by by

Transcript:  I'm really I'm really not interested in a visual reality, a visual virtual reality.  I want to see an audio virtual reality. I want to see something that's tactile. I want to  see something that's much more immersive. I don't want something that just lets me  watch TV because I don't watch TV.

Start time: 2715.34
End time: 2735.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think that fundamentally one of the problems that we get into is that is that  the people who develop this stuff only know that one area. So they're VR  specialists or they're audio specialists or they're video specialists. And so they  think about each one of these things as a silo as opposed to I want to learn and I  want a little bit of all of it. I mean, Justine, do you see that as a as a as a  limiter for that process?

Start time: 2735.66

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No. Well, it's interesting because I just got a set of Razer headphones. So they  actually have haptic feedback and they have a chair as well that also has haptic  feedback. So, you know, when you have this connected to your PC or these headphones  specifically work with Xbox One, you feel like the vibration and then you can feel  like if you're playing a first person shooter, if you're like shot in a specific  location, like you can actually feel that. So I think that is sort of taking that next  step into 4D. But again, you know, I loved the vibe because the quality of it was  great. But again, you had to be connected to a computer. So that's why having the  Quest and the Go like that kind of stuff for me, like I want to be able to take it  with me when I'm traveling and just sort of have that, you know, something that is  easy to use again. I think that's the barrier to entry for a lot of people.

Start time: 2780.18
End time: 2852.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And I think that the ease of use is a real problem because it is always like a  setup. And even when I get my son has a birthday party coming up and he's, you  know, he's going to have Oculus running. And I always think of it like, oh, this is  a setup now. Like I got to make sure that everything's working and it's not, you  know, and when it was always just if I left the computer only running Oculus, I had a  computer for a while, it was just dedicated to Oculus because we were doing a lot of  development for it. And I and so it was easy because then you just throw it on.  It works. But if my PC is doing it, I mean, it's a PC. So if it's doing anything  else, you know, I'm going to I'm going to have to figure out why it's now no longer  what what update VR is. The biggest problem I had is that I didn't have a strong  opinion about PCs. I mean, I did. But I have a lot of development.  I have Linux machines and I have PC machines and I have lots of other things that I'm  using them for different things. I have a PC that I'm doing a lot of photogrammetry  on because my Mac isn't powerful enough to do it.  I mean, fundamentally, you know, and so so I spend a lot of time there.  But with Oculus, it was like this constant issue of every time there was an update, it  no longer worked. It was like, oh, my God.  This is what I mean. Of course, now we got this with Apple with the last update to the  US. I haven't even put Catalina on because I'm just kind of like, I don't know what  will break yet. I'm just going to give them like six months to figure that out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I just put it on my other machines, but not my main one, because I'm also  worried, like, is it not going to connect to the server? But I mean, the augmented  reality, I think, is is still my favorite.  Like, I know when Microsoft was working on HoloLens, like I thought that was going to  be incredible. And I just I love still being in my world.  But yet, you know, having it, I mean, obviously augmented, but just having sort of  not taken out of that, I think is really great.  So I'm excited to see all the future stuff that Apple is coming out with.  And I mean, I know that there's always been rumors of Apple headsets.  So I feel like when Apple finally does take the plunge and do that or announce it or  release it, then obviously that's again what it will become.  I think the important thing is common for the masses.  Yeah, I think the important thing is...

It was fluid.  It didn't have the frame rate issues.  As a special effects person, it had a little bit of aliasing, but in general, it was very  good.  And I was like, this is really the future, but it's one app.  And it was done.  I think that a lot of people haven't figured out a way to do that again.  And I'm sure there's a bunch of VR people that are now upset.

Transcript:  Hello. Just let me interrupt for a second.  I want to talk a little bit about ZipRecruiter.  I am an expert.  We use it at Twit.  We hired one of our most recent interns.  We've hired a number of people through ZipRecruiter.  Hiring is a hard thing to do.  I... You know, you're down a person or you need a person.  You're going to get...  You're afraid you're going to get a lot of phone calls and you're...  A lot of mail in your inbox and all that stuff.  I know. I know.  Pushing that button on posting a job is always...  There's always a little trepidation involved.  Not with ZipRecruiter.  First of all, when you post once, just once to ZipRecruiter,  that post goes to more than 100 job boards  plus social networks like Twitter and Facebook.  It goes to everywhere.  You're reaching out to the most possible candidates.  Now, don't let that scare you because they don't call you.  They don't email you.  Every applicant goes right into the ZipRecruiter interface.  They format it, make it easy to read.  They'll look the same so you can scan them quickly.  They have screening questions.  Yes, no, true, false, even essay questions.  So you can eliminate candidates that don't work very quickly.  They also rank the incoming applicants.  So you're never going to miss the best possible candidates.  So don't worry about getting a lot of applications.  That's the whole point.  You want to comb through all of the possibilities  to get that perfect person.  It's so important.  They do one other thing that I think is really important.  Actually, maybe you saw the TV ad.  Normally, hiring takes a long time.  And that's not good.  You need to hire somebody often.  The TV ad had that guy from Cafe Alturo.  Altura?  Yeah, he's the COO, Dylan Miskiewicz.  He needed a director of coffee.  He had been advertising the job for some time on other boards  but was having trouble finding qualified applicants.  He switched over to ZipRecruiter,  and that's when the magic begins.  ZipRecruiter doesn't just depend on candidates finding you.  It actually finds candidates for you.  Its technology identifies people with the right experience  that invites them to apply to your job.  So that means you get qualified candidates,  and you get them fast.  Our experience has been really fast.  Dylan posted his job on ZipRecruiter.  He was impressed, he said, how quickly  he had great candidate supply.  He used that candidate rating feature  that brings the top ones to the best ones to the top.  He was able to focus on the ones that matched his real tight  criteria.  And you know what?  Dylan found his new director of coffee in just a few days.  Yeah, sorry, he's hired him.  I wanted to apply myself.  With results like that, it's no wonder four out  of five employers who post on ZipRecruiter  get a quality candidate within the first day.  We did within the first hour.  It was mind boggling.  See why ZipRecruiter is effective for businesses  of all sizes.  Try it free right now.  ZipRecruiter.com slash twit.  ZipRecruiter.com slash twit.  ZipRecruiter is Zip, I know I'm saying it fast.

Transcript:  And so now we're shifting gears just a little bit.  We have a report that the FBI now is tracking our faces.  And the ACLU is understandably a little concerned.  And so really, this is looking at the overall process  of the FBI and probably many other.  They're focused on the FBI right now.  But it is really looking at where does this end?  Where is it going?  What are they using it for us now?  Most of this has not been very transparent.  So I guess the question for you is,  how do we weigh liberty versus security?

Start time: 3347.18
End time: 3432.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the challenge here is, do we trust our institutions?  So at the end of the day, we have to believe  that the Secret Services have our best interests at heart.  And we have historically entrusted,  and in the UK we have the same problem with GCHQ  and the government doing the same thing.  There's so many cameras in London.  And in the high streets, it's just like they're just ubiquitous everywhere.  The question is, if we give the government the ability  to draw that data together like Facebook does.  The thing that Facebook does wrong, or the thing that Facebook does  that is creepy and non-intuitive is that because it has so much data,  it can find things that nobody else can.  It's got so much power because of that.  If we allow governments to do this, the potential for misuse  or the ability of governments or whoever is currently in politics  to use this to say, if I look at these faces,  I can say that that person is in that place  and therefore they belong to this voter group so I can target them.  Or I can set up a gerrymander on the basis of it.  The question here isn't whether the FBI is tracking our faces.  The question is, do we trust our institutions?  And I think the fact that we don't trust them  indicates that society doesn't trust our Secret Services  to work in our best interests.  So whether they're tracking our faces or our emails  or capturing all the data on the transatlantic cables,  it doesn't really matter what the actual process is.  The issue here is do we trust our governments to work in our best interest?

Start time: 3433.20
End time: 3540.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think that the hard part is that you're weighing the process of...  As someone who works all over the world,  the comfort that we live in here is unique.  You know, like in some Western countries and so on and so forth,  but generally Western countries that have a lot of intelligence.  We get to live without big walls, we don't have glass across those walls,  we don't have full-time security at everybody's house.  And I work in places where that's the norm.  Yep.  I've worked in places like Papua New Guinea and Fiji and Kenya.  Africa and India and other places like Brazil.  We live inside compounds, yep.  And so everyone lives in compounds because you don't have that security.  And so we have that security.  What our countries, as an aggregate,  these Western countries that spend a lot of money on intelligence,  a lot of that is happening invisibly for us.  And we just have to be clear that when we stop doing that,  there's a cost on the other end of security.  That metadata collection...  I'm very concerned about giving up security, for instance, on a phone.  I think that a lot of these viruses right now,  the one of cries and so on and so forth,  those are... it's our code that we couldn't keep secret.  So the concern I have is less of distrust for the organizations  and more of their ability to control the data that they have  is more of the issue because I think that there are a lot of good people  doing a lot of things that we don't want to think about or know about  that has our country.  And we have to understand, it's easy for us to say we want to have...  It's easy for us to say we want to be...  We don't want to have surveillance,  but we don't even know what that surveillance is doing.

Transcript:  So you're making a trade-off there between social safety,  so that is in general society, we have an issue where we trust our neighbour,  we trust the people in our community around us,  we don't have to worry about that.  But in the countries that you and I have been to,  you and Moffat are more with me,  those social trusts or those social boundaries are different  and therefore you have to enact physical defences.  So that's different from government.  I don't think you can make a draw or a line between high-level secret services  tracking the entire population to what's happening socially  in a small group of people,  but I do agree that there's no trust in certain countries  and that's what you end up with.  If you don't trust the society that you live in,  if you don't trust each other,  you end up with compounds living behind walls with security guards  and that sort of stuff.

I mean, there's just, I feel like the whole privacy issue,  like any time you post anything online  and especially the amount of content that I have posted,  it's, I'm voluntarily giving this information out  and I think, you know, as I've been doing this longer and longer,  I've been posting less and less,  but just the whole deep fakes thing,  there's enough photos and audio clips of me  that anyone can make me say or do whatever I want.  So that for me is kind of concerning.  I think the FBI obviously is, they have way more power  than I think that we would ever imagine.  And I think if anybody wants to do something,  like they're going to figure out a way to do it no matter what,  whether you're in the FBI,  whether you work for a phone company  and you're able to access someone's records  and then take their phone number  and then be able to change all of their passwords.  So there are so many things that I think that a lot of people  don't even realize that they're giving up on a daily basis  from going into the grocery stores to shopping,  all of those cameras, everyone is tracking you somehow.  And what's interesting with a lot of the stores now  is they are tracking you as a person,  your age, race, gender, your shopping habits,  where you go in the supermarket, what you end up purchasing.  And no one ever thinks twice about that.  And like, is there a way that, you know,  we can say that we don't want to do that?  I mean, how do you opt out of something like that?

Transcript:  Well, I have to admit that I used to be very, you know,  there was one time in Colorado that they started,  they rolled out and taking your thumbprint  when you got your driver's license.  And I was so angry about that  that I actually burned my thumbprints off  before I went in to flatten them.  And I was like, I'm not giving them my thumbprint.  And I bought everything in cash and I was very, you know,  if I had a tin foil hat, I would have worn it.  You know, I was like,  they're not gonna get any of my information.  And after doing as much work as I have  in a variety of different locations, I just gave up.  The key is just to live a boring life  and not do anything weird.  Cause it's just, you know,  there's all this tracking, you know, that happens.  And it's so, you know, what I'll say is, I guess,  I am concerned about, you know,  and I'm mostly concerned because we're seeing  where that can really go wrong in China, in my opinion,  where they're using it as the social credit  and they're paying attention  to an enormous amount of things about people  and actually controlling their lives with it.  And so I think that we get into the situation  where we can say, it's easy for us to say that,  oh, our government would never do that, but do we know?

Start time: 3741.48
End time: 3759.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The flip side of that is to a lesser or greater extent,  we actually have it here.  It's called a credit score.  And you're actually in the Western world,  your credit score defines what you can and can't do.  You're restricted as to how much you can buy,  you know, what sort of car loan you can get,  that type of stuff.  So there's aspects of that in our life.  It's just different.  So sometimes try not to-  And rudimentary.

Start time: 3759.92
End time: 3765.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's very rudimentary compared to, you know,  compared to where we're going and what we're doing.  Well, it's also what they say,

Start time: 3765.44
End time: 3816.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the story that we hear through the media is very much,  I just wanna be concerned here  that the reality on the ground that the day to day  of what the Chinese government's doing for monitoring  is about the same as what a credit score is in this country.  So it's not quite-  More aggressive, I think.  But the point I'll go back to is,  everything that you've said is, at the end of the day,  you have to have trust in your institutions.  And this is where Google and Facebook and Amazon  are making a mistake, is we are losing our ability  to trust them to act in the best interest of us as people.  When they go sharing that data,  when they go giving away that information  or being creepily stalking us around the place,  what they're actually doing is creating a breach of trust  between you and I and breaching the trust contract  that we have.  We have to be able to trust them.  And when they continually breach that contract,  we actually end up in a situation  where society begins to break down.  And that's the problem with Facebook and Google  is we can't trust them.

Start time: 3817.80
End time: 3830.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why?  That knowing that you can't trust them  also sets a precedent as well.  So it's like, maybe I won't share as much information,  but at some point, you just kind of realize  that this is what it is.  And I think something-  That's my point is, but the answer is,

Start time: 3830.92
End time: 3863.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  if you go into the situation not trusting him,  it's like when you go to buy a used car  from a guy on the corner of the road,  and he's going, oh, mate, runs brilliant.  You definitely want to get in this.  Engine's great, just got the tires.  But your hackles are up,  and you know that this guy's probably gonna try  and foist a lemon onto you.  And you're in a situation  where it's a hostile business transaction.  But when you go to the supermarket  to buy milk for your children,  you've got to be able to trust that the milk is clean  and safe, that it's been through the cold chain,  all the way through,  so that milk that comes out is healthy and fit to eat.  There's a completely different level of trust about it.

So now they're gonna be starting to get Facebook ads  for that specific type of thing.  I don't care what anybody says.  There is 100%, someone is listening somewhere  because I will talk about something,  me and a bunch of my friends,  and I will get an ad for that thing.  And it is the most obscure things.  We will even test this out  and start talking about the most insane things  that you will think in the next day.  There's an ad for something related to that.

Transcript:  But the point is that it comes back.  If you- But beyond that-  With secret services, whether it's GCHQ or MI5 or MI6  in the UK or any of the Five Eyes countries,  we have to, my problem is that I need to trust them.  I can't stop them from collecting secret information  and building up databases.  In fact, I want them to for terrorists.  The question is, do you trust them or not?  And that's the problem.

Start time: 3928.34
End time: 4010.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And again, I think my problem is less about  do I trust them to gather the information  and to even use it in our best interest.  My concern is their ability to control it.  Yeah.  And because they can't, we can argue that the-  And for me, the fundamental trust that is broken there,  as my kids would refer to, the circle of trust,  that is broken there is that we lost what we could consider  some of the most important between Snowden  and the information that was lost,  a lot of our worms and so on and so forth  are getting lost.  That's some of the most important information  that that agency has and they lost it.  They can't even control that data  and our data doesn't matter to them  nearly as much as that data.  So when you have important data  that you can't keep control of,  what worries me is that-  The second part of what Snowden talked about  is the abuse of that data, right?  Exactly.  That data's out there and you have individuals  who are unaccountable that are just wandering around  and looking at people in the same way that-  And the problem is that that,  it's less about the agencies for me  and more about individual control  and I think that that's where they have to prove it.  I think that there's parts of the ACLU thing  that I think are a little bit hyperbole  but I think that also that we probably do need to talk  a little bit about how it's being used.

The privacy is something that would be nice  if we still had but every breach,  every breach of the NSA, every breach of Equifax,  every breach of Target has taught us  that all of our data is up for grabs at all times.

Transcript:  Well and then some of the other valid issues  that are coming up is that the facial tracking  is much more, for a variety of reasons,  is much more accurate on lighter skin than darker skin.  So if you have darker skin,  it has a lot harder time being accurate.  And so that's the-  That's the algorithms.  What?

Start time: 4087.30
End time: 4093.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  Hopefully.  Yeah.  So the Apple on the other end  has revamped their privacy site headlines,  everyday apps designed for your privacy.  Justine, is this a winning formula for Apple?

Start time: 4148.82
End time: 4188.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean I think for me too,  using different email addresses for things  is always a high priority.  So for using the sign in with Apple,  I'm really excited for people to start implementing that  because you'll know exactly where a breach  or something has happened.  But they did, I'm not sure if you guys saw the video  that they played, it was like the new commercial  about the privacy.  But it was really, I mean I thought it was kind of  a touching video, just showed how much of your information  really is out there.  And I think when you stop and think how much stuff  is on your phone, it's shocking.  So I think for Apple to kind of step up  and sort of make this move and show how important this is  and really make an entire commercial  and video dedicated to it,  I think it's a pretty bold move.

Start time: 4191.26
End time: 4256.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I sense that this feels like a very slow move.  It's a very, they're not scaring anyone,  but they just keep on adding,  they just keep on tightening these little bolts  very slowly.  So they're kind of like when you put on a tire  and you keep on going around  and you just keep on tightening these bolts  very, very slowly so that you keep it all even.  But it's not, they're not just going,  okay we're gonna turn the security all the way on.  Because there's a lot of places that they could go.  And I think that they're not tightening it so much  that people go crazy.  But when you look at that trajectory,  it feels like they could go,  they could tighten this a lot.  Like for instance, I think that the email is good.  I think basically allowing developers  to have an anonymized relationship with their users  where it's fixed.  I know that I'm talking to a person,  but I don't know who they are.  And that anonymizing of the data is incredibly valuable  because you can do a lot of things  that people won't trust you to do otherwise.  And it does seem like they're gonna make it harder  and harder, yeah, as I said,  they're kind of boiling a frog, a security frog.

Transcript:  This comes back to my point.  People trust Apple to get this right.  So when it comes to this privacy  and keeping your data secure  and respecting you as an individual and that sort of stuff,  then Apple is building that trust  that other institutions are.  This is, and it's very interesting,  I think if Apple actually ratcheted up to maximum,  like you said, it'd be interesting to see  if they would actually provoke Facebook,  Google and others into a reaction.  So if Apple became so private  that the secret services weren't able to track people  or that Facebook started to lose valuable analytics data  or that Google wasn't able to do targeted advertising,  they would provoke a reaction from those institutions.

Start time: 4294.46
End time: 4301.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Google and Facebook aren't comfortable with it,  but the ones that are talking about it  in Washington all the time,  and the ones that are passing laws in Australia  are security, you know, like our government agencies.  That's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The governments are talking about it in public,  but Google and Facebook are making moves behind the scenes  to bypass the privacy that Apple's putting in place,  constantly.  But Facebook. But that's a whack-a-mole.  I think a lot of it is also saying

Start time: 4343.50
End time: 4357.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  that they are going to encrypt WhatsApp end to end,  I mean, Zuckerberg is making all sorts of,  at least, statements about how privacy is the future.  Or you're saying, Justine, what were you saying there?

End time: 4400.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, of course, Zuckerberg is gonna say that.  Exactly.  It's Facebook.  I was gonna say that too.  Yeah, but for a lot of normal consumers,  people like my parents and my mom,  they don't wanna have to be worrying.  I go home and I make sure that I have face ID,  I have all of their things secured and locked,  because that's not something that a normal everyday person  is gonna be concerned about, but it is.  What if you lose your phone  and you didn't have a passcode on?  Why not?  Those simple things everyone should be doing.  And for Apple to kind of make this video  that is widely available to everyone,  I think it's a good move,  and it just makes normal everyday consumers  a little bit more aware that privacy is a huge issue.  You have so much information on that phone, be careful.

Well, I'm doing email, and I'm doing this other thing,  I'm like, just get an iPad.  This wall will just go away, it's a closed system.  I had the same problem with my brother,

Transcript:  If you don't use password as the password.  Yeah.  And the best advice I got was,  I have, my phone is, get away from the four digit  or six digit, this is our little PSA here for a second,  is think of a phrase that you remember from your childhood  that no one would know, and use that phrase,  and don't ever say it out loud to anyone ever.  Riding my bike up the street.  R-M-  Whatever, but it doesn't have to have any special letters.  It's just a long phrase, like my phrase is 26,  I'm not gonna tell my phrase.  My phrase is, someone say shushy me.  I'm gonna say my phrase is, Frank went to the market.  No one's ever gonna guess Frank went to the market.  It's great, isn't it?  No, it is, but it's 26 characters long,  and it's not the alphabet in case you're wondering,  it just happens to be 26 characters.  But the point is, the only time I get upset is like,  my battery goes out and then I'm like, oh my gosh,  I have to type this.  You know, like, so it's, but it's a phrase  that I'm always gonna remember and it's always gonna be there  and no one, at 26 characters, no one is gonna figure out.

Right?  And so when you're sitting there going to yourself,  I use the example of riding my bike up the street,  you know, R-M-B-R-T, and what you do is you use  swear words or really bad words  and then you'll never say it out loud.

Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.  So speaking of, we're gonna continue down  the security path here, just for one more pass,  and this gets back into the trust of your organization.  Two former Twitter employees charged with spying  for Saudi Arabia by digging into the accounts  of the kingdom critics.  So these are two different folks that got brought in  and they're basically, they worked for Twitter  and then they used their access at Twitter  to start figuring out who is complaining about the kingdom.  And this is a, obviously this is what we worry about.  Like this gets past the whole,  am I worried that Twitter is doing political ads  or anything else?  It's more of, am I worried that an average person  of Twitter has access to, and it matters less to me  because for the most part, I don't put anything online  that, like I would not use Twitter  to have a conversation that was personal.  And if I thought I was gonna say something dangerous,  I would go through an enormous number of hoops  to put it on Twitter where you'd have to,  you know, you'd get through three VPNs  and do a whole bunch of things,  but I thought my life was in danger.  So I don't trust Twitter to do that anyway,  but people do and they are,  this is an important political tool.

Transcript:  So the challenge here is that when,  a lot of these tech companies are very immature  in their terms of their data security,  and they also did very little to validate  the people that worked for them.  And I have various discussions with people  in Silicon Valley over time.  And if you worked for any one  of the major technology companies,  once you're an employee, for a while back there,  everybody had access to all the data.  You could see anybody's user,  and you know, these stories that we're hearing about  somebody inside the organization  was snooping on potential girlfriends  or looking for bikini pictures and that sort of stuff.  That's because these companies  didn't have internal data controls.  And if you read between the lines here,  these people were actually accessing accounts in 2015.  Now, what the technology companies are now saying,  and Twitter in this case particularly,  and Facebook has now subsequently implemented  is data control.  So if you're an employee,  and you shouldn't be looking at this data,  now you can't.  And this is a testament to just how badly organized.

Start time: 4805.92
End time: 4846.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's what they're complaining  and bitching and whining about  because that costs them money.  Every time they have to put these data controls in place,  it restricts the abilities of the employees  to move fast, to innovate,  and bring new products to market.  Backups get harder, security controls get harder,  because when you do a backup,  you have to encrypt the backup.  A lot of their backups weren't even encrypted  five years ago.  So I'm a little okay with this  in the sense that this was 2015,  and Twitter's now gone on to restrict  and apply data controls.  So they've closed the door after the horse is bolted.  But welcome to Silicon Valley,  where the kids play with their toys  and don't care who gets hurt.  And maybe we'll wait and see if it was done in 2018.

I'm here in Northern California,  and I had my power turned off for four days  because people didn't make any of the right decisions,  both in the government and in the company,  and those were adults.

Start time: 4909.78
End time: 4932.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I was just saying, it's really crazy  because a lot of these things never,  I think in anyone's wildest dreams,  would they ever expect that Twitter became what it is today.  So, obviously, you start building this infrastructure,  and you're not planning for it to be what it is now.  And so, I think the fact that it did take them that long,  they probably should have done that sooner,  but I think it's just hard when you're thrown into something  and you're like, what do we do now?

Start time: 4932.66
End time: 4983.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And for a lot of these startups,  it's like, there was a great interview.  Now, I can't think of what,  there was a podcast or something where they're,  and it might be NPR or something,  but they interview entrepreneurs.  So, they were interviewing the guys that started Instagram.  And they were just saying,  well, things weren't working.  And then we threw together this little thing on a server,  and then the server was so popular it crashed.  And the problem is that once you have something  that in a startup, once you have something that takes off,  there is a, you're now trying to,  you're no longer fixing a stationary train.  You are fixing a train that is going faster  than you even know how to steer it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But it's easy for us to say when we don't do it,  but the problem is that when you're doing it,  you're in the middle of, it's moving really fast,  and you have to figure out how to do it without stopping it.

End time: 5018.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think without me in Twitter,  it would be hard for you to know that.  There's a lot of work that gets done  in a lot of these companies  where there's a lot of concern about this stuff.  There's a lot of, it's easy to say from the outside,  oh, well, they're not doing anything,  but they're all working on it.  And they have been all working on it for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it was entirely predictable.  Entirely predictable.  If your data is not secured and segmented  and need to know this is going to happen,  entirely predictable.  The executive team in charge of all of these companies,  Facebook, Google, Twitter,  failed to implement perfectly reasonable controls.  But no one predicted that initially.  Everybody predicted that.

Start time: 5068.74
End time: 5085.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I said this on this show two years ago, Kastin,  when I was here.  I said the problem with these companies  is that internally they have zero internal controls.  They are not validating or doing any background checks  on the employees that work for them.  And once you're inside the company with a badge,  you get full access to all the data.  This was entirely predictable.

Start time: 5085.14
End time: 5142.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the problem is we have data breaches  from people who have spent all their time doing this.  The question is whether it's going to,  we would think that our credit scores,  companies that manage our credit scores  would have some control over the data.  They have adults there probably working there,  but they still can't keep control of it.  So the thing is that the issue is that  assuming that they'd be able to actually fix this,  it would be difficult in that area.  And again, what I will say is that the data control,  they are, I've been in a situation where I've built up  online forums, I've built up all those things,  and the level of work when you're getting,  especially when you're getting started,  you can't fix everything.  And then the problem is you have a whole bunch of code.  No, I understand what you're saying,

Start time: 5142.60
End time: 5146.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but you also didn't have billions of dollars in profits  coming through the door every year.

Start time: 5146.14
End time: 5157.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that didn't happen until all that code  was already written.  This is in 2015.  They should have been implementing this since 2000.  But 2015 is 11 years, 11 years since they started.  11 years of code, of millions of lines a year.  It doesn't matter.

Start time: 5167.82
End time: 5184.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is well known and well understood.  There was a bunch of social networks  that thought that that was important.  And you know what happened?  They didn't succeed because they moved too slowly.  It didn't.  And so the thing is is that the problem is  that these ones got bigger because they moved fast enough  to stay in front of the wave instead of behind it.  Now the cost is now that they have to go back  and try to tie it all together.  So don't excuse them for being incompetent.

Start time: 5184.70

Start time: 5191.38
End time: 5224.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think if they could have made this an issue  and fixed it at the beginning, like they would have.  I mean, I'm just saying from the beginning,  I was on Twitter in 2006.  It was not what it is now.  I was the 103rd person to join Instagram.  I was even on Bourbon,  which was the thing that was before Instagram.  And no one ever initially at these times  ever expected it to be what it is.  I'm not disregarding what you're saying,  that yes, these things need to be implemented.  And I think now knowing this going forward,  people starting companies and starting these types of apps  with these things in mind,  yes, it should 100% be implemented from the beginning.  But I just think initially this was such a whole new thing  that we were doing.

Start time: 5226.02
End time: 5228.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  from the beginning.  I'm saying by 2015,  this should have been well under control.

Start time: 5229.20
End time: 5293.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just when you have at that point,  hundreds of millions of lines of code  written by a lot of different people,  pulling that out is like grabbing on.  And it's not written by,  it's not written by guys that are trying to build  in a structure, they're trying to fix something today.  And so there's not a lot of commenting,  there's not a lot of process.  And so when we say that it's,  oh, we should just go back in there and fix it,  it's the same problem with,  I'm just gonna go back to it  because it's very near and dear to my heart  is the fact that I lost power for four days  because these idiots didn't put the power under the ground.  Well, it cost them,  they saved half a million dollars a mile  to not put it under underground over the last 30 years.  And now they're gonna,  they could have for the amount that's gonna cost them,  make that mistake,  they could have put it under 60,000 out of the 82,000 miles.  And so the thing is,  and again, when we talk about these kids  and they're being irresponsible, this is a big company.  This is of old people.  And it's managed by the government.  I've worked for government departments,

And I've worked for them when they're nascent  and I've worked for them when they're mature.  And there's a certain point at your cycle  where you take data security seriously.  Neither Facebook, neither Google,  neither Twitter took this seriously  until far too late in the cycle.

You know, like, you know, and the thing is, is that,  but in the end of it, when you realise it,  when you get into the middle of all of these things,  whether it's governments or big corporations  or small companies or whatever,  you realise that nobody really knows what they're doing.  You know, like, you know, like they're all  just trying to figure it out, you know?  And, and they're,  some of them are making better decisions than others.  And the decisions that they're,  there's good decisions and bad decisions, but, but let's,  so, but that's the,  as far as we're going down the Twitter route.

Transcript:  This Week in Tech brought to you this week  by Wasabi Hot Cloud Storage.  My buddies, Jeff Flowers and David Friend,  they were at Carbonite when they patented a process  for writing to hard drives sequentially,  as opposed to in blocks.  That made a big difference.  In fact, it's why Wasabi, which is their new startup,  it's enterprise class cloud storage,  hot cloud storage, is 80% cheaper and six times faster  than S3.  It's this patented technology, only they have it.  It also is more durable.  11 nines of durability, that's as high as you can get.  Nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine,  11 nines of durability.  They do something else I think is so cool,  especially in this day and age of ransomware.  You can designate some of, or all of your storage  is immutable, it can't be changed, not by ransomware,  not by fumble fingered employees, that's awesome.  Redundant data centers too, so your data's never at risk.  They do regular integrity checks to make sure  your data has not been modified in any way,  is the best way to put your data in the cloud.  And you know, everybody's doing it.  They're all moving to the cloud.  But you don't have to do what everybody else is doing.  You don't have to follow the herd.  I know, Google, Microsoft, Amazon,  everybody follows the herd.  You don't have to.  You don't have to.  You can save money, get better performance.  You don't have to tell them your secret is Wasabi.  By the way, Just is Secure, and I would say in most cases,  more secure than on-premises storage.  It's HIPAA compliant, it's FINRA compliant,  it's CJS compliant.  Look, just all you gotta do is tell the boss,  okay, I know you want the big three,  but let me just tell you, I found one that's 80% cheaper  and up to six times faster than the better known brands.  It's Wasabi.  Calculate the savings for yourself and start a free trial,  unlimited storage for a month  so you can really bang on it.  Go to wasabi.com, W-A-S-A-B-I.com.  Click the free trial link, put the code in,  tweet, and then you'll get unlimited free storage  for a month.  Join the movement and migrate your data to the cloud  with confidence, wasabi.com.  You gotta use the offer code, tweet.  We thank Wasabi so much for their support.  Now back to you.

Start time: 5536.74
End time: 5566.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just extremely simple, but I mean, I think, you know,  making all of their products kind of look the same,  I get it, but the one thing that I never liked  about Facebook is how many times am I gonna have  to download another app to do the same exact thing  when I could just do it all in one app?  I need the messages app.  I need like the app so I can control my actual profile page.  So I think, you know, just integrating everything  into one app would be amazing, but the logo is fine.  Like if that's what you decided to go with, it's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I mean, like go back to their beginning, you know,  so the big holding company is The Facebook,  and then you have Facebook.  So I just think that would be perfect.  You know, so, but it is, you know, I like,  I have to admit that I like the different apps  because for instance, I don't, you know,  necessarily wanna go on Facebook all the time,  but I have a lot of friends that are on Messenger,  and so there's a lot of, you know, back and forth,  and so I don't really want Messenger.  When they split Messenger out, I was like,  I cannot believe they're doing that.  You know, but then, but now I'm like totally like,  I'm really glad that I don't have to,  because I think for me, a lot of times,  on Facebook, I feel a little,  I feel that Facebook's a little heavy.  I get lost in there.  You get lost sort of in doing something else

It's kind of, it's interesting,  I was listening to a professor of marketing,  Professor Galloway is quite well known  in the podcasting community,  and he points out that the whole idea of  Instagram by Facebook and WeChat by Face, not WeChat,  what's the messenger called?  WhatsApp by Facebook and Facebook by Facebook,  is really an interesting branding decision,  and his point was with it is how quickly  can you destroy your company?  Because the company that sits behind BMW cars  also makes Mini cars.  So if now all of a sudden you had Mini Cooper by BMW,  that just destroys the whole branding exercise of BMW.  Right, because now-

So I always like register, so I had,  when I went to start using Instagram,  it was like years after it started  and I was like, someone has my name, how did that happen?  And then I realized that I had my name.

Start time: 5752.88
End time: 5777.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I just gave up on Instagram, I couldn't make it work  and it was just too much of a time suck  and then I realized that most of my,  the work that I do is in IT infrastructure,  so the servers, data centers, WANs,  infrastructure software and that sort of stuff.  And I just realized that none of the nerds are on Instagram,  none of the nerds are on Facebook,  they're all on Twitter and LinkedIn and Slack groups.  So I don't care.

Start time: 5792.36
End time: 5855.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I'm more concerned for the people  that are actually on Facebook  and that are falling for these traps  because I mean, I know me personally, I'm not really,  I don't use Facebook as much anymore,  but I still use it to post updates like on my Facebook page  and things like that, but it's hard  because you'll see these ads and it is something  that you are so fully believing is real  and the fake news aspect, however you wanna take that.  I mean, most of it is fake.  Like these ads that you're seeing,  I have found myself in all of these fake ads  holding up a product, they'll Photoshop out the phone  that I have, which was like an iPhone or something  and put in something fake.  There's been all these ads that are running  of me promoting a fake little NES system,  but I'm actually showing the real one.  So it's almost impossible to even stop that  and as soon as you report it to Facebook,  another company will then make a new fake page  and start running the same ads.  So it is an issue even just for me.  So I can't even imagine on the big scale  of how this is just affecting people,  especially the political nature.

Start time: 5856.46
End time: 5891.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think for me, it comes back to this issue  we had further up the show where we talked about trust.  If I can't trust Facebook to show me genuine content  and more importantly, if they're showing you content  that they know to be false,  then you can't trust Facebook as an institution  and where does that lead?  And I think logically that ultimately it undermines.  Now Facebook is thinking that if you let that person  show a false ad, that's not Facebook that gets the blame,  it's the person showing the false ad.  But I think the lesson is that from society  is that that's not how it works,  it's the platform that they blame  or the platform that they trust.

Transcript:  I don't know if most society blames Facebook for anything.  I don't know if they really think about it.  We're thinking about it, we're talking about it.  I think most society is just like they just see the ads go by  and they either believe them or not.  And I think one of the questions is-  I want to say okay, Boomer, right about now,

Start time: 5903.82

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but it's that age group who don't actually,  they've had 50 or 60 years of just reading newspapers  as a trusted news source where it's been,  the platform has been controlled and regulated  for not necessarily legally controlled, but controlled.

Start time: 5919.34
End time: 5951.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think there's a middle group of people  that are impacted by these.  I think that there's a younger generation  that is probably less, is more cynical  about what's coming through.  And I think that from my perspective,  the question is should you believe anything that you see?  You know, whether it's on the news  or whether it's on Facebook or anything else.  I spent the last 20 years both in front and behind  the press and I need to see it from a couple  of different angles before I'm gonna believe anything  that I see because everything has gotten agenda to it.

Start time: 5953.80
End time: 5968.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I think that's the biggest challenge  that we've had, is that we've had people  who have been trying to trust the news  and then we've seen-  Which is a horrible idea.  The TV news.  In the history of the world, it's always been wrong.  Well, historically, the news was trustable, right?  Always wrong, never.  To a large, lesser, or greater degree.

Transcript:  And then we saw Murdoch's monotype,  like weaponized and monotype.  The press was never trustable.  Let's be clear, I'm not saying that they're lying.  I'm not following up on some kind of Trumpism,  you know, and like that is craziness.  People manipulating the person talking about it.  There's the person itself with their own viewpoint.  There's this, you know, I was in-  But it was never malicious or deliberate.  Oh yeah, it was.

Start time: 5991.38

Transcript:  Like it wasn't awful, right?  Like it is now. Oh, it was.  It was completely awful.  Compared to what it is now, like the weaponization-  Hearst, like they were so concerned about Hearst

Start time: 6004.66
End time: 6037.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  because he would change, he would push all these headlines  and do all these other things.  The reason that we have all these laws  about how much media you can have  is because people were getting a lot of media  and then lying with it.  You know, so let's be clear that this is not,  there's nothing, like this is nothing new.  And you have people saying, I mean,  like if you think the press is crazy now,  go back and look at the headlines around like  the late 1850s and these newspapers.  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.  And it's just crazy.  You know, so the thing is,  is there's nothing new about this, you know?  And so, Justine, are you concerned about this?

Start time: 6038.54
End time: 6043.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I'm concerned just for the nature of, you know,  it is something that is being advertised to people.

Transcript:  Do you believe what you see when you watch the news  and when you watch Facebook?  Do you believe what's showing up there?

Start time: 6049.18
End time: 6083.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, like you said,  I'll definitely go and look at separate sources.  I will start searching on Twitter and then I will look.  And it's crazy because you will just put these news articles  next to each other and each one is different.  Like the headline definitely skews  to whatever that political belief is.  So it's really hard and it's even hard  to have your own opinions  because everyone has so many differing opinions.  And this content that you're reading,  it's being skewed towards what your beliefs are  or something, you know, that it's like a trigger point  because obviously Facebook knows everything.  So if it knows or it's overheard me say something  that I didn't like, it knows how to target that.

Start time: 6084.50
End time: 6114.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The problem is, is that now the data is getting so good.  I mean, the, you know, like TikTok is a good example  of that for me is that TikTok will show me videos  that I wanna see, but I don't wanna admit that I wanna see.  I'm like, no, of course I don't care about that video.  The peanut butter of video.  I might watch that for another minute.  You know, like, or another 10 seconds or whatever.  I'm just gonna, for educational purposes,  watch this for another 10 seconds.  And so, but it's, it's figured it out  because it's watching me every second  that I'm watching that video,  it's making a decision about whether I like it or not.

Start time: 6114.66
End time: 6116.46

Transcript:  about the political ads ultimately  is that Facebook's getting paid to lie.  And when people realize that, it gets really distasteful.  It's one thing for people, for you and me

Start time: 6126.18
End time: 6128.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to get onto Facebook and say, you know.  But here's the question,

Start time: 6128.30
End time: 6141.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  because broadcast ads that lie are different.  Because I just wanna make sure we're all clear  that for Facebook, the political ads  are some small percentage of their income.  You know, it's not a big part of it.  They could give up the ad revenue

Start time: 6141.78
End time: 6145.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and not, wouldn't even have to restate  their financial results, it's so insignificant.

Start time: 6145.12
End time: 6203.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, so it's a tiny little number for them,  but I can tell you for broadcasters,  the election season is when they upgrade all their,  upgrade their studios, upgrade, buy all the new cameras,  buy all the, like, there's just money coming in from heaven.  It is like this snow of money  that comes into these broadcasters.  And especially when it's like,  Trump has been this massive boom for the broadcasters  because now they have, it's snowing money every day.  You know, like it's not just around the elections,  it's just been crazy.  And so they're all coming.  I'm trying to remember the numbers.  And so the thing is that it is,  when we talk about Facebook's getting paid to lie,  I mean, there's a lot of ads.  We can cover a lot of ads in the past 20 or 30 years  where the broadcasters were getting paid to lie.  I mean, those ads are there.  And I'm not saying that that's, I mean, I think that I,  and what I will say, I don't know what the answer is.  No.  You know, like, cause I'm not gonna say  that they should just stop doing the ads like Twitter,  because the reality is-

Start time: 6203.18
End time: 6219.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Twitter didn't stop doing the ads.  It said, we're gonna stop accepting paid ads.  So if a person, if a political,  if somebody standing in politics wants to get onto Twitter  and make lies, then they do that as a person,  but they can't pay to get that targeted and accelerated.

Start time: 6219.22
End time: 6236.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the problem is, is that for an incumbent, that's great.  Yes.  Because you already have a million followers  or you already have half a million followers.  And now you have this startup that's gonna try to,  you know, compete with you and they have to, now they-  And the problem is-

Start time: 6236.26
End time: 6294.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So yeah, you're right.  It opens up an opportunity for a new entrant  to enter the market, but then it becomes an arms race  where the new entrant needs to earn money  to sustain a social media campaign  and the incumbent starts to spend money  and there's no winner here.  The voters don't win because they're just spending  more and more money on social media  to put out more and more content  that is supposed to attract ads.  The only winner there is the social media company.  All right.  And in fact, what you end up with is what you have  in politics around the world is as they spend more  and more money on media, they have to raise more  and more money and the only way that you can move  the needle on raising more money is to go to rich people  and wealthy people and as soon as you accept money  from wealthy people, you get owned, right?  Wealthy people don't give you money for altruistic reasons.  They usually over, generally give it to you  so that they can own you and get a favor back  and that is the cycle that's being broken here  by Twitter walking away from the money.  It pulls out the accelerated cycle.

Start time: 6295.10
End time: 6327.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that, again, the hard part,  again, I don't have an answer for it  but I think that I've worked in a lot of campaigns  where you're just trying to, especially when folks  are trying to get off the ground, how do you get  that word out at the beginning?  Now, I will say that I think that,  I think that the earned views is gold.  That is what everybody should be trying  to figure out how to do.  So I do believe that anybody who's just leaning  on advertising, that's kind of a cheap high.

Start time: 6330.46
End time: 6348.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're going through an election campaign in the UK  and we're watching these 40, 50, 60 year old  political candidates do these off the cuff videos  and it's gold.  It's like watching your mom pretend  that she's gonna be all hip on an Instagram video.  They are just appalling at it.

Start time: 6348.58
End time: 6349.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, well, it was the same in 2018.

Start time: 6350.86
End time: 6367.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, watching the election, watching political folks,  there were a couple of folks that we reached out to  and just said, I'll help.  Like I'll just help you because I want to,  and they're like, no, no, we got it under control.  And then you'd watch the videos and you were like,  oh, come on.  You know, like, it doesn't have to be that way.  You know, and-

Start time: 6368.26
End time: 6392.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's some like, somebody's holding up a camera  recording them and you're like, look at the background.  There's just, you know, anyway, I'm sure.  But it's just hysterical watching these people  make the transition from, you know, they're literally  walking down the street door knocking at old fashioned  politics and then they stopped to record a video  which is supposed to like, and I'm going like,  why are you door knocking?  Why are you not just doing social media?  It just baffles me beyond belief.  Anyway.

Start time: 6392.90
End time: 6432.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I think that the hard part right now is  when we go back to the whole virtual, you know,  why don't we have people working remotely?  Because the tools, I will say, I will argue that the  the tools that we have right now to stream,  to get out and interact with people,  having meaningful conversations with a large number of people  are still rudimentary.  You know, like they are, people love it  and people get excited about it.  And it's the way to scale your campaign  and it's a way to scale your brand.  But the tools that I've used for those things  are stuff that we built from scratch.  You know, we didn't have, and they still are not,  I figured once we did it, people would start building them  all the time, but they haven't, you know,  because they don't understand it.

Start time: 6432.16
End time: 6458.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So here's the other side of this too,  is when Twitter said too that they're walking away  from three million in revenue by ditching the political ads,  basically they also walked away from having to develop  a system that detected political ads  and then detected the truth.  And if you do the maths, three million dollars  is roughly about three headcount in a machine learning  in Silicon Valley, right?  Because finding people with good maths skills  and machine learning skills is about three million bucks.

Start time: 6458.58
End time: 6462.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, you know, like it was just,  I think that they just looked at it and said,  you know, this is too hot, you know, and I think that-

Start time: 6463.26
End time: 6476.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like the money that they're making,  they said three million US is what they're taking  for political ads, that's three headcount for Twitter  in the machine learning team, right?  It's not even worth their while gearing up a team  to try and detect fake ads because they can't,  they can't win.

Start time: 6476.70
End time: 6481.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, Justine, do you think that Facebook  should allow the ads or do you think  they should just cut them off like everybody else?

Start time: 6482.08
End time: 6535.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think they would cut them off at all  because I feel like that would be completely against  everything that they basically stand for now,  which is, I mean, their whole platform is built  off of that type of promotion.  And it's interesting that Twitter,  so they're only saying that they're losing three million  dollars by not taking political ads?  I think the number would be much bigger.  No, the number was three million.  Because that's not a lot at all.  And like you were saying, the amount of money  that would probably be- That's the US election only.  Yeah, but the amount of money would have taken them  to put those procedures in place to make sure  that the ads were actually legit, it was real people.  I mean, that would have cost, I would imagine,  way more than that.  So, I mean, I think it's a good deal,  but they've already given a massive platform  to our current president to basically say whatever he wants.  So, he's still there, he's still saying his piece.  So, I think that's already way too much  that they've already given him.  Yeah, yeah.

Start time: 6537.40
End time: 6609.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  You know, and I think that what you're talking about  is the fundamental problem, is you have incumbents  who already have a large following, and how do you get,  how do you build up to where you can compete with that?  And I do think that there are other solutions.  I think that people who care about this stuff  need to become more organized.  I think for the most part,  what you see is a lot of disorganization,  where, for instance, if you can,  a lot of times what we work on a lot  when we work on campaigns, or what we used to,  I haven't done it for a while,  but is this kind of coordinated effort.  So, you're gonna have thought leaders and influencers  and all these things pushing towards a new thing.  And again, what you're then doing is getting earned views,  which is what you wanna try to build up.  It's gonna be a lot more valuable in the long run.  More impactful, yeah.  But the hard part is that,  I do think that it's a complicated problem.  You know, like I look at it, I go,  I'm glad I'm not the guy that has to make this decision.  All right, so we're gonna talk about,  we're actually gonna get out of the security conversation,  jump into graphics next,  but Leo has a couple words that he needs to share with us.

Start time: 6745.06
End time: 6810.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did.  What do you think?  I've been actually really looking forward to this.  I was reading a bunch of the reviews and everyone said,  but you guys didn't put all of the features into it.  And they're, you know, obviously like we can't put  all those years of work and code into the iPad app,  but for what it is right now,  I am always making thumbnails.  I'm always doing a ton of photo editing  and the way that it can sync, you know,  using the cloud services,  I can be cutting something out using the Apple pencil,  go and just drop it into my actual Photoshop  on my computer and continue working.  So for me, it's been incredibly seamless  and just being able to, you know, make simple thumbnails  and then upload them on YouTube  when I'm traveling is really great.  So I'm excited about the future of Photoshop  and all the Adobe products for mobile.  Cause even like Adobe Rush,  I'm a huge fan of for editing videos.  It's been great.  And do you use Spark?  I have used it a little bit,  but now I mean, I mostly was using Adobe Rush  and I'm just waiting for Final Cut to be able to,  or iMovie actually, to be able to edit vertical video.  It's still shocking that they have not put that in yet.  I am.  It blows my mind.

Start time: 6811.24

Transcript:  You know, I was so against it,  like so against 9x16.  We had clients that would ask us to like,  what do you think of 9x16?  I was like, not that much.  And like, I don't, you know, like, I was like,  I don't, I hate it, you know?  And here's the worst part is that, you know,  I did a bunch of consulting for some TikTok stuff.  So I spent a lot of time in TikTok.  And now you get into this thing, like,  if you're on TikTok and you see a 16x9,  you immediately just go, nope, nope.  I'm just not even gonna, I don't even,  I don't care what you're saying in a 16x9.  And even one by one, you're like,  you're cross-posting this to Instagram, aren't you?  You know, like, and you kind of like,  you look at them sideways, like,  you're not really a TikToker.  You know, like, you're cheating.  And so the 9x16, and my frustration is,  is that more tools aren't built around 9x16,  which there's people who are probably listening  to this show that are probably horrified  that that came out of my mouth.

Start time: 6867.28
End time: 6912.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was against it for a very long time.  And now I love editing vertical video,  and it is a challenge.  Like, even now I've like moved my camera back  a little bit more, like at my desk set up,  so that I can still have enough space on each side  to edit that piece into a vertical video  so I don't have to reshoot things twice.  I've also sometimes been using my phone,  two separate phones, and like just attaching them together  and shooting vertical and horizontal at the same time.  So it's been a challenge, but there's another,  have you seen Firework at all?  I haven't used it very much, but it's kind of cool  because you can hold the camera horizontal,  but then also vertical, and it kind of gives you  sort of a flipped feel of the whole image in the video.  But I enjoy editing vertical video now a lot.

Start time: 6912.88
End time: 6957.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that there's, especially when it's a person  talking to a bunch of other people, it works really well.  So that there's something that's more personal  about the 9x16, and this took me a long time to get to,  is that I think that when it's a person,  that's kind of a nice frame.  When it's two people or three people.  There's a reason why it's called portrait.  Exactly. And landscape.  Exactly, and so as a portrait,  I think it works actually pretty well.  I think that it is as a,  when you're trying to have two or three people  are trying to show something wide,  and I'm always surprised that watching  landscape quote unquote stuff on something like TikTok,  where they're showing like a big old panorama,  and it, excuse me, and it works.

Start time: 6959.44
End time: 6964.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does that mean that TikTok then tends to lean into  head to toe shots of people doing?  No, not head to toe, just 9x16.

Start time: 6966.22
End time: 6967.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it can be there, it can be just there.  Yeah, but what I'm saying is that,

Start time: 6969.28
End time: 6982.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I could imagine that if you're shooting,  this is not my area of expertise,  so I'm coming in as an outsider.  If you're shooting vertically,  you're gonna lean into seeing the person,  or you're gonna see torso to head.  Whereas if you're shooting 16x9,  you're gonna get shoulders and head.

Start time: 6982.88
End time: 6995.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it allows you, when you're shooting portrait,  and let's just say torso to head,  it's much more focused on that person,  because when you shot, if it's one person talking to you,  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  Yeah, they have to worry about their background,  and they have to worry about a bunch of other things.

Start time: 6996.06
End time: 7002.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So does that focus on vertical then,  and maybe Justine's the right person to ask,  does it make it focus on the person instead of the scene?

Start time: 7003.36
End time: 7033.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is, I think, a lot more personal,  but a lot of that stuff is also shot  using the front-facing camera,  and it also provides, I mean,  even me as editing a vertical video,  how can I fit other things into this frame?  So if I'm doing an unboxing video,  I can put my expression at the top,  I can do a split screen and put the product at the bottom.  So it's just trying to find other interesting ways  to take that existing content  and re-edit it into something that's vertical.  It's challenging, but it's also really fun.  But I do feel like the vertical video is way more personal.

Start time: 7035.08
End time: 7039.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so it's an interesting process  that Apple is a little behind on, I think.

Start time: 7039.92
End time: 7070.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm like, it doesn't make sense.  You guys basically created this monster.  Now give us the tools to edit it.  But yeah, that's definitely something  that I've been pushing for.  It's like you have iMovie, which works incredible,  but Adobe Rush is my go-to now  for editing any vertical stuff.  And then I think it's Lumetouch.  The LumaFusion is also really great for editing.  It's basically like Final Cut, just in a mobile version of it.  Do you like Lumetouch?  I do, yeah.  I mean, I mostly just use Rush for simple things,  and then I always usually have my computer with me,  so if I actually have to edit something,  I just hop into Final Cut.

Start time: 7071.26

And I'll usually take my existing 16 by 9 project  and just copy and paste it into a vertical format  and then just kind of adjust each piece  and kind of just make it work.  But yeah, I think, I'm not sure.  I don't really use Premiere very often,  but I think they were working on some things  that will auto adjust your previous project  and kind of reformat it into vertical.  So I'm not 100% sure if that's,  I think that's what they announced not too long ago.  I think that's- It's kind of like AI editing.

Transcript:  It's one of the reasons that I got the 6K  from the Blackmagic 6K was because if you shoot 6K,  then you can do whatever you want.  Like it's not, I don't have to think about  whether it's vertical or not.  It's horizontal.  There's tons of resolution to work inside of there,  so you can kind of move your frame around  and just kind of get whatever you,  kind of use it and repurpose it.  So just throw in more bits at it.

Transcript:  I want to ask you a question, Justine.  I've had a lot of people tell me  that they're giving up on Adobe's licensing  because the cost of subscribing to Adobe's product  is getting higher and higher and people are turning away.  There was an article in Slash.thisweek.

Start time: 7150.80
End time: 7152.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you've got to pay extra for the iPad version?

Start time: 7152.20
End time: 7159.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the iPad version, you have to have a subscription.  No, you just have to have a subscription.  You already have to have a Photoshop subscription  to use the iPad version.  Is that right, Justine?

Start time: 7160.14
End time: 7191.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think so, yeah.  I have a subscription.  I do too, so I didn't notice it.  I just didn't have a problem.  Yeah, I mean, I think, I just remember growing up,  like when I was really young, I was like, I can't,  like there's no way my mom is going to pay  thousands and thousands of dollars  for each of this piece of software and then for updates.  So I think just having that subscription fee,  and especially if you are a business,  you're basically building your entire life  off of this product.  So I mean, I think it makes sense.  I'm not sure if they have smaller subscription plans,  if you just plan to use Photoshop,  but I have the whole package.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like I can get-  I think the problem is, is that there are a lot of tools  in Photoshop that just still aren't in Pixelmator  or Affinity or other ones.  So you think that you wanna use them.  And I've been trying to move more of the work.  For instance, we had, for a long time,  a lot of our computers would have,  everybody had Pixelmator,  and then the people doing graphics had Photoshop.  But so you were able to edit stuff,  and then I use Affinity on some stuff now  because for 360 video,  and for 360 stills,  Affinity has a panoramic view  where you can look straight down at your tripod  and paint it out really easily, which is-  That's cool.  Super useful.  So anyway, so that was why I kinda got into that.  And so I love those apps.  And I think that the hard part is,  they don't wanna just copy all the things  that Photoshop did.  They're doing something else.  But for us, and unfortunately,  I remember when Photoshop added layers.  So I'm old enough to,  it was a, been using this for a long time,  and it's hard for me to,  I just can't figure out why,  where it is.  I'm not saying that Pixelmator and Affinity doesn't do it.  I just don't know where that thing is.  It's interesting for me-  And they do goofy things with alpha channels  and layers that drive me a little crazy.

End time: 7335.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no, just like a lot of these apps,  I think people don't even realize  that they're even paying for.  I mean, just these simple iPhone apps,  you have to pay several dollars a month to unlock.  So this is not something that's that uncommon.  I think maybe people might be overreacting a little bit.  And I mean, I definitely remember this was,  when I first started using Photoshop as well,  I mean, it was thousands of dollars.  And obviously, I mean, I think they have student pricing  for things as well.  But I mean, if this is something that you're using  on a daily basis and you're using it for business,  I mean, I think the $10 a month is well spent  using a product that actually does work.  And you have the cloud and everything  can just sync well together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You are taking a risk.  I mean, back in the day when we were spending $600  or $700 on a copy of Photoshop,  then you were taking a risk that,  are you gonna use it enough to make that work?  And so a lot of us, I mean, I started obviously  with an unofficial copy.  It's kinda how most of us started in the 90s.  What?

Start time: 7355.86
End time: 7380.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did as well.  And I think every 30 days,  cause I was in sixth grade at the time.  So like, I didn't understand this whole world  or my parents didn't really understand it.  So every 30 days, I would reformat my computer.  And back then we had floppy disks.  So I was like trying to copy all of my little files  onto here.  I'm like 11, I'm like, I don't know what I'm doing.  But every 30 days I would reformat  so I could have fireworks and Photoshop.  And it was, I don't know, these kids today.

Start time: 7381.14
End time: 7421.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It wasn't even that hard when I started doing it.  It was just, you just had to get somebody's disks  and usually, or a copy of their disks  and you needed the serial number.  And then you were kinda like, you're in.  And it was easy to do that.  Of course, Photoshop, I mean,  Adobe figured out how to type.  And as soon as, here's the reality.  As soon as I started making money,  I bought it because I don't wanna get caught  with illegal software.  So by the mid 90s, I was paying for it.  And the great thing about Photoshop  is it came with a scanner.  So it came with every scanner  that you could buy in the early 90s.  And so that was the big thing was that we just,  you would just buy a scanner.  Buy a scanner and that's where the Photoshop would show up.  And everybody had a legal copy because they bought a scanner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I just-  That's amazing.  I struggle with Adobe.  I just can't get on board  because even starting Photoshop,  the whole interface is baffling to me.  I can't make sense of it.

Start time: 7432.92
End time: 7499.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can't make sense of Photoshop?  No.  Well, I think it's hard.  I had actually, I had a conversation  with someone who worked on the original Photoshop.  And his point was strong was that,  for us, when I started, it was very simple.  It was much, much less than what Pixelmator does  or other things like that.  And then they just kept on adding little features.  And so it wasn't baffling to me  because they just kept on adding new things.  And so I didn't have to learn  how to do something from scratch.  And yeah, and to the point someone's making online,  PS Photoshop Elements does a much more  simplified version of the experience.  Although for me, as a user that's used it in production  for a long time, it's too simplified  and I don't feel like I can get everything done.  And so, but I think that for most people  doing photo editing, I think Photoshop  is a little bit of overkill.  I think that most people, a Pixelmator  or an Infinity would work great.  And I think if you didn't have that history,  I think it would be less.  But for people like us who've been using it,  Justine, since you were 11,  and me since I was 21 or 22 years old,  it's just really hard to-

Start time: 7499.52
End time: 7522.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's products that I've been using for decades,  which I just couldn't recommend to normal people  because the gap is just too large.  But Adobe for me is just getting into Adobe is so tough.  It's so expensive.  Like just, it's hundreds of dollars a year  and I'm just going like,  I would rather go and buy a license for Sketch  or one of the other services  that's a fraction of the price.  And-  It's just a fraction of features too.

Start time: 7522.78
End time: 7539.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I'm using it every day on a daily basis  for hours and hours on end.  So I think it comes down to it like,  do I need this or do I not need this?  And for me, like I definitely obviously need it.  And it's still, it was incredible that Final Cut is $300.  We've bought that once.  Like that's it.  So that's super impressive.

Start time: 7539.50
End time: 7552.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's the benchmark for me is that  I think that Adobe might be certainly leaning  into its customers by charging so much money.  And I just find it very-  I still know if they're leading.  I just-  I don't know if they're leading.  I don't know if they're leading.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they have so much stuff.  They have, I mean, Premiere, After Effects.  I mean, you have everything, Illustrator, InDesign.  So it's like, I use that whole suite of things  and it's all there under subscription.  So like that would have cost, I mean, thousands of dollars  like back in the day, even now, if you were to buy it also.  The subscription model, I absolutely love it.  And again, if it isn't something that you need,  you can just choose to stop the subscription.  So that's always good.

Start time: 7574.38
End time: 7584.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 7585.52
End time: 7587.51

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, you know, depending on how much you're making,  that's anywhere from 15 minutes to a couple hours.  You know, is your rent out of 160 hours of time.  So I think that if you're a professional  and this is what you're doing all the time,  I think that makes sense.  Now, Adobe also released Arrow.  Justine, have you played with Arrow at all?

End time: 7705.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's something that I'm excited about.  I haven't played with it a ton.  But I'm excited about where it's going.  One of the things I'm really excited about  is that it is supporting the new USDZ format,  which is going to be,  or it's going to be supporting the USDZ format.  The USDZ format is a,  I believe it is the universal scene description.  USD was a Pixar format and USDZ is, it zipped.  So zipped up so it's a little bit more contained.  But Apple's been really pushing that format forward.  And I'm really excited about seeing USDZ in more places.  I really wish it was in Keynote.  But my dream is the Apple office stuff supporting it  so that I can drop 3D models into stuff.  But it means that you have a simple way  to basically export models.  And the idea is to get to a point  where designers can build AR experiences relatively easily.  I think that this is a good one.  I think that Apple's reality creator,  I think it's reality creator.  I don't have it right in front of me,  but is another great one where it's making  a much more graphical interface  because I think that's going to be needed for AR.  It can't be all like I'm going to write,  for most of the AR stuff we've done,  there's a lot of lines of code that make it work.  You know, like it's not like,  we built a bunch of cool pictures  and now we're going to write them.  Somebody's going to write a bunch of code to make it work.  I mean, do you, Justine, do you see yourself  building AR experiences and stuff like this?

Start time: 7706.51
End time: 7748.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think so.  I mean, I definitely would love to mess with it more.  It's just, you know, right now it's like, okay,  how much time do I need to dedicate  to just keeping YouTube going?  And then, you know, how much time do I dedicate  to all of these experimental things,  which may never end up anywhere?  But I always love testing out things like this.  So yeah, I'm definitely interested  in the whole future of AR,  like especially AR experiences for other people.  So imagine me sitting on the couch  with somebody watching one of my YouTube videos  that's up on the, on imaginary TV  so they could just be holding their phone,  watching on an imaginary AR TV that's there,  they could turn to me, I can give them some feedback,  be like, oh, I love this part.  Like this is, make sure you pay attention.  So I think there's a lot of really cool things  that can be done in the future with that.

Transcript:  Yeah, I'm really focused on education  in relationship to it is just that, you know,  or not just, and when I say education,  I don't mean K through 12 or secondary,  but really the idea of, you know,  I'm walking through, let's say, a historical location,  and being able to pick up my phone  and be able to see new data, you know,  like this is what this was, and this is what this was,  or this is what this used to look like, or this is,  you know, these are all the things  that you could be adding to that experience  where as a venue, you know, someone who's got the venue,  whether that's a historical venue or anything else,  like for me, like AR, someone, I saw something, I guess,  that they're doing a bunch of stuff  and the Dallas Cowboys are really way ahead of this.  And they have this big thing  where the football players are really huge  and everything else.  And I was like, I just wanna know where to go to the bathroom.  Like, I just wanna pick up my phone.  Like the number one feature.  I just wanna hold my phone down here  and have an arrow that goes faster.  The number one feature, no, I wanna pick up the phone  and I wanna see an arrow that goes like this,  you know, like that goes down and around,  and I go, okay, that's where I go, you know,  or where do I pick up the hot dogs or, you know,  like if you just gave me that, I'd be really happy.  I mean, you know, about,  because you get to these huge arenas  and you can't figure out which way is up.  Anyway, so we'll see how that goes.  Now, Microsoft had Ignite,  they have one of the things that we're looking at here  is their strategy of Azure Arc, Azure Stack Hub,  Azure Stack Edge.  Can you tell us a little bit about what all this stuff is?

Start time: 7831.52
End time: 7938.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can try.  We're gonna drop into some consulto babble though.  So we're gonna start talking about,  when you start talking about UCSDs, I'm sort of losing it.  But up until now,  Microsoft has been working with Azure Stack on premise  so that in your own data center,  and you would have,  and that would be an on-ramp to the Azure cloud.  And so it's the old hyper-V,  you've got a group of virtual machines  and on top of it is a controller  that drives the virtual machine.  So it brings your storage and your servers  and your networking altogether-ish sort of thing.  And that's your first step down the road to cloud  is to get into virtualization  and then you could take those virtual machines  into the cloud.  The second stage of cloud infrastructure  has been to transition to containers.  And so we've seen the idea of a container  where a virtual machine will run containers  inside of that on top of the server.  And then it becomes where does the control plane  for the container sit?  So the announcement that Microsoft is saying  is very similar to what Google Anthos has done  and similar to what AWS Outpost has done,  which are the competitive products,  which is instead of putting the control plane  in your data center, use the one in the cloud.  And then Azure Stack in the cloud  will then manage all of the containers in the VMs,  whether they're in Azure's cloud,  whether they're in your Azure Stack on-prem.  So it just becomes very seamless.  It's an attempt to be seamless.  Well, in theory.  In theory, it becomes seamless.  What it also does is it becomes cloud-first.  So where the previous generation of Azure Stack  was in my data center, lots of servers, VMs,  and then I can start moving those VMs into the cloud,  but there's a control where it passes out of my domain  into Azure's domain.  Now the control stack is in Azure for containers,  for the VMs.  And it shifts people's thinking away from on-prem  to cloud-first, which is good for the Azure business.

Start time: 7939.26
End time: 7996.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think that what's interesting is I know that  with AWS we're doing a bunch of stuff right now  where I have this thing I was talking about  has 343 million polygons.  Well, I tried to texture it and it crashed.  You know, it didn't crash.  Well, it did crash my computer.  My little iMac was like, I can't do this.  You know, I'm not built for this.  This is too much.  And so, you know, then I put it on my PC  and it was still not enough RAM.  So now I'm just getting, you know,  but the idea that I was talking to a friend of mine  is we'll just spin up a, you know,  so in AWS we're spinning up.  GPU clusters.  I got four GPUs and 256 megs of RAM with a big,  you know, like whatever.  I just spin that up and just push everything there  and let it cook.  And I'm paying like our subscription  that we were just talking about, except a little bit more.  You know, like, so I think it's like 30 or $40 a day  or something like that.  But the thing just, you know,  but I was able to just create,  because I don't need that computer.  That's an expensive.  Yeah, you don't want to spend $100,000 or whatever.  That's a lot of computer.  And it's a 10 or $20, $30,000 computer that's sitting there.

Start time: 7997.00

End time: 8015.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly.  So instead I just throw it into that, you know,  I'm able to just kind of push it into the cloud  and let it do its thing for the time that I need it.  And then I'm out.  So now, Justine, do you see yourself moving into the cloud?  How much work do you do in the cloud right now?

Start time: 8016.04
End time: 8045.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I do a lot as far as transferring huge files  back and forth for editing.  I mean, we use frame IO a lot  for almost all the editing stuff,  as far as, you know, making changes and edits  and sharing things with clients.  But I'm interested in like cloud computing.  So what Google's doing with Stadia is pretty fascinating.  Just the fact that you can play all of these crazy,  massive, powerful games just in the palm of your hand  is going to be really cool.  So I think for me, cloud computing  is going to be really cool.  So that's going to be something

Start time: 8046.04
End time: 8060.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that I'm definitely looking forward to checking out.  And I agree.  I agree with frame IO.  That's pretty much how we,  that's how you communicate with everybody, you know,  to tie all that stuff together.  It's a great example of, you know,  as a service, you know, really makes sense for, you know,  for a lot of folks.

It's just the hard part is, you know, when I'm traveling,  you know, the wifi in hotels sometimes isn't that great  or when I'm visiting my parents.  So it's having that consistency of connection  is going to be really, really important.

Start time: 8087.32
End time: 8099.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, like that was my trouble with this thing  that I'm working on is I, you know, when I was traveling,  it was hard to put the files onto the virtual machine  because it's, you know, six gigs of photos.  Yes.  So you're like, there's a start process.

Start time: 8100.12
End time: 8116.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, transferring six gigs into the cloud  is a substantial challenge.  But, and that problem probably won't ever go away.  So the network infrastructure that's in the world today  is not iterating at a pace that we need to manage  big pieces of data moving around.  And networking is particularly weird.  In short term.

Start time: 8116.94
End time: 8129.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like, I mean, what I mean by that is  if I have to have it done right now, that's a problem.  If I can, you know, the hard part really is making sure  that the tools allow me to interrupt that upload.  Yeah, and then resume it.  And resume it relatively well.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, this is the problem,  because I'm glad you mentioned Stadia, Justine,  because it's really interesting  because my general vision of Stadia  is that it's probably 10 years away.  So don't get too excited about it.  It needs, I think, last time I checked,  it needs roughly 50 megabits per second  of consistent bandwidth to operate,  to bring the image down at say, 2K, 4K type thing.  And there's just not that much bandwidth in the world.  And it's entirely possible,  according to some of the people I've spoken to,  that there's actually not that much compute  in Google's cloud to be able to do that yet.  So it's a very exciting project,  but it's very early announced.  It's not actually there.  They don't have GPUs in all of their locations.  So it might work around Silicon Valley,  or close to where their cloud infrastructure is,  but if you're outside of that range.

And I actually kind of think that the other side  of that coin is it makes very little sense  to announce these products,  which are so obviously not fit for consumption.  And then people try them and they get unhappy with them,  and then they fail.  Would they be better off?

Transcript:  Oh, yeah, AT&T.  Like, what are you doing?  Well, the worst part is that the worst piece is  that it's not just marketing.  You wish it was just marketing,  but they are switching something  because my performance drops when it goes to 5GE.  And I'm just like, okay,  if you were gonna do the absolute wrong thing,  make sure that my experience is worse  when you switch to the new brand than the old brand.  So what actually happens is,

Transcript:  I don't know if you're interested in this,  but there's a thing called 4.5G,  which is, so 4G LTE,  and then inside the LTE is a thing called LTE Plus,  or an LTE Extra Mode,  which is sort of broadly named 4.5G,  and it activates a bunch of extra frequencies  and signaling rates and the usual sort of,  the way that the 3G, 4G standards work  is the first 3G comes out,  and then there's all these sub-releases  that we don't talk about.  And then four comes out, and it's a major step.  It's actually not even, 4G was a major,  5G is a major step because they stop encoding the IP  into radio packets.  IP actually becomes native on the network.  So the data flow becomes vastly improved and much better.  So true 5G will be a difference.  What happened with AT&T was they relabeled 4.5G, 5G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Which they did the last time too.  I mean, they had whatever they called it,  but it was like, AT&T has a, yeah.  Habit of jumping.  Habit of like, I wanna be first,  and I don't actually wanna put the hardware out there,  or we're working on it, but we're gonna get you excited.

Transcript:  There's only like one phone in the country,  anywhere in the world that can do 5G.  You shouldn't buy it because it only does it  on a certain subset of frequencies  that will never work very well.  You'll never get good 5G.  As long as you're willing to take that 5G phone  and throw it in the bin in about six months  when the next generation 5G runs.  If you wanna be the cool kid on campus that has 5G

Start time: 8340.56
End time: 8345.24

Start time: 8357.98
End time: 8375.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly, because you gotta be within like 250 feet of it.  So it's gonna be.  Yeah.  But now the 5G though, I mean,  I can see the transmitter's getting put up,  even in like the little town that I live in.  You see the little dots going on all the lights  and everything else.  So it won't be just one tower.  It'll be like these little groups of areas

Start time: 8376.20
End time: 8392.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  for the telcos to get into 5G.  Mainly it's to do with the software control of the tower.  So they're shifting away from the legacy idea of hardware,  custom hardware, custom specifics,  to using software-defined radios  and software-defined engines in the tower.  And so that dramatically shifts the way the cost.

Start time: 8392.28

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, doesn't it also allows them to compete  with a terrestrial cable, right?  I mean, because you theoretically could be now,  like a T-Mobile can be competing with a Comcast  because if they can keep that price down,  they can match the same price for that.  I now theoretically have a choice of that 5G distribution  over top of, instead of using the ones  that have had the lock.

Transcript:  Except that substandard is still in the 3GPP forums  and is probably three to five years away  before it'll be ratified.  And then you have to have the spectrum licenses.  You have to go out and buy the spectrum licenses  from the government that you can run that in.  And then you have to have a base station  that you put in on your house that it lets you to do that.  So there's a lot of steps in the middle of that.  Yes, it is potentially exciting.  However, the idea that you'll be able to get  a gigabit per second is fraught with all sorts  of really substantial infrastructure challenges.

Transcript:  I think mostly the average person wouldn't notice anything.  If they had 100 down and 20 up, they'd be like,  well, this is amazing.  You know, like it's not, you know,  until 8K comes out as Justine.  Justine, have you seen actually any true 8K content  on your 8K TV?

Start time: 8467.28
End time: 8493.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They did have some 8K content that was like available  that I could watch on it, but as far as-  Was it like a butterfly?  Yeah, it was mostly like nature.  Yeah, yeah.  It looks amazing.  But I mean, again, I watch a lot of my content on my phone.  So, you know, 8K content for me on my phone  is gonna be, it's not that necessary.  You know, I was like, I think that Sony-  But even looking at like my analytics and stuff  and like on YouTube, it's like most people watch content  on the phones, at least in my audience.

Start time: 8493.82
End time: 8554.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, I was kind of a pooing 8K until I was at NAB  and they showed the Sony booth.  They should just, I have no idea why Sony doesn't show this  at like Best Buy and so on and so forth,  but they had this giant LED wall that was 8K HDR,  120 frames a second, and it literally made me sick.  No, sorry, no, like, because when they moved the camera,  I realized that my brain could no longer process  the difference between reality and what it was looking at.  And so it was like, you're moving the camera,  but I'm not moving.  You know, like, so my inner ear and my eye,  suddenly just the same problem that you have with VR,  except I was looking at a screen.  It was only happened when I walked close enough  to the screen where it got my whole periphery,  that it became this problem.  But I realized that that is the, but of course that,  and I think that that is where we settle.  I think that 8K, 120 frame per second HDR  is where we'll get to that point,  and then we're not gonna really,  other than crazy things,  it won't get any further than that.

Start time: 8555.20
End time: 8580.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, like the LG VR Tv's,  so I have like one of those like in my office,  and it's so crazy because it's right next to two windows,  so it's in the middle.  And when you put like a fake window on it,  you can't even tell that it's not like it's a TV.  Like it just looks like there's a window  in the middle of my windows.  So it's like things are getting so realistic  that when people talk about like video games  and things like that,  like you are actually living in these worlds now,  and it's crazy.

Transcript:  And it'll be interesting.  I really wanted to see,  I don't think I'm gonna end up getting to see it  in one of the Dolby theaters,  but the new Will Smith movie had,  they did it in 4K, 120 frame per second.  And I really wanted to see it in high frame rate,  but it's not, there's only like 10 theaters  in the country that can actually play it.  So yeah, so it's a,  now Microsoft, speaking of movies,  Microsoft stored the entire Superman movie  on a piece of glass.  Why is that important?

Start time: 8614.14
End time: 8639.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, in theory, because it's gonna be able to last.  Yeah, I mean, that's the key.  The thing is, of course, that, you know,  we used to talk about CDs being such and such,  and it turns out they only last 30 to 40 years  before the substrate starts to rot.  And we've got the same problem with magnetic tapes.  You know, you get- And drives.  And drives, magnetic drives.  And so we have this problem with storing it.  And in theory,  because the difference between theory and reality  is often quite substantial,  this should last for quite a while.

Start time: 8643.46
End time: 8651.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When we used to buy silver and gold CDs,  and the silver was the cheap ones  that would only last two to three years,  and the gold ones were meant to last 10 to 15,  and all that sort of stuff, yeah.  Right.

Start time: 8652.64
End time: 8675.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think this is interesting too,  because there's obviously here in Los Angeles,  you know, fires is a huge concern.  So, you know, I've bought fireproof cabinets before,  and I'm like, well, if I'm putting my hard drives in here,  that's not gonna make that much of a difference.  It's fire resistant,  but the heat is still going to melt  whatever's inside of it.  So even having something that's stored in glass,  obviously that would melt at a much higher temperature.  So I think that's pretty great that it, yeah,  will last way longer.

Start time: 8677.02
End time: 8747.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I have a-  We've had to think about it  because the fires didn't get to our house,  but you know, they start-  Last year's fires got within a couple miles.  And so there's been a lot of discussion about that.  And I will say that I-  It got me thinking about that process of,  you know, we have a go case.  You know, like when I did a lot of travel,  there was always a go bag.  You know, so you had a go bag that was always all my,  everything I needed for that thing,  I had to add like three things and I'd be gone.  And literally when I got home,  I would immediately pack that bag.  Like I'd wash all my clothes and pack the bag, you know,  but within hours so that I just was always,  always had a bag that was ready to go.  And so I built this,  or I'm in the process of building out this go case  that is basically if there's a fire  and we have to leave in 15 minutes,  you just grab that one thing.  You know, like it's a copy of all our-  A copy of all the thing.  But one of the things for photos, for instance,  I'm putting, while I'm uploading them to the cloud  and putting them in two different places,  I'm also printing them, you know, on archive photo.  That's a good idea.  You know, just so I have my most important photos,  you know, in that.  But I think that all of us have to think about  the storage stuff because, you know,  I have videos that I no longer have anymore  because I left them on a, you know,  I left them on a CD and then I pulled them out  and they're no longer there.

Start time: 8748.42
End time: 8771.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then the CD's dead.  I think the interesting part here is too,  is I wonder how many people are ready to handle cold data.  So people who do video, like I suspect Justine  and yourself, Alex, is that you are used to storing stuff  and then saying I'm done with that,  lock it away, I'm finished.  But I wonder how many ordinary people  would think about this idea of I copy this to this thing  and that's it, it's written once and I'm done with it,  this cold data idea that I'm storing that forever.

Start time: 8772.00
End time: 8806.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think that there's a lot of times  when you want cold data, you know,  like when we finish it, when we work on a show  and a movie is a perfect example.  You just don't want it to change.  Like we've decided that that's it.  That's the edit.  That's the edit.  It's not like you want all the raw data there  but that final version, you wanna have it,  I just want that done.  I just wanna put it somewhere, you know,  and I think I like the permanency of cutting CDs  back in the day because it was just like,  I knew that if I sent it to a client, it was what it was.  It's not like getting changed or moved around or,  you know, all those other things.  So, I don't know, Justine,  do you think you would store on Glass?

Transcript:  I would love to actually.  I'm ready.  Sign me up.  Just mostly for all of my old things.  Like I wanna have all of that old archived footage.  I have still have a lot of it just all backed up on a server.  And then I also have the Jellyfish server  which is fairly new.  So that's most of my recent stuff in the past two years.  But even that it's like, you can't trust these drives  no matter how many backups of the backups  of the backups you have.  So if you do have something that is like that,  that is way more permanent, like I'm definitely into that.  I think a lot of people would be too.

Start time: 8836.16

Transcript:  Hey, I wanna interrupt one more time.  I'm gonna come back next week and do the show.  Thank you though for filling in.  I really appreciate it.  It's nice for me to take a little time off,  but I will be back next week.  I did wanna come and talk about Mint Mobile  cause I use it and I love it.  And it saves me so much money.  You know how wireless bills are just ridiculous.  If you looked at your bill lately,  it's like, it seems like it goes up every month.  And I know you're paying too much  unless you're using Mint Mobile already.  Network coverage is better than ever.  It doesn't matter which carrier you use.  So why pay more for the same service?  Mint Mobile, they're what we call an MVNO.  They resell T-Mobile service.  So if T-Mobile is great in your neck of the woods,  don't pay, what am I paying for T-Mobile?  70, 80, 90 bucks a month?  Mint Mobile could cut your bill down to 15 bucks a month  for the same premium coverage.  It's not too good to be true.  They save money by not having stores  by doing all the support online.  But you get the same great cell phone service.  I decided, I splurged.  I got, I'm paying a whole 25 bucks a month  for my cell phone service.  Unlimited text and unlimited talking all over the country.  And 12 gigabytes a month,  I never go through all of that, but I thought, why not?  The trick is I paid all up upfront for a year.  So it was $300 for the year,  but that's a year of all of that, 25 bucks a month.  That's it.  300 bucks a year.  You can get it even less, 15 bucks a month  with that special three month introductory plan.  You get unlimited nationwide talk.  You get unlimited text.  You get crazy fast 4G LTE.  They just, they re-imagined how wireless should work  and they pass those savings onto you.  You get to port the number over  if you want to keep your same number, no problem.  And if you're not a hundred percent satisfied,  Mint Mobile has you covered, seven day money back guarantee.  I love Mint Mobile.  Now you can get literally $15 a month,  same exact service you're already getting.  It's their three month introductory plan.  They'll ship you the SIM for free,  put in your existing phone.  They have phones for sale, but just go to the website.  You could check to see if your phone will work.  I'm using my Mint Mobile with a very nice OnePlus 7 Pro.  It's fabulous.  And it just blows me away  that that phone is 25 bucks a month  and my iPhone is a hundred bucks a month.  It just doesn't seem right.  I'm moving everything to Mint Mobile.  You should too.  Mintmobile.com slash twit,  cut your wireless bill to $15 a month  with their three month introductory plan  at mintmobile.com slash twit.  M-I-N-T, Mint, Minty Fresh, Mint,  Mintmobile.com slash twit.  Hey, back to the show and I'll be back next week.  See you then.

Start time: 9031.24
End time: 9104.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've watched a lot actually.  What do you think?  The Morning Show is honestly a really incredible show.  I actually got a press screener,  so I have seen the whole season  and I can tell you it's amazing.  And it's so powerful.  The performances by Reese and Steve Carell  and Jennifer Aniston were just really amazing.  It was such an honest show  and it's pretty daring for them to touch on the subjects  that they touched on, especially in this climate.  But I think it's a show that needed to be out there.  And the reviews were not very good for it.  And I honestly kind of think that the reason is  maybe they were being a little bit too honest  and a lot of the people writing those reviews  didn't like how honest it was.  And I don't know, I think it was incredible.  There's a couple other shows that are coming out later on  that are I think very promising.  The Truth Be Told, it's Octavia Spencer  and she does a crime podcast, which is amazing.  So she's going through, oh my gosh,  I'm blanking on his name.  Aaron Paul from Breaking Bad is also in it.  It's a great show.  They also have The Dickinson Show,  which is kind of like a CW-ish type of show.  I haven't watched that one yet.  I watched a few episodes of C, probably not my favorite,  but the morning show by far has been, I loved it.

Start time: 9106.06
End time: 9120.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I haven't seen C yet,  which I was excited about C and For All Mankind.  The fundamental problem I had was I was promised  that this was gonna be a family affair.  And then as soon as I turned them on,  they were all like MA 14, MA whatever.  And I'm like.

Start time: 9121.52

Start time: 9123.92
End time: 9136.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and I was all excited to watch them  and then I saw all these MA, MA, MA  and I was like, what the?  So I was on the opposite side of that  where I really was excited about finally a platform  that is just gonna play a bunch of stuff  that I can actually watch with my family.  That's what I thought too.

Start time: 9137.48
End time: 9164.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and then even watching C, that first episode,  I was like, oh my gosh,  I hope there's no children watching this episode.  But even the morning show, definitely,  the language and everything was definitely way more mature.  But I think it was The Helpsters,  which is like the Sesame Street show.  I haven't watched that yet,  but there's also another one, Ghostwriter,  when I was growing up, that was one of my favorite shows.  So I'm glad to see that kind of get a reboot.  But I spent way more time watching Apple TV  than I thought I was going to.

Start time: 9165.22
End time: 9184.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I haven't, because of that, the vast majority,  as when you have a family,  the vast majority of my viewing habits  relate to what we all watch together.  So I haven't had as much time to watch through it.  My wife tried to watch C  and I think she got through about the first 20 minutes.  She said, I watched 10 minutes and I walked away,  and then I came back and watched another 20 minutes,  and she's like, okay, I'm done.

Start time: 9185.62
End time: 9186.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think we did the same thing.

Start time: 9187.56
End time: 9195.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just, I think it was trailer.  We're just too bad,  because the rumor is they spent the same amount of money.  I mean, they spent a lot of money on that show.  Yeah, yeah.

Start time: 9195.98
End time: 9231.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I did start watching For All Mankind,  which is a cool concept.  It's basically like, okay, what if Russia landed on the moon  instead of the US?  Which, I mean,  something that I've definitely never thought about,  but I think it's a cool concept.  I think they also renewed that for the second season.  They also renewed C for a second season,  which I'm not sure how that's gonna go, but whatever.  I mean, Jason Momoa was great.  And The Morning Show also has a second season.  And I think Dickinson as well.  And it's cool, though,  a lot of people were complaining about the price,  but if you buy an iPhone,  you're gonna get a whole year of this for free  or any Apple products.  So I think that's,  essentially you're getting a free year  of the service anyway.

So it's- Disney Plus did?  Yes.  So it started at Snow White  and then like for,  it took them hours to tweet through every single  500 plus things that will be on the show.  It was an amazing event.

Start time: 9325.80
End time: 9342.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So here's the question.  Here's the question.  And Greg, I'm gonna come to you with the same question,  but for Justine,  eventually we're gonna have to make a choice.  Like, well, maybe we don't.  I mean, you spend as much money as you spend on cable  and you end up with all of them, right?  But if you're gonna choose, let's say five services,  what are the services that you choose?

Start time: 9344.84
End time: 9363.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, are we talking like music streaming as well?  No, no, just video, just video.  Okay.  I mean, I do watch Netflix,  but I also have five people under my account.  So I am now responsible for five other people's accounts,  so I can never get rid of Netflix.  So probably I would say Netflix.  And then with Disney+, do you also get Hulu, correct?

Start time: 9364.40
End time: 9373.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Incorrect.  They have a service where you can get Disney+, Hulu,  and ESPN+, for I believe $15 a month.

Start time: 9374.62
End time: 9402.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, so it's like a package deal.  So I mean, I think that's one of the things  where you find the best package deals.  So I mean, that's pretty interesting  because I also have Hulu.  So if I get Disney+, I can also package that in.  I think just a lot of people kind of hop services.  They watch a bunch of shows one month on Netflix  or for a few months, switch to Hulu, cancel that,  and kind of just hop back and forth.  I mean, I think that's an option,  but I wonder if there's a way to package these things in  to give you a better lower price if you stay longer.

Start time: 9403.60
End time: 9493.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not sure.  Yeah, well, I mean, I'm not smart enough to package it.  Like, I mean, to jump in and out.  I mean, I just have the subscriptions.  For me, I have, my wife likes a lot of the competition shows  so you think you can dance and stuff like that.  So we have Hulu mostly to take care of her  wanting to watch those shows.  I watch for broadcast research primarily.  I don't think I'd pay for it otherwise,  but I have YouTube TV because it is the,  if you're researching broadcasters  and you're researching graphics  and you're researching stuff like that,  for me, being able to DVR just everything,  I just go down, I just want to DVR all the shows.  And then I go back and I can collect them.  I don't know, again,  I don't think I watch enough broadcast TV  to justify $50 a month if I didn't do that.  Apple TV, I think, is a given for me.  Disney is kind of a given for me.  Netflix is, I have a hard time,  my wife's funny, she's like,  why are we still paying for Netflix?  Like, she doesn't,  I don't know when the last time she's watched any Netflix.  I think it was the last Jim Gaffigan thing  was the last time she saw it.  But, and then Amazon Prime just comes  with your Amazon Prime, so you don't think about that one.  That one's kind of like, just comes packaged.  And I guess, I kind of feel like,  I wonder if Apple's just going to keep on doing that  where as long as you keep on buying Apple products,  you never actually pay for it,  but then they account for it as a subscription.  Because I don't think,  I don't think that's how it's going to be accounted for.  I think that they're going to account for it.  You bought the subscription  and you paid less for your phone.  What, go ahead.

Transcript:  So it's like, I also have Apple Arcade  and then Apple News and Apple Music.  So at this point, Apple is.  How do you like Apple Arcade?  It's cool.  I mean, I think it's fun just mostly  because you can download the games  and you don't have to worry about having a connection,  which is what you run into with every other game.  And they also have so many in-app purchases.  So that free game that you purchased,  you've just spent $500 on extra credits.  So having just that subscription base  to know that I'm not going to be tricked  into having to pay little extras is really great.

Transcript:  Well, I get Amazon Prime.  Right.  I don't watch it because there's nothing in it.  It's in the UK.  Very different packaging and very different content.  Right?  Netflix is almost identical to what it is here.  Oh no, it varies quite substantially.  There's a lot of shows that you get here  that we don't get in the UK version.  I get Netflix, but I only get it from my wife  and my daughters, not so much for me.  And then we get free access to the local TV channels  in the UK, which are actually quite good.  Unlike the US, where a lot of the free-to-air stuff  is less than excellent, shall we say.  Then, and so most people feel that paying  for cable subscriptions or whatever is worthwhile.  So that's it.  I'm not probably not gonna pay for anything else.  I wouldn't watch anything that Disney puts out.  I'm kind of done with Marvel and superhero movies.

Transcript:  It's for me, it's travel.  And then family.  Yeah, exactly.  When I, I remember there was some quarterly report  where Netflix said we don't see any possibility  that we're gonna let people download the videos.  I remember that.  That was like four or five years ago.  They were like, nope, never gonna happen.  And now 90% of what I watch on Netflix  is because I download it and I watch it on a plane.

Start time: 9644.62
End time: 9656.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, see, I just don't watch video at all.  I don't watch, I do watch occasionally,  but it's like, if I watched a video  for two or three hours a week,  that would be big week on TV consumption for me.

Start time: 9657.06
End time: 9678.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I also feel like I have to just to be updated  on like what people are talking about.  And I mean, I love superhero movies.  So the whole Marvel universe,  I mean, having that on Netflix was amazing.  Like all of the extra seasons that they do  of shows like Daredevil, so great.  So like those types of things.  I love that it's just expanding that universe  and going further into it.  So I'm excited for whatever Disney Plus does next.

Start time: 9678.62
End time: 9683.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that the number one thing I'm interested in  for Disney is Mandalorian.

Start time: 9684.64
End time: 9697.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, that's gonna be incredible.  Like, can we just like release all of these at the same time?  Because I like that just mass consumption  of just doing nothing for a day  and making up for it the next day.  I'm excited.  I'm just like, what's up?  What's up?  What's up?

Start time: 9697.36
End time: 9745.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It gets us back to where we're used to rent.  I remember when we, I always stayed behind  for a long time with like 24.  And we'd watch three or four of them at a time at night.  And in a lot of ways, a lot of times  it's much easier to keep track of,  keep track of what's happening.  Like a whole week up,  you know, like it's this whole week apart  is just this really hard thing to manage now  because you're used to just watching all the episodes  all one after the other.  And so it's, I like to better,  I think I enjoyed Game of Thrones better.  Well, I enjoyed better in the early seasons period.  But anyway, not that I'm bitter about how it ended.  Sorry, I just, I'm not.  You didn't see it.  So you don't, you didn't have to deal with the,  the horribleness of the last season.  I'm sorry.  I'm a struggle.  Do you feel the same way, Justine?

Start time: 9746.16
End time: 9759.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, so it's weird.  I watched a few seasons of Game of Thrones  and then I just like stopped watching it.  And then I watched like the last, I guess the last season.  So I miss maybe like the first seasons in between.  So there's-  You miss the work that we did,

Start time: 9759.78
End time: 9805.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the work that we did as viewers for, you know,  trying to keep track of all the pieces.  And you got to, the worst part was,  is my wife and I got into this thing on the last season  because we were so excited about the last season  that we were watching between each episode  in the last season, we were watching the old ones.  So we were watching Game of Thrones  like one or two every night, you know,  to get, to make sure that we totally understood  all the bits and pieces.  I think that made it worse  because the bad writing became much, much,  it was in technicolor, you know, like, you know,  like of what the, of the, of how bad it had gotten.  So anyway, but one thing we didn't list,  which I think is partially the fault of that show is HBO.  I'm not interested.  Are you, are you going to subscribe to HBO, Justine?

Start time: 9805.54
End time: 9817.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I think I get it  because I actually do still have cable for some reason,  because it was actually cheaper for me to keep cable  than to get rid of cable to keep my internet.  So I just kept it.  So I think I still have HBO as a package.

Start time: 9817.10
End time: 9821.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You will not get HBO Max.  But you won't, but you're not going to subscribe  to the online version for your phone or whatever.

Start time: 9821.90
End time: 9830.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think so.  I mean, I think I still actually can have access to it  through my phone, but I think HBO Max is something specific.  Right, right, right, yeah.  Do you have, is there different content  than if I have HBO Go?

Start time: 9831.06
End time: 9840.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, there is content that available to you on HBO Max  that will not be available to you on HBO Go,  even though you pay the same amount of money.

Start time: 9841.42
End time: 9857.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I gotta draw a line, because honestly,  I don't have time to do all of this watching  when it's like, I end up getting into that mode  of like, all you want to do is watch content.  But there's just so much.  So it's like, how do you figure out,  where do you draw the line?  And you're talking about YouTube TV,  which is actually really great too.  I love the DVR feature.

Start time: 9857.92
End time: 9895.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's my favorite part of the whole thing.  I mean, that's why I have YouTube TV is,  is specifically because of the DVR feature,  like I'm gonna be able to go back  and probably watch the Stealer game after this,  because we missed it, because we were doing the show.  So that's a good example.  But I think that HBO really is paying a price  for how Game of Thrones turned out.  Like in this rollout, I actually think  that there's a lot of people that are bummed.  You know about that, and I think it actually affected.  I know right after Game of Thrones, I canceled HBO.

Start time: 9896.36
End time: 9899.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wasn't it supposed to be like another Game of Thrones show  that they ended up canceling?

Start time: 9899.56
End time: 9905.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There was three.  There were two, were there three?  There's gonna be, there's three

Start time: 9906.04
End time: 9929.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and one has been canceled already.  Okay.  But there's supposed to be two  that are still in pre-production, I think.  But they're still trying to work them out.  And I think they have to really figure out  how to make sure that they come out well.  They ended so badly.  And a lot of it had to do with showrunners  that didn't want to invest in.

Start time: 9929.28
End time: 9942.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think it would have made too much difference  how badly it ended.  I think that had an impact.  But I suspect that the show was so bad  that more people quit than would have otherwise.  But I suspect a lot of people were only subscribed  to HBO for Game of Thrones anyway.

Start time: 9942.52
End time: 9979.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think there's two things there.  One is that they should have had three more seasons.  Because they tried to pack three seasons into one.  And I think it a lot had to do with the showrunners  didn't want to do this any longer,  because they didn't know what they were doing.  And I think that if you watch it,  they're just a slow trail off since season five,  six, seven, eight, all just slowly fell apart.  Because they didn't think about it that way.  And they're showrunners.  They're not Martin.  And so I think that that was part of the problem.  And then the second problem was  they didn't have something to come right after it.  They didn't have another big show.  Another Game of Thrones.  That was, this is something.

Transcript:  That's what Avengers Endgame felt like to me.  I was watching Avengers Endgame  in the back of the plane seat.  Because I didn't see it when it came out.  And I was watching the actors.  And the actors just all seemed bored.  And it was just, I was watching.  I thought I was pretty darn good myself.  I was like,  it was a couple of times I had to pause  because somebody was going through  and I was watching and the actors in the back  kind of like going,  I didn't see that.  I just was, I found it incredibly tedious  by about 90 minutes in going like,  really is it not finished yet?  I loved it.

Start time: 10009.15
End time: 10011.34

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought, well and I think that this speaks to  Disney's power in this area.  Is that  MCU was an incredibly well designed system.  Oh yes.  You know, a system of individual video,  individual movies as well as group movies.  And you know, it'll be interesting to see  if they can do that again.  Because they haven't done it very well  with Star Wars in my opinion.  I mean, it's done okay.  But I think that, you know, I think that  they've had a bunch of missteps in that area.  So it's not like the whole company has a model that works.  It just happened to be that Avengers, you know,  they were able to figure that out.  And I think that they've been able to keep.

Start time: 10052.36
End time: 10089.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The comic books would put characters together  and take them apart and put characters together  and take them apart.  So they had a template to work off.  And they could see, and so much of the,  that whole MCU thing is predicated on comic book stories  and existing, you know, stories, you know,  product that had worked.  And they just had to re-spin it and bring it back.  So I think that, and the audience itself had adapted to that.  They were expecting Spider-Man to appear with Iron Man  and then disappear again, right?  So there was that.  But I don't know, Avengers Endgame just felt like  it was on entirely predictable train tracks to me.  And it was just like.  Oh, but I loved that train.  Yeah, it was a great train.

Transcript:  I mean, it definitely was very, very long.  And I watched it.  I made a mistake of going to like the 11 p.m. showing.  So by the end, I was like, oh, I love this so much,  but I'm so tired.  So it was, I was like, oh gosh, it's so long.  But I mean, it was, it's great.  It was something that I think, you know,  being a fan of the franchise and the characters,  I think it gave everybody, you know, like I said,  like the closure that everyone needed.

Start time: 10119.98
End time: 10152.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  All right, well, one last thing to make sure  that everyone knows,  because I think it's important that people know  that this is available.  Amazon Prime memberships for Veterans Day,  to celebrate Veterans Day.  Amazon Prime is discounting prime subscriptions  for veterans by $40, which I think is a great move.  I think that every major company should provide veterans  with specific benefits for their service.  And so I think it's really important  that we make sure that Amazon gets the-  Kudos from that. Kudos, kudos for that.  You know, I think that that's- That's really great.  Yeah. Yeah.

Start time: 10153.38
End time: 10165.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So- And anybody else who thinks they can try  and get a free ride, don't.  Don't screw it up for everybody else.  Yeah, yeah.  If it just requires you to get up and say,  I'm a veteran or something, don't screw it up.  Just- Yeah.

Start time: 10165.85
End time: 10181.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  But definitely I think that more companies,  you know, and a lot of companies do.  And so I just think it's important  that we always make sure that it's clear  that they're doing something they don't have to do  and they're making that available.  So anyway, thanks to Amazon for that.  Justine, where can people find you on the web?

We recorded green screen stuff at your studio years ago.  And it's crazy that that all came back around.  And I also recently did a Final Cut training with them.
