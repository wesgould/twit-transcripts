Transcript:  I want to send my son Hank down there to apprentice with Chef, because Hank, as you know,  is a Twitter chef, which is not quite the same as a real world chef, and I thought it'd be great if  he could go down and sit by. He wants to do that sometimes. I would love to arrange that,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  apprentice with. That'd be amazing. That is wonderful. I appreciate that. Thank you.  Also with us, Larry Maggott, who has quite the tale to tell this week,  president and CEO of ConnectSafely.org, another radio refugee. Hi Larry, good to see you.  Good to see you, Leo, and everybody. And the man who elected me president of the internet,  my good friend Jason Heiner, formerly of Tech Republic. He's now editor-in-chief of all of  ZDNet. Hi Jason. Hey, great to be here, Leo. Always a pleasure.  So nice. Always nice to see you. This is a great time to have kind of,  I like to do at the end of the year, kind of bring together people I know and love and have known for  years, and we get to talk about the tech news. And God, I was hoping we wouldn't have to talk  about Elon Musk. I was praying. This'll be quick. By the way, Elon has inadvertently created a new  hero in the world, John Mastodon. So Elon yesterday banned any mention of Mastodon. You can't link to  it. In fact, when you try to link to it, you'll get on Twitter, you'll get, oh, this site is  malicious and dangerous, which it's not. Mastodon has 5,000 social networks. Many Twitter refugees  have fled to Mastodon. We've been running a Mastodon since 2019. We're one of the Mastodons  that is blocked. But there was an article, somebody wrote an article that misunderstood,  because one of the Twitter handles blocked was join Mastodon. And somehow, some editorial writer  thought it was John Mastodon and even said the founder of a competing social network has been  banned. And ever since, everybody on Mastodon has taken up the charge for John Mastodon.  There are John Mastodon accounts. There's a whole legend of John Mastodon now. It's exactly how the  internet should respond to an infection like what's happening over on Twitter. I just saw that  now Elon has banned Paul Graham for mentioning his Mastodon account. Paul, ironically, a venture  capitalist, founder of Y Combinator, very well known in the community, beloved in the community,  and somebody who had been supporting Elon all this time. Now he's banned. Taylor Lawrence banned,  not much of a surprise, along with many, many other journalists. I'll be honest with you,  maybe Mike, because you're a journalist, you can tell me I'm wrong, but who the hell cares  if Twitter bans journalists? Elon has now firmly shown this is his plaything. This is his crib.  He has the right and legal right to do whatever he wants. For the EU to weigh in is complete  nonsense. For journalists to whine is complete nonsense. The writing is on the wall. This is  his Twitter. Move on, right or no? Well, move on, yes. To beg to get reinstated is ridiculous.

Start time: 434.30
End time: 479.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Journalists, whether they have been banned or not, or reinstated or not, should care because many of  us have been cultivating audiences and readership on Twitter, in my case, since 2007. Almost every  day, almost all day. Now all of a sudden, he's explicitly said that people have to start building  credibility on the platform. Yes, it's his legally. He owns it, but our relationships are not his.  The connections we have with our readership are not his. It's really a bummer to start over on  another platform when so many of us have invested so much in this platform. I'm not completely immune

Start time: 479.52
End time: 495.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to that. I have a half million, more than a half million followers on Twitter, but I have no problem  leaving it. That was the mistake, perhaps, is to say Twitter is ours. It's our relationships.  Guess what? It never was. Maybe it looked like it was. Jason, how do you feel about this? You're also

Start time: 495.26
End time: 559.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  a journalist, obviously. All three of you are. Yeah. I will say that Twitter was by far the  platform that I was most engaged in for the longest time. Really in 2018, I pulled back from  all social media when it became pretty clear that there wasn't as much value. It was very toxic.  And so to be upfront, I have spent less and less time there. And it has been clear that Twitter  itself was a little bit lost in the wilderness trying to find its way. And now it really is sad  to see what's happening because I think one of the things that is easy to forget about Twitter  is that however you felt about Facebook, Facebook became a much more valuable company.  Instagram became a rocket ship. TikTok, the new rocket ship. Twitter always still had  some very strong brand value among journalists, among celebrities. Chiefly among those, though.

Start time: 560.32
End time: 564.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right? I mean, normal people didn't. It had no brand at all.

Start time: 565.08
End time: 608.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For sure. But I'd say among people who were doing, like Mike said, cultivating audiences,  it had a very high brand value. And in a matter of 12 months, almost all that brand value has  been destroyed. And that's a significant, significant destruction of value that is going  to be very difficult to reestablish because the old saying goes that trust comes in on foot and  it goes out on horseback. It takes so long to build and it takes so short of an amount of time  to get rid of it. And my feeling is that Twitter, for me and most of other people,  it's really lost a lot of trust. It's going to be very difficult to reestablish.

Start time: 609.56
End time: 656.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, Elon owns it, but I think your point, Jason, is fair. I mean, it's not exactly a public  utility, I admit, but it has that flavor in the sense that we all use it or have used it.  We all have depended on it. I mean, it's the first thing I think about. I've got something to say. I  want to get it out there right away. You know, what other platform do any of us have, you know,  that we can get right out? Maybe you guys do, VDNet perhaps, but where you can, you know,  three in the morning, you get an idea, you want to say something and you can say it.  He is taking something away from all of us. Does he have the legal right to do it? Yes.  Does he have the moral right to do it? Maybe not. And should he have the legal right to do it?  That's actually, I guess the answer is still yes, but I think it's worth debating about.

Start time: 656.58
End time: 729.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it was, well, yeah, I mean, I guess it's, I think we've should, this is a lesson we should  have learned a long time ago, that these giant corporate owned public forums are not ours and  they never have been ours. Mark Zuckerberg's completely in control of Facebook, Instagram,  completely in control of it. And things happen all the time there. And it has been in their  interest all this time to cultivate you content creators to say, yeah, come on, create your content.  YouTube is going to be the same way, but at the, ultimately they control it and it's a mistake to  believe you do. And what an opportunity I think we have to learn here to stay away from these  centralized platforms. I see so many people, so many journalists making the same mistake,  migrating to post, which is owned by Mark Andreessen, which has in its policies, you may not  bad mouth billionaires. It's clearly the wrong place to go. It's the same lesson. And some people  have not learned it. There is, I mean, this is one of the reasons why you think Elon is so threatened  by Mastodon. Mastodon is completely decentralized. No one controls it. You know, it's funny. A lot of

Start time: 729.34
End time: 740.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  companies no longer give out their web address. They give out their Facebook page or their Twitter  handle. I mean, I mean, technically my website is hosted by somebody, but I do own it.  And I have complete control over it.

Start time: 741.10
End time: 766.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So maybe we go a little bit back to the, you know, there was a reason why for years people  like Kevin Marks and the IndieWeb folks have been saying, you need to own, I've been saying this,  I've been saying this to teenagers. You need to own your presence on the web. You cannot let  Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, Twitter, Snapchat, tell people who you are. You need to  do that. You need to have your own website. Is that asking too much of people?

Start time: 767.22
End time: 788.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think it's asking too much, but I would encourage everyone who does own their own website  to do what I did this afternoon, which is to remove Twitter from, almost every website has a Twitter,  like go see us on Twitter. We should all remove that because Twitter has basically decided that  they're not going to provide free publicity to other social networks. So why should we provide

Start time: 788.82
End time: 818.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  free publicity for Twitter? Absolutely. I took Twitter off ages ago. If you go to my website,  you'll see two links, a Mastodon link and an email link. And that's it. Used to be, and this  software allows for Facebook, Snapchat, TikTok, Twitter, but yeah, that's a lesson we should  learn. We should take with us. If you don't own it in the sense that you control what's on that  platform, you're always at risk. And I think we're going to learn that about YouTube as well

Start time: 819.34
End time: 931.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  in the long run. And I think the future is the reason that these platforms, Web 2.0, centralized  a lot of control, right? And what happens with central, this is in all of human history,  what happens is when resources get centralized, then a very small number of people extract all  the value, right? It makes billionaires out of people, a very few number, and then everybody else  is left sort of fighting for the scraps. And so we've seen this time and time again.  I do feel like, and it is somewhat of a utopian vision, but I think we are on the direction  toward this future of federated identity. This is what Web 3.0 is trying to solve,  which is trying to create this federated identity using the blockchain for each of us to be a node  and have a node that is not controlled. We control what information and private information we give  to anyone we interact with. It is putting more of an onus on users, but I think that the users  who are, call it 35 and under, they have this innate comfort with these platforms and with  technology in the ways that they aren't scared away from this kind of idea. And so I do think  it's not an easy road and it's not going to happen in 2022 or 2023, but I think we are on  the road to a place where we have federated identity and Web 3.0, whatever you want to call  it, blockchain-based internet that will fundamentally change the way that these things  are built. And we're not going to fall for the sort of the promises that we did in Web 2.0 that  essentially centralized a lot of value in a few hands and they extracted all of the value

Start time: 932.14
End time: 1001.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and then we are left with what? Not much. The only thing I disagree with you on is the  blockchain Web 3 thing because that's owned by Andreessen Horowitz. That's just as bad as  anything else. But the idea, the notion of decentralized, Tim Berners-Lee, the promises  is so geeky at this point. But Tim Berners-Lee has been promoting this with his solid project,  solidproject.org. The idea of using web standards, he's the guy who invented the  World Wide Web, he's at the World Wide Web Consortium, using web standards to allow  people to control their data, control their privacy, control who they are on the internet.  This is, to me, this is a huge opportunity. If fencer capitalists weren't so goddamn greedy  and if it weren't dominated by billionaires who hate the idea of people controlling their destiny,  this would already have happened. Somebody needs to step forward and make this possible.  Gargron has done that with Mastodon but that's just one tiny bit of a much larger ecosystem  that could be created where you own your identity and you control it. I think that we need to make  this easy for everybody because otherwise they'll just keep falling into the Twitter trap.

Start time: 1002.52
End time: 1022.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the Fediverse seems to me to be perfectly unstoppable. That's the irony. Elon can't buy it,  no one can buy it. No one can buy it and you can see how it's already subsuming old brands like  Tumblr and Whatsapp, Photoflicker and so on. Tumblr has joined the activity pub which means

Start time: 1023.06
End time: 1035.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tumblr will be a peer on the Fediverse which means you could have your presence on Tumblr,  for instance, and participate in the Fediverse. Absolutely. You could even imagine a future

Start time: 1035.16
End time: 1045.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  because obviously Elon Musk is destroying Twitter and it's going to be a shell of its former self  in pretty short order. You can imagine it changing hands and then itself becoming part of the Fediverse

Start time: 1046.10
End time: 1055.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  post Elon Musk. Yeah. Well, you know, it's interesting. You talk about the town square,  right? The analogy of Twitter like the town square but the town square is truly public property.

Start time: 1055.78
End time: 1061.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, that's the problem. That's why Twitter, which was by kind of de facto town square, isn't

Start time: 1061.94
End time: 1092.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  truly the town square. No, it isn't. And nor is Facebook for that matter. Any privately owned  property is not a town square. By definition almost, it's public property. It's the municipal  place that every citizen of that community owns. And could you imagine if in order for,  Leo, you and I to decide we wanted to hang out together, we somehow had to get permission from  some billionaires so we could talk to each other? One of the things perhaps that's slowing the Fediverse

Start time: 1092.26
End time: 1195.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  down is it's kind of built in antipathy toward brands and businesses. It is a little bit of a  socialist empire. I think brands are starting to show up on Mastodon. Change. News brands should  be on Mastodon. A lot have. ProPublica is there. There's journa.host where a lot of journalists  who are refugees from Twitter are going. This all began, which probably should say, although I imagine  you all know, when Elon claims, and by the way, there's no support for this claim, but claims  that his car containing his child X was jumped in Los Angeles and that the reason it was jumped is  because Jack Sweeney, who's a college student in Florida, has been posting the Jets location,  Elon's jet location, along with many others, by creating a bot that republishes the ADSB  database. This database is created by airline enthusiasts who have little raspberry pies.  I thought it was an official database. It's not. Your tail number is public and you have a transponder  on the plane that is necessary so that people know who you are as you fly around, but these  enthusiasts have been using raspberry pies on the ground to gather information about what's flying  overhead and post it to this ADSB database. There isn't a central public database for airplane  location, but ADSB exchange exists so that people can upload and that information is really there.  It's kind of like OpenStreetMap. This is the biggest of the exchanges, but there are many others.

Start time: 1198.02
End time: 1265.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is open source intelligence. They're public information. Planes are required by law to  broadcast their exact location every three seconds. It's illegal to keep the location of an airplane  secret. What's funny to me is that Elon Musk is, until recently, the world's richest person. He's  obviously a public figure. He's somebody who would be the target of maybe foreign spies or  stalkers and paparazzi and so on. Somebody like that has to hire security, do whatever they have  to do to protect themselves. He also has the option, if the location of his airplane is a  security risk, to not own an airplane, fly in another kind of airplane, airlines, even for  executives exists all the time and nobody knows which individual executive is in what plane.  He's got a bunch of things that he can do to protect his family. I think he absolutely should

Start time: 1266.22
End time: 1361.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  protect his family. Including, by the way, not owning his private jet, but leasing it from a  company so that no one would know he was on that plane. There are things he can do, but he never  liked Jack Sweeney's Elon Tracker account. Jack tracks everybody else too, including Jeff Bezos.  He never liked it. Always complained about it. At one point, it was said, offered $5,000 to the kid  to take it down. The kid said he never received that offer. By the time he asked for it, Elon said,  no. Once Elon owned Twitter, he said, I'll never take it down, but that was just a matter of time  before he took it down. What he did, which was a little shocking, I think, to journalists who  thought somehow they had a right to be on Twitter, he took down any journalist who mentioned the  existence of this Elon's jet account or that it had moved to Mastodon. They mentioned it not even  on Twitter. They mentioned it in a news article, in the New York Times, in The Voice of America,  and everywhere else, in CNN. He banned them. Some of them, I think are coming back, he had a poll.  He loves these polls, which apparently is, as far as I could tell, the stupidest thing ever,  because anybody can vote in these polls, including the Russian GRU and the internet  troll factories. Anyway, he had a poll and said, should I bring him back in seven days?  I don't remember what the answer was, but I think he's reinstated some. But who cares? This, to me,  is all you need to hear. Goodbye, Twitter. I don't understand why brands are still on Twitter.

End time: 1366.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I really don't. You know the story about what happened to me on Monday night.

Start time: 1366.44
End time: 1378.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What happened to you? Oh, actually, let's get into this. You, through connectsafely.org, which you run,  were a member of the Twitter Safety Advisory Council, right?

Start time: 1378.28
End time: 1459.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's correct. Since 2016, I was actually a charter member. We used to have meetings and we  would give them advice and we would test out some of their safety-related products and product  changes and had productive conversations. They didn't listen to everything we had to say.  We were not a decision-making body, which is very clear. And the other thing that's very important  is we were divided into committees. So, for example, some of my colleagues on the board  have been trolled, allegedly, for participating in child pornography because they didn't proactively  do anything to take down alleged child porn on Twitter. But the fact is that none of these  people were actually even on that committee. The people who were on the committee that dealt  with child pornography were the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, Thorn Foundation,  and other world-renowned experts in that particular field. I am not a world-renowned expert when it  comes to child pornography, but we are somebody who advises on things like harassment, cyberbullying,  stalking, and all of those other things. And you were volunteers, right?  Yeah, we weren't paid. And Twitter, actually, even though we put them down as a contributor,  the only money they gave Connect Safely was they gave us some advertising revenue,  which is significant, advertising inventory. So, you know, we could do ad-free advertising  on Twitter. So that was significant. But other than that, they weren't one of our  more generous sponsors. And we're very public, by the way. We get money from Meta and Google  and all these other companies. So we don't hide that.

Start time: 1461.02

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When Elon bought Twitter end of November, did anything change in that relationship?

Start time: 1466.58
End time: 1502.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, we never heard from them. Well, the only thing changed is we stopped hearing from them.  And I had just about decided...  Did you still get the ad inventory?  Well, they didn't take it away, as far as I know. It's still there. They'd already given it to us.  So I suppose it's in our account.  Should advertise Macedon.  Yeah, I would get that.  Oh, you'd be taking that immediately.  Oh, really? So anyway, I happened to be in Washington, DC at a Meta safety summit that  I was speaking at. And eight o'clock comes along and we're having dinner with the Meta folks. And  I say, I have to excuse myself. I've got to go do this Twitter thing. And everybody sort of  chuckles. And I was a zoom, a zoom call that...

Start time: 1502.96
End time: 1505.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, zoom or something like that.  Advisory group was going to be on.

Start time: 1505.86
End time: 1560.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. So I'm walking down the streets of Washington, DC, on my phone, I dial in,  you know, through zoom and nobody's there. And I said, maybe I got the wrong link.  So I go search my email and there's an email saying, thank you very much for your service.  We no longer need you. And there's no more safety advisory board. So this board that...  And what's interesting about it is that this meeting that was supposed to happen Monday  was hastily called after some of my colleagues had resigned. A couple of people resigned last  week or the week before. They hastily called the meeting and they escalated it to bring in some of  their more senior people. I don't know if Elan was supposed to be on the call, but some of their more  senior people were going to be on, much more senior than we usually get on our calls. But then they  just abruptly ended. So clearly they don't want to hear from us. They don't want our advice.  I was probably going to resign anyway after the meeting. I wanted to hear what they had to say,  but now Elan can say, you can't quit. I fired you. So, you know, I'm no longer on the board.

Start time: 1561.12
End time: 1590.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is no more board. Elan had also promised to create a moderation board to determine who  should be brought back to the site and who should be banned. And that board never happened. There  was nothing to do and he's making all choices at this time. So, okay, I mean, there's, you know,  I guess my attitude, it was easy for me because I abandoned Twitter in my mind months ago.

Start time: 1590.92
End time: 1600.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I mean, it was essentially no point in having a board to advise a company that's run by a guy  that doesn't want to listen to anybody's advice. That's what Elan Roth, who was head of trust and

Start time: 1600.46
End time: 1605.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  safety said when he left. And then of course, Elan some weeks later started to slime him

Start time: 1606.66
End time: 1631.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  with false accusations. A couple of my colleagues got slammed. I don't know if you remember this  guy, some alt-right guy with a million followers slammed a couple of my colleagues on the board.  And then Elan retweeted it. And again, blaming them for child pornography. I mean, come on,  that's like QAnon crap. That's about as low as you could get to accuse somebody of having anything  to do with child pornography who's completely innocent of that charge. I mean, it's a horrible

Start time: 1632.06
End time: 1636.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

If somebody wants to buy something and burn it,  that's their prerogative. It strikes me that he right now likes the power that it gives him  to wield these troll armies against whoever he feels like it. He's always felt that way,  I think. He did that with Dogecoin, remember? It was a magician's trick. He waved his hand and  Doge went up. Then he waved his hand and Doge went down. You experience that once and you go,  that's pretty cool. You want to do it more. I feel like that's what Elan's doing now. I feel like  anybody who continues on Twitter is merely sharpening that sword for Mr. Musk. But you've  seen what has done to Tesla. I think that's a big mistake. Well, he's going to pay the price,  but he can afford it. We'll sort millions of stockholders. Yeah. Well, maybe you should have  thought twice about buying stock in Tesla. Maybe so. I think it's pretty clear that Tesla is not  being run at all right now. I think Tesla shareholders are suing over that as well.

It occurs to me because of the fact that  this car can be controlled remotely, that a madman is capable of driving me into a cliff. I'm not  suggesting he would do that. But it does concern me that having somebody like Elon Musk technically  can control the car that I drive. It makes me think twice about whether I want to keep that car.

Transcript:  The larger story to me, and it's more a political story than a tech story, although tech really  becomes weaponized in this story, is that authoritarians and the very rich have formed an  alliance, maybe some cases the very rich are becoming authoritarian. We as the people have  really got to be careful now because these tools are extremely powerful. An authoritarian-wielding  Twitter, we know this, can have immense power, but that's only if we give it to them. I think as  normal people, we've got to remember you're just helping an authoritarian. It's time to stop helping  authoritarians. They're not acting in our interest. That's more political probably than technical,  but it is the case. Anything else you want to say about this sad person and what's  sadly happening to Twitter, which was a pretty cool thing at one point? I guess it's over.

Transcript:  What's the vision? I think it's clear that, well, what is clear is that there isn't necessarily  one. But the thing that is interesting is I believe it was at least in the last six months,  maybe 18 months, I do remember Jack Dorsey saying, having a bit of a retrospective,  knowing the direction that Twitter had gone and saying, the mistake we made was going public.  Once we went public and then we had to create revenue to get the advertising dollars to  be a growth company and to get investors. That's when remember, and I'm sure you all  remember this, when they banned all of the API, they closed down the API because  Twitter was originally a bit more decentralized like we were talking about.  It was really evolving quite powerfully. The beginning of the end was, from my perspective,  was when they shut off the API, they went public, they put all of their focus on advertising.  I said that, I believe I've said that in columns in the past. It was about, like I said, somewhere  between like six, 12, 18 months ago, then Jack Dorsey essentially said, that's where we made  the mistake and we lost control of this thing. Even at that time when he said that, to me,  that was him saying that he was on his way out and he didn't really see a great path forward for  Twitter and it's played out. No one could have imagined it accelerating the demise of what we've  seen in the last few months. That was the exclamation point or the period on the sentence.

Transcript:  Hill, The thing I found really chilling is, I think it was Kevin Ruse's article in The New York  Times saying, they won't admit it, but Silicon Valley is watching what Elon does, wondering if  they can do it with their company too. That is chilling. I think it's specifically talking about  the layoffs, but what it really is, I think, is a lot of the tech CEOs are nervous. We know this,  Amazon and Apple especially, are nervous about the employees standing up to them.  And they're watching with great interest to see if you can beat them down with a stick  and survive. So that was a story in The New York Times this week. I was kind of like,  well, I hope that's not a widespread point of view. We'll see. I think Elon is not doing  good news for himself. This was the story. Elon Musk, management guru,  why the Twitter owner's ruthless, unsparing style has made him a hero to many bosses in Silicon

And actually, one of the stories we talked about  on our Christmas episode, which is coming up on Sunday, is the shift in power, I think,  in tech companies. We're engineers at Google, told Google we don't want to do military contracts.  Microsoft's had the same problem. Employees at Apple, Starbucks, Amazon attempting to unionize.  Employees are realizing they have a little bit more power than they thought, and that's got to

Transcript:  scare the C-suites at these companies. Well, I think hopefully the tech CEOs who are watching  this will sort of revise their opinion once Elon Musk totally destroys Twitter and loses billions  and billions of dollars, which is almost certainly going to happen. I mean, he's just failing  in almost every way. And it's hard to imagine he's kind of turning the whole thing into Parler.  And how is a site like Parler going to have advertisers and revenue and so on? So it's really  going to be a good lesson for all the tech CEOs in some ways. So the other thing is that...

Transcript:  I spend almost all my energy on Twitter criticizing Elon Musk now, so I sort of use that as a great  place to do that. And a lot of comments on his tweets, and he's got this army of trolls that's  exactly like Donald Trump's trolls. So there are certain types of people... Lying narcissists always  make false claims about all the great things they're doing. And there are certain types of...  I think it's a personality trait or something. There's just some people who believe them when  they do that. They get their information about a lying narcissist from the lying narcissist.  And so people are like, oh, he's fixing everything. Well, what he's doing is he's destroying  a feature that Twitter had already, and then he's replacing it with a worse one. And this is true in  almost everything from verification to everything else. And so it has that 2016 feeling, these  arguments I'm having with these Twitter accounts that are one month old, have zero followers,  no profile picture, and a fake name. Millions of these accounts are on there, all supporting  Elon Musk. So it's just become a weird place. And it's still fun to poke fun at Elon Musk on his

Everybody wants to have  their Twitter account. I still have people in this company. I would love to tell my marketing  team to stop using Twitter, but it's impossible to get people to move on. So as long as people  continue to try to, I don't know what, save Twitter, participate in the dumpster fire,  I don't know what it is. I guess we'll have to cover it.

I left Facebook a few years ago, but what I left was all my family and friends who don't use  anything but Facebook. That's what I left. Same.  So in the case of Twitter, it's easier because a lot of my readership and  followers and so on have moved to Macedon, which is great. With Facebook, it's harder to get  your grandma or somebody like that to move to another social network just because you did.  So I was like, come on everybody, let's all leave Facebook.

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by Stamps.com. Oh, it is the season to be jolly, but not  to go to the post office. If you're a small business, it's hard because the post office  is full of wonderful, cheerful people with arms full of gifts they're mailing.  And those long lines are going to slow you down. The good news is if you're a small business,  you don't have to slay through the traffic to the post office.  If your inbox is more like a blizzard than a winter wonderland, are you rushing to send  cards and gifts to your loyal clients? You don't have to go to the post office. Go to Stamps.com.  It is not too late to get your holiday mailing and shipping under control with Stamps.com.  There's no lines. Sign up now. You'll be printing your own postage in minutes.  There's no postage meter, no special link, just your computer, your printer and Stamps.com.  How do I know? We've been using it for more than a decade now. In fact, Stamps.com has been  advertising on our show since 2012, which means I'm wondering if you've heard me talk about it  for 10 years and you still haven't tried it, what are you waiting for? This is the time.  You're 24-7 post office right at your desk. Stamps.com, and by the way, it's more than just  the US Postal Service. This is something that happened just this year and I'm so excited about.  For more than 20 years, Stamps.com has been indispensable for over a million businesses using  it to conduct business with the US Postal Service. Well, now you get the US Postal Service and UPS.  UPS. So everything you need for all your mailing and shipping is right there at your desk, your  computer. No lines, no traffic, no hassle. And I love it because Stamps.com has arranged major  discounts with both services that you can't get at the post office. UPS rates up to 86% off.  I think Stamps.com is great, a stress-free solution for every small business. So use it, use it.  Stamps.com, we do for goodness sakes. Stamps.com, you could print postage right on the envelope  if you want. You can print your logo, it fills in the return address. It'll even take the sender's  address from your website. So if you're on eBay, Etsy, Amazon, if you're a seller there,  you don't even have to fill out anything. It'll fill out overseas international mailing forms.  It'll fill out certified mail. All the different forms, it fills out automatically,  customs forms from the website. And when it's time for the package pickup,  you just push a button on your dashboard. An official, a uniformed official with the United  States government, aka your mail carrier, will come or the guy in the brown shorts from UPS will  come and they'll pick it up and they'll take it. You don't have to ever get up from your desk.  One other thing I love about Stamps.com, rates are constantly changing. It's very hard to keep  track of who's going to be the best person to use. With Stamps.com's switch and save feature,  you can easily compare carriers and rates so you know you're getting the best deal every time.  And I love this feature. When you're mailing something and Stamps.com says, oh, is that a  book? You could do it medium-ale. They'll save you money. They make suggestions to save you money.  You even get a scale so you know exactly how much it's going to cost. You always print exactly  the right postage. And it looks so much more professional. I can't tell you how many times  I've gotten an Etsy package that's tied up with brown twine and brown paper and somebody's stuck  like 30 stamps onto the front of it. That is not a good, I guess maybe you want to look at really  kind of down home, okay? But it's not the most professional look. And it's also happened many  times to me, postage due. Not with Stamps.com. You got the scale. You always have exact, you don't  pay a penny more or less than you have to. If you're working in an online store, like I said,  Amazon, Etsy, eBay, it works seamlessly with all, and Shopify, and all the major shopping  carts and marketplaces saves you time, saves you typing, makes it very easy and very professional.  Really, really professional. This holiday season, trade late nights for silent nights. Get started  with Stamps.com today. Sign up with our promo code TWIT. You'll get a special offer. It's four weeks  of Stamps.com, a four week trial, free postage that you can use over a period of time. I think  it's a significant amount of free postage. You'll get that free USB scale so you know exactly what  you're sending. No long-term commitments, no contracts. All you have to do, go to Stamps.com.  There's a microphone in the upper right hand corner. It says, heard it on a podcast. You click  that and you enter TWIT and immediately you'll see what a great deal we have for you. Four week  trial, free postage, free digital scale, no long-term commitments. Stamps.com. I cannot  recommend it more highly. It's just the best. We couldn't live without it these days.  Okay. I'm kind of in the TWIT hangover here.  Now another story that makes me mad. The Senate, by acclamation, unanimously has voted to ban TikTok  on government devices. The No TikTok on Government Devices Act, introduced by Senator Josh Hawley,  of course, passed by unanimous consent late Wednesday. No one objected. The proposal prohibits  certain individuals from downloading or using TikTok on any device issued by the United States  or a government corporation. Now obviously they can't ban, 13 states have done the same, they  can't ban TikTok from my phone because you know my personal phone or your personal phone or even  a government employee's personal phone. But they sure would like to. Hawley said TikTok is a Trojan  horse for the Chinese Communist Party, a major security risk to the United States and until it  is forced to sever ties with China completely, it has no place on government devices. Mike, you agree?

Transcript:  No, I think that there is a case for certain types of military personnel. So for example,  if you recall years ago, you could tell where there were secret bases for special forces in  Afghanistan because the Fitbit data sort of showed everybody running around in the, you know,  all these Americans running around in the Afghan desert or something like that. But that's a rare  case. I mean, most of us are not special forces deployed on secret bases. So I think there's a  case to be made not just for TikTok, but for any sort of device that harvests information. What I  think, I think the states who are banning TikTok for government employees and now the Senate  is still has to be passed by the House and signed by the President. I think what the government,  if the US was serious about it, they'd really understand the risk. The risk isn't so much data.  We've talked about this on this show before. The risk is their ability during a conflict to  have a lot of propaganda. It's a powerful propaganda tool. I think that the US government  should figure out how to sort of monitor TikTok to a certain extent, to have a way to pull the plug  if there was a conflict with China, that sort of thing. That would be rational. This is just like  irrational. It's just a lot of posturing and pandering to the ignorant, essentially,  making it seem like, oh, the Chinese government's watching everything we do, et cetera.

Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's BS. I have to say, if I were the Chinese government trying to sway the American  electorate, I might rush to Twitter faster than I'd rush to TikTok or Facebook. It's cost them $8  a month. Yeah. TikTok, it's a little harder to sway public opinion. I mean, I guess there's two  potential threats to TikTok. One is that it's gathering more information on you  than you think or know. For that, I will refer you to a Kaspersky study, TikTok Privacy and  Security. Is TikTok safe to use? Steve Gibson talked about this on Security Now this week.  Essentially, their conclusion is it's no different than any other app on your phone.  It does not. According to the New York Times, the CIA reportedly investigated TikTok, found no  concrete evidence that Chinese intelligence authorities are spying on users. It does not  exfiltrate an abnormal amount of information from your phone. If you're using it on an iPhone,  it adheres to the same limits that Apple imposes on other social networks.  So the two possibilities are it's spying on you or that it's going to be used to propagandize you.  If it's not spying on you, propaganda is a lot easier over on Twitter and Facebook.

Transcript:  I'm sorry, go ahead. Well, I'm saying, I want to disclose that they are one of our supporters,  one of ConnectSafely supporters. We do in our Parents Guide to TikTok raise the China issue.  We did this two years ago. We raised the China issue and simply reported what they claimed at  the time is that they have no servers in China. Although it doesn't matter because you can be  sitting in China and access a server that's anywhere in the world. I do think TikTok has  moved their US data to Oracle. Right, but it's theoretically possible for somebody to be sitting  in Beijing and log in to a server that's located anywhere. But the point is, I think that much of  the information that's on TikTok is quasi-public to begin with. I mean, I can go to TikTok and I can  watch people do what they do. Now, admittedly, I don't know what they're watching. Only TikTok  knows that kind of data. But I'm with Mike on this. I mean, do I worry at all about China and  TikTok? Yes. But I also worry about the fact that Apple has a relationship with China. Everybody  has a relationship with China. I mean, there's Chinese chips in this phone that I have. Except  Google. Well, you're saying there's no Chinese chips in a Pixel phone? Oh, well, that's a phone.

I'm not saying that  there isn't the possibility of extracting data. But I'm saying there's so much of that. And it  is a fundamental, almost an existential question that Americans have to ask themselves if we are  worried about China. If we really think China is the evil empire of this century, then our entire  economy has to be intertwined with it because we are so in bed with China. I mean, again,  you know, when I was a kid, if you wanted to buy a pair of jeans, and I looked, it was something  like $12 in the 1950s to buy a pair of jeans. That's like $200 or something today. You can  buy jeans at Walmart or Amazon for $10, $12 made in China or maybe Vietnam or somewhere else. But  the point is that if we want to break ties with China, we better get ready to pay a lot more for

Transcript:  our goods, not to mention- Actually, yeah, the biggest risk from TikTok is just how compelling  the content is. I mean, here's a perspective I can give that somebody who lives in all kinds of  different countries all the time, almost everywhere you go, there are a lot in a lot of countries like  Morocco. We spend a lot of time in Morocco, for example. Police are sort of posted in public  places and they stand there and their job is to watch what's going on. And almost to a person,  the police are watching TikTok on their phones. Security guards, it's the same thing here in  Oaxaca. You see, if a police person isn't driving or something like that, they're watching TikTok.  Great, they're watching TikTok and not you. That's good.

Transcript:  A couple thoughts on TikTok is, one of the things that TikTok has done, and there were  signals that this was going to happen, that somebody was going to get this right for a while,  which was the idea of mapping from the social graph, meaning that it's all about who you follow  and you have to follow the right people. And then you get the content that is aimed at you.  What TikTok did and has done and is doing and that others haven't been able to replicate yet,  but are working on, is they've mapped the interest graph. So they understand your interests. They've  been better essentially at machine learning and data, and they map your interests better.  And so when you go there, you see, I see a higher number of things that I actually want to see  on TikTok than I do on Instagram, far more than Twitter, Facebook. I don't really go to any longer  YouTube even. So they have done this so well because that's what they were all about.  They focused everything on that and they're doing it better. I think the others will catch up and  I think we do have to keep in mind that TikTok is doing, I think, as much as they can to sort of  put themselves at arm's length from China, from the Chinese government. Yet there are signs that  there's still some close ties there. I'll just share one. It's a little bit exceptional, but  it is data-based and value-tainment last week and Patrick Bet David, who runs that,  had this very inflammatory headline in this YouTube video that says,  how TikTok is destroying America and why it needs to be banned, which I think is over the top.  However, he did run this experiment where he showed, here's what all of my views were  and the number of videos that I had that had zero to 20,000 views, 20 to 100,000 views,  100,000 to a million and over a million. He ran this experiment where he says after he did that  and he collected that data, he published a video very, and I think it was in August of this year,  he published a video that was inflammatory and critical of the Chinese government.  Then he tracked what the data was, the popularity of his videos afterwards, up until last week,  and you see that they massively dropped off and were now no longer promoted.

Transcript:  But is that a hazard to us that anything we say negative about the Chinese government will not  appear on TikTok? Is that what we're worried about? By the way, you can't say anything about  Mastodon on Twitter either. I mean, is that what we're worried about really? I mean, is that what  we're worried about? I think I'm more worried about, to be honest, value-tainment. YouTube is  much more of a problem in terms of radicalization. If TikTok wants personal information,  they can buy it like anybody else can from a data broker. If TikTok wants to sway our opinions,  maybe that's possible. But the fact that TikTok downgrades negative comments about China,  if that's the hazard we're worried about, that seems kind of de minimis.

Transcript:  Sure. But again, I think there's a potential. I think the Chinese government, by the way,  bans TikTok. TikTok is banned in China, oddly enough. But I think the Chinese government  views TikTok as one lever of many that they have. If they were to invade Taiwan, for example,  and there's a global conflict or whatever, I think they would go there. I would worry more if it were

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. But that's why my view is that we should be aware of that, of the potential  propaganda element, should that ever occur. And at that point, the plug could be pulled. I just hope  it never comes to that. I hope there's no conflict over Taiwan. But in the meantime,  it seems like a lot of the political rhetoric around TikTok is kind of BS.

Transcript:  It also feels a little bit xenophobic to me because there are plenty of American companies  that are invading our privacy far more. They're not doing anything about that.  And again, TikTok, or rather the Chinese Communist Party, if they want to influence Americans,  have much more direct avenues to do so. And TikTok is pretty good. Again, they are one of

Transcript:  I don't have any huge complaints about that. There was a story this week, which I didn't read  because it seemed like link bait to me, that TikTok pushes harmful content every two minutes.  Kind of how you define harmful content. If it's bikini, maybe, I don't know.

Start time: 3649.30

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is saying that if you are a teenager and you sign up, that every few minutes you're  immediately pushed toward content. They know nothing about you.

Transcript:  So this is from the Center for Countering Digital Hate report they published this week,  found it can take less than three minutes after signing up for a TikTok account to see content  related to suicide, which I have never seen on TikTok. I must be doing something wrong.  Or about five more minutes to find a community promoting eating disorder content. Again,  I must be doing something wrong because I haven't seen that.

Transcript:  I think the thing to think about, I think here, just to sort of put it in perspective,  is that if we felt like, if we put one of the other platforms on the table, if it was  Instagram or Facebook or Twitter, we'll sort of put the rest of our Twitter conversation aside.  And we felt like as soon as you started  discriminating or posting hate speech or, we'll not even call it hate speech, criticism of,  because to be fair, the Valuetainment example, it was just criticism of the policies of the Chinese  government. If any of us started publishing policies on any of these US-based Twitter platforms  of criticism of the US government, and all of a sudden our content started having lower  thresholds of followers and those kinds of things, I think we would have a problem with that.  I think we would feel like that's not something we want to support. And that's not something that  we want to think of as a platform that is creating the sort of atmosphere that we want.  And so I'm not saying that everyone shouldn't stop using TikTok. I still use TikTok myself.  I'm just saying we should go into all these things with awareness. We talked about earlier  the fact that there was this false narrative that we were having a public town square and come to  find out it's not really public. And now we need to think about sort of a different path forward.  And certainly this is just another example of the fact that these platforms are owned by companies,  but now these companies are influenced by governments in ways that really we should  have some transparency around the facts of what's really happening and what's really driving,  especially these interest graph driven phenomenon, which is in TikTok today,  but is likely to be in all of these platforms in the years ahead.

Transcript:  I think if we're going to have a what Jeff Jarvis would call a moral panic over  TikTok, the real thing we should be panicking about or freaking out about or thinking about  is the fact that algorithms and artificial intelligence that can custom tailor things  just the way we want them. This is going to be ubiquitous. It's not about TikTok. It's about  everything. We're entering in a world of where the vast majority, almost all of content that  will be posted online will be synthetic media. AI is going to write the words we read. It's going  to create the pictures that we see. It's going to create videos we see. And this will be highly  tweakable and customizable. And this is something that I think nobody's really talking about.  TikTok is kind of doing us a favor because they're saying here's a little tiny glimpse  of how everything is going to work in the future. And that's what we should be talking about.

That car that  drives by, how do I know whether that's just some cool car somebody created or whether it's  something that Ford is trying to get me to buy? I mean, there's so much that we are going to have  to put our critical thinking caps on if we want to survive the metaverse and it's going to just be

And we protect ourselves.  There's some people who are going to fall down the rabbit hole. But most humans, when they're  faced with addictive behavior, eventually go, oh yeah, this isn't working for me and back off. Or

Transcript:  maybe that's not the case. No, no, I think that is the case. And I think we've already seen it with  the election. So the midterm elections, the sway of disinformation, deliberate political  disinformation, it was less persuasive this time around, even though there's a lot more of it.  And so we basically... There's a self-correcting mechanism. We weaned ourselves off of it,  sort of. Enough to the point where the election denier types mostly lost. And so,  it was just a couple of years ago when disinformation was way more effective.  So I think we are capable of learning, of adapting and of protecting ourselves and finding out  what's healthy, what's unhealthy and so on. And again, like you say, Leo, some people are just  getting at McDonald's every day, but most of us don't. Yeah. And I would hope it's not the

But it's especially when you get away from the coast, especially when you get into the red states.  It is... There is a very large segment of our population that is not stepping away from the  excess of sugar. And I'm almost using that as a metaphor. I mean, whether it's overeating or  voting in a way that's against your self-interest or whatever, there are people in this country who,  for whatever reason, are not thinking about what is truly in their best interest, at least not

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and sugar and so on. TikTok is doing it, except instead of with our eyeballs, with our taste buds.  Yeah. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. But I do think we're learning. I honestly... The news is kind of...  It's slow, but the news is going forth. We've got an obesity epidemic. People are getting sick.  What we were telling... Partly it was because the US government was saying, don't eat fat.  And so people were choosing Cheerios. And I think that's kind of turned a little bit.  I don't know. Maybe it's the arc of justice is long and bends towards less Cheerios. I don't know.  But I feel like... To paraphrase Martin Luther King, I feel like you can have some hope. All I  know is when I go to TikTok, all I really ever want to see is more and more cheesy gordita crunches.  Talk about junk food. That's junk food, but it's my son.  That looks delicious. Yeah.  You might... Oh, your son makes it.  People might say, oh, here, you'll like this one. This is four and a half million views.  People might say, oh, Leo, you like TikTok because your son makes his living  on TikTok. But even he understands that this isn't going to last.  Look at that sandwich. How did he stay so thin?  He doesn't eat this stuff. Are you kidding? He's a pusher. I don't know,  because he's never brought it over to my house. He makes it, but he never brings it over.

Transcript:  To me, that's TikTok. That's all I need is just food, food porn.  Let's take a little break and come back with more. I do think, just to make it clear,  it's perfectly legitimate for government to say government employees can't have TikTok on  their government-owned phone. That's fine. If an employer wants to say that, that's fine.  The Department of Events banned Strava, the running app, because it turned out you could  tell where stuff was at the Pentagon because everybody was using it. That's appropriate.  I'm not saying you shouldn't ban it from government phones. I'm just saying,  I feel like there is a move in Congress to... There's an FCC commissioner saying we should  ban TikTok nationally. There's a move to banning it. I think that's one of those things where you  go, okay, good, we took care of social. What's next? Where there's really a much larger problem.

In fact, Mastodon just costs us money.  It doesn't make us any money. Our show today, speaking of America's obesity crisis,  brought to you by Noom. Now, this is an app you absolutely should put on your phone.  I don't go anywhere without my Noom app. What is Noom? It's not a diet.  So that's really important because diets, I think we've learned, diets don't work. If I tell you,  you may not eat something, what are you going to crave more than anything else? That thing,  right? And eventually, you're going to eat it. You really are. Noom is different.  Noom is different. It is a psychology first approach that lets you stay focused on what's  important to you. When you decide to lose weight, it's not just the number on the scale. There's a  lot of reasons people want to lose weight to be healthier, to be more active, to be better looking.  Whatever your reason for losing weight, whatever reason for wanting it, I shouldn't even say losing  weight. For wanting to take control of your body, Noom's there to help. Do you eat because you're  bored? This is a bad one for me. Can you pass up food when it's free? If somebody brings me donuts,  I'm going to eat the donut. If the answer is yes, don't stress. Noom weight helps you break the  cycle and change your habits for good. I, for instance, I'm a fog eater and I know this because  having done Noom now for more than a year, I've gone through all the lessons you get with Noom.  You get all sorts of things to help you understand what you're doing. I've learned that now I observe,  I go in and I'm not paying attention. I stuff my mouth because I'm watching a TikTok or whatever.  I'm watching those videos from Henry and I got to eat something, right? But that insight is so much  better than being restrictive. Sam is saying, don't do this, don't do that. It's understanding  what you do so you can make a choice. And that's how you break the cycle. That's how you change  your habits for good. Noom weight is not a diet. It's different. It uses psychology to help you  understand your eating habits, to learn how to make healthier choices every day. That's why they say  losing weight starts with your brain. The program helps you understand the science behind your  eating choices, why you're craving what you crave. And it's such a success. To date, Noom weight has  helped more than 4.6 million people lose weight. Active Numbers lose an average of 15 pounds in  16 weeks. 95% of customers say Noom weight is a good long-term solution. And I know it,  I've been using it. Lisa loves it. She didn't have much weight to lose, but those last few pounds were  very hard for her. Noom made all the difference. And a year later, she hasn't gained the weight back.  We also have members of our community, Brianna Wu. She's been looking fantastic. I said, what have  you been doing? She said, I did Noom. I lost 100 pounds. Now, not everybody loses 100 pounds,  obviously. Not everybody should lose 100 pounds. Lisa lost, I think, five or 10. But she's very,  very happy. And I'll tell you what, both of us, every meal, we pull out our phones, we do our Noom.  Every evening, we do our lessons. You can have a regular counselor who works with you. You can  have a group that works with you. You get to choose how Noom works. In fact, one of the things  you'll notice when you first sign up for Noom is it asks you a lot of questions. That's so it can  tailor a program specifically to you. Their flexible program focuses on progress, not perfection.  We're not talking giving up carbs or creating other restrictions, because that's counterproductive.  If you've got cravings or food FOMO, I definitely have food FOMO when it's pizza day at Twit.  It's hard for me, but Noom weight has helped me lose weight while enjoying my favorite foods,  being conscious about what I'm doing. You choose your level of support from five-minute daily  check-ins to personal coaching. They've published more than 30 peer-reviewed scientific articles  to inform users, practitioners, scientists, the public. Peer-reviewed articles about their  methods and effectiveness. In fact, they're doing a book. You can pre-order it, the first book ever,  The Noom Mindset, a deep dive into the psychology of behavior change. They use cognitive behavioral  therapy and other established psychological techniques to help you understand what you're  doing and to take control of your health. I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  crashed but it certainly got close enough to scare me the uh there is a group of tesla fsd beta  testers who have been self-reporting the data according to this article uh the miles driven per  disengagement have gone down by 54 since march so it's getting smarter well wait a minute but  it currently sits around the same level it was around this time last year so it got dumber and  then it got smarter um it's it's actually uh my the overall miles per disengagement is actually  getting worse oh i'm sorry down miles driven is down by 54 percent how many miles uh i don't know

Start time: 6976.42
End time: 7053.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  what it's again it's essentially saying there are more disengagement per mile yeah yeah per mile  which i think is not to put this in perspective and i also i have a tesla model y um i did not buy fsd  but i did get the subscription where you pay 200 dollars for it um so uh for the same reason  larry did is to test it as a tech journalist um i i think this isn't surprising in the sense that  more and more people are are using it right and so i i think that that's not surprising i think  you also have to take into account that um you know twitter twitter tesla is posting see there's  a problem right there i know i know it is confusing um too many t's uh the the you know tesla is  pushing this out way in front i wouldn't even call it beta i call it more like alpha software right  yeah um they're pushing this out so more people have access with lots of disclaimers and you also  have to pass the well for most of the year you had to pass the test of being you know a generally  now it's easier you don't have to be a safe driver it is easier now which is worse they've let  makes it worth yeah they've let um less and less safe drivers into it throughout the year

Transcript:  keep in mind with tesla too is elon lost interest in tesla over two years ago right like once they  got the model 3 and that was elon elon is good at some things let's be honest like he loves  trying to put a lot of energy into big problems and he's very good at that but when he lost  interest in tesla after they got the model 3 delivered and since then it's really become an  they need to operationize this is kind of the level of the systems thing right they need to  build systems that make cars for less money that put them in you know local areas that's why they  built the the plant in shanghai the shant the plant in berlin they need to do all the things  to become a great car company that's what they're working on now and that's not a big problem that  elon needs to solve so really other people have been running tesla for the past two to three years  and elon has barely been involved right he he pulled back from the earnings calls it was clear  on the earnings calls at times this the cfo would kind of interrupt him and say well actually here's  sort of you know he would do it in the most polite um politic way possible but it was clear that elon  barely had been briefed on what tesla was doing when you listen to him on earnings calls to be  able to speak to it and then other people picked up and really has done have been doing the real  work for for years over at tesla and frankly they've done some magnificent work i i mean i  don't really i'm not really a car person i've had the car for two years it's the best car i've ever  owned by far yeah and and i really looked at um i it was really hard decision for me because i'd  owned a ford for like 20 years and loved ford and i had to choose between the maki and the tesla  model y and then the vw um they're uh you know um now i'm forgetting the name of it all of a sudden  the um and it took me about six months to kind of decide and um and now i i would not um i don't  regret it at all like it was by far the one of the better decisions when i was made for that when i
