And of course I want to thank my staff for making  this possible. They've been working their butts off. And here we are in Vegas with  a great panel. Let me go around the horn and say first hello to Tom Merritt from CNET's  Buzz Out Loud. Great to see you Tom. Good to see you Leo. Dressed all in black like  Johnny Cash. Yeah, trying to fade in. I'm very impressed. Fading in, is that what they  call it? Yeah, right into the, no one calls it that. Just you. He's fading in ladies and  also fading in. Ms. Molly Wood. Hello. From CNET's Buzz Out Loud. Molly is, there we go.  There I am. Finally got a camera. I'm here, I'm here. She's somewhere out there. I'm just

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  tucked in here fading in. You've got a distant camera. I know. Good to see you. Thank you.  I got to do Buzz Out Loud with you guys on Thursday. Yeah, thanks for coming up. That

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  was a blast. That was fun. Yeah, it was really fun. You made some announcements, best of  CAS announcements as well, didn't you Jim and Molly? Yeah. Right there he's pulling  it out. The envelope please. Oh you guys don't have a laptop. No, no. I feel a little

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  disconnected from the chat room. This is awesome. I know I do miss the chat room but other than

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that I'm not carrying that anymore. So you can watch my chat room. Molly's got a droid

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and Tom has an iPhone. I feel like we should have some sort of a browser race. Go ahead.  I already pulled it up. No, I already pulled it up too. You guys suck. Yeah, no, because  we prepare for your show. Did you look at the Nexus one? Oh no, see that's something

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't do so would you please stop it, it's really embarrassing. We don't prepare for

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  our show. I did look at the Nexus one actually. I got to play with it yesterday. What do you  think compared to the droid? What I really want desperately, I mean aside from it doesn't  have a keyboard so there's that. It's a beautiful piece of hardware. The really thing that I  want desperately is the widget, the built-in Google weather and news widget. That's like  the big addition in 2.1. I couldn't figure out what else they added in 2.1 that I would  really want except for that one widget which is just like super useful. But it's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  on your desktop. It shows you not only the weather but the news? Yeah, it's got like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  a news feed coming into it. That's cool. And it was so addictive. I mean literally I just  saw a couple headlines and I would click that. I mean it's probably terrible. I'm sure I'll

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  crash the car. Here's something that puzzled me. I was talking to it. I was at an Android  party, an Android event last. Oh, I'm sorry. Tom laughed. That was funny, Ma. Thank you.  That's what I like. That was amusing. That was hilarious. That was quite amusing. Veronica  does that to me. Yeah. Hilarious. Very funny. Sorry. What was I saying? You were saying  a party? I was at a party. I was at a party. So there you go. Oh, there's more. I was  at an Android party. You were out partying with the Nexus One. One of the designers of  the Nexus One was there. And I asked him about multi-touch and he said well actually multi-touch  is built into the Nexus One. It's built into the operating system. It's built into the  hardware. You know where it's missing? The Google Apps like Maps, the Pictures app. And  why is that? I don't know. But if they update it, you've got multi-touch. Because Veronica's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  theory was that Eric Schmidt coming from the Apple board had made some pact with the devil  that he wouldn't do multi-touch in the US. But it sounds... I thought that was my theory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, yeah. Something like that. No, no. Or now it's Molly's theory. Apparently it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  just a question of updating the apps which they'll do soon. So why didn't they have the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  apps with multi-touch before? Because they have it in Europe on the milestone which is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the Droid. I don't know if that's the case. I think there's a little US license signature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  People have told me they have it in Europe. But I don't know if they have it in Europe  in the same way the Nexus One has it. But it doesn't do it. Have you seen somebody do  anybody in our chat room in Europe, does the milestone actually do multi-touch or is it  capable of multi-touch which is what the Nexus One... And by the way, apparently the Droid is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the Droid is too. Yeah, it's perfectly capable. It's built in. I think that there  was a little bit of a licensing thing in the US. No, that's not funny. Titus says my girlfriend

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  has multi-touch. I don't think that's what we're talking about. A different kind. Inappropriate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Inappropriate. Anyway, I thought it was certainly very hot but it didn't make me regret buying

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  my Droid. No, and I guess if the Nexus One gets multi-touch, your Droid will get multi-touch.  I think so. I don't think they're holding it back. What deal with who? It doesn't make  any sense. Makes no sense. They're not holding it back and that's why I wonder if the milestone  really does or maybe... Who did the milestone? Motorola. That's the Droid version. It's the  Droid. Yeah, it's the European version. Maybe Motorola in Europe did something. I don't  know. Maybe they may modify the apps. Have a different agreement or a different patent

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  situation or something. I'd like to know more about this. Yeah, I'm convinced that it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  just a different licensing or patent situation. I'd like to. And so it's okay in Europe. I  don't know why it would be. That doesn't seem because I... But I don't know. But the multi-touch

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  was one thing I was bothered with on the Nexus One. Otherwise, I really love the phone.  It works really well. It's easy to figure out how to do stuff. Doesn't it make our Droid

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  look like a Terminator? I didn't feel bad about my Droid. I mean, that was the one good  thing is I thought the Nexus One was really neat and really pretty, but I didn't feel  like I was missing a lot with the Droid. I mean, it didn't make me really like... Because  sometimes that'll happen. It's so gorgeous. It's so slick. I did not like the on-screen

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  keyboard though. I like my keyboard. Exactly. I like my keyboard. Let's get Jay up here  and Jay Adelson is here from dig.com and ask him because he probably does a lot of phones.  And while he's getting set, let me do a commercial. This portion of This Week in Tech at CES is  brought to you by Ford. When it's just been a long Ford commercial. Sync my ride. Somebody  in the chat room said, and I think it's an appropriate question, why would you have a  sponsor on? But one thing about our CES coverage is very different from the coverage we do  back in the cottage is we've had product people on all the time. We will have more product  people on not just because they're a sponsor, but because what is CES all about? But products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Normally I do not have vendors on. And kind of Ford this year. I mean, they own this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They owned this show. Maybe it's not apparent because Ford's been a sponsor and they're  a sponsor of yours too, but it's not been apparent. But we aren't talking about Ford  because they're a sponsor as much as because they really owned this show, it was a Ford

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  show. Yeah. Let me talk about Google. You talk about Ford. You talk about Intel. I mean,  those are people making the news here. Yeah. Let me do... Yeah. Well, we'll talk more

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  about all of that in just a second. Let me do a little bit of a Ford SYNC commercial  and then we'll be right back. This whole trip actually was brought to you by three sponsors,  the folks at Citrix, the folks at SYNC and the folks at audible.com. So we're going to  mention all three in the show today and thank them profusely. Ford SYNC is, as you just  heard, the in-car, hands-free, Bluetooth, media player stuff that has done so well in  the new Ford cars. And you can find out more about it by going to the website, syncmyride.com.  I don't think the news Ford, MyTouch and MyTouch... What is it? MyTouch? They rebranded it. It's  MyFordTouch. MyFord and MyFordTouch. Yeah. Terrible. SYNC is so much easier to remember.  MyFord and MyFordTouch. I know. SYNC is part of MyFord and MyFordTouch. That's even more  confusing. I know. It's just a mess. Anyway, I don't know how much they have on the website  page there, but you can read a lot of news about all of these new features. It's just  really exciting, the idea of connecting in your car at that level. So I'd invite you  to go to syncmyride.com, learn more about it. And also, of course, the next time you're  at a Ford, Lincoln or Mercury dealer, give it a try. Syncmyride.com or test it out at  your Ford, Lincoln or Mercury dealer, Ford SYNC. We appreciate their support. They brought  us here. Jay, you're not here for work. You're here on vacation. I'm totally on vacation,  completely. Now, see, that's my dream come true, is to come to CES and not have to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  anything. Well, this is my first CES. You've never been here? I've sent people for years.  I've never got to go. I've never got to go. Doesn't he look like Ringo Starr? I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ringo's here. I wish. I wish I was that cool. I'm sorry. If you do the accent, I think we're

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  going to see it a lot. I think honestly he looks like a cooler beetle than Ringo Starr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. That's so nice. He's Herman from Herman's Hermits. You know what? That would be also  cooler than me. No, no, no. So anyway. So this is cool. So you are here working. You've

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  never been to CES and you said, I want to check it out. You know, the thing is I've

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  always been a gadget nerd my entire life. I mean, probably the king of the gadget nerds,  but I've never been allowed to CES in like what would be my native habitat, right? And  I got here and when my friends who are working here saw me, they're like, oh, well, you can't  actually see all of CES. It's like too hard. No. Like wrong. There's only four days and  there's 8,000. I swear to you, I think I might have seen everything. Yeah. Finally.  Would you like a chair? You know, it's like my knees are. Can we get Jay a chair? This

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  poor guy. He's just dying. You're in agony. The reason I brought you in is we need you  to help us with this Nexus One thing versus Droid. Did you see that? You must have seen  it. I did. First of all, let's get this out on the table. What do you carry? I carry an

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  iPhone today. And by the way, that's novel because, you know, as far as I'm concerned,  and by the way, you'll notice no skin, no like listening, special things, no cases.  You go bareback. I go bareback. Mayday. That's OH. So, so, you know, for me, I couldn't use  an iPhone for all since it came out because I was living in rural New York and it wasn't,  there was no AT&T coverage. So I moved out to California thinking, Hey, I can now. Oh.  Yeah. You should have emailed me. I totally would have warned you about that.  So it was a little tough. And I can tell you, I can tell you right now, I'm investigating  other phones to choose as an alternative. So did you look at a Nexus One?  I looked at the Nexus One and I think my first impression is I love Android. I love the operating  system. I love the openness of that. I'm excited. It has all, it has enough apps for me. The  one thing it doesn't have yet is Verizon or, you know, the CDMA sprint style. Well,  coming this spring. Right. So am I going to get that guys? Nexus One coming this spring to  Verizon. Yep. All right. That's what I've heard. So that I think might in fact be my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In the meantime, you could, you could get one of these and just turn it on and then you actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  get data that, you know, he's got a sprint or a Verizon MiFi. It's a good idea. Yeah. It is a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  good idea. The Verizon MiFi has saved Tom's iPhone, I think. It is. Now the question is though,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  will the Android have Red Laser, one of my favorite apps of all time? Isn't Red Laser great? Red Laser

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  scans barcodes and tells you where you can get it cheaper. Android has a barcode scanner. Android  invented the product. But I don't know if it has. No, it does it better than Red Laser. There are  three products that do it, three applications that do it, all of them free. And the thing about Red  Laser is it's a copy of those applications. ShopSavvy is the one I use for big in Japan.  Oh yeah, we're using ShopSavvy. ShopSavvy is incredible. Like a custom version for  CNET too for electronics. It's incredible. And the thing is you couldn't do it on the iPhone until  the 3GS because it didn't have an auto focus camera. But the G1 did from day one. So in fact,  that's a category that Android owns. Well then I should be fine. I should be fine with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right, I'm all over it. I like ShopSavvy. I think it's actually showing me in real life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Red Laser's pretty good. I can download it now too because I'm on Verizon. I'm such a douche.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I had, I had the BlackBerry for years. Leo, you know I was always a BlackBerry guy.  And I had to, I had to give it up. That's kind of a telecom kind of a thing. Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it's a little corporate. A little corporatey. Yeah, biz. You know. But do you think we're going to see

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  even better Android phones throughout the course of the year? Yes. Because Google has said we're

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  going to roll out a ton of these things. Well that's exactly what they told me at this party is that  this is just the beginning. And the other thing I asked them, which kind of surprised me is,  well if that's the case, why do you sell an unlocked version? You have to use this with T-Mobile  anyway. You have to buy a T-Mobile account. Why would anybody pay $529 for an unlocked version  versus $199 since you have to get a T-Mobile account? Now T-Mobile does offer a month by  month account. So you can not lock in on the T-Mobile. Well that's worth a lot though.  Apparently, what it tells me is that this is a phone for a narrow niche that's smart enough to  know that, that's smart enough to say I'll buy unlocked. He told me that by far the majority of  buyers are buying unlocked, not locked. By far. Well there's not, there's also not any kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  upgrade path through T-Mobile. So anybody who's already on T-Mobile, they're not getting a discount.  You know, like Verizon will give you a discount if you've been with them for a certain time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought that there, I thought I had heard there was an upgrade option. Maybe it was only like a,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you can't buy it through T-Mobile. You have to buy it from Google. You have to buy it from Google,  which is why. So then, and then people are having, there may be some kind of discount,  but they haven't figured out how to apply it. And then it's led to that big customer service  meltdown with Google. Yeah, that's not a good thing. So yeah, let's talk about the customer

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  service meltdown because the only complaint about the Nexus One to this point has been

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that Google is just unresponsive. Right. Well to be fair, wasn't Apple struggling  when in its first few days? I mean, we were all impressed with how fast they replenished supply  in the stores, but they had the whole store infrastructure. To be honest, the experience

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  of buying a Nexus One was far superior. I waited six hours in line for the first iPhone and it was  a, it was, you know, a nightmare. And you're right. It was the servers were down. The Nexus One,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I ordered it, it came the next day, done. Is that because you had the option to wait in line though?  If you've been forced to buy it on Apple's website, maybe, would it have been an equivalent

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  experience? Now the other difference is the iPhone, you have to activate through iTunes.  And I think that that's ultimately funky and stupid. That's where they had support issues was

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  when that went wrong. But, but you know, if, if I can choose, well, right. But if I can choose my,  my provider, then a certain amount of customer service experience is not going to be Google's  fault. It's going to be who I choose might be, you know, good or bad. So. And people who had never

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  used the beautiful T-Mobile also complained just a tiny bit about T-Mobile. I've used T-Mobile for  a long time. I have Blackberry. I had an, and right now it's running my N900, but as soon as I get  home, it's going to. Did you ever have a sidekick? Yeah, I did. I had a T-Mobile sidekick. I forgot  all about that. That actually was a pretty good. That was pretty hip. Yeah. You know, it's a great

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  way to meet chicks. It was my first time I ever saw a phone. I went, that is targeting the teenage  demo for a phone. Right. And I was like, wait, teenagers have phones. Is that allowed? I guess

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  so. We actually gave sidekick the best of CES. Remember Tom, that was when we were back in tech  TV. It was still the danger communicator. And we liked it because when you went flip it, did the  Star Trek sandwich, they had to take out because Paramount wanted to suit the pants off. Actually,  speaking of lawsuits, apparently Philip K. Dick's family is threatening to sue Google over the name

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nexus. The Nexus one, because yeah, it's in do androids dream of electric sheep? Nexus six.  That's the Android that's dreaming of the electric sheep. But it's Nexus six. But I think there  might be a reference to Nexus one. Presumably there was a two, three, four. Yeah, right. Maybe

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  even a five. But isn't there a point? Unless they use Microsoft numbering. Isn't there a point where

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  just shut up? Yeah. Really? It's a cool name. Well, now do you think they'd be okay and not

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  try and license them? You know what? I think that they looked at the droid advertisements that said  droid is a registered trademark of Lucasfilm limited. And they said, Hey, a little dollar  signs appeared in front of their eyes. And they said, well, why don't we get a license for Nexus?  Because really it's a tribute to Philip K. Dick. It's an Android operating system. Of course,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  they call it Nexus. There's not a confusion here. Nobody's not going to buy do androids dream of  electric sheep because there exists a phone called the Nexus. And I, you know, this is out on a legal

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  limb, but I don't think copyright allows you to essentially claim. Does it allow you to claim every  word that is in a book? I mean, really like if you invented a name for something in a book,  it's different than just using a word. Yeah. It seems a little fuzzy to me. It's pretty common

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  for the, you know, for like somebody like Lucasfilm or whatever, to try and protect trademarks when  the only reason they're doing it is because they have a trademark that is necessary. I don't think

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nexus one kind of fits that. I think, yeah, I think LucasArts can make a claim. Hey, we're out  there merchandising things. We make electronics. We put these things out there. So this could hurt  our business. I don't see the Dick estate doing that. I don't see them. I'm just glad to hear you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  say Dick. I knew you'd all want it. Oh, we're all just children. So I know it's so sad. You know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  one more, one more thing. Uh, is it Zenny Jardin from Boing Boing had a great thread going on the  day of the Nexus one with people making quotes from Blade Runner and playing off it with Nexus  one things about the phone and how it worked. And that was great stuff for the Philip K Dick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sure they sold a lot of books as a result. So let's not get greedy. Dick estate.  Don't get, make sure those words are in the right place.  Molly, you're getting into it. You're looking for the title already. I like that for the title.  That's my nominee. We're going to keep working on it though. 3d televisions were a big story here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Really? I hadn't heard much about that. I was surprised by some things I saw. You like the  televisions. Well, first of all, I thought I'd hate it. So I would have low expectations, right?  And I went in and I did think that the quality of what I was seeing was actually, you know,  consistent with what I saw in a movie theater. But the thing that really got me was when you  combined it with the gesture control with, with the cell at Toshiba. Oh, you thought that was cool.  Well, I just, I knew it was out there for a while and they never gave it to us. So, but there's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  good reason. Did you, how long did you watch? Did you go through, go through a couple of those demos  only about half the time was she able to get it to do what she wanted to do. She had a very good  pattern. She would, so the idea is it looks like Natal where she's waving her hands and there's a,  there's this 3d globe on the screen and she's spinning it like minority report and spinning  it left. But then frequently she say things, well, let's just take a tour through the content. It  was clear that the globe had a mind of its own or, wow, but can't they fix that? Yeah, but it's demo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, well, that's the thing. Do you really want that? Well, here's the thing. Right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  controls are the big problem with all these, all these machines that we put in. So maybe  she just be intuitive. They just go like this. Well, either that. I mean, look, we all want voice  recognition. We all want, you know, simple things. We all want all in one remotes and nothing ever  does the trick. So I just want them to try something else and maybe I can get there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was one of the announcements Steve Ballmer made in his thrilling gripping speech on Wednesday  night. My favorite part was the power outage. After it was kind of like a rain delay. Really?  They practically had the guy with a tarp come and roll the tarps over the seats over Ballmer's head.  And they started showing Hogan's heroes reruns. And then finally they started. And yeah, I mean,  the whole speech was reruns basically was, oh, you know, this is what we're, but one thing he  did say is Natalya is coming this year. That's the Microsoft gaming stuff that made Veronica look so  silly going. Yeah. Well, it's going to make everybody look silly. You know what? I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Adorably silly. Look, just try new things as often as possible. We get locked in a rut. I don't care

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  if they're silly or embarrassing. You're refreshing breath of fresh air. Usually we're just a bunch of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kermans going, that sucks. What's next? Well, I want more things that suck because if I get more  things that suck, eventually I will get something awesome. No, you're right. Let them try stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let them try. That's the argument for the late adopter, right? You always buy like three year  old technology. Everything works great. It's fast. It's perfect. That's right. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  LG introduced a motion remote that I thought was actually pretty cool. It was similar. It works  like a Wii wand so that when you want to get to different quadrants of the screen. And I thought  this would, this to me was the best sort of iteration because it doesn't have as many potential  bugs. It's just like wave your hands in the air because you just kind of go like, okay, I want my

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  cursor to be over here now. That would work a little bit better. But even the Wii, don't you find a  little difficult to navigate with the Wii wand and get it to do what you want? It's hard to get it to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that right place. What about the Voodoo controller? Did you guys ever use that one? It's a handheld  that it has. It has a little bit of a motion component to it. I kind of like that. Motion is

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  okay. I'm going to give you that Jay. It's okay. Let them keep working on it. It's early days yet.  This one had a camera that touch you. But it had a camera aimed at you. Part of what they were  showing off though was the fact that this is a TV with eight 3.2 gigahertz processors at the IBM  cell processor, which IBM has canceled by the way. Really? Yeah. That $11,000 TV is making it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  absolutely weird. That's like when the people planning CES six months ago kind of get there

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and go, do you think people are going to remember that? It had the 2D to 3D conversion. That was

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  interesting. Up conversion, 2D to 3D. They also had up conversion of 2K to 4K, which didn't look all  that good. The 2D to 3D didn't look great. It was an interesting idea. I actually talked to a guy  who's a graphics expert about how do they do that. He said the only way you can do it is with edge  detection. If stuff is soft focus, if there's a shallow depth of field and stuff is out of focus,  we presume that's in the background. Of course, that's not going to work if the focal point is  in the middle and there's stuff in the foreground out of focus. It's going to push it to the back.  So it's going to have some weird effects. That's right. I don't know. Personally,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it gave me a headache after a certain amount of time. My big issue with all of the 3D stuff,  I'll just be honest with you, you're sitting and watching this great football game, having that  immersive experience, and you turn to your buddy and he's wearing those glasses. I know.  I mean, and so are you. Yeah, and it's not going to be like shared love. And your buddy's looking  back at you going, man, your nose looks hilarious right now. We both look like idiots. At least no  one can see us looking like idiots because we're in the privacy of our own. They're already getting

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the stylish glasses. No, I don't care how stylish they are. You're still wearing dorky glasses. And  they have batteries. How many pairs of those? And they have batteries. What's going to happen

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  when the battery wears out and it's like some funky weird battery and then you're sitting there  in your house wondering, okay, do I recharge? Plus you know those batteries are going to explode

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  like the laptop ones. I'm just saying. On your head. Scalp burns into your eye. I presume that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you could flip a switch and turn off the 3D and watch it in 2D. That's a good point. These TVs  got to be able to do 2D too, right? I'm just not, I hate to say it and I don't want to be the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  curmudgeon grouch about it, but I'm not wearing those glasses at home. I'm not doing it. I want  to lay on the couch and put my head on the pillow and I am not going to keep 10 or 11 pairs of  glasses around for when I want to have a party for the Super Bowl or for the Academy Awards. BYOG.  That'll be like a new box that you check on the e-vite. Don't forget your goggles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Within a year, Oakley is going to have the Oakley active shutter. You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think by next year we're going to see them rolling out the 3D TVs that don't require glasses.  They can't. There's no way. They're starting to do displays that like simulate 3D already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can't see from the side though. That's the big problem. Yeah, but you kind of can't with  3D glasses either. They have the display. With the shutter ones you can't. They have the display,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but the problem is if you watch it longer than three minutes, you do vomit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's a bummer. Yeah. Okay. Well, it's okay. You said you wanted new stuff that might suck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well that's true. It's good. It's a good technology for certain applications, but I just

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  can't allow myself to get sick. I'm not buying 3D. I just really think that they, what surprises me  is that these big smart companies are spending so much money on technology. Avatar, come on.  That was awesome. I think Avatar would have been better in 2D. Just as good in 2D.  Did you just watch it in 2D and tell her, and I kept saying, God, I wish this were in 2D.  Seriously. Don't you think that it's exhausting. It's exhausting to sit there and have that sort  of take you out of the movie. It would have been a bit. Trust me, watch it at home when it comes out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, wait, wait, wait. But did you go to IMAX or regular? Regular. Okay. Because I think the  regular size film 3D for me was a better experience than my friends who went to see IMAX 3D.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, IMAX even takes you out of it more. I saw IMAX 3D and loved it. Loved it. I was thinking  maybe it's better than IMAX. I had a little bit of a hard time at the beginning, but after I watched

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it for 20 minutes, I was in. No problem. Most importantly, I looked at my daughter and my son  who were sitting next to me and their minds were blown and I was the coolest dad ever. That's totally

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  worth it. It's a great movie. It would have been better in 2D. The Gryph points out, remember in  1978, what was the big story of CES? Quadraphonic sound. Yeah. Okay. We've been here, done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I actually think 3D is going to be in every TV. I think it's just going to be a thing that's in  there and you can not use it like you say or use it. It's not that much more expensive to make the  TV do 3D. And so I think that's why we're seeing it explode so fast because they're like, you know  what? It's not that hard and it makes people want to buy our TV because it comes with 3D even if

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  they're not going to use it. It's really just iterative. And then let's not forget that a  couple of these manufacturers, let's not name names, LG, really all they did was slap a slide  into their press conference powerpoints that basically said, and also we are also going to  do the 3D this year because all of a sudden they kind of got wind of the fact that 3D was going to  be the big thing at the show. And Panasonic is the only one with a ship date. You know who did

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  something stupid? It's Sharp. Sharp announced red, green, blue, yellow TVs. No, no, no, no.  Red, green, blue, yellow TVs. Not CMYK. No, red, green, blue, yellow TVs. And they kept showing  yellow tubas that looked, well, yellow. There's a real problem. I mean, what it did is it enhanced  the color space. But I was talking to our home theater expert. He said, yeah, you have a broader  color gamut, but you don't want a broader color gamut. There's an established defined color gamut  for television and you want to stick to the standard. You don't want to invent some standard.  It doesn't make you want accurate color reproduction and adding a fourth channel does nothing. So that  was a very strange move. I mean, let's put it this way. They're completely capable of doing  something stupid, even if they do it in constant. So just like I said, though, more stupidity is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  better. Well, eventually somebody's going to hit the ball out of the park. J. Adelson, ladies and

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  gentlemen, more stupidity is better. Let's take a break. I do want to talk about the best of CES.  So we'll get there. We'll get there right after this word from the folks at Citrix who do the Go  To Meeting product. Go To Meeting actually would have saved us a lot of money. We should have just  stayed at home and used Go To Meeting to go to Com... How long before CES is done that way with  internet meetings? The whole point of Go To Meeting is you do more, you travel less. Anytime you're on  the phone with somebody and you've got a PowerPoint presentation, a spreadsheet, maybe some slides you  want to show and all you have to do is say, look, here's, I want to show you this. GoToGoToMeeting.com,  click join a meeting. Here's the meeting ID. Now they're seeing your computer on their screen.  They're seeing that PowerPoint. They're seeing the spreadsheet, the slides, the websites. And it's  engaging. It's dramatic. It makes you more effective. And it's a great way to have meetings.  Best of all, it costs you a whole lot less than flying around the country to have your meetings.  I want you to go to GoToMeeting.com slash twit right now, G-O-T-O, meeting.com slash twit. You  could sign up for 30 days free. I'm not selling you a pig in a poke. It's going to cost you nothing.  You can at least try it out. Call your clients, your colleagues, show the boss, say, look, this is  what, what do you think about this? Would you think this will save us money? You think we'd get more  done with this? I guarantee you they'll say yes. Do more, travel less, easy to set up. Just take  you a minute or two. GoToMeeting.com slash twit. Thank them so much for their support of our travel  down here. I think it's kind of ironic in a way that they paid for us to come all the way here  when we could have just done it with GoToMeeting. So CNET every year does the best of CES. You've  been doing, actually I think you guys took over for Tech TV, right? We did. Well, G4 Tech TV did

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it for the last time in 2005 and then we took it over in 2006. And we've been doing it very, a much

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  better job frankly than even Tech TV did. That used to be fisticuffs in that room. We're trying  to figure out what the best is. Right. No, there's no fisticuffs in our room. Oh, it might be. We just don't go.  Let me just run through some of the winners in the Tech TV days. Well, there was the Danger Sidekick  communicator and my favorite, the Moxie. Big winner. Oh right, I forgot about the Moxie. I love Moxie. Well, it was a great product.  Never really went anywhere. In fact, it just declared bankruptcy this year. So that's CES in a nutshell really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It really is, isn't it? I mean, because you don't see all the products that are going to come out  in the year. And there's things like Photokina and CTIA. So you don't see all the products in every  category necessarily. And there's a lot of, I don't know, there's a lot of fun in the air. So the best of is not necessarily the best.  I'm kind of looking forward to seeing what's next. It's not necessarily the best products of the year. I do like the two that you picked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's start with the television. You took the Panasonic VT25 Plasma TV. Why did you guys pick that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the main reason is because, like I said, that's the only 3D TV with a ship date. I think in some ways.  Really? Are you kidding? Of all the TVs in here, none of them have ship dates? I'm pretty sure that is going to be the first one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There may be a few more, but most of them don't. That's stunning. I think that's the only one. They've all got like, you know,  summer and this and that. And Panasonic's got a firm date. And it's a really good TV. It's a really good TV.  The display looks very good. We didn't give it because it has 3D. That's sort of a sideline. It's just, we love the TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's got internet connectivity. I think it's got a great picture. I think a couple of things there.  It's interesting that it's plasma, not LCD, because everybody's buying LCD these days. And it's a lower power drawing plasma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Much lower. They cut it in half. Yeah. Not sure the internet connectivity really is a big deal. No. Come on, Mr. IPTV.  You better. I'm a big fan of being able to watch stuff, but I think that the software that drives my consumption is better with another product.  You like Roku or Boxee Box. Did you see the Boxee Box? I love Boxee. Did you see the Boxee Box? I did. I saw the box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you wish that it was just a box? I do. Instead of a box with a corner cut off. Yeah, like a little. Okay, that's a little weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I don't know. But it almost doesn't matter because then I look at the TV and it just, I'm not. So for people who don't know.  Boxee's on it. For people who don't know, what is Boxee? Boxee for I can. Jay, go ahead. You're obviously a Boxee lover.  Well, first of all, Boxee, I believe is based on the original Xbox Media Center Open Source. Yeah, it's based on XBMC. That's right.  And it's a software program that you can either download and install yourself or with this D-Link Boxee Box and have next to your television.  And basically it makes internet video, everything, all the media on the internet consumable on your television.  Including Revision 3, including Twitter, including all CNET, everything. It's all there.  They have applications that can be installed on Boxee. So you can actually have applications like Dig and Revision 3 and Twitter that allow you to consume it very easily.  And as far as I'm concerned, the gracefulness of the UI is the key. And I've seen some really good UIs over the last couple of years.  I love the Voodoo stuff and I absolutely think that Roku. I mean, there's good stuff. But Boxee for me, and maybe it's because I'm an internet nerd, I thought was really great.  Which I don't think I'm going to get in the internet televisions for your earlier point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I was talking to Boxee about that. I was like, you've got this box and you guys are talking about doing other boxes. Do you want to be on TVs?  And they said, absolutely. We would like to make some deals with television manufacturers and get Boxee as an embedded system.  So you buy a TV and it comes with Boxee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If that happens, then your internet television now, to me, makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because you know what you're getting now, basically, like it's true, the Viera Cast platform, right? That's the one that runs on Panasonic.  And it does have some good connectivity options. But for the most part, it's kind of like the difference between Vcast and iPhone OS.  You know, it's a very proprietary UI. It's a proprietary system. It's tightly controlled in terms of what widgets you get and what actual programming you get.  And Boxee gives you basically all web video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you prefer to Yahoo widgets or any of the other built-in TV. Yahoo widgets is another very common TV platform.  That's almost like the thing they do.  And it's fairly open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's almost like that's the thing they do just to show that they have it. I mean, they're not going to stream all of the video from the web.  They're not going to have that really sort of, like I said, elegant interface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Boxee, you can download, you can put it on your computer, you can run it on an Apple TV if you hack it.  There's a lot of things you can do. But they've now done a deal with D-Link to make a cube that has a corner cut off and sits funny.  And an HDMI port.  And it has the Boxee software. It has an ethernet port or Wi-Fi.  It has ethernet or Wi-Fi, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it has an optical audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a little pricey. It's 200 bucks, right?  Yeah, you know, but when you compare that to the other boxes, it's kind of in the range.  It's a little more than a Roku, though. Roku's 129.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Roku is 99 now.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Roku is pretty killer priced.  Roku is...  But Roku to Boxee, I mean Roku is very utilitarian. Everybody should have a Roku, period.  It's too cheap not to have.  But Boxee is so elegant. And even the design is kind of elegant.  I don't know, I think it's up to Andy.  There's also the PopBox from Popcorn Hour came out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they are starting to get... there's somebody to watch because they are getting as slick on the interface side as Boxee.  And on the technology side, they've always been somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, geek trivia. Where's the name Boxee come from?  Oh, I have no idea.  It's the Android dog on Battlestar.  Oh, it's after Boxee?  I didn't know that.  We'll think of the logo. The Boxee logo is a little dog.  The Daggett.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That makes sense. Daggett.  Wow, well done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The chat room told me that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you go to the Boxee or to the D-Link booth or the NVIDIA booth, they're demoing it.  And I noticed that they won't show YouTube videos in the booth.  Because I guess they're worried about copyright.  I guess they're worried about copyright.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  However, Hulu shut Boxee down.  There's a back and forth with Hulu. They don't want to be on Boxee.  Which is again, typical Murdoch BS.  This guy, they don't get it.  That makes no sense. I don't get that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can maybe still get Hulu if you try.  You might be able to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a little bit of work, but it might be possible.  Yes, I would not condoning any.  No.  Although you can dig things. Did you notice?  You can dig from Boxee?  You can use the dig app and you activate it.  You can actually dig the video when it opens up.  That's really smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Boxee already has social media in it.  That's really part of the fun of this.  You can Facebook share it.  I think that's the future of everything.  The VT25, I think we'll agree that's a great TV.  And I think a very good pick. It's a credible pick.  I might disagree a little bit with Jay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought the Boxee was wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Really? The Boxee should have won.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe not best of show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because Boxee wasn't in the same category as the TV.  The TV is a little of a mundane pick though.  Because there are a lot of great TVs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it says something about CES.  That it's sort of a compromise pick.  Nothing at this show stood out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like the Palm Pre last year stood out.  And said, hey, this is something really revolutionary.  And your computer hardware pick though did stand out.  I thought quite a bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh yeah, the IdeaPad.  And that was the one.  The U1 from Lenovo.  The IdeaPad U1.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And apparently our best in show voting was super close.  And I think it was between the IdeaPad and that TV.  Because that is just so clever.  I think they both won each in their own category.  They each won their own category.  Tell me about this. Oh Jay.  This is amazing. You're going to buy it right away.  It's a netbook.  But then you actually can undock.  So it's a netbook running Windows 7.  And you can undock the display.  And then the display becomes just on the fly.  Like hot swappable.  A slate tablet running Linux.  And then Blue Dog Linux tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A real simple interface for photos, video, web surfing.  Multi-touch interface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then you re-dock it.  And it syncs your browser.  And then just switches back to Windows 7 on the fly.  And also it's gorgeous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's got Core 2 and Snapdragon.  And battery life 10 hours.  A real 10 hours.  And it is beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The base continues to run when you pull the tablet out.  So you can actually hook that up to a monitor.  And have two computers running at the same time.  Yes.  For the low, low price of?  Under $1,000 was all they would say.  They wouldn't give me a full price.  Not cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it's funny because it's the size of a netbook.  But it's 3.5 pounds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it actually feels a little heavy.  A little bit. But you know what?  The fact that you can just pull that thing off was so magical.  I loved it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's beautiful design.  That's the thing about true innovation in the What's His Name way.  Where it felt like magic.  I like it when things actually work.  And then the thing turns into another thing.  And then you can touch it and put the thing back on the thing.  Because I was kind of skeptical until I actually picked it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I pulled it out.  And it was a flash.  It flipped the tablet and started running.  I was like, this actually runs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not just a concept.  I also like it that even when you detach the top,  there's still this plexiglass shell.  I think that's a nice touch actually.  Then you don't have a keyboard without a...  It looks like you broke it.  I think this is very interesting.  The Snapdragon processor was everywhere.  It's in everything.  Including the new phone.  That is an ARM processor.  Gigahertz ARM processor that has enough power  that a lot of people are using in CE devices.  I think it's one of the big stories here.  High powered chips are now becoming so easily  and widely available that you can see them in cars.  You can see them in CE devices.  And I think that transforms everything.  The voice recognition in sync is powered by Nuance.  Which does Dragon.  And I asked them.  I said, how do you do this in a car?  He said, well, because the cars practically are PCs now.  They have enough horsepower.  They have enough RAM in them.  We can really do challenging applications  like voice recognition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The other one that almost won Best of Show  and won in its category for CardTek  was My Ford Touch.  Which we talked about a lot earlier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was a real close contender.  I think this should have won.  I don't know if you guys nominated it.  This was a very interesting product.  Out there, there's the copia that you mentioned  which is kind of a kindle  with social networking.  But this one, the Entourage Edge  looked a lot like that Courier video  that was on Dig a while back.  It was a Microsoft concept product.  It was a two page  e-book reader. The left page, E Ink.  The right page, a computer.  And you could drag from one to the other.  You could have a real computer  on one side and a real e-book reader  on the other side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was really laggy in the one that I tried.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The prototypes they were showing around  did not have the full snapdragon.  It's 700 MHz.  So maybe it'll be faster.  It's a couple of things that were interesting.  First of all, it was a big e-book page.  It was almost a 10 inch page.  I thought that was kind of interesting.  And they put a Wacom digitizer on top of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  so you could draw on it.  Although the drawing was a little clunky.  The drawing on the Plastic Logic Q  I thought was the best that I tried.  It's an e-ink screen as well?  You don't have to use a stylus or anything.  It's not an issue of e-ink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it a processor or is it an e-ink?  It must be a processor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You were able to draw on the Plastic Logic pretty fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can we get back to the killer app  of these things is reading books on them?  And newspaper.  That's right.  It has to feel like it goes away.  Kindle feels like a book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This does not go away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Given the reading factor, I find the spelling of that product unacceptable.  Oh, the inter-capped T and DG.  That is not...  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the entourage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually think that I would not buy it  because of that.  I have issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was in the portable media category.  And this is part of the thing as we evolve.  There's not really MP3 players anymore.  In fact, portable video players aren't really a big thing anymore.  So the e-books are in there.  But the Tivet is the one that won the category.  The Edge was a finalist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Tivet is a tiny little module  about maybe four times  the size of a credit card or something  that lets you do mobile DTV over Wi-Fi.  So it's the receiver for mobile DTV.  Kind of like a sling catcher?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It takes the broadcast mobile DTV

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  which is that separate broadcasting  of digital television  that they use for phones a lot.  Like the Flow TV?  It's similar to Flow TV.  And it adds it to any device.  Including a phone or a portable media device.  It's interesting.  So that you can get 30 plus channels  on your mobile phone.  And wherever there's broadcasts.  That's kind of what Flow's business model was too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Flow sells a little tiny TV.  But really they said  that's just almost to prove that we can do it.  Really what we're doing is reselling  this 700 megahertz television connectivity  where we rebroadcast  real time live sports and stuff.  And you can get it on your phone.  Is it Vcast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the same kind of technology.  I think it's just different people doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Vcast was not using  I think the DTV.  I don't think it's using this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The same one that Tivet is using.  No. But the thing about Tivet that's cool is  it adds it to everything.  So T-I-V-O-T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's from a company called Valips.  V-A-L-U-P-S.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And how much is it going to be?  It's a subscription thing.  So it doesn't really matter how much it's going to be.  It's going to be a month, right?  That's going to be the big issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll find out.  Do you want to watch live TV on your mobile?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there are very rare occasions.  And that's the problem with the whole product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like the Academy Awards and you're stuck in the subway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or some game that you record on your DVR.  I say no like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you know what?  I don't want to watch Lost.  But I might want to watch a live event.  And I definitely watched  Blizzard, BlizzCon,  on my phone while I was walking the dog  because I had it on direct TV.  I was using Sling.  And I've watched Twitter on the Ustream app.  We're on the mobile phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sure all the Revision 3 stuff is too.  So they say $90 to $120.  I don't think there will be a subscription.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No monthly.  It's just a broadcast.  This is basically an antenna.  It's just picking up a broadcast.  So it's just a fancy antenna that goes in your pocket  and has built in Wi-Fi.  Flow is a rebroadcast service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you would have to pay a monthly fee  because they're actually cashing and rebroadcasting.  But the advantage of Flow is they cash it.  So you can lose connectivity.  And it won't buffer.  I mean it's almost like kind of buffering in the phone.  So that's kind of interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I could see wanting to have.  Although you'd have to be a pretty big TV buff.  But I could definitely see it for news.  I mean there's going to be those moments when you get a CNN breaking news alert.  How cool would it be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Dr. J as an IPTV guy, don't we want to be everywhere?  I mean that's the idea.  I'd like to be on the big screen, but I'd also like to be on the little screen.  I want my Tivet to work with my Ford Touch enabled car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well my thing is you want to be on something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But only when you're pulled over, Molly Wood.  You want to be on something that someone already has, in my opinion.  Because asking people to carry more stuff is insane.  I know that's the problem.  Or even buying a Tivet.  I mean it should just be part of the service that you get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See that's the problem with the glasses too.  More stuff.  Yeah that's absolutely true.  I could just see all those 3D glasses gathering dust underneath the TV.  Oh god.  The clutter factor alone makes me crazy.  And you've got to buy more.  Because if you have a big family gathering, people come over and you can't watch it.  You'll need kid size.  Yeah.  And you need chargers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then your kid's going to break them.  Like my toddler, come on.  I'm not letting them anywhere near those fancy Panasonic charger jobbies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Tivet broadcasts over Wi-Fi to your device.  So can you use more than one device on one Tivet?  Well that's what I wonder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No it's this little tiny mini Wi-Fi.  Right?  Because the Tivet is itself a station that does a little bit of a zap over to your phone.  It probably has like a 1mm range.  Otherwise people would be watching your TV.  Yeah.  You could just start up a TV station in your building.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're listening to TWIT, watching it too I hope.  Live.twit.tv with Molly Wood and Tom Merritt from CNET's Buzz Out Loud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jay Adelson from dig.com.  And we're going to have more of the news from the consumer.  And we're going to have more of the news from the consumer.  And we're going to have more of the news from the consumer.  And we're going to have more of the news from the consumer.  Before we do that, I would like to mention my friends at audible.com.  Before we do that, I would like to mention my friends at audible.com.  Does anybody here listen to audiobooks?  Anybody at all?  Yes.  Yes? Yes. Yes. Good.  You know it's interesting.  Well it's funny because when we first started doing this years ago,  It wasn't...  Not that many people did it, but I think now all geeks do some audiobooks.  Because we all have little devices that we can listen.  I guess that kind of really confirms why it's very interesting.  Really confirms what we just said that,  you got to work on the device you got.  To me,  I would rather listen to an audiobook  than watch television on my device.  The picture that I see in my head  is so much better than anything  that I'm going to see even on a big screen TV.  And that's what I love about audiobooks.  I read a lot.  The other thing I love is that I have a busy life.  And I don't get as much reading time as I'd like.  If you are in the car  and you're not reading, or you're at the gym on the treadmill  and you're watching Oprah,  it probably adds up all those times  when you can't hold a book,  but you've got some time to spare.  You're going to get two or three hours a day of reading.  Imagine the world that will open up to you.  All the books, all the things you've wanted to read,  all the material you've wanted to keep up.  And that's what Audible is so great for.  A-U-D-I-B-L-E, Audible.com  65,000 titles,  radio shows, comedy performances,  as well as books.  And books in every category.  Audible is a great book for nonfiction  and home improvement and self-help  and science fiction, the best collection of science fiction ever.  I know with Sword and Laser you're always recommending  when it's possible, an Audible  version of the book.  Because, again, who has time to read  but we always have time to listen.  Audible.com slash twiit2 is the URL  if you'd like to sign up  for the Platinum account and get two free books.  Audible.com slash twiit,  the number 2.  The Platinum account is two books a month.  And the only plan I have, I easily go through two books a month.  In fact, I know people, I've talked to people with long commutes  that have two or three Platinum accounts  because they go through two, four, six books a month.  Two's a good one to start with.  Two books a month, first two books are yours.  Absolutely free.  You can cancel it any time and you get to keep those books.  So there's no cost, no obligation to you.  Go to Audible.com slash twiit2  and sign up for Audible today.  I think you're going to thank me for it later.  It really is a great way.  And I think a lot of geeks are doing Audible.  I think that's one of the kind of in fashion things to do  is listen to audiobooks.  Because we all listen to podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what's interesting about audiobooks that I like  is that you know exactly how long it's going to take you to finish the book.  That's a good point. I never thought of that.  You could say, oh, I need to finish this by Tuesday  for a discussion or whatever.  You can schedule the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  David Foster Wallace, Infinite Justice, it's taking me 15 years to read.  You know?  Some books just take longer than others.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But in Audible, you know.  I'm reading that on my Kindle, which I find vaguely encouraging  I don't have to look at page numbers.  I'm like 30% sounds like a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's right. It works for me.  I've read 10 times as much since I stopped being intimidated by the size of books.  That's a good point.  Kindle, they're all the same size.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then someone gave me the physical copy just as a supplement.  And I thought, I never would have picked this up.  Kryptonomicon, you know.  Oh yeah. Anathem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Baroque cycle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't even get me started on those.  We're not doing an ad at this point, but Kryptonomicon and Anathem  are both on Audible and really good listens.  Those books will engage you and pull you in.  I loved Anathem.  I thought that was such a good book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually just pushed it on a friend of mine who normally doesn't read that kind of book  and she texted me yesterday like,  I love this book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is the newest Neal Stephenson novel.  He's got Snow Crash and the Baroque cycle,  which I never did finish.  I couldn't even get through the first one.  You loved it? I finished it.  That's because you're educated.  Because I have no life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He likes books that are just about knowing things.  It's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's interesting stuff.  That stuff takes you someplace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I loved though Anathem.  What's funny is, at first it's a science fiction book  and then it's a book about monks.  It just goes all over the place.  But it engages you.  It makes up a new language.  You have to figure out what they're talking about.  But it somehow resonates.  He is a master.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I loved the sense of scale in that book.  The idea that humanity had progressed 5,000 years  and then it was just this perspective-inducing read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you know what just came out?  It's probably not on Audible yet.  It's Daniel Suarez Freedom.  It's the sequel to Demon, which I know Demon's on Audible.  I don't know either book.  Demon is great.  You've got to read Demon.  A guy who owned an online gaming company dies.  A demon goes off and starts investigating his death.  A demon?  Not just investigating his death, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's almost like a giant booby trap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's like some weird kind of universe where demons exist.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's an internet.  It's a computer demon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it starts using the network to investigate his death  and start taking revenge and then start setting up a dark net.  Oh, I've got to find out more about this.  This sounds exciting.  I don't know what I've walked into.  I'm going to go to the next one.  I'm going to go to the next one.  I'm going to go to the next one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know what I've walked into.  Clearly, you would seem to have walked into a book group.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not sure what happened.  It was a tech podcast.  Now it's a book group.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Dr. Kiki is here. She's been out on the shore floor all day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have. It's been so great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So exciting.  For people who are just watching this or listening to Twitter,  we've been at CES for all four days of CES  and doing kind of weird, wacky stuff.  We've been streaming live.  We've been recording all the shows here.  Dr. Kiki's been here as co-host, but she's also  been on this crazy wireless rig that Colleen Bill is using.  That is so impressive.  I'm so blown away by Colleen.  Colleen's amazing.  It uses EVDO.  You weren't doing streaming. You were just recording.  But we were using it to stream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yesterday we were doing live streaming from the shore floor  running all around South Hall, upstairs South Hall,  Center Hall.  Today it's just been to tape, so no live stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We'll get all of that out on the feed  in the next couple of days.  You'll see more and more stuff.  We'll have a live stream of CES.  All of our coverage will be there.  I think our goal was, it's funny,  I used to say this when we were at Tech TV,  is to do a virtual trade show,  but we were so tied to the form  and the big lights and the big cameras  and the stage that we couldn't really do  what you do at a trade show.  This wireless rig has let us walk around,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  go to parties.  It's been great. I've been running around  and we weave through the crowd  and come up and interview people on the spot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're really at the show with you.  The real experience without the foot pain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The sweat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  At home you can put your feet up  and rest and relax, but here we are getting sore feet.  For you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually here, I'm going to go a step further.  No pun intended.  We're getting permanent nerve damage for you.  Some years after CES, my little toe will be numb  for like months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tom and I were talking about this  because every year you forget.  It's like childbirth. Otherwise you'd never repeat it.  Every year you forget how awful it was  and you go back and with the highest of hopes  like, oh I'm going to go see a show.  But you know what it is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sleep deprivation  causes long term memory loss.  No, no really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That makes perfect sense.  I think that really is why you forget childbirth.  It doesn't have anything to do with the pain.  You're so tired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It also explains why fathers are supportive.  Because they're not obviously  they're losing sleep too, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Otherwise they would bolt.  I don't know how we got to turning CES into childbirth.  We went from book group to mom's group.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And dad's group.  And let me tell you about the shoes I'm wearing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's talk about shoes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So did you see anything today, Keke,  that was interesting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh I saw all sorts of things.  A couple of my favorite things today.  The Panasonic booth.  I always love the earthquake booth behind us.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You may hear it on the audio podcast.  I think it's rolling off on the video stream.  Because it's about 20 hertz.  It's as low as you can get.  We're all getting a good massage from it though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Great foot massage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The Panasonic booth has a great eco section.  And that was something that I went through  and took a look at their home fuel cell.  And their solar technology.  Their home energy management system  that they've developed.  So that you know where you're using electricity.  And how you're losing it in various ways.  How you're using it.  And more effectively use your energy.  And lower your energy costs.  So that's something that's really cool.  Also far though it's only available in Japan.  So we just have to wait for them to bring it over here.  And then there's a Fuji film.  Little 3D camera.  Handheld digital camera.  3D, 2D capability.  Now I can make my own 3D movies.  It does still in video photography.  And you can, it's just that  the trick is it has these two lenses that are  eye distance apart.  It has a stereoscopic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Last year at iStage there was that 3D webcam.  I can't remember what it was called.  But it had the two little eyeballs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's cute as heck.  I'm going to feel so left out if everything goes 3D.  It's okay, don't worry.  You and me Molly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want 2D.  I want 1D.  That's harder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My line in the sand is I'm not doing it until I get ocular implants.  That's right. Get the implants.  That's the way to go.  I'm holding out for the new eyeballs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the thing. We all report on this.  The advancements in technology.  And where this next step is.  And we see what's coming.  But we're used to watching things in 2D.  And that's what we grew up with.  Is it that kids of tomorrow are going to grow up with 3D  in watching it?  And that's what they'll be used to.  And so that'll just be the thing.  And then when video or images go a different direction  will they be the old farts who are going  when I was a kid  this 3D thing is never going to happen.  Is it just a generational thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know. I say bring it on.  Bring it all on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jay is so open.  I'm actually with you on the 3D part of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can I tell you though.  So I went to a demo of  I saw the Dolby 3D  and I saw the real 3D and I got both those demos.  And in both cases part of what they showed you  was not the things  that were filmed for 3D effects.  Just regular old stuff.  Like a football game.  I think sports is really the killer app.  Looking at that stuff I said to myself  I'm not aware of it.  It just feels like I'm standing next to the field.  Then suddenly 3D  isn't really a big change for you.  It really just feels more normal  than 2D.  If it's done really well.  Unfortunately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just keep coming back to that.  I know it seems like a small thing.  For years I wouldn't bowl

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  because you had to rent the shoes.  It's the same principle.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can buy your own shoes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm just going to point out  you could have bought your own shoes.  That's too much of a commitment.  I could picture you with a bowling bag.  Ralph Cramden here.  Hey it's awesome.  Midwest where I'm from.  Nobody misses with the Jesus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have to grow my pinky finger out.  I just by the way  added Freedom and Damon to my audible.  Is Freedom available too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Freedom just came out two days ago.  We're actually going to interview Daniel

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  on Sword and Laser next week.  Is Freedom as good as...  I'm about three quarters the way through Freedom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Back to Book Group.  I want to make those my audible picks.  We do get two books if you go to audible.com  audible.com slash twt2.  We could do a Daniel Suarez marathon.  Hot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have a question.  I think there should be a most curious and weird.  Alright.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I got one that was curious and weird.  It is a bluetooth ring called the Orb.  And you put it on your finger.  I saw it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh my. And it's the caller ID.  It's the caller ID.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It goes on an OLED screen across it.  It says Jay's Calling.  You could push a button.  It says I'm busy. Call back later.  Or you take off the ring.  You unfold it. You put it over your ear.  And it's your bluetooth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what we're talking about.  That's curious and weird but almost useful.  But that has a use.  How do you explain USB cigarettes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love that.  That was going to be mine. You took mine.  No I'm not mad because I'm so happy that you went there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is there a slogan smoke them or mount them?  What does that say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Burn through your data.  I think the company is called.  I just couldn't figure out

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  what the marketing gimmick was.  I think it was generally quit smoking.  But you actually smoke.  It's an actual cigarette.  It's an electric cigarette.  It's an electric cigarette with a little charge in it.  You smoke and you blow smoke back out  as you breathe it in.  The question is, is that healthy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No it's not a cigarette. It's a nicotine delivery system.  But it's not healthy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean you don't get tar.  You get the nicotine.  Kids, am I the only one

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that realizes the real purpose of this?  Is for kids?  It has nothing to do with tobacco.  No seriously, it's a vaporizer.  What are you all looking at me funny for?  I don't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't load a joint on it or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't?  No I don't think so.  Oh and the charge, you put that instead?  A little THC?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But they can't sell it as a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's like a lot of work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why do you have to hack your electric cigarette just to get to the carton?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It didn't occur to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You look like Herman's Herman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did just move to Marin.  Oh you need one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go to your local head shop.  Any other nominees for the weird product?  Auto ergonomic keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a keyboard that actually moves like once an hour or so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's an ergonomic keyboard but it changes the position of your arms.  Because they're like look even with an ergonomic keyboard you keep your arms in the same position.  So this thing once an hour just kind of subtly moves it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If they really want to do it right they change the keys around too once in a while.  Really stimulate the brain.  That's just masochistic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What about that thing that you breathe on to control the games?  Oh yeah.  The puffer?  It's like a breath controlled mouse.  Zek-sercist?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You want to share that with anybody else?  You control it via breathing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't have to breathe very hard but just kind of change the direction of your breathing and it moves the cursor on the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They say you breathe with your mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Coming next tongue control.  Oh.  I saw the hand glove.  The hand glove?  I saw the glove.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I saw the foot sock.  The gaming glove is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The gaming glove.  Thank you.  I'm going to say this though because I feel bad.  Wait, I think I might know the name.  It's in his pocket.  It's Peregrine.  Because they gave away, did you see this?  It's a vaporizer.  I mean not vaporizer.  It was a hand sanitizer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Apparently the big schwag of the event wasn't the foam rubber paperweights or anything like that.  It was hand sanitizer.  This place is swine flu central.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Throw me some.  We're all going to die.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm vaccinated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've been out and about the floor all day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't care if I've been vaccinated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll give you a little extra too.  I have a three year old. I've totally had it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Purell's on us ladies and gentlemen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I am so clean now.  Mine has a smell.  There's does. Holy Hannah.  It smells like alcohol.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And all of our skin is going to be even drier now than it already was.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And now we have flying.  Dana's sanitizing.  Now we're home of the flying Purell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't have anything that's cute and weird.  Cute is what I was thinking.  Weird would be good.  I don't have weird. I have cute.  Upstairs in South Hall there was a company that had a little rhinestone studded heart pendant.  That contains a four gig flash drive.  Valentine's Day.  You can carry your data in your heart.  It's the gift for your nerd girlfriend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would love one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's nerd bling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's adorable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Offload all those text messages and save them.  That is special.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If it wasn't before it is now.  It's been a wonderful CES and a great twit from CES.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want to thank you all for being here.  Tom Merritt and Molly Wood.  It was practically a Buzz Out Loud show.  It was great to have you.  You guys are so great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Buzz Out Loud is at cnet.com slash live.  Live.cnet.com or live.cnet.com for the live version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now we start drinking and tomorrow we get on a plane.  Mostly drunk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The CNET setup here was amazing.  They had a special pen for the editors.  They had a dozen video editors and they were all penned up in this glass wall.  You can watch what they're doing.  It smells terrible in there.  All that coverage will be at cnet.com or news.  CES.cnet.com is the home of all that stuff.  Jay Adelson is the CEO of dig.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank you very much for having me Mr. LaPorte.  It's great to see you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm glad to see that you're on vacation and get to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm so glad I finally got here.  It's the best way to do CES is to not work CES.  I partied the whole time on the floor.  Fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know what that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Dr. Kiki Sanford is of course the host of this week in science,  the great science radio show,  and of our own podcast Dr. Kiki's Science Hour  which is seen every Thursday at live.twit.tv at 3pm Pacific, 6pm Eastern.

Editors are still working even though they don't have an aquarium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There will be things posted to the RSS feeds for the next couple of days.  How many hours did you do today?  We got about two hours, over an hour and a half of footage today.  So that's going to be at least two RSS episodes I think.  And there's stuff from yesterday, the day before yesterday,  our live coverage that we've done.  All that has been recorded down and we're cutting and chopping  and the editors are turning it into a beautiful summary of what we've done.  How are you?
