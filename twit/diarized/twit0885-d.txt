Transcript:  It's time for Twit This Week in Tech. I'm Jason Howell filling in for Leo Laporte.  And today we've got some awesome guests. Joining me today is Ashley Esqueda, Roberto Baldwin,  and Megan Maroney, where we have so much fun, so much news to discuss. Amazon buying one  medical. What might prime healthcare actually look like? We take some guesses. Also, Snap  and Twitter earnings lagging. That's largely thanks to a diminishing ad spend market. What  does it mean for big tech? That's coming up. Subscriptions for in-car features. Hot or  not? I think not, but we've got a nice discussion there. How Netflix's identity, which is binging  content is actually biting its butt. Plus so much more coming up next on This Week in Tech.

And just give us a heads up, I guess, if you start getting  dizzy or whatever. I don't, yeah, just give us a heads up. Editor at protocol, of course,  just so people know what you're up to now. But it is so good to see the three of you. This is  going to be a lot of fun. We've got the keys to the sports car this week. So where should we  drive first? We got a dock full of news and I really do not want to start with Elon Musk.  So I don't even know why I said that out loud because it almost makes it happen when you do

Start time: 317.74
End time: 327.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that. I'm going to say now I feel like we have to, I feel like you drove us right. I feel like you  drove us right off the freeway into New York town. It's like, I've been told, you've gone wrong.

Start time: 327.98
End time: 331.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like, don't stare at the sun. Don't look at the sun. And then I looked at the sun. This is

Start time: 331.76
End time: 346.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  exactly what I did. Fine. Real quick. That should just be a recurring segment onto it. It's just,  Elon did something. And then you just talk about it because it was just, it's like a guarantee  every week. There's something going on with Elon Musk. There's, it's a six sided die. And when you

Start time: 346.46
End time: 394.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  roll it, five of them say Musk and the other one is like a random story. Yeah. So what is the thing  that Elon Musk did this time? Well, I guess this has to do with his trial, right? There's this  trial. And between Twitter and Elon Musk, Musk was pushing for it to go to next year, but that's not  happening. Apparently Twitter was pushing for it to happen soon. They want to get this done,  reap whatever reward slash benefit they can from this really just messy, ugly situation. And  apparently it's going to be expedited five day trial going to happen in October. So we aren't  going to have to wait long. I kind of felt like we were going to wait a lot longer. And this whole  Musk thing was going to continue out forever and ever. But I suppose this is good news. What do you

Start time: 394.66
End time: 443.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  all think? Well, that Delaware court of chancery, like they don't, they don't tend to mess around.  They're, this is like a very no nonsense court. And yeah, it ended up, I think the five days is  actually one party wanted a shorter trial. The other wanted a longer one. And then of course,  like Elon Musk said, my legal team needs more time to prepare. We have to push this until next year.  Chancery, nope, nope, we're going to do this in October. It's going to be five days and that's  it. So I think Twitter just wants to put all of this to bed, whatever, come what may, they would  like to move past this. And so I think that this is a real big win for Twitter to not have to kind  of drag this out even longer than it needs to be. It's odd for Elon to want to delay something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The filing itself is funny because it's sort of designed for Twitter. Like it's in, you know,  it has the little poop emoji that he tweeted in it. It's like little pieces that it's almost like  they did it just like perfect for their platform. Like this is how it's going to play out. This is  the speed at which it's going to play out. If you read it, it's just like little tweets,  basically in the filing, which is amazing. It's like a little performance art.

Start time: 474.90
End time: 481.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The entire trial is expected to be rolled out in 140 characters per, you know, side. So I think

Start time: 481.72
End time: 497.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you're absolutely right. I don't know how they're going to pull that off.  Is it 280 now? Is it 280 now? Let's let it double the length.  That's true. They have expanded on that.  Come on, it's expanded. The tweets have been expanded.  Classic Twitter.  It's going to be one long thread. One long thread.  And the lawyers are not allowed to edit anything.

Start time: 497.96
End time: 500.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, no editing. My God.  Sorry.  No.

Start time: 500.76
End time: 509.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sorry.  There will be not a single edit made. No edits. Unless they subscribe to Twitter Blue,  in which case you can undo an argument. There you go.

Start time: 511.36
End time: 525.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you all using Twitter Blue these days? I signed up for it initially. And then after like  a couple of weeks, like I think my credit card, like I had to replace my credit card,  there was fraud or something like that. And I just never updated it. So apparently I'm  not missing it that much. But what about y'all?

Start time: 527.46
End time: 560.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I use Twitter so much that I'm like, I feel like I like some of the features it has. So  it's like helpful for me. But the undo is really nice. Like the click send now. And then it's like,  hey, if you want to undo this in like 10 seconds, then like, here's your chance.  Because it'll give me that one last like proofreading, which that's always when I  catch it right after I post. So once I hit that tweet button, then it's like,  oh, there's my typo undo that. Like, let's just start over. So that's helpful. I like that.  That's a nice feature. I actually do appreciate that feature.

Start time: 561.66
End time: 561.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Start time: 562.22
End time: 599.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. That was the only feature I used. And for $5 a month, I felt like it was worth it.  But I also felt like it kind of trained me a little bit to take that extra look.  So I don't know, you know, you form a habit in like 30 days. So like now I do feel like  I think a little bit more and then I do that last proofread before I tweet. But  in the no ads thing never really worked for me. Like I would always click and get at,  you know, like you're supposed to be able to see content with no ads or maybe see it without a  subscription. I don't know. That was the no ads thing is very weird because it's like for LA Times,

Start time: 599.46
End time: 632.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  like if I click on an LA Times article, it says you need a subscription. And I guess if I have  a subscription, that would be a thing I wouldn't see other ads on. It's very odd and it doesn't  work and it's weird and bad. And I don't like how it's set up. It should just be here are the  partnerships we have. If you click on an article in the Twitter app, we will open it in our own  proprietary browser and you can read it like in a reader mode or something like that with no ads.  And that's it. Like that should be how it works. But unfortunately that is not the case. And it is

Start time: 632.18
End time: 669.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  very annoying. Yeah. And it's not hard to do that.  Oh no, it's not. Yeah. I thought about signing up and then I thought, I don't care enough. I tweet,  oh my God, a lot, so much. And they're all full of typos. And I'm like, you know, I've gone this far.  Why mess with the brand? That's my brand. Exactly. Like why mess with it? Just let it go.  That's who you are. If five tweets happen and none of them have typos, people are just going  to assume I've been kidnapped. Or hacked. I understand. Or both. That's a good fail safe

Start time: 669.24
End time: 674.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that you've inadvertently created for yourself. I like that. Yeah. It's my security. It's my info

Start time: 674.58
End time: 700.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  sec. Very nice. Apparently we don't care about Musk because we're just talking about Twitter and  it has nothing to do with Elon Musk. And you know what? That's just the way it deserves to be.  That actually makes a lot of sense. There's so many other things he did this week too. Like today,  yesterday, day before. It's just nonstop. So much of it is just so tabloid-y though. So I end up  tuning it out because it just feels like noise more than anything. So much noise. I did almost

Start time: 701.22
End time: 763.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  get canceled on Twitter this week. Should we talk about that about Elon? Oh really? Do tell.  Now I'm going to get canceled again. So I got home from work and my three teenagers were at  the dinner table and I was like, did you see the pictures of Elon Musk without his shirt on?  And my daughter said, mom, you cannot body shame anyone, including billionaires. She's 19.  Smarter than me. And so I tweeted that. And I said, I thought she was wrong, which if you know me,  I was joking. I'm not a body shamer. But then someone retweeted it and there was a whole big  thing about if you body shame a billionaire, anyone with a similar body will feel like now  they know what you think about them. It was a big learning moment. But it was one of those moments  where I was like, oh yeah, I guess everyone who follows me and follows the people who are going  to retweet me don't really know when I'm joking. So yeah. And then somebody retweeted it today.  Don't body shame the rich, just eat the rich, which I thought was good. That's a good thought.

Start time: 764.22
End time: 773.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you're going to eat the rich, you shouldn't be body shaming them.  If anything wrong with eating the rich, right? Nothing wrong with eating the rich or taxing them.

Start time: 773.98
End time: 786.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And also there are just so many other ways to like poke fun at them.  Did you see his Elden Ring build? It's garbage. Like that's that's the thing.  There you go.

Start time: 786.92
End time: 791.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I will throw the word maidenless around without remorse. That's my favorite insult for people

Start time: 798.86
End time: 803.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  now. It's just that's part of my permanent lexicon, just maidenless behavior.

Start time: 806.12
End time: 944.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, let's move on from Elon Musk topless to just Twitter and Snap. And the only reason that I'm  going here is because I'm seeing kind of like a thing happening. I think this is kind of interesting  to talk about. Snap had its weakest quarterly earnings report ever, slowing its growth, the  slowest growth in history as a public company. And of course, the economy right now, everything's  in flux, everything's upside down, it feels like, especially the last six months, things have changed  a lot in a very short amount of time. And so what they're seeing, because they rely so heavily on  the ad spend, is that that money is just being removed, right? Not to mention Apple's privacy  policy changes, which have had a dramatic effect on Snap. This is, of course, the changes that  allowed iOS users to opt out of ad tracking. So that's making things more difficult for a company,  a poor company like Snap. Shares dropped 25% on the news. And then you got Twitter,  which reported lower than expected earnings for the quarter. Their ad revenue actually only grew  2% year over year. That's compared to 23% growth last year. And so a lot of what I was reading  about this has to do with the ad spend slowdown that's happening right now, the economy. Of course,  with Twitter, you've got the shirtless Elon that we were just talking about. There's probably a  lot of blame that can be placed on him as far as that's concerned. And actually, Twitter's spent  out of pocket a good amount of money just on that alone, $33 million between April and June.  But setting all that aside, we're in this time of economic uncertainty. Apple's privacy move  is compounding the pain that's felt by tech companies who are just really, their business  is totally reliant on ad spending and data tracking and all this crazy stuff. It just seems  like Twitter and Snap are a couple of examples. And I feel like we're going to be cascading effect  as we move forward further into this year, we're going to see a lot more companies feeling the  effects of this. What do you all think? That's just not where people are. Twitter is its own thing.

Start time: 946.18
End time: 1041.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think Twitter has always, they've always struggled to turn a profit, to make Twitter,  to really blow out Twitter into something similar to a Facebook. I think Twitter is a weird  outlier in its own way, but that's not where anybody is. And so it's like Snapchat is competing  with Instagram and TikTok. And the thing is, there was a point where there was a mix of younger and  older people on Snapchat. And now it's the younger people have broken off for TikTok and the older  people have broken off for Reels. They're over on Instagram. And so there's just nobody there.  It's not in use the same way that Instagram is being used and that TikTok is being used. And so  it's just, I don't know anybody who uses Snapchat as their main mode of conversation with anybody  anymore. I mean, used to, but not anymore. And I think that's sort of the struggle that they're  going to have is they're going to find it very difficult because all of the millennials and  older are on Facebook and Instagram and all of the Gen Z kids are on TikTok now. And so they've all  broken off from Snapchat and they're like, bye, this is much more interesting to us. And also  you have apps like Be Real, which a lot of influencers who are in that younger demographic,  they're also breaking off to apps like that. So it's just, it's a scenario where Snapchat is  not in a great place and I don't know what they can do to bring people back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think I've opened Snapchat in about four years. So yeah, there was a point where like,  hey, we're on Snapchat, but we were all on, you know, MySpace at some point. We were all on  Friendster at some point. We were all on Facebook at some point. That thing. Yeah, we were all on  Facebook. And mostly I just get on Facebook to yell about Facebook, about how angry I am with them.  And then, I mean, mostly I'm on Facebook because of the bands, because that's where everyone says,  hey, go see a show here on Facebook. But even for that, it's become completely unusable.  It's just, Facebook is really good at selling ads and that's about it. Snapchat is really good at  just, I don't know, sticking around longer than I anticipated, really.

Start time: 1091.04
End time: 1095.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Snapchat is really good at not going away. Every generation, it's like, it's not even

Start time: 1097.48
End time: 1183.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  every generation. It's just every so often you're going to have this churn where it's like, oh,  because no younger generation wants to use the social media platform that the older generations  have used. They want their own thing. And I get that. I totally understand that. I respect it.  That's what it is. Gen X was big on MySpace. Then it was boomers with Facebook. Now they're like,  but it wasn't that way at the beginning. And then it was like, oh, well, now we have MySpace,  so like, bye. And they left all the boomers on Facebook. Then it became, oh, well, here's  Twitter. Here's Snapchat. Here's, it's just, Instagram for a long time was like very,  before it got bought by Facebook. They're just like every single kind of like group that comes  up and starts using social media, they want their own thing. They want their own thing.  They want to feel ownership of it. They want to feel like it's their community, their age group,  their demo, because that's what they want. They want to interact with people who are like them.  And so it's very hard. I am surprised most of these companies have survived as long as they have,  just because, I guess now it's like, if you look at the demographic use of each one of them,  it skews heavily towards one column. And I think TikTok in particular is like,  it's just exploding right now with users because that's where everyone is. And that's where all  the trends and the memes are coming from. That's the thing.

Start time: 1184.96
End time: 1192.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And the stuff that's happening on TikTok is ending up on other platforms as well.  It's like, all this crazy stuff is happening on TikTok. And yes, it's just like, kick that out.

Start time: 1194.18
End time: 1196.68

Transcript:  Instagram, so I can see what TikToks I haven't seen yet. Like, oh, this one didn't show up in  the algorithm. I'll go over the Instagram and watch it there.

Start time: 1207.60
End time: 1246.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When my kids borrow my phone because apparently they know my password. Yeah. They're ending up  on YouTube watching the TikToks that are there. And actually, yeah. And actually, so this was a  surprise, totally tying with what we're talking about. I was away with my family on a swim meet  for a swim meet for my daughter. And while she was there, she was with a couple of friends and  she had my phone at one point. And then when I got my phone back, Snapchat was installed.  And some of her friends from the swim meet were friended. So apparently some people are using  Snapchat and younger kids apparently have Snapchat and use it regularly.

Start time: 1247.92
End time: 1320.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's what your friends have and it's what your parents don't want you to have.  Snapchat was the big thing. Nobody's parents because, oh, things just disappear,  which actually turns out to be pretty good for kids when things disappear.  Totally agree.  Yeah. So I think, I mean, my kids use it and I will use it sometimes because they,  I like to see their bitmojis, especially when my daughter went away to college. So I could see  she was all the way in New York. But that's really the only way that I used it. But all of these  companies are dependent on advertising dollars and those are right now in the toilet. So that's the  other thing that is affecting all of these. And if you already, Snapchat lasted this long for  whatever reason, but it might be the change that Apple made with tracking, might be the final  kick in the pants, tossing them off the edge. Because they really can't make money right now.  Because it's the changes with the Apple, it's the war in Ukraine, it's just the general  macro environment. It's all these things. And if you were already not doing that great,  or if you were a Twitter where someone was tweeting about how terrible your platform was,  and also I'd like to buy it maybe, then no, you're not.

Transcript:  Hypothetically speaking.

Start time: 1327.18
End time: 1331.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that's what I think. They're all suffering right now. Anyone dependent on advertising is suffering.

Start time: 1332.82
End time: 1484.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, for sure. There's two different directions we could go right now.  So I'm going to go to boring one, just real quick. And then after that, I have to take a break. And  then we're going to talk about B-real because you mentioned B-real and I definitely want to talk  about that because I think it's super interesting. Before we go there, I think this ties in with what  you're talking about, Megan, which is this American Data Privacy and Protection Act. That is basically  a new draft going through Washington, D.C. right now. There was an original draft in June,  many revisions since, and this is focusing on data minimization. So it ties in this whole ad  tracking thing. What does a future of big tech look like if the mechanisms that they're used  to relying on in order to stay in business and do what they've done for so many years,  is the rules are completely changed. And apparently, this draft spells out 17 permitted  purposes for data collection and the use of the users. Things like authentication, things like  fraud prevention, transactional data, that sort of stuff. Anything outside of those 17 purposes  would be prohibited. So in essence, you can't collect data that you don't actually need.  And these are the categories that you might actually need data for. And if they aren't those  categories, then you can't. And I think it'll be interesting if this is a bipartisan bill  that you're that's taking shape right now and it happens, the impacts that this has for  the tech companies that really rely on this. One thing that it points out is targeted advertising.  And actually, people who are really advocating for privacy say this is kind of one of the  disappointing parts of this bill. It would impose limits on this, but only some, not all. I think  data privacy maximalists would say, get rid of targeted advertising entirely. And of course,  I'd be amazed if they actually went in that direction. But instead, they're saying,  no, you can't do this to miners. You can't have targeted advertising based on sensitive data like  health, geolocation, private communication, that sort of stuff. And no following people around on  the internet tracking everything they do, like dropping some sort of tracking mechanism that  then shows that when I go over to this site, I buy this thing and how it all ties into place.  And I don't know, I'm curious to see how if this happens the way it's described,  it's going to impact the business model of so many of these companies that are just making  money hand over fist over fist, the way things have been.

And at some point, somebody had to say,  privacy advocates and tech reporters and a lot of people have been saying, this is too much. You  know too much about us. You don't get to know every single little bitty thing that's happening  in my life because I searched for something that I thought was private and now you're using it to  serve me ads because you think I'm pregnant or to serve me ads because you think I enjoy, you know,  going to Thailand or the, you know, just weird little things that you're searching all the time  or you're doing or where you're at. It's too much. And if you can bring that,  at least squelch it a bit, I think it helps for individuals and it helps. I mean, the industry as  a whole, they just need to figure it out. They're supposed to be smart people. If they can't figure  it out, then I don't know what to tell them. That's the thing is they've been, you know,  decades of how smart they are and how they're going to change the world.

Oh, we've been building everything on the backs  of journalists, but we've been stealing all the ad goes, all the ad dollars go to Facebook and  Google because someone gets on, yeah, that sits on, you know, people sit on Facebook all day and  that's what the ad advertisers want. They don't want the, Oh, someone went to a site and they  read an article for 30 seconds. They probably didn't see our ad. Meanwhile, over on Facebook,  someone was on this site for two hours and our ad was right there while they scrolled up and down  and gotten a fight with their cousin about whoever was running for office and some small like school  district that no one knows anything about other than someone made a big fuss about their stupid,  stupid ideas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  be real. I am. Yeah, we should be be real friends. I have, I started being on be real through my  daughter who she was like, you have to get on this. This was, I don't know. It was like,  right when she like last summer. I don't remember when it was. And then,  then it was just my kids for a really long time. And then it became, now it's my kids, several of  their friends who requested me. And so I felt like that was fair to accept their request. And  then for former coworkers, Jason, Tom Merritt, Mike Elgin, and Willa Remus from Washington Post.  So it's like four guy tech journalists and a bunch of 17 and 19 year olds. That's who I follow.  Yeah, I've noticed in my short amount of time with be real that it is not about amassing,

Start time: 1848.12
End time: 1875.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  like collecting friends. You know what I mean? Like a lot of services, like when I started  Facebook, it was all about like, I don't know, I knew you for two minutes. Sure, you're my friend.  And it was about getting that number high, you know, high, as high as possible back in 2008 or  whatever it was. Be real seems to be a lot more, a lot more controlled, I suppose. What about you,  Ashley? I mean, I'm not sure if you're on the show, but I'm sure you're on the show.  What about you, Ashley, Roberto? Have you used this at all?

Start time: 1875.94
End time: 2138.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I love it. I just like the idea of it, which is that for those of you who have not used  Be Real, if you're listening to this, so it's an app that is, I would say, like Jason, it's a  controlled social media. So it's not just posting publicly whenever you feel like it. You know,  you got to basically the app flags you and says you've got two minutes to post. Like this is the  time you get a two, everybody gets the same two minute window to take a picture of what you're  currently doing, which is why it's called Be Real. It's just like, no filters, no, nothing, no AR,  nothing like that. It's just very straightforward. Takes a picture with your front facing camera and  your rear facing camera. And that's what gets posted to your profile. And there are rules that  it has. So if you post late, other people will not, you won't be able to see other people's  photos, their pictures for the day. If you delete, if you want to delete a Be Real,  you have to, you can only delete a picture and you're not allowed to delete the next day's picture.  Like the next one they post. They won't let you delete it. Like it'll say you can't, so we'll let  you delete this one, but you can't delete the next one. Like, so whatever that is. And it says,  and there are, there are things where you can say there was a bug or I can't see anything or,  you know, what have you, but it's really interesting that,  so I, it feels like Be Real is the antithesis of what most people think social media is for  at this point, which I think is what is so appealing about it to a lot of Gen Z kids.  I read, this is like a weird kind of, I promise I'm coming back to Be Real in this point. I read  a really interesting Ask Reddit the other day and someone said, I just don't understand Gen Z humor.  Like I don't, here's like some examples and they listed some examples and it's like, you know,  Gen X humor is like very kind of South Parky sort of nihilistic. Then you get into millennial  stuff where it's like this existential crisis humor. And then you get into Gen Z and it's just  like, it's, it's insane. Like you don't know what it even is half the time. And everybody's just  kind of like weirdly in on the joke because it's just a vibe. Like the memes are vibes. Like they're  not really, they're not at all. Like they don't make sense a lot of the time, but it's a vibe.  And like, I get it. I understand that. And that's cool. Like I love it. But someone had responded  to that Ask Reddit and they said, it's really interesting because Gen Z's meme humor specifically  is it moves so quickly. Their, their version of the internet moves so fast and evolves so,  so quickly that a millennial or a Gen X or, or, you know, boomer, whatever, what have you  might post something. And that meme could live for weeks or months. Like, and in the early times  of the internet, a meme would live for a year. Like it's, it was just like, you know, we all  are familiar with the meme. I can has cheeseburger. Like that is an iconic long time meme that doesn't  exist for Gen Z. It's just like, this is the, you're living in the moment from moment to moment,  meme to meme. And it gets remixed and regurgitated and redone and re like just transformed so many  times in the span of 24 hours that it just becomes chaos. Like it's chaotic, but it's a vibe again,  like the, the it's funny because it's a vibe. And so it's, I thought that was so fascinating.  And be real to me seems like it is working very hard against that. And it's just like, no, this  is just like, show people what you're doing right in this moment. It's the same to everybody shares  the same two minutes. So it's really a little snapshot of like, what's going on in time right  now at your phone. There you go. That's it as a very simple, very straightforward. And it has,  it's got bumpers on it, right? It's got guardrails on it to keep you from gaming the system, the way  so many other social media platforms have been gamed by both influencers, advertisers, everything  in between. It's just super fascinating. I find be real like the so, so, so fascinating. It's very

Start time: 2138.90
End time: 2229.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  interesting to me. It gives me flashbacks to early Twitter, to be honest, like earlier,  early Twitter. Yeah. I just, just in the sense that when, when Twitter first came out, it was  kind of like, what do we even use this for? You mean, we're just supposed to share what we're  doing right now. I guess I'm eating a sandwich. Does anyone really want to know that I'm eating a  sandwich half the time with be real, what you end up getting, or at least what I end up getting in  my feed is people sitting in front of their computers, right? So you end up seeing like a  screen with whatever they're working on, then a shot of them sitting at the computer, which isn't  the most exciting thing. I realized, Hey, join the social network where all you see is what people  are, you know, that they're working at their computers, just like you. But, but I think  what's, what's interesting or appealing to me about it is that because of the guardrails that  you were talking about, Ashley, because of kind of the rules of play, so to speak, and this idea  that you can't like, there's no easy way for you to go all Instagram and show, you know, your  luxurious yacht, because you just happen to be standing in front of one, you know, with the two  minutes that it happens or whatever, there's no painting your life to be anything, hopefully,  other than what it actually is. And it's kind of the blandness of life ends up being the appealing  factor of be real for me. It's kind of like, it's kind of like confirmation that like, Oh, yeah,  my life can be pretty boring, too. Nice. You know, it's you're not always seeing just the really  great stuff that someone's doing, you're seeing kind of the boring stuff that they're doing. And  that's cool too, because that's what being a human is all about. So there's a very funny tweet about

Start time: 2229.90
End time: 2238.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it that says, I can't believe we're all so fake. This is from Connor, Connor Franta. It says, I  can't believe we're also fake. They're now making social media apps that force us to be ourselves.

Start time: 2247.17
End time: 2274.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just like that there's now a social media that'll just chronicle late stage capitalism  of just sitting in front of our computers with the existential dread in our eyes.  How are things going? Well, you know, you know, staring at this box again.  I also just literally signed up for it like two seconds ago. I'm like, yeah, that sounds fine.  Whatever. I need a tech reporter guy. So yeah, it's the same name. S T R N G W I S. Go ahead.

Start time: 2275.76
End time: 2305.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Don't follow me. Okay. So the fatal flaw would be real. And I don't know why they didn't think of  this. It seems quite obvious is that the app is terrible. And some people think that's like very  unique. But the reason why it almost never works because everyone is using it at the exact same  time. And like that is inherent in what you do. Like everybody opens it up and takes the picture.  And then so it's like, well, didn't you know that like, as you scaled as you got more users,

Start time: 2308.94
End time: 2313.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  data spike is very bad. It starts at the same time every day.

Start time: 2317.96
End time: 2382.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can change your time zone like to European time zone or like US time zone, but not like  you had little US time zones, but you can be on a different time zone. But it's basically the  same time every day. So what has happened is like, I've been using it as like, I don't really do it  every, you know, every time, like, but you can do it at any time in the day, it just shows that  you've done it late. And then after you do it, you can see everyone's photos. So like, I haven't done  mine today. And I'm definitely going to do it of you four to have like a very meta be real situation  when you least expect it. But that's the thing. It's like, it doesn't, it doesn't really.  But I do still love it for all the reasons that we've discussed. The other thing that I don't know  if you know this is that you can take you can retake the picture if you don't like what you  look like, but it will notify like doesn't notify but you can see can look at people's be reals.  And like if you know, if I see that Jason had like this lovely picture of his steel cut oats  and blueberries and his smiling morning face, I can see like how many times did he take that picture.  So it'll say like that you like took it, you know, until you had the exact right angle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a snitch. Yeah.  I travel a lot to Europe. So is it, so is it, is it based on the phone's time zone or is the  app have its own time zone from where you set it up? Because I travel to Europe a lot. And so will  it correct as I get over there? I think it's only because I think, yeah,

Start time: 2418.26
End time: 2420.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Something like be real though. It's hard to see at this stage. Like, like it's, it's got activity,  it's got movement. Obviously the younger generation users, a lot, a lot of like kids using it.  I don't want to call them kids. A lot of younger people using them. This is what happens when you  get your mid forties. I get off my lawn. But there's a lot of movement right now. Part of me  wonders if an app like be real has a short lifespan, right? Cause it's interesting right,  right now, but like, what does it have the ability to grow into over time? It's kind of built  around these really, you know, like, like we were talking about it, these, these hard and fast rules  like these companies ultimately want to broaden out and become something more. How do you do that

Start time: 2478.46

Transcript:  when you've got these rules? Facebook will just copy this. It'll just be a feature of Facebook  copies where it's like, it'll be like a check-in feature, but it'll just be like, hey, like, here's  this fun little, you know, sub menu on Instagram reels or whatever, or on Instagram where you can  just choose it. And then it's like, Oh, if you'd like to be notified every day to just like snap  a picture, we'll take one of the front and back of your camera or whatever. They'll, they'll just

Start time: 2500.68
End time: 2505.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 2507.50
End time: 2537.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  remember front back, the app that took a picture of the front and the back. Remember them, you think  they're like, Oh, come on. He's front back. Pour one out for front back or went out or path.  Yeah. Oh, I forgot about peach. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I have, I have, yeah. I just sign up for all these  things. So I keep my screen name and now I'm just like, but I'm on be real now. This is the one that's  going to stick. This is the one you're ready to stick around for at least six months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  it's been around. It's been chilling. Yeah. And imagine the data that they can collect. That's  the other thing, because if it's like, if it really is us just doing our regular normal things,  you know, cause if you were like, if you're constantly posting on Instagram about like the  one time you got to, you saved enough money to go to Hawaii for the year for me, like you're not  like, that's not going to be that targeted advertising, right? But if it's like everything  you're doing on a normal day, everything that's in your background, like, I mean, obviously they  have a privacy policy in place and they're not like grabbing all that stuff yet, but it is a  pretty interesting trove of data, just like what you're actually doing in your regular life.

Are you getting a lot of ads for steel cut?  Oh, yes, yes, I am. No, I don't. Yeah. And I don't even think there's like,  there's not even any ads in the app at this point. So that's not pharmaceutical companies.

Transcript:  Prozac. Who knows? Maybe Amazon will buy Be Real and then buy everything. Yeah, they buy everything.  In fact, apparently Amazon is getting further and further into the, it's ambitions of kind of  revitalizing the health industry. They announced its intent to buy One Medical, which is a San  Francisco chain of primary healthcare clinics. Although One Medical, from what I understand,  I wasn't super familiar with this before kind of hearing about this news and reading up a little  bit about it, it's like technologically powered. So it's not just like primary healthcare clinics,  it's got a technological kind of backbone to it. Kind of like a self-service sort of approach.

Start time: 2661.24
End time: 2688.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's kind of like forward. Is this like forward? There's like a series of, there's like a chain  of medical offices that they have like very high tech sort of experience when you go in.  I think it's similar to this. It's like, there's a real heavy focus on like, forward, I guess,  forward trajectory technology and like medicine. Okay. Yeah. Digital services.

Start time: 2689.32
End time: 2725.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. I think One Medical was like aimed at probably like millennials and people like,  it's always an addition to health insurance. So when I worked at Medium, we had this as a benefit,  like it was an extra benefit in addition to medical insurance. It was just easier and faster.  They got in a little bit of trouble because I think like right when vaccines came out,  they like sort of offered to have people who had One Medical skip the line.  Yeah. So it's like, they're just like a disruptor, like Uber and taxis or Airbnb and hotels. That's

Start time: 2725.54
End time: 2792.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  their thing. Right. Right. So Amazon's $3.9 billion all cash deal to acquire. And of course,  everyone jumps to the obvious place, which is, okay, do we trust Amazon to be that hands-on with  our medical information if you happen to be with One Medical? I saw a lot of people online who were  like, oh, seriously? Like, I'm out. If Amazon's in, I'm out. I'm not comfortable with that.  So yeah, I mean, that's, I mean, undeniably, that's an easy place to go. This isn't Amazon's  only foray into this either. They bought PillPack however many years ago. And that's the kind of  like the automated kind of mail order pill delivery service for medication. Of course,  Whole Foods, which isn't healthcare, but it is healthy living. So Amazon kind of has this whole  thing going on right now. But does this concern any of you as far as Amazon being the puppet master  in control of this healthcare wing, so to speak? I mean, they're obviously going to use your data.

And then  they get sort of slapped by the government and they get like a $30,000 fine or something, which  is essentially like the executive lunch budget for the day. Yeah. It's always concerning when  any of these big companies continue to consolidate more ways to get your data,  especially when it comes to healthcare. That's, that's, I don't know. I don't know if I.

Transcript:  It's really prickly. It's really prickly. It's like just a real thorny kind of place to be in,  because the thing is, is, you know, technically they would have to keep that information private,  but also, you know, there's the argument that can be made where it's like, oh, we, and we,  it's the data is anonymous. We, we make sure that it's anonymous before it's used by  Amazon prime or like, you know, but the thing is, is like, it's going to know it's you, right?  Like if you're going to a one medical facility, your phone is there, your geolocation, if you  have any location services on it and you have the Amazon app is all, I mean, it's just, there's a  lot of kind of, there's going to be a lot of coincidences with your data, right? It's just  going to be, it's, oh, it's what a coincidence. You, you got diagnosed with diabetes and now  Amazon is going to recommend to you, like, here's all these sponsored, you know, insulin  pumps that we can recommend to you and you can use your FSA and like all this other, you know,  all this other stuff. So I feel, it always makes me feel icky when like a big tech company buys  company that's in a completely different services vertical. It's just a little,  it's a little weird and it sketches me out a little bit. I mean, I'm not going to,  I hate saying this was like, I'm not going to stop using Amazon. Like I need that convenience  in a lot of ways. Like, and there's a lot of things that I need. I got my hypocrite,  I fully admit it, but also it's just like, yeah, that, that kind of thing is like,  I don't know that I could, I don't know that I could do it. I don't know that I could give my  health data to a company like Amazon, but then it's like, how much do they already know about  you? Right? Like, cause if you are a diabetic, let's say you buy, you buy some supplies on Amazon,  they probably know, they probably have an idea that you or someone in your household  has a certain health condition. So, or is in a bucket of cat, you know, a bucket that includes  a myriad of health conditions that have similar symptoms or similar care, you know, care instructions.  So I had, it's a, it's a tough one. It's a tough one. Well, and if they do know that about you,

Transcript:  what exactly are they doing with that information? If they know that about you, right? Like, it's not  like they're selling it's Amazon. So their business is not selling that information that we know of  to someone else, but it is about like their myriad. Yeah. Myriad ways that all of their services  tie into each other. Like I can almost imagine, you know, going to the front desk after, you know,  getting a health checkup and they're like, do you have the, you know, the, the Amazon Prime app and  you scan the QR code and you get like a discount on the way out or something like that, you know,

Transcript:  if you get a discount on your prescription, that's going to be the same, right? It's like,  you're going to get some discount on your prescription or you walk into a whole foods  or an Amazon fresh and it pings you and says, Hey, like you have high cholesterol. You should  try these foods or sponsored foods or whatever. Like I can see that very easily happening,  you know, where it's like, Oh, Hey, like you are, you, you, your doctor does you have keto,  like here's some keto friendly food options, you know, things like that. I can see that happening  because you're shopping data. If you're using Amazon already is that data is already being like  sorted out in that way. They know that stuff about you.

Transcript:  And there's also the concern that people in the household share an Amazon account. No one has an  individual, you know, there's not like five people in the house who all have their individual Amazon  account. The entire family uses one Amazon account, but if someone goes to the doctor and  they're diagnosed with something that they don't want the rest of the house to know about, whether  it's their parents or their spouse or their partner or whoever, the last thing that person wants is for  someone else in the family to hop on Amazon and find this like, you know, be, Oh, you have hemorrhoids  or something, you know, it's just something that's, here's your preparation age or something worse,  you know, there's the pregnancies or, you know, cancers or, you know, there's a lot of things that  people, you know, you know, we don't know how people's lives are. We don't know like what kind  of relationships they're in. A lot of relationships are extremely abusive. If you have, if you are  pregnant and your abusive partner finds out via an app, just log in on the Amazon. When you were  about to go, you know, to have some, you know, take care of the pregnancy, because you do not want to  have a child with this horrible person. Well, now you've just created this whole huge mess for this,  for this individual because you decided you wanted to share data to help people buy stuff.

Transcript:  Yeah. And to piggyback on that, I mean, with the Dobbs decision and Roe v. Wade, you know,  now that data, that information becomes like more important than ever. And we all know Amazon hasn't  been the greatest at resisting subpoenas from law enforcement with ring doorbells and other home  devices, smart home devices they have. So yeah, this is like, it's a, it's a real kind of, it's a  real touchy thing. I mean, I just, people's health data is just like one of the most, it's like health  finances. I mean, there's like some buckets of data that are just really sensitive. So I mean,  they, they're really, I think, I would hope that regulators would make sure that they, you know,  really kind of locked it down. But again, like, like you said, Roberto, it's like, you know,  they'll just be like, Oh, well, we did it. And like, oops, whoops, we were mis-handling the data  this whole time. And it's just like, you know, these, if we see this over and over and over again,  it's just, it's a, it's a pattern. It's a pattern. It's a pattern of behavior. It's not a thing  that's like, Oh, well, they made a one mistake. Like they messed up this time. And it's like, no,  this is, this is pretty regular across so much of the industry. Right. Right. Well, Amazon in buying

Transcript:  one medical definitely signals at least their understanding that they, you know, that they are  going to be placed under a lot of scrutiny, a lot of regulatory oversight as a result of this. But,  you know, how much impact is that actually going to have? The other thing that, you know, we talked  about the story briefly on Tech News Weekly, me and Micah Sargent on Thursday. And one of the things  that we ended up talking about is like, you know, we live in a country where healthcare is just so,  so filled with, with holes. Like, it's just a, it's a horrible situation here for healthcare,  for a large, you know, swath of the population compared to other countries where healthcare is  paid for, for everyone. And, you know, here you have to pay through your teeth. It's something  like an Amazon buy of a primary care health, you know, business like this is able to offer healthcare  that enables people who couldn't have afforded it prior to now suddenly afford it. And, you know,  obviously there is the caveat of, okay, yeah, but the data, you know, complications around that and  everything, but that's also, that, that is a benefit, right? Like being able to, to enable people  who couldn't have afforded healthcare before to suddenly do that in a country where it's just a  broken system, at least there's something there, but who knows if that's what we're even going to  see from Amazon. I'm just kind of reading the tea leaves from, you know, kind of the prime ethos,

And then we'll get  back and we got plenty more news to walk through. So we'll get back to that in a second. But first,  this episode of This Week in Tech is brought to you by Audible. And you know, man, how many years  have I been with Audible? Not as long as Leo. Leo, when he, when he starts rattling off his stats,  I'm always like, man, you, you, you could probably listen for like a hundred years, the amount of  hours that you have in your Audible library. I don't know, but I have a lot, not quite that much,  but it's awesome. Like all of my spare time filled listening to audio books. I love it.  And you know, our schedules, they're busy. We're always on the go. I feel like I'm always on the  go. I don't have a ton of times to do the things that I want to do, but you know, I can, I can  find the time. If I'm walking my dog, I can find time to listen to an audio book. That's why I love  Audible. Audible offers an incredible selection of audio books across every genre. And you go on  there, you search for any author, any, any genre, you're going to find so many options  and all presented in a way where you can really kind of get to the root of, you know, the  suggestions and the reviews and everything to really kind of figure out exactly what you want  to spend your time listening to.

It's always, you know, up and ready to go. I've got my, my audio book downloaded so that  when I'm on the plane and I don't have connectivity, let's say my audio book is there waiting for me.  So when you're traveling, when you're working out, walking, doing chores, big time into that,  you decide. One audio book that I have been actually listening to a second time, I listened  to this audio book called Untangled by Lisa DeMore, guiding teenage girls through the seven  transitions into adulthood, because I have a daughter who is almost a teenager. And let me  tell you, life's starting to get a little crazy around here. So I'm trying to do my best to be  informed, to understand where she is at and to be able to assist her and help her in any way that  I possibly can. And this audio book is just fantastic. Like I said, this is my second time  listening to it's Untangled by Lisa DeMore. She is just an amazing author on this topic. And I've  learned so much through listening to it. So, and that's just one example, right? Like a lot of,  a lot of Twit fans big into sci-fi. You're going to find tons of sci-fi on Audible and everything  else under the sun.

Transcript:  I need it. I do too. This is, this is so cool. I love any, any and almost all examples of how  artificial intelligence is intersecting with, with kind of the creative arts. There's some  things about AI that's, that's kind of frightening to me in certain ways, you know, supposed, you  know, behind the scenes of the tech companies and what they're doing and how AI is making decisions  that's, you know, promoting hate or, you know, those are the things that I don't like AI for,  right? Like there's a lot to be worked on, but I'm fascinated by this idea that AI is powering this  new generation of apps and services that can create art, be it music, be it visual art, that  right now, let's say that it's not perfect. It's not, it's not always that I could look at an image  and say, oh yeah, that's a human made that. And then actually it was a computer. Like it's not  always that way, but it's happening more often now than it was when they started doing this sort of  thing. And I feel like that's only going to continue to improve in Dolly too. Everything,  I mean, everything that, you know, all the examples that you see from Dolly are just,  I don't know, it's mind blowing to me that you can use words and how to create it.

If you are really good  at finding things on Google using keywords, you can be good at art on Dolly too. Like that's,  I think that's really a great way to explain it.

It's easy  to look at something and think like, Oh, I am surprised that an AI made that or that wasn't  made by a person. The art, I'm surprised the art itself, but then there's just something  slightly off and it's disturbing.  A former coworker has access and just tweeted, tell me something to Dolly. And I said, this was  when my internet wasn't working. And I thought it was because a squirrel had eaten through the  cables in the ground somewhere. And so I was like squirrel eating my internet. And it's like a  squirrel eating a laptop. And it's just like, okay, well yeah, internet equals laptop. And it's just  disturbing enough. But yeah.

Start time: 3981.34
End time: 4016.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Someone gives you that prompt. They're like, well, what we're looking for is,  you know, and then exactly what you said, Roberto, I can't recite it word for word,  but what we're looking for is that. And as a designer, like I'm not a visual arts designer,  so I don't know how the mind works in that regard. But I had to imagine that certain  concepts come to you or, you know, or you want to pursue, but you have no idea where to begin.  And, you know, if Dolly gives you three or nine different ideas, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,  there you go. Maybe that's the foundation. Oh, you know, I didn't think to put the pancake on  her head like that. That's interesting, you know, or whatever.

Start time: 4017.20
End time: 4061.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It could also be interesting if you're an artist to like run it through, like, so you have a kind of  base thing. So let's say you have a, you know, possessed bear or what have you. Let's, we'll  stick with the horror movie stuff. You have possessed bear, but you're not really sure if you  want it to be like gangrenous or if you want it to kind of be like less gory. And so you could run  it through something like Dolly to sort of like give you different options without having to  draw out, you know, do a draw over and then render it yourself, right? Like it could be something  used for kind of that where it's like, I just want to see the different iterations of this that  I have ideas for and get it, spit it out very quickly and then decide what I want to go forward  with. And then, then you go and, you know, as an artist, you would, you would go ahead and do the

Start time: 4062.00
End time: 4132.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  actual concept art yourself. As a former designer, what we typically do is you just draw a lot. You'd  make a bunch of little squares on a piece of paper and you just start like doodling a ton of little  ideas of like what you think, like the design should be or what the concept should be or which  art should be. And then from there, you're like, oh, okay, so I like this bear and I like it with  a bloody face. You know what, what if I, and sometimes you want reference art. So Dolly would  be, actually might be pretty good for reference art because you're like, okay, I need a picture of a  bear eating a cow. Now finding that photo out in the world is going to be difficult. So you'll,  what you'll typically do is find a picture of a bear and find a picture of a cow and then maybe  a picture of a bear eating like something else. And then you sort of merge those together as  you're drawing. If you could tell Dolly to like, Hey, show me a bear eating a cow. That might help  you when you're coming, because you take those like 12, 15, 60 pieces of thumbnail art, and then you  narrow it down to like the five or six good ideas. And now you want something that looks a little  bit better. So you can sort of, you know, sketch it out. And if you need some reference of a bear  eating a cow in this instance, then you might be able to do that with Dolly, which will help,

Start time: 4132.48
End time: 4155.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  which is helpful. Yeah. Yeah. It's making me think using Dolly as like a way to,  what is the word? It's escaping me right now when you're, when you're making a movie and you got to  do all the different little images of the different storyboarding, storyboarding, storyboarding. Thank  you. Yeah. Using Dolly is like a storyboarding tool would actually be, it would be horrible for

Start time: 4156.34
End time: 4160.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that. Actually, it would be horrible for storyboarding because you need to control,

Start time: 4160.96
End time: 4182.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you need control. You need control. Yeah. I was just thinking if somebody did storyboard a fictional,  like a totally out off the cuff, like you could do a short story with this storyboard something  with Dolly and all the randomness that it gives you, and then try and make a film out of what it  gives you. You probably get some tech, some headlines at least. So there's an idea for you.

Start time: 4183.24
End time: 4193.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's going to be expensive. That's going to be expensive. Yeah. It's going to be expensive as  well. It's going to be like, Oh, now I got to go buy this and do this effect. Oh, this was a bad

Start time: 4193.64
End time: 4227.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  idea. This is horrible. This is horrible. One thing that's interesting about getting access to  Dolly though, is that you get full usage rights. So commercialization, reprint, you could sell it,  merchandise rights. I just think it's interesting that you could use their platform to create  something that you aren't actually creating. The system is for you, but it becomes an original  piece that sits on its own and that you can then sell. I see many people going to this site and  just making tons and tons of stuff, filling Etsy with all of this crazy merchandise and everything.

Start time: 4228.22
End time: 4245.76

Transcript:  I don't know. So you own the copyright to the item. I want you to create it. You own the  copyright. Like if I created a piece of artwork, I immediately own the copyright to that artwork,  unless I'm stealing it from somebody. So if I go to Dolly and I create something, which was my words,  and it gives me a picture, I now own the copyright or they're giving me rights to use that image to-

Start time: 4247.00
End time: 4253.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 4256.00
End time: 4256.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They can use it too.

Start time: 4262.56
End time: 4288.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they own the copyright likely, but they give you usage rights. So yeah, if they see that you've  taken something and you're making a mug and you're making $200,000 a year with your bear eating a cow  mug, Dolly can be like, you know what? Maybe we'll make some tumblers with a bear eating a cow.  We're selling that mug too.  Yeah, we'll sell that mug too. I'm sorry for putting the image of a bear eating a cow.

Start time: 4289.30
End time: 4317.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It'll be interesting to see if they have some type of annual subscription model  for people who want to just own exclusive rights to their own generated images.  There's some interesting legal gray area there where it's like, yes, it's transformative,  but also technically I would be the creator of it because I use the keywords to generate the images.  So I'm very curious how all that sort of shakes out.

Transcript:  But I wonder if it'll be something like Creative Cloud or Shutterstock or whatever, where it's  like you're basically paying to license your own AI generated phrases or whatever. And it's like,  okay, well, if you pay this fee, if you're a professional, here's the fee you can pay.  You can either pay per image like they do on stock photo websites. You can say, oh,  I want to license this for $100 or whatever. And maybe they change the pricing based on  what's popular in SEO at the time. What are people searching for? What's really hot right now?  That's a thing that costs more money. And then things that are less searched for cost less money  to license out. So I'll be very curious to see how they end up trying to monetize  Dolly too. And I'm sure that's coming, but I have a feeling maybe they will ask artists for an annual  subscription fee for unlimited licensing of however many images.

Transcript:  I mean, they've started monetizing it actually with this announcement. It's a credit based  system. So basically if you are a free user from the beginning, you get 50 credits for the first  month free. And then every month thereafter, you get 15 credits. So that's 15 text prompts that you  get for free every month, right? That you could use. You can purchase additional credits at $15  for 115 credits. So for $15 you get 115 tries. Kind of similar to the stock photo system.

Transcript:  be surprised because I, and this is, I think one of the things that this is going to be used for a  lot is, you know, people who are writing their own content for their site, you know, would normally  go to if they needed an image, go to a stock photo thing and try and find the thing that closely,  closest matches what they're writing about, but that's not always possible. So you end up picking  from what you have, at least with Dolly, you can say, this is exactly what I need. The challenge  will be how quickly can you get to that image that you're willing to accept, right? Because I mean,  even though you have 15 tries, 15 credits, I mean, on the system that I use, which I can't,  what was it called the Dolly mini, whatever that was from like a month ago, where all the faces  looked like they were like Toxic Avenger. Yeah. On that system, you know, you put in a prompt  and you weren't always guaranteed that the result of that prompt was going to be great. You know,  you might have to do it two or three times to find the one that you're like, all right, that's a  winner right there. So, you know, people are going to be burning through credits probably just to  find the thing that they actually want to use in the end. But I think it'll be really useful for  that. So, I don't know, time will tell. We'll certainly find out. Let's see here. Should we  talk about selling, I mean, speaking of subscriptions, BMW's heated seat subscriptions,  which apparently, when I saw this headline, I was like, are you kidding me? Apparently,  BMW has been doing this since 2020. So, this is not the first example of a subscription  model in vehicle sale, you know, features as it were. Roberto, you're probably the best one on  the panel to talk about this a little bit. What do you think about a subscription model coming to  the inside of a vehicle? What do you think about that? Well, I mean, we've people, automakers have

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  been talking about subscription models for a long time because they're trying to figure out how to  make more money from vehicles. Because right now, like a truck and an SUV, those are just cash cows  for the automotive industry. Like the gas powered ones. As we move to EVs, that's the, the margins  are much lower just because trucks and SUVs, they don't have all the same regulatory issues. They  can charge more. They make more money. It's again, the margins are crazy. So they're trying to figure  out like, well, how can we make money? Can we make money from subscriptions? Because most people have  become accustomed to subscriptions. We have Netflix, we have Spotify. And for a little,  for a few years, BMW offered CarPlay as a subscription, which I mean, and the automotive  press and owners just hammered them forever. And this is in the, in the United States for this.  And they finally just relented and said, fine, you're buying a BMW. You pay this much for CarPlay  and you just get CarPlay in your vehicle, which everyone's like, yay. Cause you know, cars are  expensive, but that hasn't stopped automakers from figuring out how to do it. Still here in the United  States, but also in other markets where they might be a bit more open to a subscription service. Like  the, I believe the, the heated seats is in South Korea. It's not even here in the United States,  but all the headlines were like, Oh, BMW. Well, that's not here. And you know, but a lot of the  US press, well, there you go. See Jonathan Gatlin, he knows, you know, all the press here is like,  Oh, it's, it's a, it's a fun, you know, easy click for people to get angry at something. Cause anger  sells that's we've all learned that we've learned that through social media is that if you have  something that is going to make people angry and click, boom, that's how you're going to get the,  that's how you get all the page views, which with ad sales, the way they are, I don't know how well  that's working out for us anymore. But you know, you, you know,  Tesla is going to make a FSD a subscription. So there are all these subscriptions and there's,  I can see where you, if there's a feature that you don't use all the time, let's say like  GM's super cruise, which is a hands-free driver's assistance system. It's not, it's not, it's not  automated driving. It's not, you know, don't, that's not a thing you can buy. Don't think that's,  but it's a hands-free system. You don't need that. Let's say 99% of your life. And then one day you  and your family are going to go on this long trip. You're going to be on the interstate for hours and  hours and hours. And you're like, you know what, what if I just subscribe to this for one month?  So for this trip, we have super cruises, hands-free drivers assistance. And so during that,  you know, eight hour drive to your grandmother's house or whatever, or Wally world, and that, you  know, eight hour drive back, you have this extra driver's assistance system for that. I can see it,  but for things like, you know, features in the vehicle, like heated seats or radio stations,  or, you know, access to the infotainment stuff, that's, that's, that's really nickel and diming  people who are buying cars and cars are already expensive, regardless of whether or not you're  buying a gas car or you're buying a, an EV. I mean, the median price is over, it's in the 40s,  40, 45, 40 something thousand dollars. That's so much money. I can't afford a $40,000 car. I don't  know. People are getting five year loans and now there's all these defaults coming, you know, 23%  of vehicles that are financed in Washington DC are, are in default. It's, yeah, it's, it's a crazy,  crazy world and the automakers are trying to figure out how to continue to make money in this  new EV world. But it's, it's, you know, they have to tread lightly because, you know, being again,  BMW for years got hammered for charging subscriptions for, for, for car play, which is,  which is, it just, it was just ridiculous is what it was.

Transcript:  There's kind of a disconnect for me too. In the, and I don't know if it's semantics or what, but  you know, I can buy a car, I can choose to pay for an option, right? When I buy a car. So I buy it  and that's kind of the model that like I'm used to. I buy a car. Do you, do you want the upgrade to  the blah, blah, blah? Yeah, sure. I'll get the upgrade or no, I don't want that. You know, and  if I don't want it, it's not in there, but this is kind of like, yeah, we put that in there. We're  just not letting you have it until you pay us a little bit more. And I don't know, I don't know  why the disconnect doesn't work for me there. Like it's kind of the same thing, but it's kind  of different, you know, it's like, it's already there. What's happening is this happens with,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  with Tesla's is the Teslas are built with all the hardware for FSD or the FSD beta is full self  driving, which isn't actually full self driving, but all the hardware is already built into the  vehicle. So if you don't buy FSD Tesla, that reduces their margins on the sale of that vehicle.  So they're always pushing you like, Hey, you want to do this? You want to do this? You want to do  this? And so much of what is coming out in vehicles now is software based. So the software,  the hardware is already built into the vehicles. It's, you know, if you can reduce the amount of  trim levels or that you're building, that makes it easier to build cars. If you're building just  two trim levels and they have one has all the hardware for, and all the software for this,  and one has all the, all the hardware and all the software for this trim level, and you just push  them through. And then there are features that you can either add when you add, when you buy it or  add later on, that's, you know, that's extra money for them because they've already built it in.  It's easier just to bake it in, especially when it comes to software into the vehicle, as opposed  to like piecemeal it, Oh, this person wants this, this person wants that, this person wants this.  So that's where it's changing. And you know, vehicles are now evolving because of over the  air updates. So you can buy a car now that in three months, six months, especially if it's an EV,  it might have better range because they figured out, you know, what, you know, with all the driving  that people are doing with the vehicles, they're like, Oh, you know, if we adjust this in the  acceleration, or if we adjust this with the way that the, it's charging and discharging, we can  give people an extra five miles. And so that's great. But it also opens, again, it opens up for  this idea. We're like, well, if you want this feature, we'll charge you a subscription, but you  can also like go out and buy a car and be like, you know, I don't want this. And then later on,  change your mind, which you can't do with, you know, you couldn't do traditionally with cars.  So it's, it's sort of give and take. And for every good thing, there's always going to be

Start time: 4916.28

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  something you're like, Oh my God, really? I mean, I've got three, I like in my, so in my  Tesla app, but right there, I've got three available. I've got acceleration boost. I can  get an enhanced autopilot, which I didn't have an option for before. That's a new one that they,  they used to have, and then they didn't have it. And now that apparently they have it again,  and then full self-driving. So it's, sorry, it's my, my poor camera is very sad.  There we go.  Yeah. And then, and then you have the subscription stuff where it's like, you know,  Hey, here's your $200 a month or whatever, if you want to just subscribe.  So that's, yeah. And they're constantly like, I'll get a little notification or whatever from  my Tesla app and it'll be like, Hey friend, how are you feeling about, just take a look at these  upgrades that we might have for you. Like just, just, just look, we're no, no pressure, no pressure.  But also if you want to drive your car a little bit faster, we could do that for you for $2,000  for the low, low price of two rent. And so, yeah, they, they really like, I will say it's not  annoying. I don't have like constant, it's not constant in-app advertising for, from my car  manufacturer. Thank God that would drive me crazy. But, but it is, but it is there every now and again,  I get a little, little notification that's like, Hey, you should, you should check the upgrade  section. There's some new stuff in there like, or, or I don't know if you forgot, but you didn't buy  full self-driving and you might want to check that out now. Maybe it's, maybe now you're interested  in it. And so they just sort of like remind you that it exists every, every now and again. So that's  yeah, it's, it is very interesting how cars, especially EVs are just becoming so much more  software-based, which I know drives my dad crazy because he has a, he has an Ionic and they did a  software update and it changed like the entire UI very similarly to how Tesla changed its UI  like a year and a half ago, a couple of years ago. And, and he, he was like, Oh, I have to  relearn where everything is. It's driving me crazy. Like he's, and he's just mad. Like he's  furious about it. He's in his early sixties, just so mad about it. He's just like, Oh, I had to re,  I had to look for everything. I didn't know where anything was. And, you know, it's just, yeah, that,  that is frustrating. It's like, you know, you really have like all of your dials and everything  also, you know, your, your, your screen dials, whatever. I don't have any dials on my car,  except for the two little wheels. But, but yeah, and then it's, you know, you use your screen and,  and then all of a sudden everything's different. Some stuff that you use kind of one touch is now  buried under two or three sub menus. There's like, I mean, it's a whole, it's a whole ordeal. And I  know it actually like is better. Like I know that that UI is more efficient in a lot of ways, but  it's just, I'm so used to the previous one that it, you kind of great against it. You're sort of  begrudging on, uh, get having to learn this new UI. So I'm sure they'll change it again and they'll  do a big revamp of it someday. But, um, but yeah, it's like very annoying for a lot of people who  are just used to traditional cars where you have just gauges and dials and like, that's it. And  it's, oh, okay. Well, and then you got your screen that has sort of your, your phone apps or whatever  on it, your infotainment, but everything else is just right in front of you and it's always there  and it's never going to change. So it's very, very difficult for a lot of folks who are not used to

Transcript:  that to like start getting used to that. Yeah. It's a big thing about muscle memory and how we,  you know, after you've driven a car for a long time, you know, where the volume control is,  you know, where the climate control is, you know, where this is. And even with, if you have an  infotainment screen, you know, where things are because you've been using it. Like, you know,  your dad got used to the way the ionic was laid out and then they're like, oh, you know what,  we're just going to change it. And again, maybe they change it for the better, but maybe they  change it for the worse. I mean, again, it's, you know, building a UI for a vehicle that's flying  down the road at 70 miles an hour is difficult. But you know, when you change that muscle, I mean,  now it's like getting into a rental car. You're like, where is everything? And you know, that's  that. And that is literally my life. Every week I get a new car and every week I'm like, oh, okay.  How do I turn on the wipers? Like I'm flashing lights at people. I'm a professional automotive  journalist and I'm just flashing high beams at people all the time, trying to figure out how to  turn on the windshield wipers on because sometimes people are like, oh, it's right here, but you  don't pull it to do this. You do, you know, you do this or it's way over here in the infotainment  system, which is just, don't even get me started in windshield wipers and infotainment. But yeah,  yeah, it's, it's again, there's a good and the bad of the whole like, you know, the tech, the rise of  tech in vehicles. And for the most part it's good, but there are, there are some things that are just,

Start time: 5187.60

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  just painfully frustrating. There's something that concerns me though, about tech in vehicles. And I  don't know if this is just outdated thinking or what, but I have a neighbor who has a Tesla Model  X got it very early on and we've had the opportunity to, you know, drive it, borrow it. Long story,  but we trade trailers for Teslas sometimes when they need to, you know, pull their trailer, they  borrow our Sequoia and we get their Tesla. So it's kind of a, kind of a sweet deal. Anyways,  my point is anytime I'm in his vehicle, which at this point, if I had to guess probably like six  years old, let's say somewhere around there, the, the in, in dash system is like crazy laggy. Like  every time you do anything, it just makes me think like, as we kind of pursue further this, this  world filled with, you know, vehicles who are half computer, half vehicle, and more and more  of that technology is, is infused inside of the vehicle. Will we run into what we run into now  with our desktop computers and our laptops, which is that, you know, six to eight years,  somewhere down the line, this, this thing that was once very, very capable is can now, yeah,  sure it can do it, but it's just a lot slower. And like, what is it going to be in 20 years?

Start time: 5283.08

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's actually quite, quite difficult because there's so integrated with the entire system.  So it's less likely they're going to do that. And it's, it's, I mean, it's, for the most part,  those vehicles are, you know, they're more and more, the automakers are using, you know,  quicker and quicker GPUs from mostly it's Nvidia, to be honest. I mean,  Nvidia has built a whole new, a whole new headquarters just from all the money they're  making from automakers. And I think for the, you know, automakers are, they realize that these  infotainment systems need to be quick day one and, you know, 15 years later. So at some point,  your vehicle will still get upgrades, but at that point, they're just fixes. You're not getting new,  you're not getting new features. You're not getting, yeah, like an old iPhone.

Transcript:  So I'll say you're not compatible with the newest software upgrade. Like you're going to stay at  this version or whatever. I do think, which is way more than what a traditional car.  It does feel like at some point we may get to a place where we could upgrade the way we do a  computer, but I don't think that that is close by like under by any means. But I do think that  that would be like, because that's just more money, right? That a car company could get out  of you if you were not planning on buying a new car every, you know, eight to 10 years.  That'll just be what you already do with Tesla. Yeah, that's true. That's true.

Transcript:  Yeah. It's, you know, especially the early days, the last like 10 years, you know, you've had  what people want versus what the automakers could deliver. And Tesla had the same problem  when it comes to the speed of their infotainment system. You have laggies, you have, you have  screens that just turn off. You have screens that are half dead. You know, automakers would put in  features or they would have code that just wasn't, you know, optimized for the, for the hardware.  So you have, you know, you have screens that, you know, you end up with this latency issue  and it's software is really difficult. Just ask Volkswagen. They, they released the ID3 and the  ID4 and both of those, the, the hardware was fine. The software just wasn't up, wasn't ready. And  they released these vehicles and people had these cars for a year before Volkswagen updated them so  that the infotainment system wasn't just a laggy mess. Like that was really the number one, like  issue with that vehicle was that the software wasn't ready for the infotainment system. So  you're telling people like, Hey, you can buy this car. Sure. But when you do this,  expect the screen to wait and then move, expect that to happen because the software is not ready  yet. And now, you know, they've upgraded it. But I mean, how embarrassing is that for one of the  world's largest automakers in the, in the world, they make, you know, they, they Lamborghini, Audi,  Seat. I mean, they own a ton of, of, of companies and they, that's how hard software is, is that  this company couldn't get their first real big, like, you know, the real big  current generation EV onto the road with infotainment that wasn't laggy. It's, yeah,  it's, it's, yeah.

I know that there were some hardware updates, like for some of the older,  was it the Model S's, Roberto, where it was like the Model S's who had paid for full self-driving,  but had not, they did not have the capacity. So then there was, that was like, they will,  okay, cool. But we also, you're really old Teslas, like don't actually, they can't actually run this.  So we need to upgrade some of your stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  weird because you're selling things. And Tesla does this a lot where they're selling future,  they're selling something for the future as opposed to something that you're buying now.  So you, when you buy FSD and then the prices keeps going up, which is,  they just need money is essentially what they need. That's why the price continues to go up.  Cause most things when as technology gets better, the price goes down, but for FSD,  it's like the other direction. You're just like, all right, fine. Whatever. But yeah, you're paying  for a future product. You're not paying for something that's, that's really, that's really  usable as a, what it's supposed to do right now. You're paying for, it's like,

I just, I just wanted a car and I like,  I liked my model three a lot. And I just didn't want to fold my very giant toddler in half to  put them in the back seat. So I decided to get a model Y. But yeah, it's just, I just, we don't,  we don't even have the infrastructure to really support full self-driving like in California.  Our roads are bonkers. Like I don't, has anybody, like we have bottles everywhere. It's just,  I don't know. I don't, I, I'm not, I feel like our state, it's not necessarily even the cars.  It's just, there are so many variables on side roads that I'm just like, nah, nah, I'm good.  I think I'll just, that's the thing is it is the cars. It's fine. Like, you know,

It's just like,  you get to that point and then you realize there's so much more that you didn't realize  or know before that now you have to account for and factor in for and then, and then program for.  And so it just keeps getting pushed out little by little. I mean, we've been,  I feel like humans have been saying, oh, we're going to have robots that are sentient AI since  like the fifties. They're like, oh, in 20 years we'll have robots that serve us. It's always 20  years away. And so, you know, maybe someday we'll close that gap, but for right now it feels like  it's still kind of in a similar, similar space. Yeah. It's like the broad strokes are a little bit

Transcript:  I'm open to anything at this point. What you got? I just put a story in there that one of my  reporters at Protocol wrote. It's a little push. Lizzie Lawrence wrote about an email program called  Gated. I don't know if you've heard of it, but how it works is if someone wants to email you,  they have to donate to charity in order to get into your inbox. So the idea is to shift the  onus because at this point, spammers can spam us. They can send us email and we have to go through  and delete it. Sometimes our spam filter works. Sometimes it doesn't. But basically the onus is  on us, not on the spammer. So this is a new program that would be like, if you really want  access to me, you have to pay. And she interviewed a couple of experts on how they felt about that.  It seems a little bit elitist and kind of a little bit like Calendly, like the idea around Calendly.  There was a little bit of an uproar because it's like, oh, well, yeah, if you want access to me,  you have to do this. So I didn't have money. So yeah, I thought it was an interesting thing  to discuss because I am not as annoyed by spam as I used to be. It's just sort of like, delete,  delete, delete. I know what I'm going to do and what I'm not. And I don't know that I would use  this, but curious if either of any of you would. Can you whitelist people? If I want to whitelist

This was the second quarter, consecutive quarter of losses,  not doing good. They lost 970,000 paid subscribers for the quarter. They expected to lose 2 million.  So, you know, they didn't lose as much as they thought they were going to, but still not good  at all. Is anyone here worried about Netflix or is this just kind of like had to imagine it was  going to happen eventually? Netflix is going to weather this storm. What do you all think?

Like personally,  I don't, yeah, the golf channel. I don't personally, I don't care about, I don't care  about sports. So any sports channel, if they could like get rid of it, when I had cable,  I would have been happy, but you can't. And that's the, that's the, that's the, I mean,  that's the great thing for us as consumers with a over the, with, with streaming services is that,  you know what? I'm, I've watched everything I want on Paramount plus unsubscribe. You can't do that  until you, cause everything's bundled and there's carriage fees and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  So, you know, I think, you know, because of that, people were like, okay, I watched all the things  I want to watch on Netflix. I'm going to unsubscribe until something cool comes back.  And I know people who do that. I mean, I've done that with, with the Showtime. I've done it with  Epics. I've done it. Yeah. I just like, oh, okay. I'm done with this show. I'm done with, I watched  the show I wanted to watch and now I'm going to unsubscribe and I'll come back later. I think  that's, I mean, that's just the new reality. And I mean, it's tough for Netflix, you know,  they're the big people on the big dog, big, I don't know, whatever you call them on the block.  So their, their changes is going to be way larger than anyone else.

Transcript:  I think they, so I think Netflix really believed for a long time in the binge model and that it  would keep, if they just churned out as much content as possible, they're spending billions  of dollars on content every year. And it's like, if they just kept churning out content,  then people would stay on Netflix to watch something, right? Like there would always be  something for them to binge watch. But now we have such an embarrassment of riches in terms of  streaming services and high quality programming across all of them pretty much. Like I think I  could tell you the name of a prestige show on just about any of the top 20 streaming services.  Um, I think, uh, you know, Netflix is realizing they are unable to capture the zeitgeist,  the way that they used to when they were the, you know, when, when, as you were saying,  Ruta, they were like the big dog on the street and they're not able to capture the zeitgeist  anymore because so here's a great example, Stranger Things, um, literally came and went  in my social feeds. It just came and went. People binge watched it for about two weeks  and then it was gone. And then it came back and people talked about it for another like few days  because it was only two really big episodes and that was it. And I still see like some Eddie  Munson memes and like some other, you know, running up that hill memes and stuff like that,  like kind of offshoot memes from it, but really it is not, it's not a water cooler moment anymore.  And, and you can't make that anymore with a binge model because people are either spoiled so early  that they don't bother. They'll say, Oh, just watch it on my own time. Now that I've been spoiled,  or they watch it immediately, talk about it immediately, and then they're onto the next.  And so this has kind of created a problem with Netflix because like you were saying, Roberto,  you can't just like you binge something and you say, okay, I'm good. I don't need this right now.  I'll wait until Stranger Things, like the thing that I care about comes back squid game. Like  I'll just get rid of it for now. And companies like Disney are, you know, being very methodical  about capturing the zeitgeist, making water cooler moments. So they're releasing,  if you look at their release schedule, it's literally like Star Wars, Marvel show,  Star Wars, Marvel show. It's just like one after the other, after the other, but they're all just  week by week by week so that people can have time to catch the episode, digest, talk about it.  Then you've got a fresh episode to talk about. And they've done a much better job of capturing  that feeling that zeitgeist of having water cooler moments to discuss every single week.  And I think HBO Max did this really well with shows like Game of Thrones and AMC with Breaking  Bad and Better Call Saul. They're still having these moments where it's like the gated release  schedule works for a reason. It keeps people talking about your show. And in a world where  there is so much white noise, Netflix is learning that it can't just rest on its laurels and say,  oh, well, we're just going to put out so much content that you're just going to be a subscriber  because this is a great default service to have. A lot of people are realizing that's just not the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  case. Yeah. I mean, I watched The Boys. I liked that show. Bad, horrible people who are superheroes,  but it was released every week. And I'm like, no, that's fine. I'm fine with that. And if I  missed it one week, it's not like the olden days where we didn't have TiVo and they're like, well,  I guess I don't know what happens, but you can like, we watch it. Me and my wife will sit and  watch it on Friday or Saturday or Sunday. And we're like, oh, okay, cool. And then we'll go on.  We'll binge watch whatever random thing has already been out for six months. And then, oh,  hey, there's a new episode of The Boys. It's something, it's appointment television, which  sort of went away with Netflix. And now everyone else is doing it, but Netflix. And they think they  really need to figure out how to do that, even if they dropped like three episodes, like the first  three drop and then just sort of like, keep us around.

Start time: 6708.34
End time: 6784.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. It's kind of their identity is the binge model, right? Like they really leaned into the  binge model as a huge part of their identity. And I think what's kind of interesting right now,  hearing both of you talk about kind of weekly release schedules on shows is that no one,  at least, and I totally agree, but the two of you talking about it, no one's disappointed when  it's a weekly release. I'm fine if I don't have to binge. It's fine. Of course, there's the desire  within me that if I have a full season, I will binge if it's there. But if it's not there and I  have to come back next week, I'm not disappointed. I actually really end up enjoying those shows a  little bit more kind of because of exactly what you're talking about. So if that was Netflix's  kind of model that it really painted its business around, it's kind of something that I think maybe  people are realizing, oh, well, it's nice to have that, but it's not a necessary. It's not a have to  have. And there's something appealing about that staggered release too. I don't know. I end up,  yeah, I just end up appreciating the show more because you have the time to digest it. You have  the time to talk about it and share and all that kind of stuff. Yeah. It's fun. I think also the

Start time: 6787.17
End time: 6821.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  last two years, everyone was home all the time. So it's like there's all these companies.  Netflix is just one of many pandemic darling companies that really, all we did was watch  Netflix. All we wanted to do is binge. We didn't do anything for the last two years and now we're  not anymore. Now we're out in the world. And so binging just doesn't compare to actually being  able to go to a restaurant and go to a bar, go on vacation, go outside, be with a group of people,  all those things that we stopped doing for two years, we're doing now again.

Start time: 6822.94
End time: 6889.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. It's interesting because I remember when the binge started with Netflix, that was like,  this is how we're going to do it forever. And that was all about, oh, they're going to have to wait  every week. I wish I could binge things. But as time goes on, and I think people just in general  are like, you know what? There's so much. I just can't absorb everything so quickly. Just  let me, give me a week. Just, you know, some shows are like, okay, fine, I'll binge watch it. But for  the most part, I'm like, just let me breathe. Let me breathe. And when you think about like old shows,  that the appointment television, the Twin Peaks or Seinfeld or all these things where you had a nice  week to sort of breathe on these television shows and sort of like get in, okay, what does this mean?  What did this mean? Whereas suppose if it's just all at once, everyone's, it's staggered,  it's all over the place. It's hard to sort of talk about it because you don't want to ruin it for  somebody else. Because yeah, I think as society, we were like, you know what? Just give us a minute,  just a minute. All we need is a minute. It worked because there wasn't the level of content we have

Start time: 6892.52
End time: 7056.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  for streaming just wasn't there in the early days of like Netflix. And so, or streaming on Netflix.  And now it's everybody's streaming. You can't, you know, you would watch Disney stuff on the Disney  channel or you'd watch it on ABC or you, you know, and now it's like, this is all, they're all on a  level playing field. And so this idea of having, you know, a binge model, it's really hard because  like you said, when you want to talk about it with people, you want to capture that moment,  that water cooler moment, it's, you don't know what episode someone else is on. You don't want  to spoil it for them. Maybe you're farther ahead than all of your other friends. Maybe you're the  farthest behind. It's just, and it depends on any given week, right? Like maybe you just had a really  busy week and then all of a sudden, oh, here's Stranger Things. Last two episodes of it are the  fourth season. Okay. Here's, you know, season four, part two, and you can't get to it that weekend.  And it's just like, okay, well, I guess all my friends are done talking about it. So I will just  watch it whenever I watch it. Like, I like, you know, there's always that moment where it just,  that model doesn't quite work anymore because there is so much out there. It just doesn't work.  And I'm somebody, I remember someone in the industry was excoriated in comments in,  people were just dunking on this, this kind of media consultant or media analyst who said,  I predict Netflix will have ads on it at some point. Like, and people, this was probably eight,  this price eight years ago. And people were just like, oh, that is the most ridiculous thing I've  ever heard of. This is the new model. It's going to be, you know, no ads, this, that, and the other  thing. And now that person looks like a Nostradamus. So, you know, they, they're certainly feeling  pretty smug about themselves right now because Netflix is like, oh, I think we might have to add  ads. I have like kind of a base, same thing as Hulu, where you have like ads, no ads,  but it's like Netflix is going to have to pivot. They have to, they have to change in some capacity  either to continue to keep up that, that revenue stream and continue to make as much content as  they do, which they, they really do. I think if I'm not mistaken, they are the number one  spender when it comes to original content of all the streamers. And that, like, that is a big deal,  the fact that they spend the most. And I, if it, if it isn't today, it was for a long time that  they were the number one spender in terms of original content. And so for them to keep up  that amount of spending, to make as much as they do, to license as much as they do,  it will be very interesting to see how the ads versus subscribers stuff shakes out for them.

And I know that they've  already called, they shut down, I believe they shut down the Netflix animation, which a lot of  my friends are in animation and they have friends who lost their, they lost their jobs because  Netflix is like, you know what? Let's not make all of our own animation or at least let's cut back on  it. And so you're just like, oh, oh, oh, oh. So it's not just the gravy train that we thought it  was going to be forever and ever. It's, it's, they got to figure out how to, how to, to, to,  to adjust their, just their, their business for a sort of changing world.

Like I don't, I don't have an ongoing subscription to any sort of live  TV, anything, but YouTube TV, you know, I will drop into that for the Olympics for just that month.  The fact that I could do that, whereas however many years ago when we actually had like direct TV for  years, I mean, there was no such thing as dropping in and out. It was so complicated.

Where it's like you have the, you know, you got the two things that are new and  fresh things you want to sell and you have like that classic, you have a classic ad and they're  like, Oh, hey, I remember this and you're watching. So you're actually paying attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. Yes. Well, speaking of ads, let's take a break. And I don't have a classic ad to play  for you right now. I do have, well, I guess it's classic if you've been listening to This Week in  Tech for a number of years, because this episode of This Week in Tech is brought to you by Express  VPN. They've been with us for a while, so let's consider them a classic. Profiling, surveillance,  data harvesting. There are a lot of things not to like about tech giants, right? And we talk about  these things on the network all the time, but what can you actually do about it when you rely on  so many of their products? We don't all have $44 billion to go buying up Twitter, but the good news  is you don't need to be a billionaire to take a stand. That's why I use Express VPN. I use it on  all my devices for less than seven bucks a month. You can join me and actually resist, fight back  against big tech by using Express VPN. Not to mention just fight back at protecting your data  all around, not just from big tech. You want to have good control over your data. That's really  why I use Express VPN. And especially if I go traveling anywhere, you better believe I've got  Express VPN running on my smartphone. If I'm in that, the often used example is in that coffee  shop, but you've got free wifi all over the map at this point, not just coffee shops. And if you're  using that free wifi, probably a pretty good idea to activate Express VPN. That's certainly what I do.  How do you think big tech companies make all their money? They do it by tracking your searches,  your video history, and everything you click on. And then they're selling your personal data as a  result. Well, Express VPN helps you anonymize much of your online presence by hiding your IP address,  which as you know, is a unique identifier that really identifies your specific device.  And that allows big tech to match your activity back to you. You don't want that. The best part is  how easy it is to use Express VPN. The app is just super easy. I just tap one button on my phone  or my computer to turn it on. And that's all it takes to keep people out of the business. And  actually, I should also mention on Android, especially, you don't need to use the app.  Android has a little quick settings area that when you have the app installed and have it all set up,  I just go into my quick settings and I tap on connect to VPN. There's one there for Express VPN  and it's going. I didn't even need to launch the app. It's that easy. If you don't like big tech  tracking you and selling your personal data for profit, it's time to fight back. Visit  expressvpn.com slash twit. Do that right now and you will get three months of Express VPN for free.  That's right. For free. That's expressvpn.com slash twit. Check it out. Awesome VPN. Doesn't  slow anything down either. That's like a common complaint about VPN is like, when I use VPN,  everything slows to a crawl. You don't get that with Express VPN. I certainly don't.  Expressvpn.com slash twit. And we thank them for their support of This Week in Tech.  All right. Before we get to the last stories of the show, let's take a look back at the previous

Transcript:  I.O. if you remember, Google was talking about kind of the next iteration of AR glasses that  Google is working on, going to put out at some point. But apparently they're going to start beta  testing these suckers, I think next month, starting in August. Because they learned the lesson with

Start time: 7602.96

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Glass that if you give it to just everyday ordinary schmucks like me, we're going to end up making fun  of it. And it's not going to work. So they realized that the real use of it was for tradespeople and  doctors and so on and so forth. Mr. Jarvis, as someone that has their own theme song,  you're not an everyday person, my man. Definitely not a schmuck.

Transcript:  What y'all think about Google's AR glasses, they're going to be beta testing these. So it's  possible, I mean, not to the degree that they did with Google Glass, of course, but it's possible  that you might encounter someone wearing Google's translating AR glasses. That's kind of a neat  feature. I don't know. Are you guys interested? Crickets. I made a big stink about Google Glass

Start time: 7656.98
End time: 7693.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  once on the show and then someone was kind of mad at me about it. And then I pointed to things. I'm  like, wrong. You're wrong. I'm right. But I was very nice about it. So with Google Glass, they  oversold what that thing was going to be. And then it came out and then everyone bought it. And then  everyone's like, oh, this is dumb. Everyone's doing this the whole time. Just like half rolling their  eyes. I don't know. Do I need AR glasses? Do I need glasses just to translate? I travel to other  countries a lot. That's like part of my job is to leave America pretty often. And I'm doing okay.

Start time: 7703.58
End time: 7721.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  like renting seems like a vacation rental. Yeah. Like you go to Japan and like it's part of your  Airbnb because when I went to Taipei, I'm like, I don't know. There's nothing. I have no frame  of reference for what's going on. Whereas Europe, I'm like, okay, I kind of figure it out. For Latin

Start time: 7721.40
End time: 7797.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  based languages for me, I'm able to like maybe suss out some stuff. And like that's like, I can  kind of find my way around it like over time. But then yeah, if I was going to a country where I just  had no frame of reference for the language, then having them would be nice. But yeah, this seat,  yeah, this is the thing where it's like, I feel like if I was going to stay at a hotel, maybe I  could add it on to my stay. Or if I was staying at an Airbnb, it would be a very nice perk, where  it's like, okay, and you have the option to use Google AR glasses, they can translate for you live  while you're here. Please just make sure that you take care of them. And if you break them,  you have to buy them or whatever. And then that's, that's it. Like you just you're using them,  and then you're responsible for them. And then you put them back and then you leave. And it's like,  that to me seems like the better sort of way to do it. Or like if you're going to a business  conference, you know, the and you're going to a foreign country, where you don't speak the language  or you can't read the language, then you know, your company provides you with, you know, Google  glass AR glasses to go for the conference. But again, like it's sort of a it's a weird like rental  thing. It feels like it would be a thing that would be owned and and loaned out to use for a  specific use case. I don't know that I would use it every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Aaron Norris I mean, I do wonder if these glasses, I mean,  it can't just be they can't just be translating glasses. Like that's the only thing they do.  And if that is that's a very specialized thing. Very, very limited, right. But if they are,  you know, kind of broad strokes, AR glasses, translation is one thing. What are those other  things? What is the killer app? Because that's really that's really cool. But that's a short term  kind of drop in sort of thing. I only need this a handful of times and I need it in very specific  situations. But yeah, I wonder if there's

Where it's like you're you it would be a place that you're unfamiliar with a language  you're unfamiliar with something you're unfamiliar with, you would want to use it. So it would be,  by definition, a temporary use case would be a long term use case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you're wearing these at the mall and sure it tells you how to get to the pretzel. But on the  way you look over in that clothing store. You look over in the clothing store and there's a little  call out that's pointing to a rack with a pair with a whole series of pants there. It says 50%  or 50% off while supplies last or whatever. Would you be open to that kind of AR?

Start time: 7944.84
End time: 8035.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Lauren Henry No, because that's an ad. But what I would be interested in is if I were,  let's say out of Macy's and I was looking at a designer handbag, and I looked at it and AR was  able to scan it and say, Hey, this bag is available for 50% off on this website or the designer's  website or you know, whatever that that I'm interested in that I'm very interested in.  Show me how to get the best deal on something while I'm actively looking at it because I do  that already. Right? You price compare when you're at a big box retail store, you look at  something you go, Oh, can I get this cheaper somewhere else? Let me just double check.  And you check on your phone like if I could get that information quickly without having to type  in a bunch of stuff, like it just scans the item and says, I know what this is. This is an iPad from  2020 or whatever. And here's where you can find it cheaper. Like great that that I'm into.  Lauren Henry Can you do that with Google Lens now?  Lauren Henry That's a great question.  Lauren Henry I use it.  Lauren Henry Yeah, I'd like but I mean just that live parsing of it where it's like there's no real  process to it. If it's just wearing the glasses and it tells me, Oh, hey, I see that this says  it's, you know, $299 but you can actually get it for $99 over here. Like, you know, for this camera  lens or whatever, it's $1,000 here and it's half price over at B&H. Like, I need to know that  information. Like that's very helpful to me. Aaron Norris It's waiting for your hot word that

Transcript:  Jason Kemp Well, speaking of doom, I mean, there aren't  a whole lot of opportunities to talk about doom. Co creator, John Romero, apparently working on a  new first person shooter. So if you would like doom, I mean, this isn't the first time that  they've made some sort of a follow up. So I don't know, I'm not much of a gamer anymore. Is this  is this news? I don't care. Lauren Henry

Start time: 8257.50
End time: 8335.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, you know, it's always exciting when somebody who's sort of an icon in games is  doing something new. That's nice. You know, but it's a they've got a major publisher, obviously.  I mean, there's a lot of cache there. His name John Romero. It's like, Oh, yeah, hey, I helped  make doom. Like, that's kind of a big deal. So seems like seems like it'd be pretty easy to find  a publisher, which apparently that's the case. And, but yeah, they've published other stuff before  they had a strategy game. And I think they talked about this, this shooter is going to be powered by  Unreal Engine. So it'll be the newest UE five. So this will be like, you know, a whole,  it's going to be a whole thing. I'm sure. I mean, I'm all about a new single player shooting man,  the new dooms are so good. I mean, outrageously good. If you have not played if you're a fan of  original doom, and you have not played the new ones, the 2016 doom, the ones that Bethesda and  the ones that they're making incredible. So good. The pacing is so good. The man the power  fantasy is so good. The graphics are amazing. The music is incredible. It's just like, just the way  that game just keeps you moving forward and you have so much fun playing. It's just great. It's

Start time: 8335.20
End time: 8357.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so, so good. I can't recommend it enough. Nice. I'll have to look into that. So along the game  tip, though, discord coming to Xbox, like this, again, I put this in here thinking like, well,  that sounds significant because I know, you know, there's a lot of crossover there. I'm kind of  surprised that discord wasn't on Xbox prior to this, but apparently that's the case.

Start time: 8359.14
End time: 8361.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just have to hook a keyboard to my Xbox now.

Start time: 8363.90
End time: 8522.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So now you could just do a discord call. It's a call. It's a voice call. You just do voice calls.  I could do that. Here's the problem. So I love my series S. It's great. I love Game Pass.  I think it's an incredible value for what it is. This $15 subscription, you get access to so many  games. Setting up this whole thing is a process and a half. Like you've got to connect, you've got to  get the mobile app. Then you have to transfer discord. You have to use your phone to transfer  discord calls to the Xbox. You have to connect the Xbox account to your discord account.  It's a whole, it's very convoluted. There's a lot going on here. A lot of gamers use discord,  though. So this may prove to be very useful. And the other, the other thing that I should mention  is I have a PS5 and an Xbox Series S. And my best friend and I play video games on both. We play  co-op games on both. We play on the Switch as well. And in order of ease of use, PS5 like blows the  other two out of the water in terms of just joining a voice chat. It's very simple. You literally just  click on your friend's name and it says join voice chat and you just join. That's it. And on Xbox,  it's like more complicated, but it's at least on device. And then on the Switch, it's like,  you have to do it through an app that connects to a specific game that you might be playing at that  time. It's just not even worth it. So in that regard, that it's a little bit more complicated  and not as easy to join a voice chat on Xbox's dashboard. This is a good thing. This will be a  good thing. And I think a lot of gamers who are really into Discord and use it very heavily will  find this like a minor inconvenience to connect your accounts and get everything set up. And then  we'll be very happy with it going forward. Yeah. Finally. Yeah. Yeah. But this kind of stuff should  just be done across all consoles. You should just be able to plug into, you know, plug into your  Discord, plug into, you know, we used to have back in the day when I was rating in Rathalich King,  we should have TeamSpeak. It's just, you know, now it's new stuff, but it's, you should be able  to plug into all these voice chat apps and just be able to like talk to people. And it's just easy,  shouldn't make it difficult. The whole point of gaming in so many aspects at this point are,  you know, even when you're playing a single player game, you can be in voice chat talking  to your friends. Like you're hanging out with them. It's very social experience. So to make  it difficult, doesn't make sense now. So maybe if they streamline this process, that would be great.

Start time: 8523.62
End time: 8602.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But for now, it's still a good thing. Yeah. Yeah. That was kind of part of the reason why I put it  in there. I was just really surprised that it hadn't happened before. So that's good.  And then finally, about to wrap things up, but finally Meta, that's Meta, the installation art  company that you can find at Meta.is is apparently suing Meta, the Facebook company for trademark  violation. Meta.is has been around for about 12 years. They hold a valid trademark for the name.  And actually their business has to do with multi, and this is from their site, multi-sensory live  experiences that ignite the human spirit with technology, design, music, and storytelling.  So I don't know if that's a perfect overlay over the top of the, you know, the metaverse ambitions  that Facebook has, but they've been trying to negotiate with Meta for about eight months now  saying, Hey, you guys are embroiled in all of these privacy scandals and now our name is tarnished.  And it's impossible to share the name with a company. So they're suing Meta.  Probably, I can't imagine it's going to amount to very much, but I feel bad for them because  that's quite a, you know, they have all that background, 12 years of building up their own  name and reputation, only to have Facebook come along and buy the name and wound her.  Tarnish it.

People were concerned about going to  the Mark Zuckerberg hospital because they were afraid, and this is in San Francisco,  they were afraid that their data would be sold to Facebook.  Anytime there's that cross-over.  When your name is that tarnished, maybe you shouldn't put it on things, especially with  healthcare.

So if you go to im8bit.com,  well, first of all, they have a ton of really awesome Psychonauts 2. They have a collection.  So they have a physical collector's edition that they're going to release later this year.  And yeah, it's going to be this gorgeous, well laid out art book. You can see it's not final,  but this mock cover that we have is absolutely beautiful. We are working with Lost in Cult,  who makes a prestigious, very high quality gaming journal. It's not even really a magazine. It's  sort of a collector's item. They're going to be doing the book design. And I have been  drowning in beautiful concept art and interviewing a lot of the developers at Double Fine about their  work on Psychonauts 2. And so if you are a fan of the game, you can pre-order it and it will be out  as soon as I'm done writing it, which who knows when that will be. No, it's supposed to be out  in quarter one of next year. So please make me look good and pre-order this book that I'm writing  that I am so excited to be involved with.
