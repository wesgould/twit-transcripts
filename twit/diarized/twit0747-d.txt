Transcript:  I am blown away.  This is two weeks in a row.  We've had a panelist who prepared.  I don't know what to think of it.  Your audience deserves it.  And also here, Alex Lindsay, who came off from far, far away.

Transcript:  All the way from Nevada.  Not Nevada.  Just down the road a piece.  Nevada.

Start time: 198.98
End time: 243.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nevada.  That would be funny if we called it Nevada.  Nevada.  We should start a trend because you know, Nevadans will say when you say Nevada, they'll say,  no, no, it's Nevada.  We should, Nevada, which is a small town to the south of us, start that trend.  Say, no, no, it's Nevada.  See how long it takes to propagate.  No, it's Nevada.  What are you talking about?  You mustn't be from around here.  It's Nevada.  It's just north of San Rafael.  Now remember, Dr.  Don used to say San Raquel.  So you could call it San Raquel.  Anyway, yes, you survived the atmospheric river.  Last week it was the bomb cyclone.  Oh, I know.  Do we have, is this unusual?  Is this a Californian thing?  In the UK, do they have cute meteorological names?

Start time: 244.14
End time: 256.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, we just accept that it rains for about three months of the year.  I mean, it's just like, it's always got to be, it's always got to be somewhat  okay, actually, if considerably longer, but if you're talking continuous spread,  then November to February can be quite unpleasant.  But it's just-

Start time: 259.26
End time: 277.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, we have lots of names for rain.  There's pounding rain, there's drizzle, there's misal, there's, you know,  all kinds of different-  We've had that for years.  It's like Eskimos and snow, you know, we can describe it a lot of different forms of rain,  but here it's got to be something, you know, if it bleeds, it leads.  It's got to be a bomb cyclone or, you know.

Start time: 278.18
End time: 291.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I, my theory, and I, I know I'll stand corrected if I'm wrong, is that that all  started when there was a 24 hour cable channel devoted to weather.  They just realized they can't say rain.  You got to have some-  Well, they have more time to talk about it.  Exactly.  They don't have like the two or three minutes.

Start time: 302.80
End time: 311.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So NOAA actually, I think, coined the term atmospheric river.  The NOAA?  The notion of national ocean.  Oh, right.

Start time: 311.84
End time: 316.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Transcript:  This is, I think, setting a record for the earliest the show title has been pronounced.  We haven't even done any news.  No, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  Atmospheric rivers are relatively long,  narrow regions in the atmosphere, like rivers in the sky that transport most of the water  vapor out of the tropics and dump them on Petaluma.  Actually, the picture is of Bodega Bay, which is just over the road over the hill.

Start time: 359.84
End time: 373.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My wife is driving, was it Thursday when this hit?  And just up in Presidio, the roads were just completely flooded  because they got, you know, you've got a summer's worth of leaves that just dropped off the trees.  Oh, it's a mess.  The drains were blocked up.

Start time: 375.04
End time: 379.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Atmospheric rivers, there are different kinds.  One of them, I think the one we're getting is the Pineapple Express.

Start time: 380.22
End time: 388.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, it's much warmer than it was on Thursday.  It was barely cracked 50.  And then yesterday when it began dumping in the East Bay, I was like, it's warm now.

Transcript:  And I know I think they made this all up recently.  But on Wednesday it was high pressure, low pressure.

Start time: 404.77
End time: 423.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I went out for dinner on Wednesday to a friend's place for dinner on Wednesday  and it went below single digit centigrade.  So we'll sign freedom units.  It's about 50.  And Californians are just like, oh, no, this is terrible.  I can't deal with it.  It's all put another layer on and just get on with it.  Have a cup of tea.

Start time: 423.84
End time: 431.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's OK. It got below freezing in the East Bay.  It's been pretty cold.  It was the 40s where we were.  There's one other theory.

Start time: 431.54
End time: 445.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It might not be the Weather Channel.  It might be the advent of crazy weathermen.  Remember, there was a guy in San Francisco, Lloyd Lindsay Young.  He would use all sorts of strange implements to point like a toilet plunger  and all sorts of weird stuff.

Start time: 445.56
End time: 449.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm so glad you said toilet plunger there, because this is San Francisco.  We're talking about all sorts of things.

Start time: 449.82
End time: 473.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no, he never went that crazy.  I wonder if he coined it. Maybe he did.  Anyway, that's not what we're here to discuss.  I just thought I'd start with something light, relaxing and calming,  because Ian is going to blow his stack  when we talk about the sale of dot org.  I don't think this got widely reported, but I think this is a very, very big deal.

Start time: 473.66
End time: 487.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We covered we've covered it all week because they sneaked the announcement  in late on Friday.  You had a great interview with. Oh, and that's all of the.  Well, OK, I'm sure he's a very skilled person in his own way, but it's just.

Start time: 488.24
End time: 495.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I think, first of all,  what people probably don't know is how this works.  But there's something called Isock.

Start time: 496.08
End time: 497.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, the Internet Society.

Start time: 497.98
End time: 499.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Internet Society is the.

Start time: 501.26
End time: 518.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Owner of domain names, they've been running.  Well, they run a certain number of domain names,  but because I can has been increasing the number of domain names out there,  then they've sort of they've got some of the key ones.  So Isock since 2003 has been running dot org.  It's been taken up by a lot of nonprofits.

Start time: 518.98
End time: 527.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nominally, I always thought dot org was restricted to nonprofits.  Yeah. And that if you saw dot org, you could say with some certainty,  oh, this is a nonprofit.

Start time: 528.04
End time: 540.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now you see that this is this is what 99  percent of the rest of us assumed as well.  But once this story broke, the Internet Society has been actually.  No, if you look at the paperwork, we never said it was explicitly for nonprofits.

Start time: 540.84
End time: 548.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, in fact, I know people who have dot org domain names  and they're definitely not profit.  Oh, not nonprofit.  We buy them. Did you have one? Yeah.

Start time: 548.28
End time: 551.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When we buy Schmeiser dot org, I also had that in schmeiser dot com for a while.

Start time: 552.16
End time: 554.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think for a family name, dot org is actually a good family.

Start time: 555.32
End time: 567.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we we would routinely when we get URLs,  would routinely get all of them dot net dot org.  Yeah. You just you just get those three.  A lot of times we wouldn't register them unless we could see all three of them.  So that we knew that we had that group.

Start time: 567.76
End time: 571.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nobody would kind of steal it by saying Pixelcore dot org.  And you think, oh, maybe.

Start time: 571.80
End time: 576.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But all the all the different websites we put up all had.  We always made sure we got we were able to get that.

Start time: 576.28
End time: 596.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So dot org was never really limited to it.  No, not at all.  It was just for clarity.  Dot gov. You can't get dot gov without being government.  Right. Or mill or edu.  Mill edu is that also pretty well.  Melanie to you both colored. Yeah.  But dot org.  So that was mostly just conventional wisdom that it was nonprofits.

Start time: 596.22
End time: 634.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was also because the pricing structure was set up in a way  which appealed to nonprofits and that you had that you had fixed term price caps.  You couldn't raise the domain costs more than 10 percent a year.  And that was built in right from the very start.  So it appealed an awful lot to to nonprofits.  But also you've got that dot org, which is a nice international  organizational kind of kind of approach.  So then about six weeks ago, the Internet Society said, you know what?  Maybe we should get rid of the price caps on this.  You know, what do you what do you guys think about this?  And ask the users.  Ninety eight percent said no.  And then they thought, well, we've thought about it.  Yeah, we're going to take a look, take away price caps.

Start time: 634.74
End time: 669.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, there you know what the consequence of something like that is.  If you look at some of the prices of some of the weird domains,  they can be thousands of dollars. Oh, yeah.  Even dot TV is an expensive domain to follow.  Take that, you know, take that pound of flesh.  So there is no set price for a domain at different TLDs.  Top level domains can have different prices.  Yeah, certainly.  And that price is set by the not by the registrar, but by the I can.  Or is it by the domain name host?  It is by the domain name. Yeah. OK.  So it could vary. You could shop around. Oh, yeah, absolutely.

Start time: 669.60
End time: 685.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But if you've actually built, you know, enormous amount of brand  into like Amnesty dot org or EFF dot org or something like that.  I mean, it's OK if you're in the West, but if you're a lot of African,  a lot of Asian charities have got into this.  If you jack their prices up 10 percent, that's kind of seriously  cut into their margins. Right.

Start time: 686.16
End time: 689.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it may not be just 10 percent.  No, there's now the limit.

Start time: 689.64
End time: 695.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the sky is now the limit.  And they announced as I say, is it a for profit organization?

Start time: 695.62
End time: 696.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Internet Society?

Start time: 696.46
End time: 707.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's I don't think it's technically for.  I mean, they are allowed to make a profit and they are supposed  to give a certain amount to charity.  But they do make money. Yeah.  And they've been increasing salaries quite quite readily.

Start time: 708.50
End time: 713.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they got it from Verisign in 2003.  Yeah. According to your article.

Start time: 714.00
End time: 718.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And now apparently they are selling  the dot org domain for a billion dollars.

Start time: 718.92
End time: 729.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's kind of a coincidence to raise the price caps.  Yeah. And then a few weeks later, sell it.  Sell it. Maybe this was the plan as they report in your publication.

Start time: 729.50
End time: 733.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They say if we had consulted publicly about this sale,  the opportunity would have been lost.

Start time: 735.26
End time: 742.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's a nice way to say, I wish the FCC would be that for threat.  You know, if we ask you guys, we know you say no.  So we just did it. So it sounds like.

Start time: 744.22
End time: 806.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you've got this private equity firm,  which didn't exist until a few months ago.  It's backed by three billion, their own private equity firm,  including by Mitt Romney's firm and then gain capital.  Yeah. And now they're looking to buy it for a million.  Sorry for a billion.  And guess what they're going to do with it.  They'll jack up the prices, pay themselves large management fees  and then run it for a profit.  And no one seems to be talking about this.  I mean, Tim Berners-Lee was on stage the day before we did a piece on this.  It was the number one question at the Internet Governance Forum  to put forward Tim Berners-Lee to answer.  And they ducked the question entirely.  I mean, he put out a tweet a day later saying, actually, I stand with my duck all.  But you are at the Internet Governance Forum.  It might have been a chance there to say this is a really dumb idea.  It's it's just things to high heaven.  I mean, one of the members of ICANN, I think it's the CEO,  is the leading member of this private equity firm.  They've got links to a former ICANN CEO as well.  It just stinks of a stitch up.

Start time: 808.92
End time: 821.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He Sullivan, who did talk about it to the register,  kind of, yeah.  Well, but he wasn't really very.  I thought he did a terrible job of representing himself.

Start time: 821.66
End time: 826.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, no. I mean, this guy, I think the only person who read that interview  and thought that was really good was Prince Andrew.

Start time: 829.20
End time: 866.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It didn't rise to the Prince Andrew level, but it was close.  So, for instance, was it Kieran who interviewed him?  Yeah, Kieran's an expert on this.  Kieran McCarthy.  So he asks, what about the people?  There are 10 million registrants.  What about the people who bought dot org?  Because it felt non-profit exactly.  He said, well, Sullivan, there's three million who registered names  prior to the transfer from VeriSign in 2003.  The remaining seven million, only 70 percent,  70 percent, only a small portion would have taken that into consideration.  Most people just look for a domain name and get it through a company  that's commercial.

Start time: 866.92
End time: 870.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Aha, really?  And yet they're not actually releasing figures on how much of that percent.

Start time: 870.68
End time: 877.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, it's even said a good number of dot org registrants  are domain name speculators.  So it's OK to take them for a ride.

Start time: 877.98
End time: 886.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Aha, right.  And if you're a charity  working in sub-Saharan Africa to try and get clean water for your people,  then just suck it up.  There's domain names quarters to punish.

Start time: 887.46
End time: 890.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So a billion dollars?

Start time: 890.58
End time: 894.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's rumored.  The actual figures haven't been released.  But yeah, they're...

Start time: 895.12
End time: 899.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They talked about it.  The opportunity might not have been there.  Exactly, exactly.

Start time: 899.20
End time: 922.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's like, you know, who wouldn't want that?  I mean, this is what I don't get about that.  Why people aren't getting more out of ratio.  It's a domain name system.  It's not as though you've got to develop new products or, you know,  it's an admin, a legal and some server type.  And it's a very low margin industry.  The only possible reason for removing price caps and selling off  is to jack up the prices and make everyone else pay for it.

Start time: 922.04
End time: 923.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And make a billion dollars.

Start time: 923.76
End time: 927.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  You know, this is the way vulture capitalism works.  It's just...

Start time: 928.40
End time: 934.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's sad that the Internet Society, which one thinks of as a...  I know, you'd think...  ...public benefit corporation.

Start time: 934.80
End time: 944.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Absolutely.  I mean, you know, they...  And they had a good reputation.  And then it's just gone like so much...  so much money under the bridge.  Sorry, water under the bridge.

Start time: 944.36
End time: 950.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sullivan said nothing short of a court order will stop this.  Yeah.  No, they've made up their minds.  This is his way of saying, make us.

Start time: 951.34
End time: 958.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, ICANN possibly can technically stop it,  but there seems to be vertical enthusiasm there.

Start time: 959.45
End time: 974.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who runs ICANN?  See, I go back to the days when it was a guy at USC, John Postle,  who just did the whole thing out of his office.  And ICANN, eventually the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers  became a little bit more professional.  Yeah.

Start time: 975.28
End time: 1003.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, technically professional.  If you look at some of the amounts of money they've spent,  the way they were sleptwalked into GDPR with the Who Is system,  whereby they would just say, well, you know, Who Is is really important.  We don't want to change the system.  GDPR has come in.  We'll negotiate, you know, an exit from this so we're not counted.  They took it to court four times each time the court said to them,  no, you do have to obey your European law if you're operating in Europe.

Start time: 1003.00
End time: 1019.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The problem with Who Is being it publishes the registrant's name  and address and phone number publicly.  Exactly.  And that's why many of us pay extra, actually with Hover,  I don't have to pay extra, although I imagine it's built into the price,  pay extra for Who Is privacy that uses an intermediary to hide our address.

Start time: 1019.84
End time: 1029.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the only people that really like Who Is are, you know,  sort of digital rights lawyers.  Because it massively reduces their costs. Well, yes.  OK, I was thinking legitimate businesses,  but yes, it's so.

It's just no guarantee they won't raise the price.  There's no longer a cap on it.  But what do we think that what do we actually think would happen?  And I'm just curious, like how far 10 percent is going to be a couple of dollars.  Would they double it, triple it?

So, I mean, it's if you're I think if you're a Western nonprofit,  it's not going to be a massive issue because, you know,  it'll just be a steadily increasing cost.  But because it's appeal to nonprofits so much around the world,  you know, as I say, if you're in sub-Saharan Africa or lower  Southeast Asia, that constant jacking up of costs, you've got to make a choice.  Do we make the switch now to another domain,  which might also face the same problem?  Do we just suck it up?  It just seems needlessly wasteful.  You know, it's like, yeah, you a couple of private equity firms  could make a profit out of this, but to the it doesn't really  give anything to the greater good.  And considering the number of nonprofits involved in this,  it's kind of like maybe we could just let this one pass  and you can make your money in other ways.

And this was this domain was making 20 million a month.  A month. Yeah.  And they just forged a signature, sent it to VeriSign and, yeah,  we'll take sign the domain to you.  And four years of legal arguments, the guy was on the run for two of them.  You know, I mean, this doesn't benefit the Internet in any way, shape or form.  Domain names should be a simple, cheap.  I mean, it's not so there are massive costs involved.  So make it simple, cheap and reliable.  And then we can get on with free market competition online.

Transcript:  So Eero is mesh Wi-Fi.  It's my it's Wi-Fi.  I'm right. And we use it because one of the reasons I love it is I can say to my  Amazon Echo pause Michael's Internet.  Oh, you know, it's a it's a great parlor trick because I go, OK,  everybody quiet, listen.  And I say, pause Michael's Internet.  You wait a bit and then.  It's great. It's wonderful. It's really fun.  It's the mean game to play.  No, but I have total control of the incident.  He can't go then echo unpause Internet.  No, it doesn't work that way.  He has to do what you're taking your time at home.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  Uh huh. I tell you what, these days, Wi-Fi, it's changed so much since it first came out.  And in fact, I think everybody's noticed Wi-Fi has gotten worse.  Right. And it's not really Wi-Fi's fault.  It's just that we're doing Netflix.  You've got the kids in the bedroom watching YouTube.  You got your watch and Netflix.  Mom is streaming something else.  You've got dead spots.  You've got all it's just complicated.  What you want is fast, reliable Wi-Fi that automatically shapes itself to your usage.  Doesn't buffer Netflix gives people the email they want when they want it without  slowing anything else down. And it's zero Eero.  It sets up in minutes, plugs right into your cable modem or your DSL modem.  You can manage it through the Eero app, which I'm big fan of.  In fact, I manage my mom's Wi-Fi too, because when I got the new Eero's,  the version two, which I use at home, I sent the old ones.  My mom set them up for her.  So if she has trouble with their Internet, I can literally go into the app and see what's going on.  See which of the actually the other day, one of her units was down.  I called her up. She said, yeah, unplug this.  Plug it back in.  You can check usage. You could check your bandwidth.  You could pause the Wi-Fi for any reason, whether it's dinner or bedtime,  or just because you want to mess with the kids.  You know, one of the things I really love about it,  I get an alert when a new device joins the network.  So when people come over, I can see that they've joined the network.  And if nobody has come over and we're just sitting there and says something's joined the network,  that's a cause for concern.  That's where you can investigate. You can do it all on the Eero app.  It's great for guests, too.  I have guest Wi-Fi and you can share it with them without compromising your own network.  And it expands to fit your needs.  If you're having a dead spot, you just go out, get another beacon, plug it into the wall.  And suddenly you can stream work and play everywhere in every corner of your home.  Look, you don't want to be spending time thinking about Wi-Fi.  What you really don't want to hear is the,  Dad, the Wi-Fi is down.  You don't have to think about it again.  Get Eero. You can get fixed right away.  Like you can have it tomorrow.  If you go to Eero, E-E-R-O dot com slash twit and use a code to it at checkout,  you'll get free overnight shipping with your order.  Don't delay.  Go to Eero today. Eero dot com slash twit.  Use the offer code twit to get that free overnight shipping.  You're getting the Wi-Fi every home deserves.  You're getting Eero.  I think they were the first consumer mesh.  And they've really lived up to their promise.  I have to say they've done such a fantastic job.

And yeah, you're not paying any rent to Comcast anymore.  You're not at their mercy anymore.  This was the strangest story. I saw this today.  I don't know what you think of this one, Alex.  Johnny Ive removed from Apple's leadership page.  Didn't he leave ages ago?  Why was he still on the leadership page?

Start time: 1474.26
End time: 1498.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's been a gradual exit.  A gradual exit where he may not have been that involved for a while.  And then they announced that they already announced, I think,  a couple of months ago that he was going to be a consultant for Apple.  But not be part of the team.  And then they just took a little bit more time to finally slowly phase them out.  Yeah. Look, look for a a slow week and have it just.

Start time: 1516.98
End time: 1568.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, a lot of these are years in development.  So from the time we get the laptop,  for the time it was designed, is maybe oftentimes a couple of years.  So they may have decided a long time ago that the butterfly keys didn't work.  And it just took a while to get it through the pipeline.  And they didn't want to admit it.  Because you have to design the key and then you have to design  exactly how it's going to feel.  And then you have to design exactly how you're going to manufacture it.  And then you have to test it a thousand.  You know, you have those little things that just bang on it.  Bang on the keys for, you know, literally all day, every day for weeks.  And so there's all these things that have to happen.  And those things take a long time to get through the pipeline.  So that might have been the reason he left. Who knows?  Like maybe he's just upset about the keys. But how dare you?  We worked so hard on the butterfly.  But my guess is those keys were probably corrected years ago.  Yeah. And then they just took a while to get out of here.

There's always like some like weird little glue that wasn't quite right  or some part of the process that gets itself kind of worked out.  And I prefer to wait.  I paid the price by ordering the Mac Pro's trash cans right out of the gate.  And there was just all these RAM issues.

I highly recommend it.  And I work fast.  He was one of the first designers that Target worked with architecture.  He's one of the first.  An architect.  The reason I know his name and the reason it stuck around is he was one of the first  brand name type designers Target began working with back in the Audis when they  started rolling out their quote unquote backstage lines.

End time: 1777.60

Start time: 1787.56
End time: 1834.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that a lot of us, though, we were sitting around our office at one point  talking about when the new Mac Pro comes out, you know, when they started to become  rumors that there was going to be a new one and they were going to redesign it.  And our big thing was is that we wanted it to be able to remove the feet and the head.  You know, that's what our complaint was.  We love the cheese grater, except what we didn't love was the fact that we couldn't  rack mount it and that we couldn't remove the handles and the feet.  You know, they were part of the design.  And we were just like, we just really want that.  And you can't you couldn't.  It's really painful to pick up a cheese grater and carry it around.  Oh, yeah.  The way the metal is.  Yeah, yeah.  So there was so it really felt like when they when they announced this, they kind of  sorted out what most of us that are pros that are using these heavy duty.  You know, we wanted to be extensible.  We want to be able to swap cards.  We want to add cards.  We want to be able to do all the things that we couldn't do with the trash can.

Start time: 1835.72

Start time: 1838.56
End time: 1847.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And a lot of us all said we don't need it to be any different than a cheese grater,  just slightly, you know, just to tune it up a little bit.  And we're good.  You know, we have different needs than a lot of other people.

Start time: 1847.98

Start time: 1853.96
End time: 1882.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and this one this one takes it a lot further.  I mean, it can.  It's a better chance ability.  The extensibility of this computer, because there are people.  These are all my work with.  You could pull out the modules that will spend 50 grand on upgrading this thing.  You know, and what we want is what I thought is that within the next couple of years,  I was going to have to move all my production to PCs because I wasn't going to have  anything that I could extend.  The only my biggest complaint about the Mac, the new Mac Pro is that we don't have  Nvidia cards because the.

Start time: 1883.24
End time: 1886.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, and we won't now.  Well, the Nvidia has decided not to no longer.

Start time: 1886.86
End time: 1887.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're not doing it anymore.

Start time: 1888.26
End time: 1965.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They gave up.  This is a control control issue where Nvidia wants to write the drivers.  Apple wants to write the drivers.  The problem is, is that the that the OS relies so much on on OpenGL or metal or that  they can't. Apple is not going to give up control of the of the raw code to the to  the card and Nvidia won't give up the control.  And it's been that way for, I don't know, a decade now.  I mean, and the problem is, is that the the way that ATI, it's not anymore, it's AMD.  Someone keeps on correcting me when I say that on shows.  AMD.  Former.  I call it ATI because the I think that the ATI graphics or the AMD graphics card  stink and the AMD CPUs are great.  I have a Threadripper at home.  I love that.  You know, I love the CPUs.  So I feel like their CPU unit done well.  And it really comes down to how they approach the way that they manage the data  coming through.  So the ATI, what used to be ATI, the AMD card breaks it into very small little  pieces that accelerate it.  And that process from a graphic, from a professional graphics perspective is really  painful compared to Nvidia.  And so your performance for heavy graphics solutions tends to be better on an  Nvidia and more stable than a than AMD.  At least that's so as we wrote it, it was that was what we were up to.

And then, you know, everybody in the, one of the big stories of Black Friday was  the Ryzen, the AMD parts flying off the shelves for people to build their own  computers. This is suddenly people are looking at AMD and saying it used to be,  you'd say, well, I'm going to save a lot of money, but I'm going to, and I'm going  to give up 15% performance now.  I'm going to save a lot of money over Intel and I'm going to get 15% better

They've been spending so much time trying to get to 10 nanometer and failing.  And failing.  And, you know, reducing demand, reducing production on the 14 nanometer and  then we're just going to stand the thing.  Let's up the margins a bit.  We'll get, then get extra cash.  And they're still warning OEMs.  We can't provide you with enough 14 nanometer chips.  This is an ideal time for AMD to swoop in and say, well, guess what?  We've got to, you know.

You know, so I, the main thing that I do, um, on my, uh, my, my PC is, is  photogrammetry and so I'm throwing, you know, what's photogrammetry.  So photogrammetry is you take fit photos of a, of a location or of an object from  multiple angles, and then you allow the computer to basically figure out, create  a 3d model from those photographs.  So it triangulates the position of the, the, the cameras, then builds depth maps  and, and generates geometry.  And for instance, the, the dataset that I'm working on right now has 493 million  polygons and you know, you can't run it on a Mac at the moment.  You can't, you can't, you can't move it around.  You can't do anything with you.  You like to move it, then you go do something else.

And so, so it, it is a, um, so those become, you know, issues that, that  the, you need these heavy lifts.  Now the other side of it is I, I still use, I still use motion and final cut.  And, and logic and you know, all those things.  And some of those are already, you know, as we move towards an 8K world and I'm  already editing on 6K, um, that I, I need that processing power.  I'm still, you know, I needed to be able to throw all that stuff in, do color  corrections, do, uh, you know, all the effects that I want to do.

Uh, and so much so that everybody agrees and Apple sort of telegraphing,  they're probably going to move off of Intel at some point.  There's no way though, they can do what the Mac pro is doing on arm.

Or you can somehow create a whole new code base of arm software.  So I imagine there's somebody writing logic and final cut in Apple on the  spaceship campuses, right?  And rewriting that for arm, right?

And so I think that that's going to, I have no idea how long that will take to  so we're a ways off, but, but I, and I think that it'll take a long time to  reproduce what AMD or Intel is doing is from a, from a sheer lift called the

So a lot of them, a lot of them will say, well, we're, you know, you want to  look at what the peak values are, as well as the constant values of how, how  many nits the monitors are.  And I believe, I can't remember exactly, but I believe that the Mac, the, the,  the new monitor is near a thousand.  It's constant.  And I think that it's 1600.  That's right.  I believe I don't have that right in front of me, but it, but those are  sunglasses when you were the brightest I've seen, the brightest I've seen, uh,  is 4,000 nits and that is, I mean, you feel like you feel like you should, you  should be feeling it.  Like when you see sunlight, you feel, no, it doesn't, it doesn't hurt.  It's just that it's so bright and the con and it's not just, you want, if you're

Transcript:  Well, and the big thing is also with these monitors, the other side of it is  also the, the big, uh, um, the big thing is, is that they're, the pixels can go  all the way to zero, you know, so that means that you get these super dark  blacks that you, that you don't, you don't typically, um, see on your monitor.  That's the HDR.  Well, no, no.  Well, HDR is the high dynamic range.  So we're talking about, I mean, the pure HDR is not pure, but the, the production  HDR we call PQ 2020 and that is the new format, um, that is going to describe a  much wider range of brighter, brighter, brighter, brighter, darker, darker.

Start time: 2494.62

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what is, why do you need to see brighter, brights and darker darks?  That's how life looks.  No, no, I'm just, I'm just, I'm trying to extrapolate out like the, the, the, the  business applications or the industry or the industry applications or like why  this is a net benefit to some industry or some, some end user.

Start time: 2511.90
End time: 2531.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It turns out that most of us, uh, will notice the quality of the image more  readily if we look at the dynamic range than if we look at resolution.  If we have, if we have a 4k image and a 10 ADP image, a lot of people can't  tell the difference between that.  Um, whereas especially at some distance, right.  But a lot of people will see the difference in the monitor and I had a way.

Start time: 2532.30
End time: 2534.98

Start time: 2535.46
End time: 2586.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And especially in it, where it makes a difference is not for instance, in a  studio like this that has been lit for SDR, you know, this is, you know, the,  the we've compressed, we've everything's designed it.  It's everything's bright.  Well, it's designed for it though.  It's designed for that range, but when you go into HDR, so SDR, I believe is in  the, I never remember the exact number, but it's about four or five stops of  light, each stop is twice as much light as the last one.  Whereas HDR is in the 15, 15 to 18 stops of light.  So it's, it's an, remember each stop is twice as much as the last one.  So it's a huge range of, of brightnesses.  And we can't describe, if you shoot in SDR, um, we can't describe an outside  scene where the sun's out.  It'll immediately one part's too dark and the other part's too bright.  It's out of the gamut of SDR.

This is another visual leap like that, where you'll have a technology that allows  you to more accurately convey degrees of shading of light.

I'm looking for something.  I think you want it that way.  But if you're using augmented reality on say a space station or down in Antarctica  to walk somebody through removing a tumor while they're snowed in for five months,  this is when visual acuity is going to matter.  And so what I'm trying to, what I'm, what I'm trying to think about now is, is, or  what I'm, and you know, many things, so you may be the one to answer this question.  How long until this gets to a point where it's not just for filming and industry use,  but it moves into consuming, consumer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that they, they, they, they, they learned from Google what not to do, which  is let average people just wander around with the stuff on and do things that were  inappropriate.  And so whereas they, by keeping it inside the industry, they were able to, and I, I,  you know, they've done some great stuff in construction, for instance, where you can  walk onto a construction site and visualize all the things that are out there in front  of you before they're built and have a discussion about it.

Start time: 2818.98
End time: 2853.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so one of the demos I got to do with the HoloLens was precisely that where we  walked onto a construction site, you got to see how parts got, you got to see how to  build things within the constraints of regulations and with the constraints of where  the electrical outlets have to go, wherever the ventilation shafts have to go, things  like that.  And I also really liked another one of the demos I did had you taking a look and trying  to repair plumbing infrastructure, not knowing how, and then being able to call up a manual  right in your left hand periphery and a live expert in your right.  That's the one I like.  And that was the one that blew me away was the idea.

But what we did is we we could have a camera, the same camera on either side of a, you  know, thousands of miles apart.  And you're telling I have the camera, they have the camera.  I'm seeing what you're seeing.  You're seeing what I'm seeing.  And you have someone trying to learn how to use the camera.  And I'm going, no, no, don't touch that button.  Touch this button.  And your ability to very quickly have a conversation about that.  And that was just with glass.  And that was five years ago.  I mean, it's not even new, you know, new stuff.  But I think that, you know, there's a from a learning perspective, from an experiential  perspective, there's going to be a huge explosion, but it's still

But we seems like we hit a brick wall where and it may be seen on Canning Valley, but  we can't get I mean, video games today are pretty realistic.  Yeah.  But they're not you would never mistake it for reality.  We're still are we still making that progress or did it just slow down or have we hit a  wall?  Some of it has to do with the lowest.

Start time: 2937.20
End time: 3083.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're still building video games for the lowest common denominator.  So if I put a you knew everybody's using a Mac Pro and if I knew that everyone was  using a really powerful PC with four GPU with four top of the line GPUs and I have seen  solutions, ray tracing, Nvidia ray tracing GPUs.  The ray tracing is not as important as the global illumination.  So being able to calculate shadows in soft light is actually the ray tracing is cute.  I mean, I'm glad that they're doing it, but I don't I rendered, you know, 50 shots for  Star Wars without any ray tracing with a shiny ship.  You know, so I you know, it doesn't you don't need you didn't do it in real time.  No, I didn't do it in real time.  But I'm saying I didn't need ray tracing either to pull it off.  You use reflection maps and stuff like that.  And so so it's not you don't need the ray tracing is useful for things.  But but I'm more interested in the, you know, the global illumination.  The illumination that's calculating.  If you think of light is like heat, you know, it hits something heats that up and then it  bounces off. So it's all the indirect light that we have that really makes things look  that sounds like ray tracing.  And then that what you're doing is bouncing.  Well, that's ray tracing from the point of the light bouncing around and then getting  to the this is but it's just reflecting in a way that global illumination is really area  of light. OK, but the the the big thing is, is being able to add.  So part of the problem that we have right now is we can't add enough geometry.  So, like, even even now, I've been doing a bunch of A.R. tests with Apple's reality  composer, about a million and a half polygons.  That's that's what I can put into into an iPhone, last generation iPhone.  And so I don't like that's about a video game doing these days.  Oh, they were that they do more than that.  But the the I don't know exactly what the numbers are.  It depends on how they chop it up and everything else.  But but the point is, is that we need to get to a point where we're processing 50 to 100  million polygons. We're processing, you know, gigs of texture maps.  And of course, some of that is managed by using what we call level of detail.  So LODs where you change the resolution based on the distance to the camera.  But those are you still need to have that.  That's what's not making it look real. That and motion capture, you know, motion  capture is kind of it got us 90 percent there.  But we have to get to a point where the characters are.  A.I. is driving the character motion and it's not being it's not supposed to.  They just move the way they should.  It's not it's not it's not like I'm because right now most of us are still

Boy, I have a lot more questions like why do you think Intel stumbled?  But I got to take a break.  I'll let you guys think about that.  And I also want to talk about Apple giving Crimea to Russia.  It was very nice of them.  Thank you, Apple.  Our show today brought to you by my beautiful mattress.  You know, sometimes you look around at the world  and you get home and you're you're you're sanctum sanctorum.  Your your your special place is that that bed in your bedroom  and you get in bed and you pull the covers up over your head  and you want it to be perfect.  You want it to feel great.  You want to spend the night there and not worry about the world.  Just just sleep the way a baby sleeps.  That's why you need a Casper mattress.  It's a sleep brand that is created.  They're an online only retailer, premium mattresses.  And that's key online only because they eliminate the middleman  so they can make beautiful, fantastic mattresses  without that big markup like the 100 percent markup  that the mattress store makes.  Now, there are there's a downside to that because I think a lot of people  for a long time thought, well, I have to go to the mattress store  and sleep on the mattress or lie on it anyway for five minutes if I want to buy it.  So Casper had to solve that.  And they took that engineering approach to that problem, too.  They they they put their great minds to it and said, oh,  what if we let you have it for 100 days?  And if any time in the 100 days is not perfect, you send it back.  We give you every penny back.  How about that?  That's the key.  And mattresses are just the beginning at Casper.  Their engineering talent has now created that glow light.  I love that glow light helps you fall asleep at dims.  It slowly wakes you up.  You could pick it up and carry it to the bathroom with you.  And it's nice and low.  Won't you wake you up?  They also have bed frames now.  Everything you need to create that special place you go to.  To run away from the rest of the world.  Casper just introduced a new hybrid mattress collection.  I just got the hybrid mattress.  It combines the pressure relief of their original award winning foam.  But they've done something.  You know, it's funny. It's a little at first, you know, they said no springs, no springs.  But they they realize there's a certain reason you might want springs.  And so this hybrid mattress collection has the foam,  but also durable and very gentle springs.  And actually, I prefer I love it.  You got to try it.  It offers luxurious comfort, resilient support, elevated lift.  So it's a little it's a little more active in its support.  It also is more durable for all body types.  The spring network actually enhances airflow.  It's always been good on a Casper mattress.  It is even better now.  So it really helps you sleep cool.  Very important to sleep.  And for a man of a certain girth like myself,  the other thing the spring does, it gives you edge support, a little bit better edge support.  So I used to roll out of bed in the morning, literally roll out of bed.  Now with the springs, I could sit up and get out of bed like a normal human.  There's my Casper hybrid mattress.  I just got it.  Like all the Casper mattresses, I still don't know how they do this.  They comes in a surprisingly compact box.  That is a king that is in a box.

Because once you open it up, it goes...  And then it expands out.  And now it's full size.  But watch the comfort.  So even though it's got springs, there's no sense of springs.  It's just a little bit better edge support, a little bit.  I just love it.  So soft and comfortable.

So they flew special forces troops into Crimean airports  who then took over the airports and then they flew in troops  in on commercial airliners.  It was I mean, it was an amazing thing.  But at the same time, it worked.  Whether or not it's ethically there, I have severe doubts on that front.  Since, well, of course, it's less than a good thing.

So, you know, Apple has said, here's the deal, we're not going to let you into the phone.  You know, like, we're not going to give anybody the encrypted part.  You know, like, you know, we're not going to...  That part, Apple, I don't think is given.  I could be wrong, but I don't believe Apple has given that to any country under incredible duress.  You know, they've said, no, we're not going to do that now.  The iCloud, everything else is all kind of like, well, we follow the laws that we have.  But and I, to some degree, I think that if they're going to draw a line,  I'm happy they're drawing at least a line there because nobody else is.

And so this may only be to get, you know, a handful of more sales through,  I mean, not handful of millions, but there may be a push  for the next couple of years to buy lots of Apple products  because you won't be able to buy them after that.  You'll have to use Russian.  Yeah.  So this is them having a fire sale in effect?  Yeah, exactly.  I'm not sure, but I believe that's the case, that Russia is going to press down.

The president really loved the...  The glorious leader went down very well.  And they did not mention glorious leaders factual gaffe or Tim Cook's...  How interesting.  Yeah.  Good research, yeah.  And so I thought to myself, granted, Apple news is not a huge revenue driver for Apple.  But what this does point to is right now, you have a company that is trying to sell a product  with a premium subscription.  And this is a company that's also shown very publicly and on the record  that they are fine with letting lies slide if it's politically expedient.  Wow.

And then when it turns around and bites them on the backside three years later,  and they're so...  Actually, we're fine defending lies.  You know?  But hey, check out the share price.  It's great.

End time: 3978.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But China has a law now that it's illegal to make deep fakes.  And you have to be identified as such, which in fact seems like a good idea.  And Singapore says, I guess it depends on your point of view,  that if a story is fake, it has to be labeled as such.  Problem with this one is that the story comes from a dissident Singaporean who is in residence  in Australia.  They're trying to extend this kind of labeling to outside the country.

That the Singapore government says this post has false information.  That's only visible in Singapore, by the way.  The Singapore government said it had instructed Facebook to publish a correction notice in  that November 23rd post, which contained accusations about the arrest of a whistleblower  and election ringing in Singapore.  You know, if it is fake news, then it's appropriate to say you got to label it as such.  I mean, don't we wish we could get Facebook to stop politicians from lying in their ads?

I think that all of this is really much more complicated than, oh, we should...  I think that you either do what Twitter and Google...  What Twitter did, which said, we just don't want the money.

No, no, to constantly say, don't believe any single point.  No, don't believe any sort...  Oh, that's great.  And they have to think about it.  It drives my wife crazy.

Oh God, that one's going to live with me tonight.  The first priority for all of these platforms is not...  Well, the first priority for these platforms is shareholder value.

Transcript:  But I think as a user we have to decide...  I think that the responsibility is going to end up being in the user's hands.  Well it has to be, unfortunately.  We have to look at that news.  I mean, the news has never been the news.  The news has never been true.  The news has been what somebody pushed from some different direction from somewhere.  And we have to get to a point where we can discern it.  And how do you discern it?  If you don't know...  You know it's slanted, but you don't know why or by whom.

Transcript:  So generally for me, and I don't know whether I'm discerning the truth or not, but I look  at it from many different angles.  Whether it's I want to see what Fox says about it.  I want to see what NPR says about it.  MSNBC, Al Jazeera.  The things that they all agree on, probably pretty close to the truth.  The things that they...  Everything else is probably BS.  And so it's their own little version of their angle or whatever.  And when you see that, when you're watching all of those, very quickly you know what their  angle is.  If you look at five or six different ranging from conservative to liberal, you will very  quickly...  They don't agree on anything.  So far they're agreeing like that somebody went somewhere.  But that's called facts.  And said some things.

I mean, if you couldn't justify a fact that you were putting in print, he would slap you  silly.  And it's got to...  I think we've got to extend this.

One of the behaviors I've noticed with my nine-year-old daughter, which I find fascinating,  is before she asks Siri a question, she asks it two to three test questions where she already  knows the answer.  Oh, that's interesting.  Because she wants to see...  She's a little lie detector.  Well, she wants to see how well Siri knows her Siri stuff.  So this way she won't trust an answer from Siri until she can gauge how accurate Siri  versus Google Assistant is on something.

And I happened to be there doing some other work.  But I was there on the election night and I watched.  I'm standing where CNN International is reporting.  I'm two blocks from them.  And they're reporting this huge crowd of people that were all excited about the elections.  I lean out.  There's nobody in the streets.  And I look way down there and there's 20 people around a camera.  And what they did is they took the camera and they rocked it up high and pointed it  down so they could show a crowd.  There was maybe 30 people there.  But it was like...

And that's where the press is...  Slanting.  ...been slanting forever, since the day it existed.  And I think that we have to be clear that just because something is fact-checked and  everything else doesn't mean that it hasn't been slanted.  As you were stating, who you choose to interview and how you ask those questions and where  you go with those things.  Again, it's not lying, but it's not the truth.  And it's important for us as viewers to become intelligent and to educate ourselves by looking  at it from different angles, by not believing just what we're being handed.  We're all much more cynical than we used to be.

Our show today brought to you by LastPass, another promo.  Very good news.  You know how there's Citibank Field and Quicken Loans Arena?  We've been trying for as long as I've been here to sell naming rights to this studio.  I thought this was kind of a nutty idea, right?  We sold it to LastPass.  Don't tell them.  It's a great idea.  No, no, it is a great idea.  It's going to be, people say, are you still Twitter?  Yes, it's still Twitter.  Instead of the Brickhouse studios or the Eastside studios, we're now at the LastPass studios.  That'll start January 1st.  We're really thrilled.  We love LastPass.  It's a perfect partner because, as you probably know, I've been using and recommending LastPass  long before they ever became an advertiser for a decade since they started.  Steve Gibson, about five years ago, I asked him, have you used LastPass?  He interviewed Joe Segrist.  He went over and talked to Joe, the creator of LastPass, looked at the source code and  said, yeah, they're doing it exactly right.  LastPass even since then has been getting better and better and better.  It's an award-winning password vault.  I should probably explain what it is.  Password vault, a password manager that helps millions of individuals and over 58,000 organizations  navigate their online lives easily and securely.  Normally that's a, you know, kind of those two don't go together.  It's either convenient or secure, but not both.  LastPass is both.  LastPass helps you generate long, strong passwords that are completely unmemorable, stores them  in its encrypted vault and pops them up and fills them in wherever you are, anytime you  need them.  The vault is never decrypted except on your devices with your special login.  I actually use a YubiKey because they support two-factor too.  So I make sure nobody can get to my vault, but man, it's there when I need it on Windows,  on Mac, on Linux, in every browser, iOS and Android too.  It is a truly awesome product.  And in business it's so important because, you know, when we give, you know, we just  got a new bookkeeper.  It makes it really easy to share with different team members and even teams so that that way  a new team member is integrated in right away.  We have folders for ops, for engineering, for finance.  LastPass minimizes the risk and gives your IT team a break because users can reset their  passwords, no lockouts.  There are a variety of authentication solutions including not just two-factor but multi-factor  that takes advantage of geolocation, IP address, users behavior.  So you really know that the people who are using your resources are the right people,  the people who are supposed to.  You completely can manage and control user access for every access point in your organization.  I love their identity solutions and I love the dashboard we get with an integrated view  and authentication tasks so we know who's accessing what, when and where.  Securely manage every password in your business because these days the Post-it note on the  monitor is just not a good way to store a password.  I was at the drugstore the other day and I saw they sell little books that have the label,  they say on the front of the book, my passwords.  I think that's handy when somebody breaks into your house they should know where to  go to take all your passwords with them.  That's why I use LastPass.  In fact I trust it so much.  We store all of everything in there including Wi-Fi log and software licenses, employee  IDs.  I put in my personal LastPass vault passwords but also social security numbers, my passports  in there, my driver's license.  It's secure, it's safe.  When I travel I have LastPass with me and if I lose my password I know I have an image  of it but no one else can get it, only me.  LastPass Enterprise for the business, LastPass Family for your family, LastPass Premium for  you, there's a LastPass for everybody and they've just expanded their business lineup  with some great features.  You're going to love it.  I want you to check it out, lastpass.com slash twit and find out how LastPass can help you  in your business and your life.

Transcript:  It makes it easy to be very aggressive about your passwords.  I have these long hashes because you just go, eh, just turn it on.  I'm not going to try to remember what that is.  I have it on all my devices and the ability to share a login without sharing the password  in our company was key.  We worked on a lot of secure events and it just became secondary, second nature that  you'd send somebody, like you have to log into this account but I don't want to ever  give you the password because the password can also tell you how people build their passwords.

So the idea is when you're programming this, like say you're doing a jeopardy, a trivia,  and the person gets it wrong, you can use the SSML tag that says disappointed and then  they'll say instead of I'm sorry, you're wrong.  Oh, I'm sorry.  She'll pull an Alex Trebek.  Actually, that would be an even better tag.  Like superciliously condescendingly disappointed.  That would be a good tag or just call it the Trebek.

Transcript:  Well, you know, this reminds me of and I think I said this when we were talking before the  show in William Gibson's book, Mona Lisa Overdrive, one of the characters at the beginning,  Angela, is talking to her house's smart computer and she decides that she's in such a foul  mood that she wants the house computer to be terrified of her and the house computers  like this.  And she's like, no, make it more intense.  And the computer like, please pick up the phone.  And she's like, fine, keep it that intensity.  That's what you want.  I think what unsettles me both about that anecdote and this potential for the technology  is you may have people who are like, it makes me feel big and powerful to have the machine  afraid of me.

Should we?  Shouldn't we make them sound more robotic, not less?  I agree with him, to be quite frank.  Me too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't like it when parents teach their children.  Well, I don't know.

And we model please and thank you because we want to make sure that we don't we want  to make sure we don't normalize the idea that you can verbally abuse technology.  But you can.  You can.  But that kind of behavior, it's almost a parasocial relationship.  And then that kind of behavior becomes normalized and social reactions as well.

But it's just like and actually Google did something very interesting when they think  the last build, if you've got a child's voice on that, it will thank you for saying thank  you and being polite.  Oh, that's actually a really good way of encouraging politeness or anthropomorphization.  I know.

Transcript:  There was a really great study that came out in the 90s that found out that people actually  regarded the characters on television as their friends.  They actually had closer emotional connections to them than they did some of the people in  their life.  And the researchers said, well, they see these people once a week.  The TV characters are more steady presences in their life.  They don't demand much.  It's a rewarding parasocial relationship.  And I think that we're going to see the same type of thing with technology, where people  like when I ask human beings questions, it can be stressful and I don't know how to ask  the right question.  But Siri doesn't get mad if I have to rephrase my question five or six times.  I still find out an answer.  I can rely on them.  That said, I don't think it should be with the people voice.  I think it should be used very clearly and explicitly as a tool so there's less of a  chance of there being this heavy duty emotional identification.

Transcript:  When I took my first tech writing class in college, the best thing the professor said  was remember that any time somebody picks up the manual, it's because they've already  screwed up on their own and they're looking for answers.  So you have to understand no one reads a manual.  That's good.  She's like, no one reads a manual first.  They always read it when they're upset and confused and need answers.  So write with that in mind.  That's really good.  And I would actually like to see more digital assistance developed from that perspective  to where if you're calling on an assistant, it's because you need something.

And I don't know if this is an issue or not.  There is a email authentication.  There's actually several email authentication technologies.  Yeah, one of them is DMARC.  There's SPIF, there's DKIM.  If you use one of our sponsors' devices for your email, it automatically does all of those.  If you use Gmail, I think it does all of those.  But not all email providers do it.  And what the idea of DMARC is, it proves you are the sender.  And more importantly, it allows inbound email recipients to block unauthenticated mail.  It's one way of fighting spam because nobody sending spam can be authenticateable.  Yeah.  Apparently, according to Zach Whitaker, very good tech guy at TechCrunch, DMARC is barely  being used by the presidential candidates.  Only seven of the Democrats are using it.  He actually has a little table here.  The green is people who are using email authentication.  Joe Biden, Mike Bloomberg, Steve Bullock.  I don't even know who he is.

They shouldn't have been talking about it.  And then they should have tied it up.  But the point I'm trying to make, though, is that how great would it have been if Joe  Walsh actually ran for president?  Like from the Eagles?  Like from the Eagles?  Yeah, like the Eagles.

Transcript:  So we started the show with Outrage over dot org.  We're going to end with Outrage over dot gov.  A different dot gov, dot gov dot ca.  I'll talk about it in just a second.  But first a word from Wasabi, our sponsor.  Wasabi Hot Cloud Storage.  80% of enterprises in the next five years will have shut down their cloud, their on  prem and replaced it with cloud.  And probably you're working for one of those companies.  Maybe your company is one of those companies.  And I know the first question everybody says, well, is it going to be as useful, as secure,  as reliable as my on premises storage?  Well, I've got the answer for you.  Wasabi it is.  It's going to be more secure than your on prem storage, more reliable, more robust.  Wait you say, is Wasabi Amazon?  No.  Is it Google?  No.  Is it Microsoft?  No.  It is another cloud service that I want you to add to your list.  There's lots of good reasons to take a look at Wasabi Hot Cloud Storage.  It is 80% cheaper and up to six times faster than Amazon S3.  Unlike S3, they don't charge you for egress.  Unlike S3, they don't charge you for API requests.  And oh, by the way, they support the S3 API.  So you already have tools and know how to use it.  It's enterprise class cloud storage with 11 nines of durability.  One of the things I love about this, they have immutable storage.  That is really useful because you know, you could put something on the Wasabi cloud and  that ransomware can't get to it.  A fumble fingered employee can't get to it.  You can't change it.  You can get to it, but you just can't change it.  That means you're safe from ransomware.  They also have, of course, data center redundancy and regular file integrity checking.  So if a file is changed by even one bit, they can immediately replace it with a good copy.  You'll never even see it.  We're talking the software and hardware combined that is more secure than on-prem storage,  more reliable.  It's HIPAA compliant.  It's FINRA compliant.  It's CJISP compliant.  Instead of giving you more headaches, you're going to have fewer headaches and you're going  to do it for less with Wasabi.  I just want you to try it.  I just want you to try it.  I was talking to somebody yesterday.  We all got together after Steve's event.  He said, yeah, well, but nobody ever get fired for buying Amazon.  Just like nobody ever got fired for buying IBM.  But you know what?  Nowadays, it's a competitive environment.  That default answer isn't the right answer.  You need to check out Wasabi.  A lot of great companies have already moved to Wasabi.  You should go to wasabi.com.  Use the offer code TWIT and you can have unlimited free storage for a month.  And I mean bang on that sucker.  Wasabi, W-A-S-A-B-I dot com.  Click the free trial link under the promo code TWIT.  Cut your cloud storage costs by 80% without giving up anything.  In fact, you're going to get quite a few things.  Wasabi.  This one actually, this story penetrated to the real world.  My brother-in-law said, I heard that California's DMV is selling our information.  And they are to the tune of $50 million a year.  Now you may say, well, I don't live in California, but apparently many departments of motor vehicle  are doing this.

Transcript:  And this is information you're required to provide to get a license.  It's not like you have a choice, including names, physical address, car registration  information.  The motherboard found this out.  They did a public records request.  They asked the DMV for the total dollar amounts paid by commercial requesters of data for  the past six years.  And it started at 2013 of 41 million, climbed up to 52 million last year.  They didn't get the names of the requesters, but some companies, motherboard says, appeared  frequently in earlier investigation that looked at DMVs across the country.  They include LexisNexis, Experian, the credit reporting agency, and private investigators.

Transcript:  The thing that had me just reeling the whole way through and on the way home is I kept  going to all the different smart kitchens.  And I'd have my interviews and my demos.  And then I would ask, so what is your data privacy policy?  Do you disclose the data that you're collecting from the smart fridges and the smart ovens?  How is it being stored?  How is it being sold?  Do I, as a user, have the option to edit data?  And consistently, the answer from vendors was, no, you never get to see what we're collecting.  You have no say in this.  We're not going to even tell you how it's stored or what the security protocols are  for it or who we're selling this data to.  And it's...  I remain sort of astonished that this is bog standard with doing business as opposed to  there being a level of transparency saying the good news is you have a smart refrigerator  that tells you when to buy milk.  That smart refrigerator is also logging how often you drink milk.  It's going to collate you in a database of other milk drinkers in the U.S.  We're going to bundle that up.  We're going to sell it to the National Dairy Board.  We're going to sell it to Borden.  We're going to sell it to...

Or to know, or to just know what the flow of milk is in a certain area.  If it's anonymized and it's not geographically specific, I think that there are a lot of  interesting things that can be derived from that.  That is not damaging me in any real way.  I do think that the idea that you can build a map of somebody based on all of the things...  The hard part...  We can do this discussion.  My security concerns about people messing with my phone.  I don't even take my iPhones to Apple to fix.  I don't know if I said that on the show, but I've never actually taken...  If my phone breaks, I just buy a new phone.  I'm not going to give it to anybody.  The reason is...  How do you destroy it though in a way that nobody can get the data off of the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did an article on this based on a Defcon talk.  It is surprisingly hard to destroy all the data in an unreadable...  Because their premise was, if you're running a data center and a three letter agency knocks  down the door, is it possible to destroy that data really quickly?  And even using thermite and various other things, it really isn't.  If you've got a phone that you don't want anyone looking again, you take the memory  chips out and this is their advice, you beat them to death with a hammer and then you deposit  them in various different bins in the...  In Mr. Robot.  ... so no one's got them all.

You know, they don't actually leave.  They're mostly inert.  So the thing that...  My argument is that your phone is probably the most powerful and dangerous thing that  you carry around and letting people randomly get a hold of it.  And so in the same way, because people, once they see your phone, once someone actually  has all the data in their phone, they can not only look at what you did in the past,  but they can start modeling what you're going to do in the future.  And that becomes a very complicated process.  I love our audience.

So we had 1903, which was supposedly released in March of 2019, actually it was May, but  close enough.  Then we had, we just got 1909 again released in October, but it was supposed to be September.  And so the problem is that this first release of the year 2020 is going to be called Microsoft  Windows 10 2003.  And that's a problem, especially since there's already a Windows Server 2003.

Transcript:  So there seems to be a loophole.  And Paul and Mary Jo and I have been kind of speculating about this on Windows Weekly  for some time.  We keep hearing reports that, well, remember when Microsoft came out with Windows 10, you  could, for the first year, just install it on top of 7 and it would activate and it'd  be fine.  Seems like it still works.  And there was a post on Reddit the other day by a Microsofty.  He says, I work in the Windows team.  And yeah, Microsoft doesn't want to talk about it.  But Terry Meyerson, who runs Windows, was actually more interested in upgrade numbers than revenue,  since they've really given up on revenue from Windows.  So he'd much more rather have to be able to say, 90% of our users are now on Windows 10.

Transcript:  So the story goes, if you go to the Microsoft site, download the Windows Media Creation  tool with Windows 10, you'll be able to get the 2004 edition and install it on top of  Windows 7, no serial number needed.  It will install and activate.  And at that point, of course, you have an entitlement and then you could wipe the drive  if you wanted.  It wouldn't matter.  You can install Windows 10 whenever you want.  So I just mentioned that in passing.  Remember, if you do it, it's not my fault if it fails or it doesn't activate.  And you say, but Leo, I want my Windows 7.

Transcript:  They're you know, their revenue goes into three buckets.  They have one bucket that's essentially the Azure and cloud.  They have one called productivity.  I can't remember the name off the top of my head, but that's where they're putting office  Now, Microsoft 365 really subscription service.  And the last bucket is more personal computing, which is where their revenue from OEMs, from  surface, from Bing, bizarrely enough, and from this way quaint and from Windows.  Actually, Bing is like a five billion dollar a year business.  Really?  Yes.  They've always done corrected.  Right.  They make a lot of money and they've had, I think, close to 19 quarters of consecutive  revenue growth.

End time: 7462.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually have a spreadsheet where I keep track of this stuff.  You pay attention to this stuff.  But what's notable is that typically more personal computing was the big revenue driver  for Microsoft every quarter.  And now the Azure division is making as much money as more personal computing does.  And it shows that Microsoft's been really successful in shifting its business focus  away from the end user and more towards distributed cloud services.  It's all about Azure.  All about Azure, baby.  When I was at Ignite a few weeks ago and we were at the keynote, Satya Nadella did not  mention Windows once in that keynote.  Isn't that amazing?  Not once.  What a change.
