Transcript:  This is  Listeners like you. Thanks for your donations.  Ladies gentlemen, this is Twit 123. You can follow along in the  Twit playbook at deliciousdel.ico.us slash twit slash 123.  We're also streaming live today via Ustream. So don't count on  me editing out any bad things you say because it's too late.  Everybody's already heard it.  Joining us on the panel and being very quiet now. Mr. John C.  Dvorak.org slash blog take a drink.  Hey there.  Good to have you.  Vodka.  Vodka. Is that your drink of choice? I thought it was kaha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but that's what I recommend. Mainly because it's going to be  less likely to give somebody a headache if we say  dvorak.org slash blog enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Haha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We will also welcome Mr. Will Harris from England.  Hello.  Where you cannot get a Kindle.  No, but you can get an iPhone.  We also.  Yeah, it sucks being you doesn't it Will?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It does. Apart from my marvelous, you know, internet video at  channelflip.com. It's all it's all it's all terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  channelflip.com channelflip.com channelflip.com take three  drinks.  Also here it is the wonderful and talented Callie Lewis from  geekbrief.tv dcad or callie.com and now the iule.tv. Hey Callie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, that's a lot to promote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  John, you're going to wish you had this idea.  This is such a good idea. A yule log for your iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What just a burning log?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, with some music go to iule.tv. This is so brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Basically, for us, it's a way to bring some much deserved  attention to Jeff Smith and erase some money for charity and  experiment with the whole idea of premium RSS content.  Basically, it's you know, fireplace, the crackling audio  is in there and Jeff Smith's original score. And to me, it's  the results are hypnotic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And at $5 a pop could be quite lucrative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  Well, as I said, we're splitting profits and charity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I like this story though, that you got this idea from Timothy  Ferris and his four hour work week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Yeah, I'm actually getting to interview Tim soon,  hopefully this week. He always talks about virtual products and  making products that you can set up and then be able to let  somebody else handle the dealings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, you know who he got this idea from his PUD. I'll  talk about that in a second.  Alex PUD, the guy who started EFT company. He told me this. He  said, here's my here's how I get rich. I start websites that I  don't have to run. They just run themselves like EFT. And then  they just then it's an annuity. In fact, I had a I had a manager  called me up a couple of weeks ago saying, Leo, Leo, yeah, I  can imagine him with a cigar. Leo, you're not making all the  money you could. Leo, the key is annuities. You set up  annuities. Things you just make your money. You just make your

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  money. Yeah.  I like it. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Also, I challenge you to do the whole show in that voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, you don't. Because I'll do it and you'll be sorry. Also,  you're Don Risinger who's willing wishing he was not right  now. But he he doesn't come bearing a Yule log, but he  comes bearing his very own URL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's about time, right, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  About time. Digitalhome.Cnet.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you have to make sure to throw in the in there. Also  won't work.  The? Oh, well, somebody else has the Digital Home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They couldn't give you two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know. It goes to another digital home part of  the site. So I guess we got thrown as us was if it's the  digital home.Cnet.com we all set.  And never ends. That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it still resolves to these funky numeric things from  vignette. These lousy URLs, these SEO bad SEO URLs.  Okay, that's the panel. Thank you very much. We'll see you  later. Bye bye.  Bye.  Wouldn't it be funny? We did a six minute twit.  Everybody went home.  I think it'd be funny.  It would be an improvement.  It would be an improvement. I think everybody'd love it.  So I guess since Callie has a Kindle, we could talk a little  bit about the Kindle.  John, what do you think of the idea before we get to Callie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think you know what I think or you wouldn't even ask  me what you think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're going to give Mr. Cranky Pants the floor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Cranky Pants. Take the floor.  The likelihood of this thing being successful is, let's see,  zero.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I guess the Sony readers only sold a handful.  Forty two.  Forty two of them.  And Scobel, who was real hot on this now, Scobel, in fact,  I should get him on.  He says, here's my one week review of Amazon's Kindle.  He couldn't wait.  Here's my, I've read two books on it and that's why I haven't  twitted much.  He drinks a lot of coffee.  I focus on a few areas.  Knowability by paper goods from Amazon through Kindle.  Usability sucks.  UI sucks.  Knowability to send electronic goods to anyone else.  I know.  No social network.  No touch.  No social network.  Do you want Facebook on Kindle?  We don't need another social network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want Twitter on my Kindle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A social network is the answer to everything.  For Scobel.  We'll solve it through a social network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No touch screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It doesn't. Wait a minute.  Stop, stop, stop.  It doesn't have a touch screen at all.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No.  Why?  It has that goofy little scroll.  Now, I should say, Callie's going to say he likes this.  So I'm not going to.  But, and I haven't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the time we're done with her, she's not going to say anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Callie's got the guts to stand up to a strong personality.  Stand up and call a piece of crap great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The hardware does have some issues that need some improvement.  But this thing, I think is strong.  And we're comparing a first gen device here to a sixth gen iPod.  That, you know, I keep approaching it as a touch screener.  I did it first, but it may be the case with Kindle that people wait until the fifth or sixth gen.  But I hope not.  I hope that people early adopt and it becomes something great because you want them to jump start the reading experience right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You want us early adopters to jump start the thing so that there's a marketplace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  Please go out and buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And while you're there, buy a Yule log for your iPhone because they're great too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, or your TV or your Apple TV or your Zoom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Does anybody else?  Does anybody else have a Kindle?  Do you have one, Don?  Have you played with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, I only wrote up a column saying the same thing John says.  It's going to be a total another flop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But my first reaction was that here is an example of a product designed around a business model, not around what customers want.  This is a way for Amazon to make money.  How can we package this so we make more money?  Everything's DRM'd.  You know, everything's through Amazon.  You rent, you don't buy.  It's 10 cents just to mail yourself a PDF.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, but it's not just 10 cents.  It's 10 cents.  That's a convenience charge.  If you are willing to use the USB connection, then you can get it for free.  All you have to do is send an email to your username at free.kendall.com and it converts it, sends it back to you.  And you can use the USB connection to get it on your Kindle for free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you send a PDF, it'll convert it to the Mobi format.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  And I think it's important that they give us that option.  You know, so we have wireless for a fee or another way for free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, the wireless is basically the thing that kind of makes me like this.  And I already bought a Sony ebook reader.  I already spent 300 bucks on that twice because I left one in the airplane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How much money do you make, Leo?  You just throw money away left and right.  John, I feel that it's my fiduciary responsibility.  Where's that lunch that you owe me?  That's what I like to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'll buy you lunch.  Just come over.  It's my fiduciary responsibility as the chief twit to purchase and try these products.  I don't want to buy a Kindle, but I feel I must.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you're crazy.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, should we take it from the top?  Like a hardware design?  Okay.  So yes, that's the weak point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It looks ugly.  Although now I've talked to somebody who said this is like an Apple design.  This is beautiful.  So I think it's that's it.  Really?  Yeah.  I think it looks like pre-iPod.  Ugly.  Pre-iPod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It looks like a 90s PC.  That's what I think it looks like.  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I could see John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John carrying this around in Greece.  Totally.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I don't think it looks like something new.  I think they've been working on this for, I think it's been three years.  Three years?  Like it looks like a Commodore 64.  You know what I mean?  It's like, it's that old kind of feel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I'm willing to bet that the design wasn't what they spent three years on.  It was mostly tracks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I think you're making a, I think you had to reevaluate the three years were spent between 1984.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jeff Bezos was designing this in college.  Supposedly it's designed by a company that is in Cupertino.  Not Apple.  No, it's called Lab 3.  I can't, I can't remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I mean, don't you think this thing has like real potential?  I mean, the idea of like, you know, I mean, this is a first gen device, right?  There's no doubt about it.  But when you get to the point where you've got, you know, one reader that has all your books and your papers and blogs, they'll fit in your pocket.  And OK, so this isn't it just yet.  But it's it's you can see now how we get from here to there.  We're on the laptop.  Sure, we could. And I mean, look at, you know, the fact it's got EVDO built in for the wireless.  I mean, that's like the killer application.  Oh, sorry.  You know, buying a book while you're on the go, you're on the train.  Like I need something to read.  All right, I'll just buy a book.  That's what I like about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I take it your negotiations on your website with Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They are talking to just as I mean, the number of blogs you get, they're very limited.  And it's not the screen is E Ink.  It's not fast enough to do video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You get the work that or slash blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's like it's all it's all a list, double a list.  In fact, it's mostly corporate.  A lot of sports blogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, screw it.  It is a first gen device.  But if you don't think this is the future, then you don't read science fiction books.  We're not going to be using paper forever.  And this is the best effort so far.  Don't you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Flying cars are just around the corner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that's exactly why they got the cover.  That's why they got the cover of Newsweek because Newsweek and Stephen Levy bought  into the notion that, oh, it's a future someday.  Everybody will read books this way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.  I can't get past the price.  I mean, $400 for a voice that'll let me read a book.  I said this in the column and I got beat up for a little bit, but I see, you know,  I mean, it's a $400 voice that allow me to read a book.  Don't I mean, don't I have eyes for that?  Those come free.  And you still have to pay for the book.  Yeah.  And you're still paying for the book.  That's ridiculous.  Well, the book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think they should lower it to what?  What do you guys think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, they got to pay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They got to pay for it.  It looks.  They got to pay for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When you're going on a holiday or something, you know, you can quite easily, you know,  I know you, Leo, you take like a bag of books of hardbacks and paper books and whatever.  You know, how much easier is just to take like one little device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's exactly why I got the Sony ebook reader, because I wanted a bunch of books.  But the advantage that Kindle has, they're a couple.  First of all, their books are half the price the Sony books are.  You don't have to use the Sony store.  You can just do it wirelessly.  You don't even have to, you know, go online.  You just do it from the Kindle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So in fact, you know, the Kindle is like a book for power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And here's the real reason I got it and actually why I'm a little excited about it.  I have every week a stack about three foot tall of newspapers and magazines that I recycle.  I now have I subscribed on the Kindle.  I haven't got it yet.  I won't get it for a couple of weeks, but because they're back ordered because it's  selling so well, at least at least five a day.  I got the San Francisco Chronicle, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal,  Salon and the Onion, and I subscribed to all of those on there and they'll be delivered  automatically three in the morning every morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Leo, you know, I mean, how much time do you spend in front of a computer?  I mean, everywhere you go, I mean, at least myself, I mean, I can access those on the  computer and I can have my laptop and go wherever I can read those on a laptop.  I mean, to me, at least it just that that's I don't know.  I'd rather I'd rather look at it on the computer.  Number one. Number two, if I have access to it on something, I don't have to spend  an extra four hundred dollars for. I don't know.  I can't justify it.  If you're on it. I agree with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'm sorry. I agree with that.  It just seems to me that, you know, you're on the computer all the time.  What do you need this redundancy for? It's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, come on. It's for breakfast, surely.  It's for when you're sitting down, you want to read a paper.  Oh, that's sweet.  Don't want to read paper. You want you want the Kindle.  Can you imagine, you know, Leo's there in the morning,  he's sitting in his underpants and he's got his bowl of cornflakes.  I don't want to imagine any of it.  He's got, you know, the Kindle in one hand and a spoon in the other.  It's the perfect Saturday morning, you know, just don't drop the thing in the oatmeal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then when you have to go to the bathroom, you take it with you to the bathroom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is a feisty bunch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't drop it in the toilet.  Yes, don't drop it in the toilet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Valley Wag has an interview with the designer of the Kindle, by the way.  And I want to thank T.T.K. in our chat room, who was watching live.  His name is Robert Bruner.  He was the guy who designed the Power Book.  He was at Pentagram. He went to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which Power Book are we talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The original iconic, the one you like so very much.  I don't know if it's the toilet.  The toilet seat one.  It would make sense, wouldn't it?  I don't know. It doesn't say it just says the original iconic Power Book.  He he has his own product design studio, Ammunition,  and that was who worked with Amazon's Lab 126.  To design the Kindle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, let's wrap up this review, because let's face it,  it's going to be we're going to have to judge for themselves.  I mean, we could put up a put a bet down if anybody's willing.  OK, this thing's going to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's your bet? No, I'm not betting.  Callie and you are betting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's got no she's got no she's got no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She's going to have so much money because of this I you'll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'll play the bet if people will buy the aisle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She's going to she's going to I'm telling you,  she's make half a million dollars this year on the aisle alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is going to be a hit product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you keep promoting it, there's no question about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's my that's my goal. I just want a little cut. That's all.  All right. So you're right. Let's wait.  So what's the bet, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. I'm going to have to think about it.  Because Callie, how much you want to put down one hundred bucks?  But we got to come up with something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, put something more than that. Say,  I don't know, you would let her host Cranky Geeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She can host Cranky Geeks. She never shows up.  And she would let you host.  She's in Texas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going out to San Francisco.  Although I won't have time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She would let you host Geekbrief TV for one day.  I could do that. How about that for a bet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, OK. That means I'm going to.  That means she's going to wait a minute. How does it?  I will pay the I lose on both accounts.  I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I will pay airfare and travel expenses  for whoever loses to go to that direction.  How about that?  I don't know why I'm involved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I need a trip to Texas.  So but we have to decide what the bet is.  That's the problem.  It's like, I mean, what constitutes a flop?  Yeah, we basically I'm betting on flop.  You know, she's betting on, well,  it's just the beginning of a great long term thing.  Maybe the bet won't.  OK, here's how about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Amazon quietly discontinues the Kindle within two years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I'm not going to say that because they're going to upgrade it.  And you're going to say I can I can make the claim that, hey, the Kindle,  the original was not being made anymore.  And you say, yeah, of course not. They upgraded it.  I mean, no, it's got to be sales figures because they'll never release sales figures.  Let me think about it.  And it would do the bet on the show in the next couple of weeks.  We'll figure it out. OK.  But I like that to make because, you know, it's like, you know,  what's a flop? It's almost all. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You need a measurable. Yes, you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Quantifiable. Hey, talking about, you know, predictions and philosophies.  Let me bring something up real quick.  I'm only going to do this for the audience out there,  especially the people that live in West Virginia. OK.  You know, I'm a college football nut.  Last year, I was a Latchen State fan from the beginning  because I knew this team was great.  But since the beginning of this year, I've been a huge West Virginia fan  and a great spread off and some believable team.  They are going to win the national championship.  I'm making the same offer I did last year.  Anyone wants to get me one of those West Virginia WV, the fancy looking  hoody on Twitter?  Love to get it.  Devorek, you know, you can send it to me at John at Devorek.org email.  And I'll wear the thing.  I'll give you credit on the show.  Just like I did with the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are you wearing the Appalachian state right now? Appalachian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pardon me. I'm sorry.  They always get notes when they mispronounce it.  I know it's Nevada, not Nevada.  I have a I got a few of those and those are great.  Still, the team could still win again.  But the point I'm trying to make here is that if this West Virginia  wins the national championship, which I predict they will,  I'd like to get a national championship hoody.  All right. Deal. That's it.  Sorry, it's my my only begging for clothes.  I do that once a year. I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a holiday thing. It's a tradition on Twitter.  We just John begs for clothes.  It's just part of the whole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But only cool clothes.  You know, something I can wear around Berkeley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I still have those University of Pennsylvania sweatshirts.  You never really wanted to wear those, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, nobody does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Moving right along to our next story.  What is our next story?  Oh, I could tell you our next story.  Big problems in Britain.  And that's where Will Harris is in Oxford with the iPhone.  Apparently, the iPhone signal sucks.  You're experiencing that right now, right? Well, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, yeah, it also it seems to have started with a thread on the Apple,  you know, support forums, which are legendary for their complete uselessness.  Yeah, because they'll ban you if you say anything sucks right away.  Yeah, right. So with this guy just post and says, hey, I just got an iPhone.  Does the signal suck for anybody else?  And it turns out that, you know, it's got hundreds and hundreds of replies  and thousands of views from people saying, yeah,  the reception here is absolutely appalling.  And the thing is, people have got it.  So the network over here is O2.  That's the exclusive carrier. They're sort of the AT&T.  And people have got like standard O2 phones and get like five bar signal.  And then iPhone on O2 and get like one bar signal in exactly the same place,  like one in each hand.  And so a lot of people have been complaining that, you know, what's wrong?  Is it like the iPhone that's faulty?  Is it the network that's faulty?  And the weird thing is that the iPhone seems to get like a signal bump in power  whenever you put it in the dock.  Like it doesn't even have to be plugged in.  It's just like putting it in the dock amplifies the signal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, yeah, it's like a big it's like a big antenna.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. So if only you could just like walk around with the dock  attached to the bottom while you were talking on it, it'd be perfect.  But so far, there's been no official response from Apple or O2.  There's just a lot of really cheesed off.  You need like a metal plate in your head.  Then that'd be awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. How bad is it? Well, I mean, is it is it awful or is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, I mean, so in my office, I get five bars on Vodafone.  So full signal on Vodafone.  No service on my iPhone O2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that on the same network?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's a different network.  But if you get  another O2 phone in my office, I get five bars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, so it's bad design, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, maybe it's just pretty awful, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then it doesn't sound right.  The story sounds fishy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then my local borders, I get five bars on Vodafone,  five bars on any O2 handset and two bars on iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe they forgot to put the antenna in the phones they shipped over here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, you joke, but you know,  it's not out of the realms of possibility that, you know,  the phones are getting shipped over here are just daft.  They're what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Tough, tough, tough, tough, tough, tough, like tough beer in in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, tough, tough, you know, busted, broken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why don't you say busted then?  I like tough. How do you spell that? D-U-F-F?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I never. You're always trying to do that to confuse us.  Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Who's that?  Yeah, that's Robert Scoble.  Oh, man. Wait a minute. Robert Scoble's on the line.  Robert has a may people don't realize this.  Robert has a back door entrance to Twitter.  He can call in any time he wants.  So so Robert Dvorak thinks the Kindle is a piece of crap.  Callie Lewis, who's also on the line with us, thinks it's great.  She loves hers. I've ordered one.  Dvorak and Callie now have a bet, although we haven't figured out  exactly what the parameters are, but we do know that if he wins, she'll.  Wait a minute, we didn't determine which is a winner and which is a loser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the problem. Yeah, that's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If he wins, either he'll host her show or she'll host his show.  We don't know which one is a winning proposition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you know what, John, you're more than welcome to host Geek Brief anytime.  It doesn't have to be bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Her hosting license is a good thing since I'll get paid and she gets to do the work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There you go. So so if you win, John, she makes she does the does your show.  So anyway, Robert, what do you think?  I read your blog post. You didn't seem to like it that much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I just ripped them.  I just did a video where I ripped the thing to shreds because it it just  it's so it's a device I want to love.  And I'm sort of in Callie's camp because for me, it's like cool geek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's wrong with it?  We read that we read your six points.  I can't say that it needs a social network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's pretty weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, if if I knew you had one of these, why shouldn't I be able to  to see what kinds of books you're reading?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because that's Facebook Beacon, which we'll get to in a moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well, you know, I actually like that idea.  But OK, leave that idea out.  First of all, when you hold the device,  everybody have handed this to has picked it up  and has flipped the page accidentally because the buttons are right where you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Everybody agrees that button should be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And and it's just not designed to be held.  You know, I did a video where I showed where I hold this device  and there's no place to put your thumb, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, Robert, have you tried holding it in the palm of your hand?  Have you found a way that works for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have. It's a goofy.  I showed it in my video.  It's a goofy way to hold it.  You know, it's like one little place on the left where you can put your thumb.  You look like a Buddhist. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You guys are still talking about the Kindle, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. What do you think?  All right. You showed it to Mike Arrington.  Oh, he immediately pan it.  Let me play.  Let me play the recording you made of Mike Arrington's review of the Kindle.  This is from Scoble's blog, The Scobleizer.  So any minute now, we should be able to hear him saying something.  I can't hear a thing.  He's not saying anything.  Is there audio? Is there an audio issue with the Kite?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There couldn't be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, nuts. Oh, wait a minute.  Here, the audio was turned off.  Let me let me let me.  I guess the last time I used Kite, I didn't have any audio on it.  Let me turn the audio on.  Here's here. This is Arrington.  We can't get him on the show, but at least we can play a video you made of him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, Mike, you hate the Kindle?  Are we recording?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're recording.  I'm not comfortable on the camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So he's posing.  Where the hell are we anyway?  We're at some Spanish party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're at the Orange Party.  What does he say something?  We're not live on Kite right now.  What does he say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At the edge of sketch, well, not as functional as the Kindle.  Wow, they're really close up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, stay close to the mic pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Connectivity.  Well, I give up. What does he say?  He doesn't like it.  That was fantastic.  I know. Great audio, great video.  I'll tell you, Robert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is an audio show.  Video doesn't translate very well, especially if you're captured on a cell phone.  I got news for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, the video didn't transfer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He instantly started playing with the menu and said, this just sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But, you know, the thing is, you've tried it for longer.  Callie's tried it for longer.  That's who I'm more interested in, people who've had some time with it.  Did you read? You said you read two books on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And once you actually get into reading a book and start flipping  pages and get comfortable with holding it in a weird way, it actually  the device starts to disappear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that's what that's OK then.  I mean, I got used to using the Sony ebook reader.  There's things I hate about it.  Do you get the page turn flash on the Kindle?  Yes. I hate that.  That's an ink problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Because of the screen technology it's using, which is actually  flipping little balls back and forth.  It's not it's not like an LCD screen, which means it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By the way, John, that's your cutest.  Are we talking about the Kindle still?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  I mean, there's a there's a lot of jokes here.  I'm going to tell you something right now.  I mean, I think we're looking at the time we've been talking about this.  This this thing for a half an hour.  There's nobody's going to buy it or not buy it because of what we have to say.  I think we should let it settle out a little bit and then we should go on  to some other topics. No offense, Robert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I agree. I want to say one thing.  Robert is bashing the Kindle and yet he you make you're going to make money on

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the Kindle. Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, wait a minute. People can subscribe to the Scobilizer blog.  You're one of the few, the proud, the Kindle bloggers.  I have to pay two bucks a month to read something I could read free on the Internet.  And you get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, what's even funnier is if you learn how to use the Kindle, there's a free web  browser in the experimental menu.  And actually reading blogs in the free browser is actually better than reading them  in the paid version because the paid versions don't have comments and the free version

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  has comments. Well, that's another fine recommendation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right, let's talk. I'm going to keep Robert on because why not?  We've got we've got the feistiest panel we've had in years and nobody's going to have a  chance to talk anyway. Let me ask about and this is in your this is right up your  wicked. Let's let's talk about Facebook Beacon.  Facebook's been getting a lot of heat over this advertising scheme, which nobody  except Mark Zuckerman really understands Zuckerberg.  Is it Burger Man? I never heard.  Never. I think he's the only guy understands it.  Somehow, when you buy something on Fandango or Overstock, and I've tried this and it  doesn't seem to do anything, but it will pop up a thing saying, do you want to share  this with Facebook? And then it disappears.  And then you go to Facebook and says, do you want to share this with your friends?  And it disappears. And then all of a sudden, your friends are seeing, hey, Leo just  bought tickets to see Enchanted. Maybe you'd like to go to.  Yeah.  Which is, I guess, a good way to do advertising.  People are upset, though, because they feel it's an invasion of their privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, privacy is dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, so number one, why would you ever buy tickets to see Enchanted?  I loved it. It was a great movie.  There's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And according to Twitter, everybody in the world went to go see Enchanted.  It was a good movie. I liked it.  The day after Thanksgiving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And after that, I bought Crocs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll tell you what, I went to go see No Country for Old Men last night.  Oh, that's supposed to be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So that's what I'm going to tell you.  See, I love the Coen. You can't go wrong with the Coen brothers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As good as the Darjeeling Limited?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't even know what to talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, come on. The new Wes Anderson film, Jason Swartzman.  Is it good?  Adrian Brody, it's absolutely insanely fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The Coen brothers and Wes Anderson are both the same level for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, who needs Facebook?  Why not just get a podcast and then everybody will know what you're doing through that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This guy complains that his girlfriend bought him gloves for Hanukkah.  No, she bought her gloves for Hanukkah, and she found out about it  because it said on Facebook, hey, your boyfriend just bought gloves.  And he's mad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you see the one Leo where he was the guest guy  was complaining about privacy concerns and he says, what if I was seeing Fred  Fred Claus?  That would have been much more embarrassing.  At least that would be embarrassing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's why I used Enchanted.  That's kind of embarrassing, too.  Oh, my God.  So what do we think about this?  I mean, obviously, Facebook, to get this, whatever, eight  hundred gazillion dollar valuation has to do something to make some money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, hey, can I say something here just out of the blue?  So I finally signed up for Facebook.  OK, I'm the last kind of block here, right?  I'm the big grumpy guy.  Can you be my friend? What is your?  It sucks. It stinks.  OK, that's all I got to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm kind of in the same camp with you, John.  I don't get Facebook.  I have not adopted it at all.  And I'm trying to.  Calacanis said, talked about it on what?  The last Twitter, the two tweets ago,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Calacanis said that Robert Scobel's 5000 Facebook friends are worth,  what do you say, 20 cents each?  He said a lot. Something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. And so, I mean, he got me interested in trying to adopt it,  but I still haven't gotten there yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm using it. I've approved everybody.  Got fifteen hundred friends.  Now, who are you? Are you Dan Dvorak, Angela Dvorak, Christina Dvorak,  Jacob Dvorak? Which Dvorak are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What difference does it make? The thing stinks.  Why don't you like it, John?  I don't like the interface.  I don't like the Mickey Mouse aspect.  I don't like the redundancies that are all over the place.  I don't like the layouts.  I don't like anything about it.  I don't like one thing about it.  I don't like the idea.  I don't like its trendiness.  I don't like anything about it.  It's a it's a joke.  You know what I like about it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I like it that I see I have all these friends, right, who are mostly fans.  But that's fine. I mean, these are your P1 fans.  These are the guys you really want to encourage  because they care so much. They want to be your Facebook friend.  And then I what I do is I do it like the president.  You know, the president, if you're over a hundred,  you get a birthday card from the president.  So what I do is when you have all these friends every day,  there's five or six people who are having birthdays.  I'll send them all greetings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's fantastic, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're so nice. Is that nice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I feel like the president of Twitland.  Yeah. And then I feel like they were touched.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They were touched by an angel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I tried to do that with Myspace, but gave up on it quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And, you know, I have to say, everybody that's on these systems  knows how sincere this must be on your part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It doesn't matter if you're sincere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It matters. No, but you are being sincere by actually doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't that the point? No, he's not doing it.  It's all automated.  And everybody out there knows that a black so happy birthday is just as  crappy and phony as a Facebook happy birthday coming from an automated robot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just typed happy birthday Leo to a guy named Andrew.  I better change that. Oh, no.  Here we go. It's Leandro Cahaney's birthday.  Isn't that cool? So, you know, this stuff about your friends.  You know what movies they see, what gloves they buy.  I think it's fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, Robert, but are they your but they're not really your friends, are they?  They're my community.  What your friends were seeing at the movies, you'd ring them up, wouldn't you?  Well, I used to only allow real friends on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And Robert and others like him, like Justine, convinced me that it was a valuable  thing to add, Jason, that was a valuable thing to add anybody who asked.  And now Robert's because Robert has like seven thousand Twitter people he's following.  And I asked you that, Robert, I said, isn't that crazy?  You see all this stuff? You said, no.  You said it's cool, though, to see what's going on.  Absolutely. And I have to say, on Facebook, even though I only have fifteen hundred  friends, it's kind of cool to see all this activity.  And it's like having real friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They get out of the house once in a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's kind of like having real friends only you don't have to pay their restaurant bill  at the end of the night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm going to start peeing in jars so I never have to leave the house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think you've convinced me, maybe.  I don't know. To me, Facebook is terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I mean, Facebook to me is a Rolodex.  It's a you know, it's like a white page, you know, phone book with benefits.  I get to see a lot more detail about all my friends I put in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I like the idea of really of giving it's of having a community of your,  you know, kind of closest fan.  I mean, for a public figure, somebody's broadcaster, for instance,  is a great way of cultivating the people who care so much that they actually look  you up on Facebook. I think that's that's those  are people you want to cultivate, aren't they?  And I don't mean that in a phony way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't even answer your email for God's sake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is a way that that's exactly what this is.  This is a way to participate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait a minute. Wait a minute.  Not to answer your email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, believe me, I got so much.  But I have to stop the stop the stop the music because this is now officially  the largest panel ever joining us now.  Patrick Norton.  Patrick, are you there?  Oh, my God, I'm here.  Wow. So now let me just recap.  We've got John C.  Dvorak, we've got Callie Lewis from Geek Brief TV.  We've got Will Harris from Channel Flip.  We've got Don Reiser from The Digital Home.  That's seen at dot com.  We've got us Robert Scobel from Everywhere dot com.  And now, ladies and gentlemen,  the only guy who doesn't have his own web page, doesn't have his own Facebook,  doesn't doesn't have a Twitter, doesn't have nothing.  But he has a baby and a wife.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hey, I have a Twitter and a Pounce account.  You do? Do you ever post there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, once in a while.  Oh, wait, I have to add you to my Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is yours?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I have to look up my Twitter.  I've completely forgotten that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's your Pounce?  Yeah, it's how important it is to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know.  It is Erzat's friends, but I kind of like the idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you need to. Are you that hard up for love, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's why I'm a broadcaster.  That's all we ever want.  Just the love and approval of all of our our friends that we never met.  You're just a friend I've never met.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My imaginary friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, my friend doesn't need friends.  John doesn't need anything.  John needs a good pulled pork once in a while.  And he's happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I had a lot of sites pulling my pork.  What I really need is like to clean my office.  Oh, I need that, too.  I don't need to be Twittering around and going on to Facebook  and pretending to be friends with people I've never met.  John, what are you doing?  I need to I need to finish my book, for God's sake.  But you're not doing that free West Virginia hoodie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what he really needs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, see, my real problem is the fact that number one,  I don't think anyone really cares what I'm doing, you know, at any point in the day.  Number two, to be honest with you, I don't really care what anybody else is doing.  I mean, I have a Pounce account and I don't even use that. So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think the ones where people say about their lunch are annoying,  but every so often you get this stream of incredibly useful information.  I think a lot of it depends on who you're palling around with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that could be, too.  I try to make it useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I found Twitter to be extremely fun and useful at times,  and you can get into these conversations.  I try not to have conversation spam, if that's what you want to call it.  You know, you're replying to everybody, but it can be a lot of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Some people overuse it to plug, and I'm a little sensitive to that.  I don't, I try not to plug my stuff in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And what was this again, Leo?  You can use Twitter to plug.  Dvorak.org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just, you want to see how you do that?  Just follow Robert Scoble. He's very good at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I've played a lot of stuff, not just my own stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, and actually, that's really one of the uses of it.  And I found it to be very useful is if you follow smart, interesting people,  they put a lot of links up to interesting stuff that's not necessarily their own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The real problem is when you follow a lot of people,  your impulse is to have conversations with them.  And if you do that, and then somebody, you know, has only 10 friends  and you're one of their 10 friends, all they see is you.  You know, so they get pissed off at you.  Right.  And to me, it's like I'm answering every 21 out of every 20 comments, you know.  Well, that's the thing. It really shouldn't be for conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, Robert, when you get one of these guys coming on like that,  just say, hey, I've got 4500 friends, loser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A friend of mine actually says he just blocks them  because that way nobody gets disturbed.  You know, they don't see you anymore and you don't see them anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It really shows, though, because there are opposite ends of the pole  and they both work. John doesn't even have an answering machine.  He doesn't want to talk to you. He doesn't want to see you.  He's kind of the antisocial network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, I answer my email, Leo.  You do? Oh, yeah.  All of it? Pretty much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Really? Even stuff for me.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He answers his spam. That's how desperate he is.  He doesn't get any spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't answer my spam. I don't get any spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Obviously, you haven't been listening long enough, Robert.  This is the man who gets no spam.  So are we offended by Beacon, Facebook's Beacon, or should we just move on?  God. Yeah, remember that story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How about Firefox?  We're going to. Firefox 3.  Firefox. The way I see these, Leo, that Beacon  thing's a developing story. We'll get to it next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's right. Like the Kindle.  We'll talk about it next week.  Amazon, actually, as long as we're talking Kindle, Amazon has a back down over the  one click patent.  Which is good news. A New Zealand actor.  Challenged Amazon dot com over its one click patent.  He's been fighting for three years.  He says, I invented one click.  And according to documents posted last month  in the U.S. Patents and Trademark Office, Amazon has amended its claim over  the one click patent to include Peter Calvelli.  And it's really narrowing down their patent claim, which is what he wanted.  He says, this breaks the monopoly of shopping with one click.  It's exactly what I wanted.  Victory. Woohoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that one click.  I don't know. I don't know.  In a monopoly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I love one click.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's cost me a lot of money.  I just keep clicking all day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He says he he.  We don't have to go on. Go ahead, Josh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'm just saying, let's get back to the Firefox 3.  Has anybody upgraded this thing?  I have. I didn't like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anybody? I have.  It seemed faster. Euler.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a little faster, but you keep.  There's a bunch of messages that comes up.  It says you're going to an encrypted page.  Is that OK?  And then it says, do not show this anymore.  Show it anymore. You want to keep getting this message?  And I clicked it so I would stop getting the message.  I still get the message.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're all suffering.  I think we're all suffering now because there's so many stupid computer users.  Now we who understand how this stuff works have to click every five seconds  and say, yes, I did mean to do that. Yes.  No. OK. Yes.  And it's because there's so many morons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you ever think there needs to be like, you know, like a Firefox or Windows  power user edition where it's just like stripped back, there's no prompts.  You get access to, you know, you go into C Drive  and doesn't tell you that your C Drive is protected files that you shouldn't access.  You know, it just just lets get out of the way.  You should be able to be root everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, there should be an advanced users download.  Definitely. You know what?  You should have a stupid person computer and make all the stupid people buy that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I'm going to be really controversial, though,  and just say, if you want the power user computer, just go buy a Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that's what I think.  What makes Macs so power user at this point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's got the most insane multitasking,  like built into the US and the screaming and howling was heard

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  from the entire open source community and people over his son.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, come on. You know, who really use open source anyway?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Heresy.  Oh, well, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You sound like Peter Frampton on the double album.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I mean, I use Firefox on the Mac, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The new Firefox three's biggest claim to fame is its native UI.  So if you're using Vista, it looks like Vista.  If you're using OS 10, it looks like OS 10.  Yeah, it's also an alpha.  It's very early, right?  I don't know. I was actually the best Firefox was one point five.  Frankly, I think one I think two point.  Oh, hasn't been that great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree with you there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What what happened?  If I have problems with two point.  Oh, yes. Haven't you?  No, it's great.  It's finally somebody's having problems and I'm not with an.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is great.  It's your day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm I think it could be extensions based, but, you know,  the main reason to use Firefox is all the extensions, right?  I mean, that's the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now, I use Firefox because it sucks a thousand percent less than Internet Explorer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think IE seven is actually pretty good now.  Now, the new ice, it's not a bad browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  IE six was getting to be in that.  IE six was awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  IE six was awful.  Still clumsy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did a lot of reading and Google reader and Firefox is way faster on the pages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  Safari is pretty good, though, on the Mac.  I think it's very fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, I hate Safari.  I don't like it either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I knew it too. It blows up too many pages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hey, I got the by the way, just to kind of circle around on what we were talking  about a couple of weeks ago with you, Patrick, I got the ASUS EEPC.  Patrick didn't like it on the other hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think it's fun.  I mean, it's but I think it's too expensive for what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Will liked it.  He gave it a good review on Channel Flip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, but Will thinks Mac is the only freaking multitasking power user out there.  Well, sorry, I tease Will because I care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The bad news for me anyway, is my dog ate the power adapter.  I only got to use it for a day.  So I liked it.  What I mean, I was able to type on it and stuff.  I'm looking forward to trying trying it more.  It looks like the Kindle adapter is exactly the same adapter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I'm hoping that when I plug it in and see what happens, Leo,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  just go to Radio Shack doesn't I thought it had a regular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it's not. It's some weird, you know, nine volt.  It's very strange. It's not a normal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is it a weird pin or a weird voltage?  Weird voltage is easy. Weird pin outs are hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't I don't know. I have to look at the I think it's a standard pin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He has to look through some dog crap to find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, he didn't swallow it.  He just chewed it and spit it out on it.  I hate that. He nodded, broke it right in half.  I hate it when that happens.  How's the baby, Patrick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The baby's good.  You say he didn't want to sleep last night.  Not even a little bit. He's sleeping now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they always sleep when you're awake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Midnight till, you know, two thirty last night, he was eating and fussing  and eating and fussing and then, you know, then did the whole pooping thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How old is your kid, Patrick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, just hitting five weeks.  Yeah, mine's eight weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's amazing. Not soon enough.  Alex, Alex, Alex Lindsey had his baby yesterday, by the way.  He had a boy. Oh, I don't know what the name is yet.  So we have all of that.  It's amazing how many babies, twin babies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All at the same time. It's time for a cage match

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  with the babies of the parents.  Well, actually both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who can change a diaper fastest, right? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So here's a diaper without opening my eyes now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's funny, the first time you change a diaper, it's hard,  but there's this pretty steep learning curve.  You get over it really quick.  It's not it doesn't take a long time to learn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm quite impressed with both of you that you've been able to keep up  with everything that you're doing, having just had a baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Isn't that amazing? Well, yeah.  You know, that's funny that way. Rent, food, spills.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, that's one good thing about the Kindle is you can read a book  while holding the baby.  You hold one in the palm of each hand.  What if you figure out how to hold it?  But the baby, the baby or the Kindle, the Kindle and the baby.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Rather.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By the way, I'm loving Tekzilla.  You're doing a great job, Patrick.  It's just getting better and better.  It is a really enjoyable show.  I as long as we're giving out plugs, I want to make sure people go to revision three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Dot com forward slash Tekzilla with a K and a Z.  Hey, T.E.K. moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Zed I L.A.  What is this rumor we're seeing that Murdoch's going to buy?  Dig and that maybe you would be going along revision three would be going along.  Have you seen this rumor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, that's that's news to me.  I think the best part about working  because I've worked for startups before.  So have you, Leo. But this is sort of the most Silicon Valley ish startup  I've ever worked for, which means, you know, we actually have all these VC  involved, which means, hey, you know what?  Maybe we're getting sold right now.  Somebody could be signing contracts. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I hate that feeling.  We had that feeling at Tech TV for like three years.  It was god awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, there was a difference between the thing that, you know, the the the Ziff  Davis, I should say, not Ziff Davis, the  the boy Paul Allen, Vulcan Ventures, Vulcan Ventures was just a whole  fascinating experience to its own self.  And I don't have that feeling here, you know.  But hey, you know, we who knows, they could get sold tomorrow or revision  three gets sold. Well, here's what happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This this all comes from Valley Wag. Here's what happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, that incredibly embedded source of accuracy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I understood that it was Paul Allen and Vulcan Ventures  that was interested in buying Dig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, wouldn't that be a burn?  You know, and the door won't hit me on the ass either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, that would hurt.  So I guess apparently the journal a couple of weeks ago made a deal with Dig.  All articles on WSJ.com, the Wall Street Journal's online site,  have Dig buttons now.  You can dig a story.  And once you do, that story becomes open to the public.  It no longer requires a subscription to read.  So so there is something going on between Dig and Wall Street Journal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I mean, Wall Street Journal's the Wall Street Journal's playing catch up, right?  The New York Times, the Wall Street Journal.  I mean, what's kind of funny is like, you know, you think of Wall Street Journal  as the home of one of the most powerful journalists in technology,  but they haven't been as advanced online as maybe they could be.  And the Times is play around with some stuff.  They're still playing catch up, but adding Dig buttons.  I mean, it's amazing.  You know, you see Dig buttons and a half dozen other kind of social networking  site buttons starting to show up on articles on a lot of very mainstream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sure. Times has been doing it for a while.  But the difference is that all of a sudden, these subscription  only articles are now suddenly open to the public.  If I think that's smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess you got to remember something.  It's it's a you know, this is still this still comes down to a  I need eyeballs to look at web pages.  And this is probably this is a very trackable experiment in revenue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. So how are you going to feel when you use how are you going to feel  when Tekzilla is available only on Hulu dot com?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't even know what Hulu dot com.  Well, see, that's Rupert Murdoch and NBC's website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By the way, I finally got my invitation to visit Hulu dot com.  This is where the office went.  And what a crappy site.  I don't has anybody else used Hulu.  Oh, yeah. I had it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't have an invitation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can't. I can't invite you, Kelly.  You have to go to Hulu dot com and apply.  Yeah, I guess all of us here probably could.  So, Don, I've got to.  It's just it's a flash base.  You can you can expand it.  There's one weird thing, which is that you can embed anything  in into a website like YouTube.  So I guess they're encouraging people to put their videos on their site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hulu is. Yeah. Right.  Well, this Hulu is pretty mainstream.  I mean, at least it looks like it's NBC.  I enjoy the world's premium content when, where and how you want.  Well, no, this is great.  Obviously, they read the revision three manifesto.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, this is what happened when NBC pulled off of iTunes.  And Fox pulled off of iTunes and said, no, you cannot sell our shows.  We're going to make people go to our proprietary site and our flash.  No, no, no, no, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It says right under Hulu dot com forward slash splash forward.  But it's about us.  It's we're going to help you enjoy the world's premium content  when, where and how you want it.  Oh, hallelujah. Thank goodness.  And I thought it was a profit thing. A closed flash system.  Oh, of course it's a profit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can't download the files.  You can't put them on any player.  You can only the only thing you can do is embed them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, is that because they can't do it or because they're waiting for Adobe  to finish their cool guy?  That might be interesting.  Yeah. Our management software that will allow that the flash based stuff  that they've been working on for a year.  You might be right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So on Friday, Valley Wag says, as if the dig  News Corp deal is done, we'll dig News Corp deal, include revision three.  I don't think any of this is true.  There are who knows, you know, the room is on a dog's ass once in a while.  We've heard a very, very we've heard a very specific number  brooded about News Corp rumor has it would pay three hundred forty million dollars  to buy dig and would at according to this, take a stake in revision three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, a stake in revision three isn't the same as owning revision.  Now, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There was there was talk at some point about Fox or Rupert Murdoch  buying into as if Davis and or tech TV.  And at that point, I kind of got queasy.  I wasn't anxious to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I mean, Rupert, he's just bought the Wall Street Journal.  He obviously has a bit of success, both with his investment choices  and his history in publishing.  You know, if he ends up owning it, hey, you know what?  Maybe I'll be replaced by someone younger, attractive and more smarter,  maybe with a degree in engineering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  As they told us in the screensavers, all it needs is more cleavage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, what was crazy was that the end of that value  work rumor was that Murdoch really wanted to stake in revision three  because he wanted Kevin Rose to front the Fox Business News Network  technology. OK, I'm going to take that story off the list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I didn't get that far.  Yeah, I is Kevin Rose and I'm drinking.  No, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Once also wants to use Rose, Kevin Rose for coverage of CES,  the large gadget trade show in January, which is very,  which is a kind of an interesting the Fox Business Network needs eyeballs.  Right. So they hired Kevin.  Then Kevin has the I could see the court, you know,  Dignation audience plus the core dig audience,  potentially giving them more traffic.  That would be so I can see where that might actually be useful to them.  Because if that's a very not traditional media way of thinking about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What are your guys plans for CES?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think we're sending a small crew down to film for Teczilla.  Nothing. No live shows down there this year.  Will, you're going to be going to CES?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I'm thinking about it.  The trouble is, you know, as John says, it's completely over covered.  And so it's like, what can you really bring to it that a million people  aren't already bringing with bigger budgets?  So I'm I'm dubious about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How about you, John? CES?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I have to go because there's a PC magazine has a party on  Tuesday night.  And so they, you know, want me to show up.  So I'm going to probably fly down there and then fly back the next day.  I can't see really spending much time at the show because it's just like,  you know, Will said that I said, which is it's over covered.  I don't I do.  I get more out of reading the coverage and then analyzing that.  And I can actually being on the show floor.  I do like to bump into a bunch of people say, hey, hey, I haven't seen you  for a year. Let's do lunch.  And then they never see him again for another year.  I mean, I'm getting sick of that, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's really interesting is walking around the floor last year,  I was watching Engadget and Gizmodo and I knew, you know,  everybody on the show floor knew what Steve Jobs had had done.  And he wasn't even at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They were all following the Mac world coincided last year.  This year will not. There will be different weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And we're still doing the blog house, by the way, at the Blasio.  Well, that'll be fun. Get some free bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's for CES. Yeah.  That'll be a lot of fun. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was a lot of fun last year.  We had 600 bloggers come through there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would be down there doing the radio show if  we're over a weekend, but it's not.  I will in 2009, but I can't do it in 2008.  Steve, Bill Gates last keynote, right?  Is that going to be exciting?  Oh, yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, boy. Callie, you're going to be there covering it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. Will you be there covering it?  Maybe you could make a little Bill Gates screen saver for the iPod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe I could.  Yeah, I'll be there at least for a day.  I don't know how long we're going to stay.  We haven't quite figured that out yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  John has a great video you could use.  Used to use that in your speeches, didn't you, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Bill Gates going, oh, no, I like Bill Gates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, you would.  I, you know, I have the not Steve Ballmer, but  he gulps and gulps and gulps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you took this was back when you had a video toaster.  I think he took all the gulps and strung them in one long video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was like an hour of gulping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That make a you put that on the iPod, maybe some music by Jeff Smith.  You got something there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'll have to get that video from you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here's a story from Edinburgh.  I'm really reaching for this one.  Robert, let's see, a guy's name was Mark Morrison.  He he called in sick, but he did it in a in a way that business didn't approve of.  He texted in his sick.  He says, I can't come to work today.  Then he didn't show up again.  They they finally fired him.  They said the company says you have to call or use our official system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You should have fired him with a text message.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, the good news is an Edinburgh court, they call it a tribunal,  says that the company is wrong and they awarded him compensation of six thousand  nine hundred seventy seven pounds, which in the US dollars is like four million  dollars, I think.  Give or take.  And and overturned the ruling.  So there you go.  So it's OK to text in sick in Edinburgh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they fired him because of the text or because he kept calling in sick.  Like they said it was they fired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The reason was because you're not allowed to text in sick.  You have to call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Seems like they could have come up with a better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How lazy do you have to be to not even like I mean, surely it's actually more work to  text than it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no. And you don't have to prove anything when you text in.  You don't have to go, I'm not feeling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you're bad at having a sick voice, you're good to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ferris Bueller would have gotten a lot of mileage out of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Most of the people under 25 years of age, they do almost everything in texting.  I don't see that as a big deal.  Yeah, I think this is the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, it is that they don't text, say, their boss or they they don't.  You know, I mean, if you got if it's a job or the old guys.  Well, no, I mean, think about it this way.  If it's a job where you got to, you know, and it sounds like it's probably, you know,  is he waiting tables?  Is he a schoolteacher or something?  Is is it a job where they need to get somebody in to cover his shift?  And, you know, one random text may not get to the person who actually has to do all the  stuff to cover that guy's slot.  You know, I don't know.  It seems like it's not that delete expletive hard to make a phone call to say you're  not going to be in work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, especially in Edinburgh Tribunal disagrees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Patrick, that sounds like an old fart talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's me. I'm the oldest fart in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now that he's a papa, he has to be an old fart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I've been an old fart for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. You've always been a little older than your age.  The Mall of America is using text messages.  Do you when you park at the Mall of America on Black Friday, a day before yesterday,  you could send a text message to a short text and it would send you your location  where you left your car.  Apparently, the mall is so big, about 50 shoppers lose their car every day.  And the day after Thanksgiving, they expect about 400 people to lose their cars.  So they want you to text it.  That's awesome.  Isn't that great?  Say again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The parking lot there, they've got hundreds of acres of parking around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they got like eight parking lots.  Do you guys have the system in the states of the of the of like, where you text to  pay your part?  Yeah, isn't that cool?  Oh, it's the worst thing in the world.  You don't like it?  Well, it's the version over here is terrible.  I mean, you phone it like so you're in a rush and you want to go buy a you know,  put a quid in the ticket.  Oh, you have to wait.  Yeah, can't do that.  Right.  You have to phone this number.  Then it says, right, where are you?  And they say, right, Oxford, do you mean, you know, Worcester?  No, Oxford.  And you're like, OK, what's the location?  You know, you say, what's your, you know, license plate for your car?  It's like, you know, FD7.  Did you mean SBA9?  I've missed trains trying to get this blinking.  Unless you think they do it in the train station, right.  But in Oxford, right.  But whenever there's a train on the platform, the ambient noise is such that the system  can't hear you. That's good.  So if you get to the platform, get on a train and you're trying to pay for your parking,  you can't do it.  You've got to wait for the train that you want to get on to leave before you can pay  for the parking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I want to remind you this program brought to you as always by audible.com.  We're not going to do a long book.  We did a long book talk last time that was kind of fun.  And by the way, John, I went out and I bought the Jacques Ellul books.  I got them, the Technological Society and Propaganda.  Ah, good.  The type is so small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, on Technological Society, not Propaganda.  So did you get an old hard copy?  No, they're paperbacks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're still in print.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I'm going to have to scan it and put it on my Kindle just to read the damn thing.  Anyway, audible.com slash Twitter.  See, I think maybe it's just because I'm getting old or something, but I like it that I can  listen to a book.  I don't have to worry about, you know, how big the print is.  I can listen and I somehow for me, I absorb the information better.  I love audio books and audible.com has 45,000 plus titles.  They play on pretty much any device now through November 27th, half price on a thousand plus  unabridged titles.  So it's a great way to stock up.  That's the nice thing.  There's no term on these.  They as long as you want, you can you don't have to wait till you know, you don't have  to send them back after a month if you don't get around to reading it.  Well, you keep it and you read it when you feel like it.  I have hundreds of books on my iPhone, which I love it.  So I want anybody have a recommendation for an audible book they've listened to lately  because I have some if you if you don't.  But I like to give you the opportunity.  You know, I'm looking for Stephen King's The Mist.  Have you seen The Mist yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've seen previews.  I haven't seen it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's supposed to be really scary.  They have a lot of Stephen King books.  I'm just wondering if they have them.  They have The Shining.  They have Carrie.  Sixty nine Stephen King books.  They must have The Mist.  Anyway, if you're a Stephen King fan, Salem's Lot, there is nothing spookier than turning  out the lights.  Listening to a great reading of one of his books from audible hearts in Atlantis.  I read that one on audible.  That was great.  A U D I B L E dot com slash twit.  I'm still looking dreamcatcher bag of bones.  Oh, on writing is a great.  You're a writer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On writing is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Isn't that a great book?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  Sorry.  Yeah, no, it's a wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's kind of a half memoir, half about how he writes.  And I thought it was really useful for writers.  You're a writer, right?  Callie, you write.  Yeah.  You're writing a book right now.  I think you and Neil, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, ever since we started Geekbrief, we started that.  It'll be done, but we have to figure out how to get some time to ourselves from Geekbrief.  So, and I, you'll and everything else that we're doing, but this you'll log things going

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  to be huge.  You're going to be able to write that book finally.  Thanks to the you'll log many of these Stephen King books, unabridged and half price.  So it's a good time to stock up on Stephen King at audible.com slash twit.  Go there by the way, to get a credit toward a free book when you join up and it can, it  could be a Stephen King book audible.com slash twit.  We do thank them for their support this week in tech.  Has any anybody played any new games?  I'm playing Assassin's Creed and really enjoying it.  Anybody played crisis?  You played crisis yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've been playing it all day today.  It's funny.  So I quite like it, but it's one of those games like unless you have an absolute monster  of a PC, like a monster, don't even bother because you might as well take like a brand  new HD movie and play it on like a 14 inch tube with, you know, mono sound or something.  You just don't want to do it.  And so if you can't play the game on the absolute top settings, don't even bother.  Yeah, it's my, it's my opinion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have a crossfire system, so I should be able to do it on that, right?  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If it's a crossfire, it's optimized for Nvidia.  I hate it when I do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Does Nvidia pay these game designers to do that?  Is that why that happens?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, well, it's not that they pay them.  It's just they have a lot more money in the first place to help them out.  Oh, help them out.  Oh, we help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  Here's a bag of cash.  We're going to help you out with the development.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, Nvidia can pay for engineers to go and like just sit in these game design studios  for weeks on end and optimize code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I like this crossfire system.  So you're saying it plays Bioshock well.  You're saying it won't be enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, unless it plays Bioshock at like, you know, a high resolution with everything  turned on at 60 frames a second.  It will do that.  Oh, well, you might get away with it then.  It's a pretty high energy.  But I mean, I'm playing on an 8800 GTX, which is the single fastest, basically Nvidia  card, and I'm getting like maybe an average 20 frames a second.  Really?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But you have, this is with anti aliasing and shading and all that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no.  That's with all the details on high.  No anti aliasing whatsoever.  What?  You just can't turn it on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How can they design a game that's so tough that even the highest end system can't play  it well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, that's it.  You only get the most out of it if you've got a quad core CPU because it does all the  physics and AI on different cores on the CPU.  And then if you need a dual graphics, preferably high end Nvidia graphics system to be able  to play it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're describing a $5,000 machine to play this game.  Pretty much.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apparently.  I mean, on my 8800, I'm only playing at 1280 resolution.  Ouch.  You know, you can see how much we can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're trying to kill off development so they can go all console.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Maybe.  I mean, that's the advantage of these consoles.  You don't have to worry about that stuff, but you'll never see anything as good as  Crysis, or will you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, in a couple of years, maybe.  But Crysis right now, I can't see anything in the next 12 months on the development  cycle that looks as good as Crysis.  I'll have to buy it.  Can you buy it or is it still just download?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it's out.  It's out.  How about you, Don?  What have you been playing lately?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I haven't played Crysis.  I don't really do the PC stuff, but all right.  I think I'm going to get lots and lots of bad emails for this, but I've been playing  Super Mario Galaxy.  I play the Satsuki.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, you know what?  Everybody's telling me Super Mario Galaxy is the best game ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I'm telling you that it's not.  I don't really like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not that great.  My daughter plays this.  It's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's the Wii killer game.  Everybody's saying it's a gimmick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what?  I can't know what I can't stand.  Number one, I know it's Nintendo.  I know they've been doing it for years, but why do I have to sit through the awful  and boring and disgustingly awful text messages that we have to sit through?  And they talk and they talk.  And then of course, this is what really gets me and I can't get over it.  This stupid shaking my hand.  It's a gimmick and I can't stand it.  I can't stand it.  Why do I have to sit there and shake my hand at it after everything I have to do  for no good reason?  You don't like the Wiimote?  No, not even.  No, no.  Like in the game, you have to shake your Wiimote in order to do a few things.  You have to do what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can you say that again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let me, let me try to break it down a little.  Uh, uh, make a G-Ray, uh, basically shake your, your Wii, shake your Wiimote.  And, um, what do you call it?  It's been a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sorry.  You're talking about the Wii controller.  Yes.  You shake your Wiimote.  Hey, it's Mario.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  John, I thought we were, I didn't know where we were going with that one.  Um, no, but I don't know.  I don't like, I think it's a gimmick and, and, uh, I don't know.  I, I've been playing it.  I've played through about half the game, I'd say by now.  And, uh, so far I'd say, eh, it's okay.  You know, it's nothing, in my mind is nothing special.  I mean, uh, but I know I'm gonna get lots and lots of bad emails for it, but whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, Mario, come on, shake my Wiimote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The only thing I'm playing right now is Portal.  Portal.  You talked about Portal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I love Portal.  That's Orange Box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I haven't got the Orange Box yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, we played this song though.  Uh, the other show, other show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We got some friends obsessed with Portal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Uh, Mass Effect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, Mass Effect.  I can't wait to get, I hear that's going to be.  That's an Xbox 360 game.  That's supposed to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Completely dropped off the radar.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think this is going to be a good holiday season for all three game machines.  The Nintendo Wii though is all, is pulling ahead.  They're now tied for market share with the Xbox 360.  And I think they may start to pull ahead a little bit here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.  I'm still, I'm still of the opinion that the Wii is a, is a, a  multiplayer mini game console.  And I don't think it has longevity right now.  I really don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're a 360 guy or PS3 guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you know, right now my PS3 is collecting dust, but I play my 360  every now and then I play all three.  I, you know, I try to do as many as much as I can.  Apparently he doesn't play anything.  Yeah.  I just, I just shake my Wemo.  Uh, that's enough, frankly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's all I need to do.  How about you Scoble?  Do you play any games at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, barely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got a baby.  My son plays games.  I watch him.  He's a world of Warcrafter.  Patrick.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Played Halo 3 in a weekend.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.  My son.  I mean, we're looking at a really interesting situation where if the Wii  does go past the Xbox 360 in terms of like installed base, it's not inconceivable  that it could go past the installed base of the Xbox 360 and the PS3 combined.  And then suddenly if you're a game developer, the largest market is  Nintendo Wii and you're looking at a backwards step practically for console development.  Wow.  I mean, that's why it won't happen.  They won't let it happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And video take pockets of money over there and say, this isn't going to happen, is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're going to get out of the business, aren't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.  I think the real gaming marvel right now is the DS.  I think the DS is unbelievable.  Yeah, people love the DS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What game are you playing on the DS now, Don?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I play Zelda.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Zelda is hot.  The Phantom Hourglass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thank you.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The Phantom Hourglass.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, obviously if you look at Nintendo's cycle of handheld, you know,  obviously the upgrade them every few years, but the Game Boy lasts about 15 years.  And it's, you know, it's sold quite well.  Obviously I think it's the best selling of all time.  Uh, and if you look, you compare it, I wrote about this on CNA, I did some research  and I found out that the DS is actually selling far better right now than the  Game Boy at the same stage.  And it's actually over time is doing quite well.  And if they, if Nintendo can stick to this 15 year upgrade of the DS and, you  know, obviously you can do the DS, you might see this become bigger than the Game Boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm ready for a new, some new games.  I'll have to go check it out.  Oh, I think we should wrap this guy up.  Uh, it's our Thanksgiving leftover show and we had more leftovers as usual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what?  I used to be really good when I was a kid.  When I was like, you know, 10, 11, 12, I was brilliant and I hadn't been on  skateboard for about maybe five years.  And I thought, no worries, I can handle it.  And I just spent a lot of time falling on my ass.  But through the magic of Final Cut Pro, I look like an absolute Tony Hawk genius.
