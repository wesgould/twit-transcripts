Transcript:  Thank you. We quote you all the time. In fact, we're gonna quote you about meta  Three seconds, I you know, there's so many places we could begin here  I could continue with the Joe Rogan saga which gets wilder and wilder as we go  But I think we should talk about meta  The company formerly known as Facebook which suffered the biggest stock market loss  Biggest wipeout as Bloomberg put it in history this week  shares went down 26 percent, which is a  251 billion dollar  Change in value. I want to though be clear and I'd love to hear what you all think about this this  Didn't come out of Mark Zuckerberg's pocket. This is not they don't have a bill for 251 billion  They have to pay this is the stock market valuing the company  You know, it's shareholders, I guess who will lose money not and you know to the extent that marks a shareholder  I guess that means is his stock is worth less and I think some of this is because  Analysts had you know were disappointed  Which seems like a terrible reason to take value off the company. Oh, and do you think?  Facebook meta is worth less in in reality or just on the stock market. I

Transcript:  Mean, what is real Leo?  NFTs baby, that's what's real. I mean what's the difference between a share of stock and an NFT?  It's all like a belief it's a good right. It's fiat currency. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, you know a share is a  Is a theoretical claim on the future earnings of a company  So I think what what people were scared about here was not the present, you know  How Facebook is doing, you know meta how meta is doing as a company right now  But the future the fact that users of the Facebook app, you know, the blue app actually dropped  Right and also usage, you know  I think the you know, the death spiral is not just people like quitting the service or not, you know, Facebook not replacing  Users it's losing fast enough. It's you know, it's usage and I think that's I think Facebook is really scared of  Tick-tock as as they should be. Yeah  I mean this should have been in the stock all along because

Transcript:  We know young people don't really use Facebook  It's their parents social network they use tick-tock or snap or something else  They maybe they use Instagram, which is Facebook's, you know holding action against the youth  Facebook took I think Facebook actually did a really interesting thing  They took advantage of this moment to blame Apple  They said it's Apple's fault we lost ten billion dollars in the stock market  They said it's Apple's fault we lost ten billion dollars because of the checkbox in you know  That you now get on iPhones where it says you want to let this company track you  I don't think they can actually demonstrably prove that that was where the loss was. In fact the ten point two billion dollar loss  Came from the reality labs its VR efforts  Which have been very very expensive with of course very little revenue  Those are all of those are true. Yeah

Transcript:  There's um, you know  There's the hard cost of investing in AR and VR and then I think the 10 the other 10 billion dollars  I mean and you know 10 billion here 10 billion there pretty pretty soon  You're talking about real money. The other 10 billion dollars was missed revenue, right?  Revenue that they could have gotten but didn't get right  So I think that there actually are like two separate chunks and like you add that up that's a twenty billion dollar Delta

Transcript:  Am I crazy though Dan to say that Facebook would like you to blame Apple?  But in fact Facebook what really doesn't Facebook doesn't want you to know is they have perfectly good other means of tracking you  They don't need Apple's ID for advertisers and turning that off is actually meaningless from their point of view  But they would like to pretend  It seems to me that that that's oh, it's killing me. It's killing me

Transcript:  Well, I don't mean this in the in the cultural sense, but I think all of these issues are real substantial and intersectional  I talk to people at Facebook who genuinely think that the and they they will stay off-record  They genuinely think that the changes in Iowa's 14.5 and 15  Did kneecap them or at least in the very short term?  But I think that the larger picture is certainly this  Drop in usage which they have tried to duck into this or roll into this pivot to VR  So all of those things intersect with each other and all of them  as the end result not just result in losing money but a  Loss of influence because that's really what money is right. It's influence power

Transcript:  The  daily active users  Went from 1.93 billion to 1.9 to 9 billion  now  admittedly  What is that? That's a lot of millions. That's a  like a million  But when you have 1.9 billion  It's there's I think it's almost a rounding error  Should we?  Nicholas, what do you think? Is it over? Should we just throw in the towel should Facebook go home?  I

Transcript:  Don't know if Facebook should come back  I have this conversation with with my bosses and my friends all the time like have we reached peak tech  You know, I do wonder what like Gen Z like are they are they so do they even remember a time before technology?  Are they over this stuff? Do they not care? Is it not cool anymore?  You know if you're if you're a parent and you're thinking of sending your kids to college  Do you want them to pursue a career in tech? Have we reached peak tech? I don't know I  You know, I was recently in Puerto Rico for a family thing and I would say  Just seeing hang out with friends and family down there Facebook meaning the big blue app is still heavily used and certainly  WhatsApp right? Oh, yeah, what's up? It's funny when I probably sent like five I messages in my life  Actually, I'm on whatsapp all day talking to my family  So I kind of have a slightly different perspective on like the messaging wars, I guess but yeah  I don't I don't know if if I don't people is over tech  I don't know especially the past two years of looking into zoom calls and all this stuff for people just burnt out  I I don't know but I think it's a very interesting question. I obviously don't know the answer  But yeah, I I guess we'll see, you know, I guess Zuck is trying to pivot to the metaverse which I  Don't know how that will go  I suppose I'm I'm more inclined to be cool with that as a as a as a big gamer and as a huge nerd  It's like that's neat to me  But like is my adoptive mom gonna sit there with a AR VR headset all no, she's not that's never gonna happen  So, I don't know very interesting a series of events here. I think you're right. I think the stock market anyway

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Says we're at peak tech and it's over and we got to find something else  I should point out though if you bought into Facebook when it  IPO'd you're far from underwater  You're you've still made more than 250 bucks a share since the IPO as my wife keeps telling me  So I it's not it's not the end of the world for Facebook  And I often wonder when you see these kinds of drops Apple lost  Almost 200 billion dollars in 2020  And by the way, that would have been a good time to buy some Apple stock because not only they recover it kept on growing  I often wonder, you know Monday is the stock market gonna say, okay  We had our sell-off. Let's let's let's back to business as usual. So that's the real question for me  I don't care about the stock market so much  But the real question for me is is this a bellwether? Is it the beginning of the end for Facebook is Facebook?  Going the way of myspace  Are they gonna be able to make a pivot to augmented reality?  Clearly Zuckerberg feels like it he's he actually had an all hands the day after the stock tumble  He his eyes were red and watery, but he told everybody it was because of a scratched cornea  According to Bloomberg who had unnamed persons at the event  He apparently  You know  Repeated what he'd already said to in the in the earnings call that it was the rise of tik-tok  unprecedented level of competition is the phrase  Reels competing with Instagram  But he also said I want you all to focus on  Video that this is the future and I I guess  Does he mean video as in?  VR  Turned out great last time  Yeah, I mean they're they're a homegrown video platform was a terrible flop, right?

Transcript:  Well Facebook also I mean the last time they did a pivot to video they a couple of maybe 1836 months afterwards  They said oops. We yeah did a miscalculation which caused companies like Mike to just vanish overnight. Yep. I

Start time: 822.89
End time: 847.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Guess that's one issue with this is  It could be that the tremors will be felt throughout the tech market as you say Nicholas  Because Facebook is so kind of pivotal to for news organizations for for everybody  In driving traffic that failed Facebook might be bad in general for the tech industry  So maybe that maybe that's what we're seeing. I  I know I find it hard to write them off at this point

Start time: 851.13
End time: 858.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they're a platform like unlike my space. I mean those the comparisons to a previous era of tech are just not that's true  It's not my space. Yeah, that's a really really good point

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, anyway, there's the there's the meta  The meta story such as it is. It's a great number though  251 billion dollars in value that does hurt in a couple ways  It makes it harder to attract talent because of course you pay them in stock options  So it hurts in that way might be make it harder to raise money if they needed to  So there it's not it's not a neutral event for from their point of view  From their point of view at meta and it's a bad headline, but I don't think it means that they're necessary. I mean 1.9  billion  daily active users  That's pretty successful

Start time: 899.24
End time: 933.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know one point about attracting talent  They have had problems attracting engineering talent and in the valley their reputation is pretty  Bad at least when it comes to engineering talent  But on the other side although we talk about all the losses the 10 billion dollars in in the  The their meta component they've attracted a ton of people from microsoft a ton  And the hololens people are pretty pissed off right now because they kill hololens 3  So they've done a very good job of attracting  Talent experienced talent when it comes to arvr and xr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. I I have to think though that you know part of the problem here is like mark zuckerberg is saying  Hey, we're not the facebook company anymore. We're meta ar and vr is where it's at. So  If you're working at meta on the facebook app, you've got to feel like you're a second-class citizen, right?  Like you're not taking seriously even though you bring in all the money and that's got to hurt morale  Like how are they going to hire, you know engineers to to work on?  You know fixing misinformation or optimizing ads or you know dealing with apple, you know, the apple id issue  That's that's where I think they're going to feel the pinch. Although remember apple is paying

Start time: 977.37
End time: 1040.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  180,000 dollar bonuses to its engineers not to go to facebook  So it is a cutthroat competition at silicon valley for engineering talent if you're good, you you know, you can write your own ticket  So all of these companies are trying to keep people  Not just not just facebook and I don't think facebook's the only company losing talent either  I think people just move around to kind of increase their value  Alexis ohanian. I don't know if he's the expert on this. He's a vc now did found co-found reddit  Said, uh, we all knew this was going to happen  He told bloomberg  Uh facebook ad products just doesn't cut the mustard anymore  The savviest marketers have started ditching facebook for advertising  That might be the case. I don't think it has to do with apple to be honest with you  I think facebook has plenty of ways of knowing who's watching what on their platform  But uh, is it the case do you think that advertisers are turning their back on facebook that it's no longer the place to go  That would surprise me  What do you think nicklas

Start time: 1042.09
End time: 1082.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I  Well, one thing I will say is that the I never get better ads than I get on instagram  My my interests are are pretty explicit into soccer. I said this for soccer video game stuff  Watches, those are pretty much my three things and every ad on instagram is related to one of those three things  And i've definitely purchased several items off instagram. So I don't know how they do it  You know, I have a mixture of like don't follow me. Don't track ad blocker  I I try to put up a fight I guess and and yet, uh, the ads on instagram are are pretty good  So, I don't know if marketers  I don't know. They seem to be having a pretty good time at least I think it has to be nuts to abandon either facebook or instagram

Start time: 1083.42
End time: 1103.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, look we sell ads. That's how we make a living  and uh, I've constantly worried about facebook and google just eating up the ad space and now amazon  Because they have so much more information about the audience. We don't know anything about the audience  Uh, and I don't think facebook's knowledge has gotten any worse. Thanks to apple. I think that's a a little bit of misdirection

Start time: 1105.08
End time: 1125.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think where it hurts, uh facebook from from what I understand is tracking a purchase  So you get shown this great instagram ad and it pushes you off to a website  And facebook no longer can tell if you are  You know if you actually like click buy. Oh, wait a minute. You don't think so

Start time: 1126.52
End time: 1141.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Remember google was telling uh advertisers. Oh, by the way, we can tell how many you sold because we got the credit card data as well  All of this stuff is sold to data brokers and sold on isn't it? Don't they know everything anyway?  Do you really think facebook is in the dark about what you did?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The idea of the only thing that button on apple does by the way is turn off the id for advertisers so that that that information  That unique code is not transmitted  But doesn't mean that facebook doesn't see like buttons  Is that stopped by a safari?

It's a safe assumption  That your what you're doing is pretty well known by everybody on the web whether or not you click that button on the idfa  In fact, there's some read there have been a number of research studies that back that up over the last six months  So yeah, if you're running an ad blocker  but I don't think  Most people run ad blockers yet  I don't know. I think this is interesting. We'll see is it the beginning of the end for big tech I  Now government is making some inroads  congress, uh is moving pretty quickly on a number of fronts  they uh have it came out it went out of committee the uh,  Uh  Uh, i'm blanking out congress. That's good. That's a good thing  I can't remember her name. This is our senator from minnesota  uh her bill  Amy klobuchar. Thank you. Yeah her uh her bill  To uh, and I think it was marcia blackburn was a co-sponsor  To force a go by the way, the bill was written with like a paragraph per company  It was very clear who they were aiming at google apple  Uh to force these third-party app stores  Uh, and I think that may well pass  Uh, both the senate and the house and go on to be law. There's also a very concerning bill that is back  the earn it act  Which is a terrifying  Bill which was we beat once last summer but senator dick blumenthal and lindsey graham have reintroduced  The bill we did actually in 2020

Transcript:  It it's a framework for private actors to scan every message sent online  And and the premise of course  Think of the children the premise is of course that we've got to stop  CSAM child sexual abuse material and so companies need to be held responsible for every bit of traffic on their network  Uh, the earn it act could also ensure that anything hosted online backups websites cloud photos is scanned. Remember the  The fight over apple scanning stuff on your iphone will get ready  It also weakens encryption  And here's a scary thing about the earn it act. It has strong bipartisan support  This act matches an act a similar law that is in front of the house  Right now the bill creates a 19 person federal commission  What could possibly go go wrong?  Which is mostly run by law enforcement agencies which will lay out voluntary best practices  For attacking the problem of online child abuse  Uh, the real concern from a lot of people is this will actually just force child abuse  Underground where it will continue unabated. Meanwhile leaving us in a much less secure and private state  Um, so just a little be aware of CSAM it also uh changes section  Which is a big issue. In fact, mike maznik who's a big 230 supporter on tech dirt had a number of pieces  I think three talking about the uh  the dangers of the  Earn it act any thoughts dan patterson on earn it

Transcript:  mike's uh  Headline in the tech dirt is how the earn it act is significantly more dangerous than fosta fosta, which did pass  Uh, he says earn it repeats the basics of the fosta playbook  But and this is very important since earn it appears to have significant momentum in congress  It's significantly more dangerous in multiple different ways that necessarily haven't necessarily been highlighted

Transcript:  Uh, all right  I do find it interesting leo that that all of these laws not just not just earn it  But you know, there's another one about ending platform monopolies. Yeah, that's the culture going. Yeah  They have these really arbitrary cutoffs, you know, like oh if you exceed 600 billion dollars in market cap  Then you know, then we're going to take away your section. Oh, it's totally aimed at big tech. Yeah, right. Well facebook  Almost slipped below that so like are they you know, like on a monday are they going to be  Exempt from it and on tuesday, are they going to be subject? Like have they interesting have they  Thought about how any of this works. Oh, that's really interesting  how and and another one was like 600 billion dollars in revenue or 600 billion dollars in market cap and i'm like  You don't you at congress don't understand the relationship between revenue and market cap. Do you?  no  It said either or  Even walmart doesn't have 600 billion dollars in revenue. So like  It would apply to literally no one. I mean these things, you know, these things do get worked out  Through the amendment process and like, you know the most glaring kind of you know  oopsies, uh tend to get fixed but I still think it's worth pointing out like  you know  That's a big tell to me that like there's not  Sophisticated thinking about market structure going into these laws and that's that's disturbing. Yeah

Transcript:  Facebook is on the order of a hundred billion a year revenue something like that  Profit's pretty good though, by the way  Don't don't worry about facebook. Their profit is still in the 30 billion dollar a quarter range. It's doing all right  uh  Alphabet uh quarterly results came out as well  And alphabet broke 200 billion in annual revenue for the first time  So, uh, they didn't alphabet did not take this opportunity to blame apple  for anything  missed opportunity there, uh  For 2021 the full year 41 percent year-over-year jump in revenue  for alphabet  Unbelievable fourth quarter revenue 75.3 billion. That's up 32 percent  Year over year  Advertising revenue for the quarter sixty one point two five billion  Apparently, um  You know  Apple didn't hurt him  But I think at google and I think facebook's in the same boat have plenty of ways to get information about you  Google and they have android.

Transcript:  I just wanted to add on the point of google making money hand over fist about a decade ago  I had some free google host. I own my own domain daylion.org  Spelled phonetically and I had it hooked up to google for enterprise. I got one free email address  hosted by gmail basically  Not anymore buddy  Yes, exactly  I got an email like two weeks ago saying oh remember that free single email address  We gave you a decade ago now we're gonna charge you and it's like seven dollars a month for email. So i'm like a  Uh, don't you make enough money google and b the only thing that that email did i'm obviously not paying seven dollars a month  For email i'm like george castanza. I was like you're not winning  So all I did was maybe figure out like an alternative hosting arrangement  I think i'm gonna go with iCloud or whatever because I already pay for that  But i'm like like the greed of like how many people could have had that free, you know  Is it a million almost certainly not?  and you need an additional seven dollars a pop for the like it's just  It is it was very disappointing and it made me really question  Like do I really like what else don't I need from google or from amazon or from any of these guys?  It's like that like just to make an extra, you know couple dollars a month  I'm just reevaluating my entire relationship with all these guys  That's how like that's how like uh, that's how I work.

They were one of the first  cloud  infrastructure companies to offer  SSDs running linux man. It was awesome  Well lenoid has is all grown up man and it is awesome. It's the industry's best price to performance value  For all compute instances whatever you're doing shared dedicated high memory  doing  artificial intelligence gpus too you get free ddos  protection free cloud  firewall  Unfiltered api access and more from lenoid linode  The original they started three years before aws and they're still famous for predictable flat fee pricing  Universal across all 11 of their data centers no weird tiering no weird regions  You just choose lenoid because it's the best you get support  better than any because  The people who work at lenoid are like us  They understand  They're there to help.

What about amazon prime?  20 bump right in a yearly fee  Yeah, and it kind of makes me mad because they say  Uh, well we got to pass along costs  And it's like wait a minute. What am I what exactly am I?  Paying for is it is it prime video?  Is that is that why amazon prime's going up? Is it your rocket to the moon?  Jeff, is it your new yacht that they're going to dismantle a bridge and  All in for what exactly am I paying for?  I think the mistake of going up by that much  140 a year  Is that it does make people think about it and say is it worth?  What i'm getting what did you decide nicklas?

Start time: 2356.48

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I was I spent several hours. I guess the day after that was announced kind of researching, you know  Get the sentiment online. What are people feeling about this?  You know, maybe maybe or maybe not we will do a story on you know, reevaluating your relationship to all these companies, but  I think the thing it triggered in people like I said earlier was that it just kind of like  What am I paying for? You know 20 dollars a year is less than two dollars a month  Which i'll say two things about because I saw a lot of comments about this too. Oh, it's only two dollars  Okay. Well a that's not the point and b, you know, this is something that's drilled into me from being consumer reports  It's like people have budgets money does not grow on trees whether it's two dollars or two thousand dollars  People have money allocated that they spend every month and if you'd ask all of a sudden  Well, here's an extra two dollars a month. Okay. Yeah, maybe maybe most people can swing that but it's but maybe they can't  So that's one thing and then when they try to justify it by saying oh well, we have the nfl on thursdays  Uh, I don't know. This is a thing on this planet. I care less about  I don't want to help pay for the nfl  I don't if the nfl disappears tomorrow i'll be like, what are you even talking about?  So that and I suspect a lot of nerds are the same way. This is not relevant to me in the slightest  Uh now I will say uh  At the end of all of that  I kind of I did run the numbers and what services am I paying for spotify and co buzz and google one storage?  I did all the math and it as it turns out for someone literally with my specific set of services  It does make sense to keep prime if anything else it makes sense to go even further into the amazon ecosystem because I can sit  I personally can save money by doing prime and amazon music unlimited because they have the hi-fi  That saves me from having to pay for spotify or co buzz  They're they're very very specific reason but it's the type of thing where it's like  You should go over with a fine tooth comb. Who are you giving money to every single month?  I get the sense that a lot of consumers out there five dollars here five  They don't really think of it  But I i'm here to tell you that stuff adds up and all these little streaming services  They want you to subscribe to you to watch the flavor of the month television show, which is invariably  Who care? It's great. Let's say it's great. Whatever. Uh, it's like these things cost money and money doesn't grow on trees  so I really do think that  asking people, you know a little more a little more a little more, uh, it may just backfire because  I don't know the people are going to put up with it. It it certainly is  Uh, you know if you're a family with with with with uh with but never mind  Inflation never have you bought like a pound of chicken breast recently or milk like prices are going up very very high and for and  Now prime wants more money. I don't know. It's very  I don't think it's a good look especially given how much money amazon made  Uh, through the pandemic into this recent quarter now, they're like an advertising juggernaut  So you want an extra two dollars a month out of me? Why don't you just you know, it just it just smells fishy  So that that's that's my it's also

Transcript:  The case that prime made sense when it was because it was free second day shipping when you would always get that  But a lot of times now you don't  And no, I will say in the past year. I've had several packages

I was supposed to get here saturday  Uh, I was supposed to hear friday it arrived here today now. Is that a big deal?  No, obviously not but the point is i'm paying for prime to get right, you know at most two days  So what am I paying for exactly?

Start time: 2572.72
End time: 2606.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This might be the wrong time to raise prime because you know  Maybe the shipping thing is because of covet and it's going to get better  Sure, but or supply chain or whatever excuse you want to use  But but this is this is now and this is when you're raising it by the way, yahoo finance actually bloomberg  Pointed out that a lot that almost half a little more than half. I'm sorry 52 percent of uh,  amazon prime members are monthly members  So they're going to 180 dollars a year  Which really makes you wonder is it worth?  uh the money

Start time: 2608.04
End time: 2648.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would just advise folks, uh to to really look, you know  A calculator and see see where your money is going every month because it it may not be worth it depending  And it may you know, it may not be worth it if you just tweak your things a little it's like  Oh, well if if I shop over here or if I treat my shopping habits this way, uh, you you know  You can you can make this so that it works for you  You don't you don't have to be you know, beholden to uh, any any willy-nilly price increase  I do encourage folks to like take the time to to look at this stuff because it's important and you know  These companies, uh, they don't care. I guess even though they're making money hand over fist  Uh, you know, no one's looking out for you. So that's my rant with the prime price

Start time: 2648.30

Yeah, they were saying a lot of folks were saying  Can you just like maybe maybe there needs to be two tiers of prime service one where it's just the prime shipping as it used  To be back in the day. Yes, and then one with like all prime plus called with all this other stuff  Okay, great  But a lot of folks are literally just here for the free two-day shipping  And now prime is like all this value all this stuff. It's like well, I don't I don't use this stuff  Why am I paying for it people just get frustrated and like it's it's highly understandable

So if you can renew now you'll save  Uh that 20 it's not about the 20. It's really about thinking about well, what am I getting?  For what is now? Uh more than ten dollars a month, you know, uh, that's that's a lot of money  My question is bundled in there. Oh, that's the other question. Who the hell knows?

Don't worry  You saw that story jeff bezos's new yacht  Again, not not a good look jeff  While you're raising prime cost jeff bezos's new yacht is so big  That the shipyard where they make it  Uh said you got to dismantle the bridge  Um, I like jalopnik's headline on this here's the boat that won't bring jeff bezos's hair or his wife back  Feel the secondhand shame  540 million dollar mega yacht so big it's built by a company in holland called oceano  That it can't fit through the bridge although again, I saw uh, I have to  Have to find that article, but I I saw the article that said the mayor said no no no  Because he was getting a lot of pushback. We're not gonna  I could dismantle the historic bridge just for that yacht  Uh, all right  You guys are so quiet i'm I was expecting more  I was expecting more more feistiness over prime. Let me see if I can find something that'll upset you  Something that'll get you mad. How about uh,  I've been saving this but I guess it's time to to play the rogan card. Yeah, here we go  Uh, it's interesting, um john stewart said knock it off everybody  john stewart leftist uh  journalist  The daily show host he's now got a show on apple. Maybe it's because he's on apple now. He can't be so  He says people should not call for joe to be censored or or cancelled. I actually believe it. I kind of agree  I don't want to see censorship  But boy the hate fest continues. There's now a super cut of joe rogan using the n-word  Pretty old stuff  There's a there's a video of him laughing hysterically while a fellow comic  Talks about sexual abuse  Uh, it feels like the guns are and knives are out for joe rogan  Anyone in uh have an opinion on that dan you're a journalist  Should spot it what should spotify do about joe rogan? They are going to post a disclaimer apparently

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, definitely journalists shouldn't advise on policy. However, um  and I I mean  Nobody wants to be accused or engaged in censorship. Um, but  I think it's fair that if you say offensive things like the n-word repeatedly or you have  People who are pretty close to racists and nazi sympathizers like the people he's had on  Especially in the early days  I think if you have people like sargon of akkad who have said horrible things about women  I think if you advance, um  A ton of mis and disinformation about uh  covid and vaccines  then  It's okay for people to say that is offensive  And if you take a hundred million dollars, that means that spotify owns you you work for them  They're not a platform like facebook and it's not analogous to twitter or q anon  That we find offensive and maybe we want to get it's not the same  He works for them and it's fair for an employer to say hey, we don't like you saying the n-word  We're taking the content down  Spotify worst stuff the the whole censorship argument. I have no idea. I have no idea  Nobody wants to engage in censorship. I happen to think that maybe that's a little bit of a red herring and it's a distracting argument  It it does not talk about the victims  What about people who don't like hearing the n-word because it's a really offensive term  what about the  The fact that misinformation at scale about vaccines is harmful  I I mean it talking about joe rogan. I think focuses a conversation on joe rogan and that's great  It's great for his attention  But it doesn't talk about the victims and I I don't I don't ever want to be in a position where  Like censorship is bad. Yeah, sure is bad  but you know what he's done some things that many people have been hurt by and  You know what? Let's maybe talk about those people and the fact that spotify paid him 100 million dollars to do that. Yeah

We don't employ him  And somebody last week made the point a good point.

Transcript:  I I think one one big mental fix for thinking about these is to stop using the word platform like do not allow it  Facebook is not a platform. It's a social network spotify is an internet broadcaster  Airbnb is a lodging marketplace  Uber is a ride-hailing service. Once you start calling things what they actually are  It really clarifies  policy decisions darn good clarity  You know it clarifies  You know  Like how we should view?  You know actions like you know, we view sues we view cbs as you know  Just to pick on dan's employer as responsible for what is broadcast on cbs. Yeah, if dan started spouting this they'd fire

Yeah  It's not my job to express opinions, yeah, it's not my job that's so old-fashioned I love it  Well, I mean  Look, it really isn't it's I don't even think that that's old-fashioned. I think that that harms the trust relationship. I agree  I agree 100. I don't mean old-fashioned in a bad way. It's a good thing  It's just I just can't do my job people can't trust me and guess what people don't trust joe rogan either and now they don't  Trust spotify, right?

I thought you know when neil young said well i'm on my music off  Spotify's reaction was probably like mine like well fine neil go ahead  Big deal, but actually it's hurt them quite a bit  with the other artists nils lofgren and joni mitchell and  podcasters  Saying yeah, we don't want to be on this platform. It actually seems to have hurt them. There seems to be a movement to cancel  spotify  memberships

I used to listen to  Howard stern and opi and anthony as a young man and rogan was always on the time on the opi and anthony show this is  Like 2005 6 7 so this is a very long time ago back in the day  he used to talk a lot about like like ancient aliens and like exoplanets and like  Was he can I ask you because I I am not I am i've never listened to the podcast

Transcript:  It's funny to see the rogan debate pop up because I was actually part of a podcast a couple years ago  Where we analyzed it was called the joe rogan experience experience. We had like four episodes  The problem was that man produces such a volume of content that it was impossible to to listen and to like take notes on that stuff  So if anyone's been like listening closely to what this man has been saying for the length of his career  It's kind of been me  And I just wanted to add, you know as finally, we've got a joe rogan expert on the show  I'm also look i've also been racially abused in my life. It's not fun  Yeah, I could think of there is one particular instance why I felt very i'm obviously not going to get into it  But to have your personhood diminished because of the color of your skin is not fun  Having said that  As that person I listened to his you know, obviously you really can't defend the virality that came out this weekend  That's indefensible. But like just some like spicy humor is like  I don't know. It's never bothered me. I is is that is that my family background?  I've been around this kind of content, you know, frankly my family's a very blue collar family a lot of law enforcement  It is not exactly as a waspy family that is offended by like words and stuff  Uh, so that I I don't know if like, you know, the elite media has a very similar background  Uh, but yeah, it it is it is it is very interesting to see like you said the knives come out  Uh, I personally as someone who has listened I don't listen as much anymore  Just because I can't stand the covet talk. I'm over this. I kind of talk about a lot now  It's exotic it's it's it's like it's it's it's too much  It's it's like if you're hosting like a radio show, it's like can we get onto another topic? Yeah  I do wish he would go back to like, you know, like the aliens and like, you know, he had ufc fighters on  I'll go like I I like that stuff  Uh, I don't know the focus of the show really seems to have fallen off  Falling off with the move and you know  It was great that you guys had the spotify debate last week because I was like, you know if i'm spotify  Is this even worth the trouble anymore like have people join spotify spotify premium because rogan is there  Uh, you know, they'll show growth right? But would that growth have occurred anyway?  Is he that big of a draw that it is worth the constant and unrelent the relentless like  news cycle like  Focus on this man. I don't know that it is ultimately this is probably good for him, right?  More people know about him and probably more people and the idea and I also think it's kind of funny the idea  Let's say spotify's, you know, this is actually not worth our trouble. We're not goodbye rogan  There's some clause in the contract where they they sever the relationship  Are people gonna like who his mega fans are they gonna all of a sudden start reading like the atlantic or are they gonna like that's not happening?  So like I don't I kind of understand, you know  I don't think you should be saying fake things about the vaccine like obviously i'm not a fool  but like the idea that the people listening to this are all of a sudden going to be going to be listening to  To edward r. Murrow or whatever is like that seems fanciful and fake  I don't think that's going to happen  Uh, and I kind of think that maybe that bothers folks that this this this meathead who who is a commentator on mma  Has such a reach and influence maybe that bothers people. I don't know  uh, but yeah, that's sort of that's sort of my take I I I  As a one-time fan of this guy, I wish he would kind of get away from this stuff because exhausting and it is not fun  Uh, it's just not a fun, you know, let's let's get back to ancient civilizations  And that type of thing because that that was as a young man that that was interesting talk

Start time: 4022.78
End time: 4064.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And he doesn't do that as much anymore. I you know, I listen to stern too and sometimes it's offensive  Sometimes it's like I can't believe you're talking about this  But you can turn it off  and um  I guess the big issue is  If he's giving advice to people who believe it  About health which where he has no expertise or he's having  pseudo experts on  Uh, and people are listening to it and not getting and actually risking their lives  because of it  is  Then then what do you do?  Because i'm not i'm not for shutting people's voices down. I  I think we just have to rely. Yeah, I think he acknowledged on one of his

Start time: 4065.52
End time: 4096.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's done a couple apology videos in the past week or so. I think in one of them  He said yeah, maybe we should step away from this. Maybe I should have I should be better informed  I think he know it's kind of obviously I don't know him  Uh, I was a fan from way back. It feels like the show has gotten out of control  It has gotten so big that maybe like the power has gone. This was a show again  This was a show he was live streaming from like his basement or whatever talking about  Yeah, yeah, and it's like he's so big and so proud you got that rush of like, you know people wanting to de-platform him  He's his fans egging him on

Transcript:  I I I don't like the  The polarized  uh  Conversation I don't think anybody does but I think it's fair to like I listened to rogan for a long time, too  uh in  2017 2018 I heard really offensive stuff about women and about  People of color and I stopped listening because I heard a lot of offensive stuff  I know I don't recall thinking this guy should be cancelled  What I did is dial out and I think that there is a nuanced conversation that can be had here  I agree that maybe  Nobody is going to stop  listening to joe rogan and start reading the atlantic but I think that it is fair to say I find this offensive and I find that the  the  the  profit from that to also be offensive and  That's that's fair and fine to say I don't think that dismissing that is helpful. Yeah

Transcript:  Well, and just to give you some uh ammunition here, uh, according to the verge who talked to  An ad buyer who wished to be anonymous. It's a million dollars an ad to get an ad on the joe rogan experience  uh, it is  Absolutely a money maker. I I  Uh that money does go to joe, of course, but uh spotify sells the ads  So they're it's part of the spotify ad network  So it is very good for spotify's business whether they'll make a hundred million dollars in a year or two. I don't know but  There's no question. It's added to their subscriber base and they make good money on the advertisements

You can be a normal person and ask yourself  What's my responsibility to the culture and society in which I live?  Especially if i'm profiting from something. I don't think this has I look I  I agree with a lot of what we're talking about here, but I don't like the  Let's wrap this in comedy. Let's wrap this in i'm just an entertainer. Those all seem like  easy excuses for not taking responsibility and  I mean  Do and say what you want that's fine, but you you don't get it in out just because you're a comedian  I don't get an out for being a journalist and you get some responsibility.

I'm not saying  Oh, let's cancel pitchforks, but i'm saying that maybe there should be a responsibility and wrapping it in comedy seems like an easy out

Yeah  now, you know brussel is saying well this you know, the system got kind of broken because like  He wanted to you know, he wanted to bust in and start his company. Well bolt started three years after stripe. So  you know his complaint is that stripe had lined up all of the  You know  All of the great startup investors. Well, it's considered really bad form if you're a venture capitalist  To invest in a direct competitor. Yeah, so they don't generally do that. So I didn't really get what his  Complaint was there and then he also had like  You know these other theories that um that hacker news, which is this website that white combinator  Operates, it's you know reddit like, you know  Uploading and downloading links. I live on hacker news. I love it. Yeah, you know, so he claimed that um when  bolt had some announcement  That his you know his announcement got downvoted and stripe had a similar announcement that got upvoted and the editor of hacker news  You know our moderator went on to explain well  bolt's post was very  You know commercial and kind of you know  Advertisement like and people tend to downvote that yeah

Transcript:  I know it's like if you know, so if stripe and white combinator are mob bosses, they are the most inept  Mafiosi you've ever met. Yeah  But I you know, I I did think it was an interesting  you know an interesting discussion to be had about like these networks of people that kind of make silicon valley run and  You know, are they always to the good something I didn't get into in the piece is that there is a problem with mafias  Which is that you know  They tend to perpetuate a lack of diversity  Like if you have a group of mostly young white men at say paypal and they go and start companies  They have a tendency to pull that same not very diverse network with them now it happens  You know at paypal there were actually a lot of women too  Who went and started companies played key roles?  Uh became investors for some reason they get written out of the the history of the paypal mafia  Anyway, that's neither here nor there.

Transcript:  But bresla did not make them it's a story as old as time by the way bresla stepped down as ceo after this  Uh, so the story that's old this time is one  People getting in trouble on twitter  Never ever a good thing to get get spicy on twitter  But but too that's how it's always worked  when when I was in college, I went to a  Prestige university because that's where you make the connections and the people who really wanted to be prestigious would join the secret society  Where you'd really make the connections it's but that's a hundred years old. It's probably as old as humanity  and it's fact for a long time was the the kind of the sung as the praises of san francisco and silicon valley  Is well, you know, that's where you're gonna have these  Serendipitous interactions with other people who are working and you'll share information and that's the value of it  Um, I'd be hard to stop that.

Attention don't you?  Speaking of bundled subscriptions that is the future of the times right times has done very well with that  Very smart very well. I get you I pay for  cooking crosswords  In fact  My biggest problem with the new york times. I can't get them to stop sending delivering the newspaper. I don't want the newspaper  I just want the other stuff  And I can't figure out maybe somebody could tell me how do you subscribe to the digital only version of the new york times?

Transcript:  Uh, all right  Uh, let's talk about apple  They uh have responded to dutch  regulators who said you've got to allow  For some reason dutch dating apps to have their own  In-app purchases. This is one of many places like south korea and perhaps soon the us where apple is being  forced to give up  Their uh their app store their 30% vig  so  The apple's response was okay. Okay  We'll give you your own app store  And uh, you'll only owe us 27  Commission because we're not doing the payments processing anymore and the response from the community is  Amazing steven trotten smith who's an apple developer? Uh, absolutely this is on twitter absolutely vile  His response he says this says everything about tim cook's apple and what it thinks of developers  I hope the company gets exactly what it deserves everybody on the executive team should be ashamed  And some of them should not be here when it's all over  We all see you  uh marco arment  who of course is a  well-known developer and uh for for ios  His overcast is is a very popular podcast player. He also worked at tumblr. He wrote you can just feel  How much apple despises having to do any of this?  Yes  And by the way if you're a developer they've made it so there's absolutely no way you're going to do this because  once you pay the 3% to your  Credit card company and you still pay apple 27% and there's a lot of hoops  You have to jump through you have to have a dedicated app just for it special app  There's you have to do all sorts of paperwork  It's just I think it's  Fascinating  That apple is willing just to go balls to the wall, excuse me testicles to the wall for this  Like dudes you don't read the room this is not what people are talking about here

Start time: 5991.24
End time: 6024.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I think I think what it says is that the app store commission  Is only marginally about payments. It's about marketing  It's about marketing. It's about distribution. It's about, you know discoverability in the app store. It's about the you know  You know the sdk all the tools that you get as a developer  To build your app. So you're defending apple you think apple's right?  Absolutely. I mean, you know like  Look, it's it's capitalism like this is this is the cost of doing business

Transcript:  We created this beautiful platform and if you and we're going to do all the hard work if you want to sell apps here  But you're going to give us 30% which is less than you know, uh  Ingram  Microcharged when I was selling, you know when you were selling  Software in a box they would take 50 or more percent.

Transcript:  Yeah, and and actually in the fortnight case if I if I recall the judge's decision  Correctly, they actually found that you know, maybe there's a case to be made that fortnight shouldn't have to use apple's payment system  But that doesn't get fortnight out of the 30 commission  um, you know, so  So like fine go ahead use a different payment system and you're going to have to pay apple 30 percent. That was where  if I recall again the you know, the judge's decision correctly where that was

Start time: 6077.70
End time: 6084.56

End time: 6110.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you know, it's  It is complicated. I mean I think pulling apart the payments, you know  It is conceptually interesting to pull apart the payments processing part of things from distribution for marketing  but it's always been kind of a package deal that like  This is what you get for the 30 percent now is 30 the right price for every app for every

Transcript:  Please be my guest  Um, I don't know. I feel like apple. Uh  So there is a certain amount of rent seeking in what apple's doing when they when they say to amazon your kindle app  You're going to give us 30 percent of books you sell there or netflix  you got to give us 30 percent of your subscriptions or spotify, uh, and yeah, they cut it to 15 percent, but  Uh, that seems like rent seeking they didn't  That's not why people subscribe to netflix is because you you made an iphone or or spotify or buy books on kindle because you made  An iphone that's not  apple doesn't participate in that success and shouldn't on the other hand if if you make a  Uh a wordle on the iphone and they're distributing it and they're promoting it.

Transcript:  A consistent approach. Yeah, I think consistency though has been the challenge  I've spoken with with big developers like facebook and amazon, but i've also spoken with very small developers including a  uh a review site they reviewed, uh, ios indie games and  Their contention is they used the term rent seeking and that they were  Essentially put out of business  Uh, and they they argued that that apple is not evenly applying their their rules and that they would go after  um companies that appeared to mimic or do some things that apple did but better and that's maybe that's that's

You're not getting access to these companies at the right time  Once they go public once yeah, you can buy stock but but that's already after the exit  What you want to do is get in  As the big investors do on the ground floor at the beginning  So that when the exit comes you can you can benefit from that and that's what our crowd does our crowd is a venture capital firm  That has what we call deal flow  They they know about what's going on in those little startup garages around the world  They analyze companies look at the ones with the greatest growth potential and then  Let you get involved  From personalized medicine to cyber security  To proton therapy. There's something new a 20 billion total addressable market  In state-of-the-art labs and startup garages and everywhere in between our crowd is in identifying innovators  So you can invest when the growth potential is the greatest at the beginning  And it works  Our crowd accredited investors have already invested over a billion dollars in growing tech companies  21 of their portfolio companies are unicorns  Many of our crowds members have benefited from over 40 ipos or sale exits of portfolio companies. It is the fastest  Growing venture capital investment community. Let me explain a little bit about how it works when you go to our crowd  Dot com slash twit and please go there so they know you saw it here  You'll tell them what country you're in and there are rules in every country  In the u.s  They call it an accredited investor a certain amount of net worth certain amount of experience  They they don't want you to be, you know, uh betting the rent money here, but if you're an accredited investor  You can and again depends on which country you're in what those rules are so go there and sign up  It's free to sign up by the way and get deal flow and find out what's going on  Costs you nothing  But once you see something you like you can get in a single company deal for as little as ten thousand dollars  We're not talking millions of dollars just ten grand  Or get into one of their funds for fifty thousand dollars, but there isn't and now you should know there's a minimum of ten  Thousand dollars required to invest but those terms again may vary depending on where you invest  so when you go to the site and put the country you're investing from  i'll give you an example though of some of the  Early stage startups you can get involved in right now. You can invest in something called h i l  applied medical  They're using nobel prize-winning technology to bring the most advanced radiotherapy treatment to cancer patients  It's the world's first laser based system that's earned them an agreement with proton international the largest proton therapy operator in the u.s  and europe  Interesting, so they're already kind of getting into gear h i l applied medical but  Find out more you can invest in that and or many other portfolio companies  at  Ourcrowd.com  But it costs you nothing to join to find out more to read the prospectuses to read the information  To follow what our crowd is doing. It's really fascinating. Oh, you are  crowd.com  I'm not an investor, but I find it fascinating to read up on this stuff and I think it's a really good idea  To give people access to stuff that normally only uh people down there on sandhill road  Get access to join the fastest growing venture capital investment community our crowd.com  Let's see  Tesla's going to recall a whole bunch of cars  Because it turns out this is to me. This is a great story  Uh, they even said this when they talked about full self-driving that it would run  some stop signs  Well now technically that's illegal  We call it here a california stop in california. I don't know what you call it in the hudson river valley  But it's called a california stop here  Uh, and the way tesla did it is and it's I think I understand how the engineers were thinking  um  The tesla it says looks at the intersection. There's nobody there. This is what you would do, right?  And instead of coming to an energy inefficient full stop and start  It says  I'm gonna go through at up to 5.6 miles an hour nine kilometers per hour  So, okay, here's the bad news it's against the law  But I also understand exactly why tesla did it now you you're a consumer uh reporter nicklas  Oh boy  What do you think?

Uh tesla will have to recall  A whole I think was something like 58 000 vehicles  Uh, there will be a over the air software update to turn this off  Um tesla agreed to the recall after two not one but two meetings with the national highway traffic safety administration  Uh tesla did say well there haven't been any we don't know of any crashes or injuries  Caused by this feature model s sedans and x suvs from 2016 through 2022  Model threes from 2017 to 2022 model wise 20 through 2022. I think it's almost everything  Everything that was capable of it  um the firmware  update will go out in early february, which makes me wonder why they have to do the  The recall maybe that's the maybe that's what's going to fix it. I don't know

It doesn't excuse, you know tesla for allowing this to  Uh, you know get out there in the first place, but I I do wonder if you know, we kind of have to rethink the  The the whole system of recalls because that's an enormous amount of expense to get you know  Get the cars back to you know a service center and you know and and for what for an over the air update that  You know you can get with the car just sitting in the garage

Transcript:  Uh, yeah, they say recall and maybe that's the also that may be the legal term. I don't know. Yeah. Yeah, right  but it's  Recall documents posted tuesday by u.s safety regulators. I'm reading from the ap  Say that tesla will disable the feature with an over the internet software update by  Sometime this month  Now I had read it was two kilometers, but it is 5.6 miles an hour  So it is pretty fast going through there and uh ap interviewed a professor  At carnegie melon. He's a professor of electrical and computer engineering  He said uh, four-way stop signs are commonly placed. We have them all over in california commonly placed to protect intersections for kids  When no crossing guard is present  Uh, he said tesla's machine learning system can mistakenly identify objects  What happens when fsd decides a child crossing the street is not relevant and fails to stop?  This is an unsafe behavior and should never have been put in vehicles  I guess I agree. I do not do by the way. I do not do rolling stops. I have family members who do  But I I like to stop I you know, it's a token stop I don't like  I don't like sit there for a second. I come but I come to a full stop, right and I look around  And you should do the same  Otherwise get your firmware  updated  so, um  Wow  Have has anybody purchased any bored apes?

Yeah  um  You know and and we had a policy around uh, cryptocurrency and you know, and uh, whether you could hold it and disclosures that were needed  um, but we struggled to figure you know figure out with nft is like if you have  an nft like does that give you a financial motivation to  promote that group of nfts or  Ah  General, yeah, like what's it, you know, or or if it's if it's really unique then  You know, it's just your you know, it's just  you know like  Owning a piece of art doesn't give you a motive to like pump the whole art world, right?  like you just think that your piece of art is  You know is nice and worth whatever you paid for it.

It's an investment. It's speculation. So then to go on a tonight's by the way, seven million people have seen that clip  On twitter alone. I don't know how many millions have seen it on the tonight show and say look look  That sounds  Vaguely unethical am I wrong?  See to me it's now I don't know anybody wants to defend nfts, please do or bitcoin or crypto or web 3  But I am increasingly of the opinion that it's all a scam. It's I'm  Hmm

I'm publishing a story tomorrow morning  Interview a short story, but an interview with tim o'reilly, you know a famous publisher and technologist  He coined the phrase web 2.0. I think tim had the first or one of the first commercial websites  And he uses really strong language about nfts and crypto  um, we have some video that will publish but he's he  I don't know if he uses  The word scam. Wow, he references the the trading back and forth of nfts  Which is pretty common to boost their value and he does call it a pyramid scheme or that it's like a pyramid scheme  He was he was pretty  Um, okay with the technology, you know the underlying blockchain  Yeah, but but the use of it.

I think he's he is  smartly pointing out the the behavior around these  Products, I don't know that I would call an nft or cryptocurrency actually technology  These are products that come from blockchain technology  But that these products have pretty scam like behavior around them. And if you go to the very top of  The pyramid scheme is a lot of  Well, I I won't get into the pyramid scheme stuff, but it really  some of the behavior seems to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Be pretty similar to it  It did strike me that um  A lot of people who were buying nfts early on were people who were very  Heavily invested in crypto now if you convert your crypto to fiat currency  It's a transaction that the you know that may or may not get reported to the irs  But the irs is definitely going to be interested in when you convert your crypto to an nft  Not as clear to me that there is a taxable  Transaction that at least that the irs can kind of pin down  but uh, you know, I I kind of wonder if there is  Some of that motivation of like, you know, this is basically a way we can get  you know  get our  value out of crypto and you know out of  A fungible cryptocurrency and into this non fungible token. There's also a ton of wash trading  Basically meaning trading like for like which when it happens with stock stocks is pretty suspect  So I think we have to look at that

They're not even the artists by the way  um  They thought uh be kind of they were both in their 30s met while growing up in florida according to buzzfeed  And both had literary aspirations. They both were interested in crypto  Wanted to create some sort of nft collection came up with the concept of rich apes living in a swamp clubhouse  So they hired a freelance illustrator to draw them  partnered with two engineers as co-founders to execute the collection  And they've been selling them. They have  This is actually this is where you get the profit is  Uh, they make money not just from the initial sale because remember  They didn't sell it direct to jimmy fallon or to paris hilton  Probably somebody bought it and sold it and bought it and sold it and eventually got to them  They made two million dollars from the initial sales of the nfts, but they get a 2.5 royalty in all future trades  So every time that nft is sold they get 2.5  So there is some there is some money in this  Um, I don't I don't think they're scammers necessarily  I don't think anybody's a scammer in this exactly  But I think you should consider  The source when you hear people pumping up the notions of nfts or crypto or web3  Because they may have as vested interest in uh in pumping it

I'm paraphrasing there but  We'll post the whole video tomorrow. His point was him seeing the web  The first web bubble come and go the technology the underlying  Framework of the internet of course was technologically sound but the products that were built on top of it  had so much  Fud around them so or so much hype around them that it it  Caused this bubble and a lot of people got hurt in that bubble and and that's the underlying thing of what tim is saying  Is that the tech is one thing the hype is another thing and that if this bubble pops people could get hurt.

They said they were pursuing  I would like to like just fast forward like maybe five years to see where all this and if is this is this just flavor of  The month just like every marketer at an org is like we got to get involved in nfts because the kids are into it  And it just ends up being nothing  Uh, it feels again. The tech is is super cool to me  But it feels like this particular implement like i'm i'm super not impressed with like ape pictures on twitter  Like i'm sorry like that's not like I don't know like even even you have the octagonal like oh because you pay for twitter blue  and you've  What?

I gotta get one  um  It just uh, you know, I feel like maybe people should be cautious. That's all just  Like if it's if it's money, you don't need go ahead, but uh, there seems like there might be other things you could do that would be  more useful  um  Boy, i'm wondering what google's intentions are with stadia  Uh  It seems like it's slowly winding down  While everybody else with their streaming gaming systems is just getting started  Uh stadia has apparently killed, uh their white label version  um  Business insiders the business.

Uh again compared to microsoft game pass where I say, oh that's just that's part of my  Month. Yeah, it's it's bundling like I play on my phone or or stream on my laptop. That's that's kind of cool  I've used game pass streaming. It works fine  You know, I happen to have a decent internet connection of course  That's kind of like, you know, that's the trick right if your internet is good enough or not  But uh, yeah stadia, uh, I don't know it had a weird how they structured that always felt uh wrong basically, you know  Yeah

Transcript:  Our show day brought to you by  Nureva  Nureva you've got the you know, the huddle room the conference room the big one where you have people come in and stuff and  Maybe you've looked at well, how can we get the audio better? You probably had the speakerphone on the table, right?  That's terrible. That's the worst experience ever. How can we get the audio better? So maybe you went you talked  to uh, you know, a big audio  technical firm and  You know  They said well, you know, we got to bring these designers in and we got to spec it out measure everything  We got to do some echo testing and stuff like that  And then we're going to get the mics and they'll they got to put them on the table when you got a tape of a mark  Where they are and oh by the way, uh, because of covet protocols  You got to sanitize in between meetings and there's going to be wires and there's speakers and we got a technician in there every  Few weeks because he's got to calibrate it. This is not what you want  But I have a better solution  a leap in technology that has transformed  conference rooms, it's called  Nureva n u r e v a it's as simple as a sound bar  You could install it yourself  No wires no microphones just their patented microphone mist technology  The microphones are in the sound bar, but they work so there are no dead zones  That it's as if there are thousands of microphones filling the room virtual microphones. You can hear everyone everywhere  No matter what way they're facing no matter how their social distancing  You can just talk and move naturally and you'll be heard by everybody the remote participants  Participants it's amazing. It's got continuous auto calibration  So there's you know, your room is always ready to use with optimized audio. You don't need an outside technician  You can install it yourself. It's a 30 minute diy job  Just hang if you can hang a sound bar a couple of screws and boom you're you can do nureva  Which can save you a lot of time and if you have multiple rooms, you'll use the nureva console, which is awesome  To manage the rooms gives your it department the power to monitor manage adjust  systems from  Anywhere they don't even have to go to the room. They can just do it all from the console nureva is brilliant  It sounds great. It works saves you thousands of dollars  It's simple  It's modern ask yourself you want to go with that costly complicated traditional system  Or do you want to make the leap to simple economical nureva?  Nureva.com find out more  It really is a brilliant solution  And as we get back to work as we start having those meetings some people are remote some people are in office  You're going to really want to have this in your conference room nureva.com  Nureva.com we had a great week  On twitter we have prepared a small mini movie for your enjoyment

He's a u.s security researcher  And uh apparently he found out that the north koreans did I say south korea I did I meant north korea  There's a somewhat of a difference  North korea had hacked him and other I guess his handle is  P4x  Gone after him and other western security researchers trying to steal their hacking tools  Find out what they knew about software vulnerabilities. He says he managed to prevent them from taking anything of value, but he was so upset  By north korean state-sponsored hackers targeting him personally  And by the lack of any visible response from the u.s government  He said  This is an article uh from uh wired  Uh, andy greenberg writing of course he said after a year of simmering  Uh, he said  I'm gonna take matter into my own hands. It felt like the right thing to do here  If they don't see we have teeth, it's just gonna keep coming  so, uh  He said he looked into it found numerous  known but unpatched vulnerabilities in north korea's systems  He found ancient his word versions of apache  He started to examine north korea's own national operating system the red star os  Which he described as an old and likely vulnerable version of linux  He was able to  Single-handedly launch a denial of service. I don't know why i'm laughing  But I think it's I'm laughing because it's great  He said he largely automated his attacks periodically running scripts  That enumerated the system still online and launching exploits to take them down  For me says p4x it's like a small to medium-sized p4x  And he said he was able to  Unable to do that  He said he was able to  Unable to do that  He said he was able to take them down  For me says p4x it's like a small to medium-sized pen test  It's pretty interesting how easy it was to actually have some effect there  and so  I don't think he took it down for very long.

Maybe that's it  I shouldn't assume shouldn't assume but I agree with you  Oh, and it would have been a smart thing to do for microsoft apple  Google companies that make devices that use these patents to maybe just get together and buy them up  Let's see  North korea  I think i've covered everything  us  Has or the house anyway has passed a bill  to invest in chip manufacturing rnd  This is the america competes act of 2022 the senate passed something similar last summer the u.s innovation  And competition act so the bills will have to be reconciled  The house version includes 52 billion dollars in funding to help sentemy conductors  Companies build new factories to fund research and development  The president says he will sign that as soon as it comes to his desk  So this is probably a good thing  It's a it's a direct way to address the chip shortage and encourage new factories to open in the u.s
