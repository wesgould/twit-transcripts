Transcript:  Netcasts you love from people you trust.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  This is TWiT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bandwidth for This Week in Tech is provided by AOL Radio at AOL.com slash podcasting.  This is TWiT.  This Week in Tech, episode 106 for July 22, 2007, the Googleverse.  It's time for TWiT.  We're waiting for a few twits off in the wings.  I don't know what they're doing.  We're in the can.  But, meanwhile, we've got two folks.  We haven't had on Twitter in a while and we're really glad to have a back.  Brett Larson, long time contributor to Tech TV and now on your channel, on channel, don't  tell me, two?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm actually at Fox now.  Oh, you moved?  I moved.  So, what channel is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here in New York, it's channel five.  Channel five in New York.  He's on Fox five in New York City.  And do you have a title?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am the technology and environmental reporter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I thought they'd maybe like TV geek or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, they change it every week, though.  Sometimes I'm tech guru.  Sometimes I'm swami of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sometimes you'll talk about global warming and sometimes about the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Some of the Jon Stewart show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that is ladies and gentlemen, long missed John C. DeVorek, who is back.  Wasn't here last week because his daughter had a birthday.  Happy birthday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yay.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So we should get Erica Hill on since we're going to start putting real TV people on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I see her all the time on headline news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  And she's still the tech geek over there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right.  Whenever they have a web story, they put it in front of a screen and she points at it.  Exactly.  That's how you do it.  They're big fans of that at CNN.  There was a network, and I know maybe it was CNN now, where they click on the screen.  They're actually touching the screen, pushing buttons on the screen.  Yeah, it's CNN.  Is that CNN?  They have a special screen.  I'm in San Francisco.  The dot com desk.  Yeah, that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was in San Francisco today and there was a CNN truck with the satellite thing on the  top of it.  And this is not, I've seen a lot of these trucks because they're all over the place.  I mean, we have them for the local stations.  But this one was like huge.  It was a huge truck with the dish was like a big sea band dish.  It was a monster.  Well, there is only one truck for CNN.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have to drive along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That could be.  But it was a big one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've got an earthquake in San Francisco.  Get out there.  It'll take us three days.  Get out there now.  Move, move.  There was an earthquake today.  Did you feel that, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I did.  In fact, I felt it.  It woke me up.  I was in bed and I think it was like at six in the morning or something.  And it just started a low rumble.  And then it was the heart.  And I was like, it woke me up.  I guess I was just at the point where I could be, because usually I sleep through them.  And then it was like a really good little shake.  It wasn't like, you know, the bang.  I'm on a big rock, so it's like pretty safe.  But usually you get...  You live on Alcatraz?  Yeah, he lives on the rock.  Albany Hill is a big rock.  There's a lot of these rocks in the Bay Area and they're very safe because they act like  big ships.  You want to be on bedrock.  Yeah.  They act like ships.  And so they kind of move as one.  So you don't get the wave that rips.  The problem is you're on regular land around here.  The wave forms like a dirt wave and it comes flying around and then it lifts up one part  of your house and then drops it when it lifts up the other part and boom, the place blows  up.  That's kind of a problem.  But anyway, it was a pretty good shake.  I enjoyed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I always liked earthquake.  I mean, as long as nobody was injured, I was kind of interested.  Yeah, they're kind of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're like a little ride.  They make you wonder what the heck's going on.  And you say, wow, this is unsafe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John's house is right above overlooking Golden Gate Fields, the racetrack.  It'd be kind of funny if you kind of ended up in the racetrack in the middle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's a long walk, but it's possible.  Just bounce there.  Get flung over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the reason I urgently started taping is because just before we began, Mr. Brett Larson  asked the question of John C. Dvorak, the entire world wishes to know.  Brett, would you ask that question one more time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sure.  So, John, what do you think of the iPhone?  Never heard of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The most hyped consumer product of the last 10 years and you've never heard of it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So anyway, so I got my hands on one.  Oh, you did?  Uh huh.  Yeah, and I think it's a pretty spectacular little product.  I think it's still too expensive.  It's nothing I'd want.  It doesn't do voice calling and some of the other features I really like with a phone.  And I really want a phone.  I don't want another iPod.  But I have to say, if you got nothing but money and you don't mind spending $600 for  something like Gizmo.  It's not that expensive, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, there are smartphones in that price range.  That's not outrageously expensive.  No, but I use burners.  Oh yeah, that's right.  You use the disposable phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Disposable phones are cheap.  You don't have to sign up for a plan.  Just like a cocaine master.  I was going to say, what are you selling drugs?  Those drug guys aren't that stupid.  He's the Medellin cartel of tech reporters.  They stay out of trouble by using these kinds of phones.  So I go with it.  I stay short of the dog fighting part of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who was that involved in dog fighting?  It was some NFL player.  Oh, Michael Vick.  Michael Vick, that's right.  Wow.  That's a sad story.  So surprisingly, because really, we've channeled you on the last four or five podcasts saying  iPhone.  So you're actually a little more positive about it than I would have expected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I was actually never was negative about it.  I was just negative about Apple's getting into that business when it's not a business  that it should be in.  Yeah, but you know, I have to say.  I'm rethinking it.  I'm rethinking it.  But I had to be shown I wasn't just going to jump on the bandwagon without any cause.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you know, they jumped in the MP3 player business, too.  Yeah, but that was a more abundant business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It wasn't taken off yet.  This is huge.  There weren't the tens of millions of, you know, one company selling 35 million MP3 players  at the time they jumped in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's true.  Whether it's because of the iPhone or other factors is probably a combination.  Motorola posted its second straight quarterly loss this week and a big drop well below what  analysts had forecast.  And folks are saying it's because they didn't compete with not merely Apple on the iPhone,  but the BlackBerrys, the new BlackBerrys, the curve and so forth.  And people aren't just...  Which is nice.  Yeah, it's very nice.  They're just not buying Motorola phones anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Motorola phones are crap.  Well, that would explain it.  I mean, they've never...  You know, everybody went gaga over the Razr.  It was a hip flip phone with 1980s internal parts, you know?  It was like the menus were all antiquated.  Getting it to work was...  I've never been impressed with anything Motorola has shown.  Now we're...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The new Motorola Z8 has a podcast application and we're on it in Europe anyway.  What does that mean?  The MotoRyzer.  It interfaces with Windows Media Player.  It's really the first Windows Mobile device that actually gets podcasts through the...  I think through the desktop.  I'm going to find out.  They're sending me a review through the desktop.  Well, wait a minute.  It's Symbian though.  No, I'm sorry.  It's Symbian.  So they have their own Symbian OS.  So I'm not sure how they're doing it, but I'll let you know.  But it's a pretty cool looking phone.  It looks kind of like a...  slider phone that looks a little bit like a Razr with a slider.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hmm.  They call it the MotoRyzer.  I'm not kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's not a joke.  It's called the MotoRyzer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The problem that a lot of people...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know a lot of owners of Razr's and they were all jacked up when they first came out  and then they dropped them once.  Right.  Smash.  And everybody said the same thing.  Oh man, I dropped it once and I had to go get another one.  Then they dropped it again, the new one.  And that was it.  They just said, screw this.  I'm not buying any more of these things.  Three times you're out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The interesting thing about the iPhone, for all its class and its weight and so forth,  it actually is pretty durable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A lot of people have dropped them.  I've dropped mine a dozen times.  Yeah.  It just has a scratch on it.  I just have one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I only bought one.  You know, I'm really...  I share with you the same exact issues, John.  If there are things that you do with your cell phone that you need to do, like MMS or  voice calling or...  There are many features that are missing from this thing.  Right.  On the other hand, it's really spectacular.  It doesn't just...  It's just not a phone.  It's reinventing what a portable computer should be like.  And I think in many ways it's neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I said this to Apple and they got a little upset, but I said it kind of reminds me of  like what the Newton would have evolved to.  Oh, that hurts.  They really didn't like that.  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, so let's get to the real news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this is news.  I just told you.  Oh, this is old news now.  No, I just told you.  That's hot news.  All right.  So, Gun Rocket turns out the lights.  Not a huge player in VoIP, however, one of the first...  They're gone.  Oh.  Did you know about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, what happens to all the customers?  Because I'm worried about that with Vonage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're sending notes out.  Yeah, I thought Vonage was dead too after that lawsuit, but they've hung on.  They're sending out a note.  I think they're trying to transfer customers to other...  Well, here's what they said.  Originally, they were going to try to sell it and keep customers and VoIP, their service  alive through the sale and through a transition.  But according to broadband reports this morning, employees began hinting that a buyer backed  out.  Oh.  And the website's been a little slow.  Sun Rocket was great.  You pay one, I think a yearly fee.  You get two phones with it.  It was very cool.  That's pretty good.  So we're waiting to hear what happens with Sun Rocket.  But according to the Wall Street Journal on the 17th, about three days ago, they've  ceased operation and they're going to try to move their customers if they can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How popular were they?  I don't even...  That's it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's a lot of people who paid 199 bucks for a year calling.  Now, have you seen Uma?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See, this is another reason you want to get this paper.  Who?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uma, not Thurman.  Uma?  Uma.  Uma, Oprah.  Uma, Oprah.  Uma, M-A. It's a new VoIP company.  And you know it's going to be a success because Demi Moore's boy toy, Ashton Kutcher, is the  creative marketing guy.  $27 million in venture capital.  And they say that Kutcher designed their viral marketing campaign.  Uma is a device, $399 device that you buy.  Uses peer to peer.  I think this is interesting.  This is maybe a little risky, but you buy a lifetime membership.  That $400 for that little transceiver.  Lifetime phone calling via peer to peer.  And then you pay a few cents a minute for international calls.  It's lifetime, I think, North America.  But what they're going to do is seed 2,000 of these devices because it's a peer to peer  device, so they need to get a bunch out there.  They're going to seed, I think, 2,000 of them.  And everybody who gets one of these seeded ones, it'll happen in September, can invite  three friends and they can get a free one.  And then...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait, let's back up.  Am I confusing you?  No, it's like, what's the peer to peer got to do with free phone calls?  It's VoIP.  So, it's free VoIP.  I can do free VoIP calls.  We're using Skype right now.  It doesn't cost anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, this is like Vonage style.  This is a TA.  It goes through the regular POTS system?  A voice adapter that plugs into your DSL or cable modem, just like a Vonage box.  It just does.  And then you plug a regular phone into it.  It requires no computer.  Oh, okay.  So, it's like Vonage or Sunrocket.  It's a replacement for your phone system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I don't get the peer to peer thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, neither do I.  Why do I need to have the calls around it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why can't I have one phone and it didn't make a call?  It only calls other people?  Can you call other people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apparently not.  I'm having an anxiety attack here now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Am I going to get attacked and someone's going to jump out with a camera and say whatever  that show is?  I'm trying to report the news, dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's it.  The whole thing's a scam.  That's pretty cool looking.  Now, wait a minute.  By the way, Walt Walsberg gave it a great review in the Wall Street Journal on Thursday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait, let's back up again.  Let me get this straight.  Now, it's a peer to peer thing on these 200 systems at least.  It's got to be seated so it works at all because it's doing some sort of hopping.  That's right.  John, I'm going to send you a link.  But meanwhile, Walt Walsberg gets one and it works for him?  What, is he dry laughing his tests?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a little suspicious.  Click that link and you'll see how beautiful this thing is.  It's gorgeous.  This is the Engadget article.  There's a beautiful picture.  That's kind of cool looking.  400 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You want it, don't you, Brett Larson?  I would take one.  Take one.  You wouldn't pay for it.  Can I call someone's home number?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It looks like something a three year old with big giant buttons pushes.  This is cool looking to you two guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think it looks kind of neat.  It glows.  The buttons glow.  You know what it looks like?  It looks like a whack-a-mole game.  It looks like an Art Lebedev design with the big buttons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean the design, yeah.  I mean in some ways, in terms of some postmodern design, I guess it's cool looking.  So here's the deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, let me explain this again.  Yeah, I can't get it.  I'm not getting it.  You lay out 400 bucks.  You plug this thing into your broadband connection.  You plug your phone into it.  Right.  So that becomes a router.  Right.  Yeah.  Just like Vonage.  But you don't pay the monthly fee, which you pay with Vonage, which is 25 bucks a month  or Sunrocket or Packaday.  They all have fees.  You don't pay that.  So you get North America calls free.  You do pay a few pennies a minute, they say.  They don't say exactly how much it'll be if you're calling internationally outside the  North American area.  I don't know what it would be like if our European or Australian listeners buy it.  You get a phone number?  You get a phone number.  Do you get like a regular 10-digit American exchange?  I don't know.  I don't have one.  Ask Ashton Kutcher.  Asked to me more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See, here's a typical end gadget thing.  It says read Mossberg's review.  Exactly.  There's a link.  It says read is the link.  It says Mossberg's review and there's no link.  Right.  You have to click the read.  This is the all things digital.  God, Walt needs a haircut.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me put this out of the ditch landlines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So anyway, I think it's a really interesting idea, but I have to say spending 400 bucks  for something that...  They have 27 million in funding though.  And they have Ashton Kutcher.  Yeah, they're not going anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, Ashton's...  No, that doesn't mean they won't fold.  I think Ashton Kutcher, you have to say over time, is something of...  He might actually be a marketing genius.  Might be a wizard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's done well for himself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  Well, it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or this could be another very elaborate episode of Punk'd.  We don't know.  Punk'd.  We don't know.  You just paid $400 for a box with big buttons.  It doesn't do anything.  Walt says it doesn't have...  He says if it doesn't have...  Let's see.  Uma combines...  Uma.  Voip and regular phone service.  If you keep your standard phone service, Uma uses your current number.  If you dial 911, it uses a traditional phone service.  If the internet goes out, it uses...  Now this is something that's been a problem with Vonage and other Voips.  If your internet or power goes out, you still have phone through...  So he says what you should do, and I think I say this as well, if you're going to go  with something like Vonage, you should keep a minimum priced landline in case of emergencies.  Really?  Yeah.  You think?  Yeah.  I don't even have landline in my apartment.  Or a cell phone would work.  Cell phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have a cell phone.  Yeah.  But I will say the one time I called 911, there was a knife fight out in front of my  building because I live in New York.  The police showed up right away.  There you go.  There was no delay or anything.  I don't mess around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you see the video of the guys sparring in Central Park?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  I mean, I've seen it live.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So here's the video.  There's a Berkeley...  You might know this group.  This is kind of interesting because we're actually meshing John C. Dvorak's home area  and your home area.  There's a Berkeley...  UC Berkeley a cappella group called Decadence that apparently did kind of a...  If you watch this YouTube video, they stalked...  There are about 10 of them.  They stalked and surrounded these guys sparring in Central Park.  And then, I'm playing for you right now, a cappella started doing the theme for Mortal  Kombat.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Mortal Kombat!  The guys started getting into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they actually start acting out Mortal Kombat.  The guy drops, does 20 push-ups.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's very strange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, I don't know.  That's just a little New York moment.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what that is.  So let's talk about Peter Moore.  Wait a minute.  Before we go on, we will talk about Peter Moore.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Big story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Peter Moore is a great guy.  He's a great guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's a great guy.  He's a great guy.  He's a great guy.  He's a great guy.  He's a great guy.  He's a great guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's a great guy.  So Uma, you're just going to write Uma off.  Who?  Uma.  I think it's kind of cool.  I think it's cool, but I'm nervous about 400 bucks.  John, you think Walt Mossberg was had.  He was punked.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Could be.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That would be cool if it was.  Wouldn't it be funny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe this product doesn't even exist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a little suspicious that Ashton Kutcher is in charge of marketing.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's kind of your giveaway on the joke.  He says it works really well.  That guy used to do a candid camera.  That old guy.  That was fun.  If you saw him coming up to you for some other, you'd think that maybe you were being filmed.  Run.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're right.  This is kind of like that.  Now here's a cool feature.  It has this Uma Scout, which is a $39 device.  I'm going to spend more money now?  Wait a minute.  There's more.  The Uma Scout plugs into the phone jacks in the house you want to use beyond the jack  to which the hub is connected.  So it gives you more Uma phones.  The only thing that was different is you get a musical dial tone instead of the dial tone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That makes a huge difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just thought I'd mention it.  Now let's talk about Peter Moore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wrote a column today for Market Watch.  I'm trying to analyze this because Peter Moorthing got a lot of play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The pre-C of the story is he was the big guy at Xbox at Microsoft.  I think he was put a little bit in the back office.  I don't think he was on the forefront after a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm agreeing with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Then he said, I'm not having fun.  I'm going to EA.  Now he's going to run EA, Electronic Arts.  Why do you think it's a big story, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think it's a big story, but I'm noticing everybody else does.  So I decided to say, well, if everyone's following it, maybe I should rethink it.  My thinking now is that Microsoft is actually internally changing.  This is a complete made-up theory.  Good.  I like those.  But it's based on some-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A made-up theory?  Yeah.  I like those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  I'm dreaming this hypothesis, made-up theory.  His hypothesis of mine, based on the fact that he quit and it's big news, but I don't  see why.  I'm convinced now that Microsoft is going to roll out a branded PC in the U.S. market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And how do you get that conclusion from this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can read this in the MarketWatch column.  But anyway, how I got there is the fact that they just did this a few weeks ago to no analyst  picked up on it.  Nobody talked about it.  Nobody said anything.  But they did this in India.  They have a branded PC now.  Like a Microsoft branded PC.  Yeah.  You didn't hear about it.  If you read the dvork.org slash blog once in a while, you would have found the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did, but I stopped at the Captain Picard song, so I'll have to-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I read it every day.  What are you talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You must have missed that date.  But anyway, so they got this branded PC.  So I'm thinking this is like weird.  And now I've concluded because when people do stuff like this, they like, you know, especially  you want a test market.  And what better market to test than India, which is growing like leaps and bounds and,  you know, it's actually a really good place to test stuff.  And also this falls on the heels of the one billion dollars that they spent on supposed  support for the Xbox.  And I'm beginning to think that the Xbox was a test, just a test of whether they could  move this amount of hardware because they've always been in the hardware business a little  bit with their mice and their-  And never very successfully, but it's-  Well, no, the mouse has always been successful and so has the-  The keyboards, the keyboards do well.  And then they have a lot of other-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Remember, the first hardware they made was a Z80 card for the Apple II or an 8088.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The soft card.  Soft card.  Right.  And then they did an EGA board, if people want to remember, up far back.  And they've done a lot of stuff.  And now it's like they did the Xbox first.  The first Xbox, the first one was actually was a PC.  Anyone who's taken one apart knows it looks like a PC inside.  This newer one's a little more elaborate.  And I think that they're going to roll out because they see what Apple's been doing  and their Apple copycats, let's face it.  And Apple's been picking up market share so things are changing and maybe trending toward  the proprietary.  And meanwhile, they're getting no thanks or respect from their own customers who are using  Linux or selling Linux now, which they can't believe is happening.  So heck with it.  Let's do it ourselves.  Let's do a closed box like Apple does so we can use all our own-  We have a whole bunch of initiatives that nobody's paying any attention to.  We can put them all in there.  We can have the thing so it's closed in such a way we don't have to worry about all these  weird things happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And most general consumers would look at a box brand in Microsoft and say, oh, good.  Oh, that's safe.  That's actually true.  That's safe.  Oh, I can trust it.  I think so.  But here's the question.  Ladies and gentlemen, Will Harris reporting in from London where he was flooded out and  he's following along.  Welcome Will to the panel.  You heard what we were talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was supposed to be home about three hours ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is actually really your story.  This is the story of the guy leaving Xbox to go to EA.  But John somehow has twisted this into Microsoft doing hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I think the thing is that trying to get Microsoft to do hardware, that's surely  even more of a monopoly thing than just Microsoft integrating stuff into the operating system.  Oh, that's interesting.  You think they'd have trouble-  Can you imagine the Department of Justice letting Microsoft select boxes with its own  operating system with its own-  That's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's not going to happen.  What they can do now is they can do that, the thing I described, and then still continue  to sell their operating system to the other people.  They're not going to cut anyone out of the deal.  And then point the finger at Apple and say, you guys aren't doing this.  You just have a closed crummy box and nobody can touch.  And then they can point to the iPhone and say, look at how you're letting them get away  with this.  Nobody can even touch this thing either.  We're a problem.  We're similar to open source.  We do our own box and we sell the operating system to anybody who wants it and da-da-da-da.  I think it would bolster their case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what's funny?  If we go back a year, an interesting turnabout, because we were talking about why Apple doesn't  make OS X a software product-  Which I think they should.  And why they aren't, why they're hanging on to this hardware business.  And you, I think John C. Dvorak, I think it was you who said, well, all you got to do  is look at Bill Gates' wallet and Steve Jobs' wallet.  And you can tell, I mean, you know, but here you say now Microsoft wants to be in the hardware  business again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that's because I think the worm has turned.  Apple market share is starting to increase.  People are starting, these machines are getting pretty complicated.  The VIST operating system is no slouch of a thing.  People aren't flocking to it.  Linux is coming online.  There's a lot of reasons now for Microsoft to rethink their old strategy and they have  no growth mechanism other than doing something like this because they're dead in the water.  I've been saying that too, if you haven't noticed.  But this would-  Been saying that for quite some time, yeah.  Breathe life back into the stock.  Because I mean-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, their stock hasn't moved a penny in like three years.  It's just-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Microsoft stock never moves.  It's like old, old dependable, you know?  Microsoft is just always there, always doing the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but why buy, you know, investors don't like that.  Well, they don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But that's why Microsoft has done nothing, you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Anyway, it's a theory.  I think that's a really interesting theory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, it would make a lot of sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Then are you saying the counter to that, John, would be if Microsoft makes their own branded  PC, that Apple would finally say, OS X for everyone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I think that what we're seeing with Apple is what we're going to see with Apple, which  is now that they're gaining market share, there's no reason for them to ever take that  approach because now they're proving that, you know, it's working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One hundred forty two bucks, baby.  They're going up, up, up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's working.  And of course, the major problem that Microsoft is going to have is that unless they can hire  like Jonathan Ive, Mark II, how are they going to have- I mean, Bill Gates has already said,  you know, to me, say the D conference, the one thing I wish I had was Steve Jobs' taste.  I think that's the fundamental problem that Microsoft is always going to have.  From what I've heard from people who meet him, it's a shame he doesn't have Steve Jobs'

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  hygiene.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I address- sorry, I had to throw that in.  Where's my rim shot?  But about that-  So I actually address this too.  The fact of the matter is, if you've gone to CES over the past few years, have you gone  to any of those keynotes where Bill brings out these little prototypes that his company's  designed and he's done this for years, which also bolsters my case?  That's true.  You know, Microsoft branded prototypes.  They had one of a regular home PC.  They had some like media servers.  They had the tablet PCs all designed by Microsoft with their own color scheme and own design.  These do not look half bad.  And the Xbox 360 is not a half bad looking computer.  I think that argument doesn't hold water anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I disagree.  The Xbox 360 looks like one of those crappy Dell, you know, the inexpensive desktops.  It's not sexy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like Apple gets- I mean, look at the iPhone.  Apple's better, but Apple's an exception.  The fact of the matter is, Microsoft's not as dreadful as they once were.  I don't buy that.  They're gonna hire people and hopefully as long as Bill stays out of the room, they'll  probably get some pretty good looking stuff.  Bill's about to leave the room, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Permanently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's an interesting point.  More evidence.  I would hope it would work better if they made it from start to finish.  Their OS on their hardware, you would hope, would work really great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it would all be, you know, it would be optimized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you see what Howard Stringer said about Steve Jobs?  This is according to page six in the post, so, you know, take it with a grain of salt.  Stringer's on a panel with Jeff Bezos, Sergey Brin, Barry Diller, Anderson Cooper is moderating.  They're discussing how technology is changing the way people get entertainment news and  all of a sudden Stringer, who's the, of course, the CEO at Sony, says Steve Jobs is greedy.  He says Jobs said that Steve wants a world where only he makes money.  And then he stormed out of the room.  He's a little bitter.  Sony's not been doing that great lately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sony's been doing terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody said I'm a PS3 hater.  And I just want to make this clear.  I'm not a PS3 hater.  I think the PS3 is great, but I don't think it's great.  I don't think Sony's such a great company.  Yeah.  When have they ever created anything that's stuck around?  Yeah.  Well, and this whole deal about, oh, we're going to cut the price to $499.  Well, first the rumor comes out, then they say never.  And then two days later they do.  And now we find out that it's on a discontinued model they're not making any more of.  So quick, get it, because it's going to be gone soon.  So some price cut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It just lies down the lies in video games, isn't it?  Yeah.  I mean, it's insane that you can have the president of a company deny something to a  reporter's face and then two days later come out and do the exact opposite.  Well, maybe he didn't know.  That to me is just deceptive.  Maybe he didn't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's nothing short of deceptive.  No, I think the guy didn't know.  He didn't know.  I agree.  What are you doing at that company?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, it's bad either way.  Either he is a liar or he's completely out of touch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think he's incompetent or a liar.  I think the fact is that they don't, nobody, nobody would know.  One hand's not, you know, they're all over the place.  It's just a decision.  There's no chain of command that makes any sense.  It's just ridiculous.  It's horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, one good thing.  Jerry Yang is at the helm of Yahoo and everybody's saying Yahoo is going to have a new strategy  Jerry says I'm spending the next hundred days, hundred days focused on a strategic  plan.  I may not have all the answers, but as of today, I have a pretty strong idea.  And I just read some gossip.  It's probably somebody, some pump pump, stock pump scheme.  It's somebody in house.  Yahoo employees are very bullish to have Jerry back and they feel like Yahoo's big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I had a, I just did a thing on CBC this morning on Yahoo.  Is it going to turn around?  Well, you know, for one thing, their price earnings ratio is 50 and the industry generally  runs around 22.  And so they're overvalued.  They're overvalued.  So the stock's probably priced way too high.  But I, last night I had dinner in San Francisco and ran into one of the vice presidents of  Yahoo and told them I was going to do CNBC.  And so he, you know, couldn't really tell me anything, but he did say a couple of interesting  things.  One, there's a lot of young smart guys over there that don't mind telling the older guys  that they don't know what they're talking about.  And in passing somewhere along the lines, while he was reticent to speak in any detail,  he did say that, you know, people keep talking about us catching up to Google and nobody  ever references the possibility of leapfrogging.  Yeah, I know.  I, you know, I was almost going to laugh at that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  We could, hey, hey, we could take over the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google could be his.  I know I had, I had a bit of a like, okay, whatever.  I mean, this is not AMD and Intel here we're talking about.  We're talking about us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How could they leapfrog Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Unless if they had some new search technology that was better.  I mean, that's the only way I can see it.  And I don't see that happening anytime soon.  They have a better, actually even just, I don't, I don't know.  They just barely got their ad thing working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean this is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't see it happening either.  I mean, that was the comment and I just, you know, okay, whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's what you're going to have to do.  If you're going to leapfrog Google, Google's told the FCC they've put up the $4.6 billion.  That's the minimum bid.  And they've agreed to, to back it for a portion of the 700 megahertz spectrum band.  This is the band that is now.  I think that's the big story.  I think it's a huge story.  It's the band that was occupied by, now I've read one story said UHF stations, but 700  megahertz is the all TV.  It's all TV.  Yeah.  You know what's interesting though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's all TV and it's FM radio.  Right.  So where's FM radio going to go?  Oh, we don't need FM radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's cause that HD radio is working out.  Oh, it's going to be so big.  The idea of course, and this is a brilliant idea on the part of the US government and  the FCC is to move these broadcasters off the analog, inefficient analog channels, get  them up to digital and a different spectrum, and then take that very valuable low frequency  spectrum, which goes through walls on like 2.4 gigahertz and sell it off for big, big  bucks and the bucks go of course to the US treasury.  Google's basically stepped forward and say, we're going for it.  We want some of that.  That means they'll be competing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that's great.  What is the, yeah, this is not happening tomorrow though.  I mean, what is happening in January?  Yeah, but you know that this was supposed to have happened like in 06.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it was supposed to happen 10 years ago.  They keep pushing it off because the big TV stations are all crying poor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, neither of that, but I didn't realize about the FM.  You're right.  It's sitting right in the middle of that.  Yeah, it's between channel six and seven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They block it off.  I don't think they sell that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They could block it off and leave it on because I hate to lose my FM channels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, the world is not ready to give up FM yet.  It's bad enough.  We've got to go to digital television.  They're not, I don't think FM radio is going away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you know, they still haven't talked about how they're going to, you know, you talk to  to average show on the street about you realize that in 09, you know, analog channels gone.  What does that mean?  Yeah, exactly.  What does it mean?  There is no channel nine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right.  So here's, so here's an, so here's what Google says.  There are four things that they would like to do with this spectrum.  Open applications, open devices, open wholesale services and open, get this, network access.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sounds like Google.  Now, I think one of the things you could, you could make a pretty good case for is that  Google would like to go into the phone business, the cell phone business, the wireless business.  Hmm.  Interesting.  That makes sense.  Network access.  I mean, that's actually a good thing to try to interpret.  Yeah.  What, what are they, what would you do if you're Google and you get this spectrum?  Now, remember, this is great frequency.  This stuff is better than Wi-Fi.  You can go through walls if Google does.  Google's remember, remember we've talked about this for years.  Google's built these, you know, these containers with servers in them for reasons unknown.  They could be very well be the kinds of things you'd make for, let's say a phone switching  center, all in software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They must be stopped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think this is very interesting.  This is a very, I mean, look, Google's got the cash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does this mean we're, we're going to start having to sit through advertisements to make  phone calls?  I don't know.  What would you do?  A portion of your phone call today is brought to you by the good people of Coca-Cola.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google's smarter than that.  I think Google would find a way to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's not far from the, from the directory inquiries advertising sponsors, right?  Yeah, there is the free 411.  You wanted pizza in Fremont, you know, do you want to have pizza from Joe's Pizza?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, what do they do when you do Google 411?  Are there ads in that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think so.  Well, I think it's based on the, it's, it's if you want, you know, a pizza, it'll give  you like a sponsored pizza listing or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does it?  It's usually for crappy pizza though, like Domino's.  Oh, sorry.  Didn't mean to say that.  No, I agree.  It's never for like original raised pizza.  They don't, they don't have to advertise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's Nathan's hot dogs and what is that papaya place?  Papaya.  Graze papaya.  Graze papaya.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wouldn't you rather have a Graze papaya?  I think Google's sensitive though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They know, I think that if they do advertising in there, they'll find a way to monetize that  is not going to turn off consumers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think they're that sensitive.  You don't?  I say that because, you know, I've been complaining bitterly over the last, I don't know, six  months about the fact that I never get invited, personally invited to any of their parties.  Would they invite all the other media members?  They're insane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They never invite me either.  Don't feel so bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you're not in the area.  I got invited to the last Google.  And I complain and I get Google people and I complain to them and they all, yeah, whatever.  And they don't, it never goes anywhere.  So that's the lack of sensitivity, it seems to me.  They're not sensitive to my needs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's sensitive to Dvorak's needs.  I think it's very, I would love to read some tea leaves here and figure out what Google  is up to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think they know themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well they know it.  They're going to take over the world.  They know it's valuable.  There's so many things they could do with this.  Obviously the baseline would be Wi-Fi kind of network access.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Whoever owns that spectrum is going to be rolling in cash.  Whatever they have to pay for it, they'll make back in the first year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And don't, I mean, look, here's the other companies that will bid for this, Verizon,  AT&T.  Wouldn't you rather have Google win it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want Google to have it.  Because the FCC chairman said, I think it was on Monday or Tuesday, that whoever does  get it has to keep it open.  So it can't be, you know, if Verizon owns it, they can't say, you can use only our  phones on this network.  It has to be open.  Like they have it in Europe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's an interesting, this first came up in MacBreak Weekly earlier this week, but  here's an interesting idea.  Google buys a spectrum, creates a 3G network that you can use VoIP on, right?  Maybe goes in partnership with Apple or maybe does their own VoIP phones that use this network  for data.  And of course you can make phone calls on it.  Suddenly they are a cell carrier instantly overnight and they could make an open cell  network that would just kill the other guys.  Wow.  Put them out of business.  That'd be cool.  Exactly.  Who would mourn Verizon?  Who here would mourn that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, I think there's maybe another thing at play here.  If you remember, I think it was the Verizon CEO.  I think it was him or it could have been the AT&T guy written about this.  They threatened Google with, you know, these guys are getting a free ride.  You know, you wish they should be charged extra and all this other stuff.  Remember that?  Here's a way to deal with net neutrality.  That started the net neutrality argument.  But anyway, the guy made a big fuss.  You know, maybe the Google guys are, maybe they do have a little bit of a, you know,  kind of a grudge thing going on here and they're going to decide to, you know, you really feel  that way.  You know, maybe we can do something we can do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a way to deal with net neutrality.  OK, sure.  You want to make your networks hobbled?  We'll make an open network on 700 megahertz.  Yeah, free.  It's free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I talked to, we did the story on that back when it was happening.  PC Magazine or PC, no, I'm sorry, Popular Science was saying, you know, the solution  to net neutrality, if they do in fact get what they, if Verizon and AT&T get what they  want, then the cell phone companies or someone like Google can open up a wireless network  and say, here, ours is free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, competition, that's the key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you know, if you look at what's happened to the telephone industry, that's exactly  what the cell phone industry did.  Well they better.  Cell phones came along and said, hey, for 40 bucks a month, you can make all the calls  you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's a very exciting prospect.  I hope that Google does something like that.  And then you add, you know, then you make a device, now you take an iPhone, you open  it up or an iPhone like device.  You open it up, you don't say you have to be on any carrier, you just make it an open  device.  Maybe it's Linux based, who cares what's running.  But you put Google apps on it.  You put Skype on it.  I'm sure Google would use Google Talk instead, but you put a VoIP application on it.  Suddenly this thing is very powerful and works everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  And it literally, I mean, there's TV everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's another point.  It's good enough for TV.  Yeah.  Right?  Because that's what they've been doing.  We know it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That would be kind of funny to divide that frequency and then put TV on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love Lucy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We'll buy it up and let's put, I got an idea.  We have channel two and channel three and channel four.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's only one thing that could foil this evil plan.  That's New York State Senator Carl Marcelino.  You probably know this guy.  Is he, is he a showboat?  Is that the deal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've never even heard.  I hate to say this.  I've never even heard his name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  He's, he's proposing a law.  He's a Long Island Senator.  We've heard from him before.  Isn't he the guy who said you can't wear an iPod crossing the street?  Oh, he may have.  I think he is.  Now he says, and in that case, I would say, yes, he has a showboat.  Now he says he's going to propose a law in the New York State legislature banning text  messaging on cell phones while driving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm with him on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually, yeah, I agree.  Cause I've almost been run over by people texting and driving while driving.  Yeah.  And putting their makeup on at the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He says weird three handed women.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They got, they got the cell phone resting on their knee.  They're texting with their elbow and they're putting the mascara on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've seen people drive with their knees while they're doing those things.  I have too.  And that's usually what they're doing.  What we need to do is invent a little knee attachment for a steering wheel so you can  drive with your knees.  That's how the market should deal with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or the, or you see the guy, you know, the business guy driving down the street with  his knee, Blackberry in one hand, electric shaver in the other.  You know, looking in the mirror, shaving and sending email at the same time.  It's all good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The violation penalty would be a hundred bucks.  CTIA, the wireless association says we back this law.  We think text messaging while driving is dumb.  Stupid.  Didn't New Jersey already do that though?  Similar bans, actually Washington state is the first to do it.  Similar bans are pending in New Jersey, Connecticut, Arizona, California and Oregon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  The thing over here, you can't use a cell phone at all while you're driving.  You can't make calls with it.  You can't hold it in your hand.  Oh, that's good.  Even with a headset?  No, you can use a headset as long as you're not holding the phone to dial any numbers.  So if you've got like voice activated dialing or something like that.  You certainly can't text.  You'll just be like, you get like three points on your license or something and you just  get screwed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think in California you're not allowed to type while driving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So there's studies have shown that even talking on the phone is distracting enough.  Even if you have that idiotic headset on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People get run over all the time up here when they're bicycling along the road because just  because people reach over to put a cassette in the stereo or tune the dial.  I mean, basically the problem is idiot drivers.  You can't outlaw that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The problem is there are a lot of idiots in the world.  That is a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Facebook made its first acquisition on Thursday, Para Key.  Who did that?  This is big.  What's that?  That's a little Scooby question.  Para Key was started by two guys who started Firefox, Blake Ross and Joe Hewitt.  I'm not sure.  Do you know what it does, Will Harris?  What is Para Key?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's supposed to be a web based operating system.  So if you imagine it's like a virtual desktop, you can upload all your photos, you upload  all your music, you upload all your friends and your contacts and your email.  You can share as much of that desktop as you want with everybody else.  So you can share the kind of photos.  It automatically syncs with everything that's on your computer.  And the idea is that the way that Facebook has opened itself up as a platform, this is  the next extension.  They're going to take the Facebook platform as popular as it's been and make a real web  platform for computing in a way that's going to rival Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Facebook's stunning.  What's happened with Facebook in the last year is stunning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's insane, isn't it?  I mean, who would have predicted this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well clearly, Mark did because he turned down that billion and a half dollar offer from  Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wonder if he just got lucky there.  If he thought, well, we'll do something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's true that the one thing-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If he was just playing hardball, it turns out he was right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The one thing that makes it work is completely out of his control, which is that everybody  is using Facebook.  I mean, it could have been some other platform.  It doesn't have to be Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is kind of a roll of the dice though.  I mean-  Oh, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a heck of a problem.  The last rumor, and I think it was probably just a rumor, was that Microsoft was going  to offer him six billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, I mean, all the money now is on an IPO.  All the money.  What IPO?  Allegedly, Google was in the running to buy Parakeet.  The thing that swung them towards going with Facebook was that Facebook was offering them  pre-IPO stock.  Stock.  That that was going to make them an absolute mint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'd take Facebook stock at this point.  There's not going to be an IPO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why not?  It'll be bought by somebody eventually for two billion or whatever.  The IPOs are dead in this country because of these Sarbanes-Oxley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why does SOX prevent an IPO?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, for one thing, the first thing that happens with SOX is you lose 4%.  This is a conservative estimate, by the way.  You lose 4% of your profits just maintaining the records that you need for Sarbanes-Oxley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because you're now a public company, you have to maintain these records.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You have to do all this extra work.  And of course, I've written about this, and if you go two weeks ago to MarketWatch, you'll  find my repeal Sarbanes-Oxley column, which says a lot of this stuff I'm going to say  now.  I agree with you.  I don't know why we haven't said that.  It's a good one.  But anyway, and I got good letters on it.  But anyway, my thing is, I renamed it.  It shouldn't even be called Sarbanes-Oxley.  It should be called the Public Accountants and Auditors Protection Act of 2002.  Because it's got nothing to do with anything except protecting these guys who did a crummy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  job.  It was in response to Enron.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, which was fine.  They busted Enron without Sarbanes-Oxley.  So what do we need it for?  This is like setting up, you know, some sort of another layer for no good reason.  And the only people it protects are the guys who screwed up at Enron and other places,  MCI, who were the accountants that didn't do their jobs.  And now they don't have to because they put the burden on the company.  Why even have auditors anymore?  So the whole thing is a big scam.  How did Bush allow this to happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why didn't he veto that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I wonder myself.  I think he's in the pocket of these big accounting firms.  No.  Well, he's in the pocket of somebody.  But whatever the case is, this has really killed the public market.  Except, you know, that's why people go to the London Stock Exchange or the Toronto Stock  Exchange.  They reincorporate in Canada or Switzerland.  Wow.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very interesting.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that's why all these buyouts have been taking place.  All these cool little companies, they don't do IPOs anymore.  They wait till Google or Microsoft or some other sucker to come along to buy them and  then try to integrate them.  And this is going to ruin these guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  But I think if they were really willing to do that, you know, they would have taken the  one and a half, the two, the six billion.  I mean, the only reason to have not taken these offers so far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Look at some of these deals.  There's lots of multi-billion dollar deals happening left and right.  And what did Microsoft pay for that company?  It did nothing more than optimize advertising.  It's like four billion or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I do think that this is a problem.  But so you think Facebook would be crazy to go public.  So the only way they can really exit, their only exit strategy is a selling strategy or  they don't exit.  But why would you exit at this point if you're about to become the next Microsoft, if some  have said?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what?  I wouldn't even call them the next Microsoft.  I wouldn't even call them the next AOL.  That's what it really looks like to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In a good way or a bad way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In a good way during that era when you thought AOL was going down the tubes.  Remember that over at MSNBC?  Yeah, I was wrong, but I was right eventually.  Yeah, we all are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right or dead eventually.  Yeah.  Well, they'll have the advantage AOL had of that network effect where you can't leave  because all your friends are there.  Right.  And they're certainly building a platform that is very sticky and very attractive.  Yeah, I agree.  Does this parakeet, is this parakeet kind of like Google Gears?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it's more like the sort of, as far as I understand it.  It's not middleware, it's more of an interface.  It's more like the sort of flash desktops that we've been seeing.  Ah, okay.  I'm trying to think of the name off the top of my head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's a UI, it's not middleware, it's a UI already.  Yeah, yeah.  That makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's basically loads of web services rolled into a desktop metaphor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's the URL?  Do you have it for the listeners?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Parakey.com.  It's a private beta, you can't get in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, it's not even open yet and they bought them?  No, yeah.  Gives the computer the bird.  But in other words, it doesn't work.  That's just how good they are.  Here's my favorite story.  The 75-year-old has fastest home broadband.  We did that last week, unfortunately.  They found some, oh, you did?  Yeah.  Oh, I missed it.  It just seems to me that whether you find somebody who doesn't ever going to use this  one way or the other and they give it to her, what is the point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's the mom of a guy who works for Cisco and he just set it up for her because it was convenient.  But yes, she's got 40 gigabytes.  It's too fast.  It's too fast.  Oh, the internet's so interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although you know what I will say to that, as someone who's dealing with an 80-year-old grandmother who has the internet,  she expects it to be as fast as the TV, whereas when she clicks something, it doesn't come up.  Whereas when you punch in channel five on your remote control, there's channel five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, there's latency issues that they don't understand.  You have to explain to the old people latency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why they like email because it gets it and then it's there.  It's just like there.  They don't have to think about.  Actually, it's interesting because I just saw a study that said younger kids don't like email and are stopping the use of email.  The use of email.  Now, you're the youngest guy here, Will Harris, I think.  You're only like 25.  Do you still?  I think you've said this before that people don't use email anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, number one, I'm 24.  Okay.  No older.  I already have a complex.  He still has his whipper snapper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I still have my webs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't that usually what you say when you're 24 and somebody says you're 26?  I'm 24.  All your teeth in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All your teeth in.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think the thing about email is that like I think many people are just fed up with the fact that there's so much marketing and so much crap.  It's not even that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just so easy to write an email.  I get so much email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And also when you've got you don't answer email.  All your friends are on IM like when all your friends are online and you can see whether or not they're there to respond to a message.  You can just ping them.  Well, and that's how I use Facebook.  So why bother sending a message when you can see someone is right online or if they're not online, you just wait till they are online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I keep up with my friends via Facebook.  I just that one line of what they're up to their status update.  That's all I need.  That's all I want to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what I like to do with my friends?  I know this is abnormal and unusual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you like to do with your friends?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually like to meet them out and see them in person.  In person?  No, that's too weird.  You know, like, you know, text them and say, hey, let's meet at eight o'clock at World Wide Plaza and then sit across the table from them and communicate.  Actually, people use Facebook that way too, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You'll say what movies you want to see and your friends can see what's a table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a latency issues with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a big as table.  So that's they're saying that email will be in the future.  Email will primarily be used for business and that people will use other social networks as you do, Brett, like text to get together.  It's faster.  It's easier.  And Facebook, again, the Facebook comes up in this discussion because that's how a lot of people are staying in touch with each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess I'm going to have to get a Facebook account.  Come on, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Join the Facebook army.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did just do a MySpace account.  You don't have a Facebook account, Brett?  No, I don't do I don't do any of that stuff.  Oh, come on, dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You just got a my LinkedIn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do LinkedIn.  Oh, I keep getting invitations to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that's too businessy.  You would you would actually enjoy Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I joined Vox, but I did it as a pseudonym.  So I guess that doesn't count.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you don't blog on it, probably.  You're just there.  No, I got a real blog.  You know, you've got the work dot org slash blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The work dot org slash blog works fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where, by the way, you could see a great video of Jean-Luc Picard singing, which I think is just you know, one of the guys I brought on recently, this guy named Hopper Hopper and Harry Hopper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And he's a he especially he started giving us stuff.  You know, I could probably put him on the team because he all he does, I think all day is watch videos.  Yeah, he's an older guy.  He's already that's what you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You want somebody who's got a sense sift through all the crap on YouTube.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's what he does.  And I mean, we also the rest of us, we put videos up once in a while.  And I think maybe I don't know who to put the Picard went up.  I don't remember.  But but this guy produced him.  He comes up with some of the weirdest and oddest videos from all the sources.  It's really very it's looks like and I get we get more compliments for people because they can't go and find anything.  I go looking around on YouTube nowadays and it's impossible to find the good stuff.  This is by Gasparini.  I don't know who that is.  Oh, Gasparini.  Yeah, he's a London correspondent.  You should get together with him, Will.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, hook me up.  He's a fan of Jean-Luc Picard.  Apparently, the University of Alberta has solved checkers.  I read about that.  I think that's kind of neat.  Yeah.  What do you mean by solved?  They have a database with every checker position in it.  Checker game position.  That's 500 billion, billion positions in that wild.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My God.  And they've run through all the relevant decision trees.  And basically, that's it.  It's done.  You just look it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's amazing.  And there you go.  And that's all.  We don't know where pie ends and they've solved checkers.  They've solved checkers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And apparently, you can't do the way the program runs.  It's like, remember when the first computers came out?  Actually, the first computers came out.  And I kind of document this in one of the public speeches I give.  The first one was done by Berkeley Systems or Edmund Berkeley  or something like that.  And around 1952, 1953, there were these computers.  I think 55 maybe.  But anyway, in these things, all they could do,  they were analog, many of them.  And all they could do was play tic-tac-toe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they used to have them in the museums.  You go to a museum when you're a little kid  and they'd have a tic-tac-toe computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they would never lose.  You couldn't beat it.  Actually, they had a chicken who could do that, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you could tie it.  And you can tie this game.  If you play a perfect game of checkers,  you can tie the computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because checkers can't be won.  It can't be?  I don't know.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Checkers can be won?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought you said they figured out all the rules.  Well, wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, checkers can't be won if you just said that you could tie it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, if you're the player, I'm saying,  but it can be won by the computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, the computer.  But you're saying that you could always go to a draw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can do a draw if you play a perfect game,  according to that article.  OK.  So checkers has been solved.  This is a terrible analogy,  but this is relating back to the old tic-tac-toe games,  which were the same thing.  You can play it to a draw if you were lucky.  Yeah, you can't win tic-tac-toe.  You can win it, but you can't win it against the computer.  Only if they make a mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you could always, if you know what you're doing,  you can always force a draw.  A tie.  And you're right.  That's exactly what they say at this website,  that perfect play results in a draw, no matter.  But that requires perfect play on both sides.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that killed the conversation.  Ha ha!

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I was planning to retire and play checkers,  so that's it for me.  Yeah, forget it.  What about chess?  Chess hasn't been solved,  but we've got computers that play better than humans,  so it's kind of moot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the question on my mind to chess players out there,  if there's 500 billion, billion positions with checkers,  is it the same number?  Because it's the same number of things on the board.  No, because all the pieces move differently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there's more positions than there are.  No, I know, but think about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can move a chess piece to any spot on the board,  I think more or less.  I think it's what you think is less positions.  No, it's many more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's many more.  No, there'd be less.  Than 500 billion, billion?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I once knew this,  because I actually gave a speech on this.  So let's see.  The number of legal chess positions is 10 to the 43rd,  which is more.  According to a college-  Okay, 500 billion, billion?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Take another look at your zeros.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  500 billion, billion is 10 to the 24th?  Something like that.  I'd have to go back.  What is chess?  10 to the, what did I just say?  I don't know.  I don't have a memory for these things.  10 to the 43rd.  Apparently.  Chess is 10 to the 43rd.  Well, according to memory shot,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  there are 10 to the 80 elementary particles in the universe.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So there's-  Oh man, I got him off a deep end again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait a minute, I'm going back here.  You're two for two now, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm supposed to be the guy that keeps this from happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're the problem.  All right, patent law in Congress, very important.  Senate Judiciary Committee approved an amended version of-  Why is my cell phone making noise?  It's in airplane mode.  Is it you or is it me?  Maybe it's you.  Oh good.  Because if the iPhone's airplane mode doesn't work,  then I'm a deep doo doo.  See, that's, yeah, that's me.  The iPhone is really noisy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that an iPhone?  Yeah.  Do you know, I have the extreme Mac Luna alarm clock.  Funny story.  If you put the iPhone in it-  It better be at this point.  If you put the iPhone in it, because it holds an iPod.  Yeah.  When the iPhone starts doing that thing where it goes,  It turns the alarm clock on and it starts flipping through the radio stations,  which isn't so bad when you're just getting ready to go to sleep  at four in the morning when you're completely asleep.  But that's what they say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what they say when you dock an iPhone with a normal Apple dock.  It says, hey, this isn't made for the iPhone.  Should we turn off the phone now?  Because you may not like the results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have actually started doing that because as much as I love listening to the radio,  I don't like it startling me at four in the morning.  I don't want to hear all the stations.  Yeah. It's like a bad horror film.  All right.  Okay, guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just have to point this out.  Yes.  Sorry.  Atoms in the universe, 10 to the 77.  Okay.  Possible moves in chess, 10 to the 120.  Possible moves in Go, 10 to the 761.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why they will never solve Go, at least not until next year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And if you took a supercomputer with a thousand times the processing power of a current PC,  making a billion calculations a second, you need approximately three times 10 to the 103 years to check all the moves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  More time than's left, frankly.  More time than we got on this show anyway.  John C. Dvorak is now the vice president of Pod Show.  That means he's in charge of everything at Pod Show.  Whoa.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, you guys.  Get back to work.  We're not at Pod Show.  Hey.  As far as the coffee grinder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm the last independent podcaster here.  So.  Last guy standing.  Last man standing.  I plan to do twit to my death, my grave.  And that can be any minute now because it's killing me.  So how's things going at Pod Show?  We love a workaholic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think things are going well.  They're having a board meeting today.  So you notice I wasn't invited.  So I'm here doing this instead.  Well, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's good.  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They got a nice, they got a new system they're coming out with.  You know, I mean, it's one of those things, it's kind of like, you know, if you want to put your stuff on through their system, you're going to have free bandwidth.  It's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the deal, I think.  If, you know, if people start doing that, I think that's great.  They got like 9,000 people doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's the deal.  If you put, if you agree, do whatever it is that you have to agree to.  What do you agree to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you agree to put, you know, do you agree to let them put an ad here and there, you know, at the beginning, not interstitial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you share the revenue in that too, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you can if you have enough numbers.  If it's like 10 cents a month, they're not going to bother with you.  But if you're making money, yeah, they'll do a deal.  And you get free bandwidth?  And you get free bandwidth anyway.  I mean, if you got like 10 people listening to your podcast, you can do it through the pod show, go to podshow.com and you can get free bandwidth.  You just upload the thing.  The next thing you know, you get a pod show.  And now if you're like a WordPress user and you want to like if I just found out this today, because Matt and Millen are, you know, Matt.  Right.  Yeah.  I don't know why I can't pronounce the name, but photo Matt, he who invented WordPress.  I'm we're had a there's a little meeting like Voldemort.  He who invented WordPress.  But, you know, we had you know, they're having a big board press confab on Saturday, which is going to be, you know, unfortunately, the shows the shows going to be after that.  Yeah.  But they there's somebody talking about thing called Word pod, which is a plug in for WordPress that lets you link to like the twit broadcast or any of the ones like my tech five or any of these things.  And you can play it on your WordPress blog like you have a bunch of players on your Drupal thing.  I think those are plugins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, go look at my Facebook profile and I've got a twit player on there with album art for all the shows.  You really click the album and it's got a little player on there.  And it plays a show.  I think that's very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't know they had one for WordPress.  I didn't put some stuff.  I would have put a twit and a great way to drive on the blog that devore dot org slash blog so people could go to it and click on it and they can listen to me rambling and you know, whatever this meaningless blather.  What are you up to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  New York City Brett Brett Larson Fox five technology and environment reporter environmental reporter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  Yes, it's a new a new feather in my journalistic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you think global warning true or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I think I would have to get back to you on that.  No, I know I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's a reporter.  He doesn't have to have an opinion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't have an opinion on it.  I just report on it.  He's covered.  That's what I've been up to lately working with Fox and doing the tech thing.  It's been it's actually been quite a bit of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's amazing how many people left tech TV to go to New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and to get more famous and make more money.  Pretty much everybody.  Pretty much everybody else came here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know anybody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, we didn't report actually a big story, which is Jim Lauderback, who was, of course,  a regular tech TV, the host of Fresh Gear and our editorial director behind the scenes  and stayed at Ziff Davis.  He's an old time Ziff Davis guy for a long time and was did he was he kind of like the  editorial director for Cranky Geeks and DLTV 2?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Was he kind of the actually they really gave that job to Patrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK.  And then Patrick reported to Jim.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, Patrick reported to Jim.  And but Patrick, I think, did most of it still does.  I think most of the heavy lifting.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, hey, if you got a guy like Patrick, wouldn't you want him to be lifting?  Makes sense.  Just look at him.  But anyway, Lauderback left.  And guess where he went, where he ended up.  He is now the CEO of Revision 3, a little company that does some shows like Dignation  and and so forth.  He went to Revision 3 to work with Prager.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, you want to do inside scoop?  Yeah, what?  And I had the pieces together from different sources.  So what happened?  I can tell you what he's getting paid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ziff Davis got is in the process of being sold again or did get sold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, they sold part of the company.  Now they're not his part.  Yeah, they sold half of it.  So his part still OK?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I thought it might have had to do with that.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's his part wasn't going to be sold.  So anyway, he was the the editor in chief of PC Magazine, essentially.  The rumor has it, although I haven't asked him or confirmed this or said anything else,  but he got two hundred thousand dollars a year, which is I think may have been actually a cut  and pay for him.  But five percent of the company of Revision 3.  Whoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll take it.  They didn't offer it to me, though.  Isn't that kind of funny, though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Trouble making throwing out these guys salaries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's it's kind of like when Viacom bought CBS because Viacom was originally a spin off of CBS.  Isn't that weird that, you know, David Prager worked for louder back.  Now he's hiring those and starts a company and then hires him to work for that weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, a lot of backs, the new boss, Jay Adelson, who was doing, I guess, double duty running  both Revision 3 and Dig will stay at Dig and Jim will run Revision 3.  And it's pretty clear that the goal now of Revision 3, I don't know if there was any question ever,  is is to become an IPTV network.  We asked David and Jim to join us today.  They both were tied up.  They've got a board meeting.  This is the fun part about digging investors.  Greylock, their investor, and they have a board meeting so they couldn't be here.  I don't have a board meeting.  I basically do podcasts all day, all night.  I don't need a board meeting.  Will Harris, do you have a board meeting?  Are you bored?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Only when I'm really bored.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You are doing an IPTV thing in Britain as well, yes?  Yeah, allegedly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What's the status with that?  Well, I'm finding studio space and hiring people.  You do a show already.  Sorry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You already do a show.  What, do you tweet?  No, you do a video show, that game show.  No, that was a pilot.  Oh, you only did one.  That was like a one off.  It was awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That will be going into full production in September.  So we're outfitting, we're buying loads of DV kit and MacBooks and whatnot.  And now that you're...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I should say there's other big news.  He was in New York City last week.  Do you want me to keep that a secret or can I mention their big news?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can say, yeah, I got an iPhone.  There you go, ladies and gentlemen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He won't be able to use it.  That wasn't the big news I was thinking of.  You know that, right?  No, no.  Come on, tell us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no.  I mean, it's only big if you care about these things, which is that I got engaged.  He's engaged.  It's my lovely Alex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, congratulations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Congratulations.  Thank you very much.  You're all invited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We like to share the good news with our Twitch family.  Yeah, I was pretty chuffed.  That's a Britishism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was going to say, that doesn't sound good.  She chuffed him.  Will Harris is at Will Harris, W-I-L.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's only one L because they don't have room for two on the masthead or something.  WillHarris.co.uk.  And that's where you'll find out where's Will.  There I am.  There he is.  Thank you, Will.  We appreciate your coming by at late night London.  Always a pleasure.  Oxford.  Sorry, not London, Oxford.  We thank you all for joining us and we'll see you next time for another thrilling, gripping edition.  John, it's great to have you back.  I'll tell you, the show hasn't been the same without you.  I'm going to have to edit out about three hours of this show because there was a real lull in there.  But that's all right. It's going to sound snappy by the time we push it out.  Yeah, you're going to have to do something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tonight's the night. Harry Potter comes out.  This is it, baby.  Midnight tonight. Harry Potter, the last book.  It's already been blown out of the water by the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know. And it's actually got a set.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've had to avoid looking at the internet for the last week because all of the spoilers are out.  Well, I can tell you what happened. It gets me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think he's getting it headed.  I don't know what's going to happen, but I'm getting up tomorrow morning to go and get it.  When the last book came out, I was a member of this forum.  And these guys on this forum decided to change every single forum title to Snape kills Dumbledore.  So as soon as I logged on to check my private messages on the forum, it just had like Snape kills Dumbledore, Snape kills Dumbledore.  And I was just like, you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, I haven't read that book yet, so now you've just spoiled it for me.  Doing the twit, baby.
