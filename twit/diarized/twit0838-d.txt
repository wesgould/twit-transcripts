End time: 179.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It did knock down a lot of branches onto my yard.  But really, that was it.  One of our little trees in a pot fell over.  But that was the extent of the carnage.  So not too bad in Providence.

Start time: 179.94
End time: 203.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, my mom's, of course, as you know, just down the road a piece.  I was very worried.  Power didn't even go out for her, which I was very pleased about.  Meanwhile, I probably should say this before we even get started.  Best wishes to our friends in Louisiana and Mississippi and Alabama.  Please stay safe.  You dodged a bullet, Dwight Silverman.  I know people were worried about big storm in Houston.  And as you know, you have no drainage there.

Start time: 204.36
End time: 247.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, yes.  The early model run showed it like coming to the Texas coast and those quickly shifted east,  which always is a relief to us.  But we've been through it so many times.  We can really say we feel Louisiana's pain.  No kidding.  This is going to be a bad one.  This is as bad as Katrina.  Yeah, that's what they're saying.  And it's a test for this new levee system and the other things that the Army Corps of Engineers built in Louisiana.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Yes.  So hopefully it'll hold and, you know, hold back some of the damage.  But there's no way to avoid some major catastrophe there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Come here, Ant.  I had a couple of doughnuts.  Hey, no, no, no, no.  I am Ant Pruitt and I am wonderful as always.  Oh, and show us your biceps.

End time: 329.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, show us your biceps.  Because the camera angle is too low.  So I can't when I lifted it's not high.  Get out of the shot.  Again, I am Ant Pruitt and I am beautiful as always.  I hope you two are doing the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's funny because I call Sports Radio back home and they're like,  you're in San Diego.  I'm like making my daughter still suffer listening to Sports Talk Radio.  I'm on the 405.  You know what I mean?  Like I might as well listen to something.  We call in.

Start time: 388.34
End time: 392.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I hate to say this.  Oh, don't say it.  Being in Texas.  Oh, don't say it.  I'm not really a football fan.

Start time: 393.02
End time: 400.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't go there.  OK, it's better to be a non football fan than a bad team football.  So I would accept that.

End time: 402.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Particularly in the case of the Texans.  That's right.

Start time: 403.66
End time: 415.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And if you ever get stuck in a situation where someone forces you to pick fanhood,  just say you're an Eagle.  We're tough people.  Nobody's going to mess with us.  Eagles is good.  I mean, look, you just say I'm an Eagles fan.  They'll back off.  I'm like, oh, that guy's crazy.  And they're going about their day.

Start time: 415.80
End time: 420.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They won't ask any questions.  I understand Owen because he lives in the area.  But Alex, how come you're not a Patriots fan?

Start time: 422.24
End time: 457.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, when I was living in San Francisco, several of my best friends are from the Philadelphia  area and they were like, hey, we're watching the Eagles game every Sunday.  Why don't you come down and we would order cheese steaks and watch the game.  So I've been to an Eagles game now.  I got Eagles material.  I watched the preseason games.  I dig it.  And we were really good for a year and we've been garbage ever since.  But hope springs eternal that this season with a new QB and new coach will will turn  it around at least to be a little bit better.  But the Patriots, I can't actually tell you, Leo, what I think about them.  On Twitter because of the editing rules, but you kind of cheaters, cheaters, cheaters,  cheaters, dirty cheaters.

Start time: 458.06
End time: 474.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In short, just by listening to that verb is you are a decent human being.  And that's why you're an Eagles fan over a Patriots fan, because you are salt of the  earth.  You are one of man's men.  And I appreciate you.  So you can suffer with me along for another 10 years until we get back to being good.

Start time: 474.28
End time: 480.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's true fandom.  You got to ride the hype as you got to you got to roll through the valley.  So be a fan when they're winning Super Bowl.

Start time: 481.52
End time: 486.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's no but anybody can do that.  As a decent human being right there is a great answer.  I appreciate it.

Start time: 486.72
End time: 490.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We fell off.  We fell off real hard.  But you know, the further you fall, the higher up you bounce.  Exactly.

Start time: 491.16
End time: 496.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly.  Yeah.  Well, I hate to bring down the sports talk show, but you want to talk about tech?  Oh, yeah.  That's what we're here for.

Start time: 497.24
End time: 499.41

End time: 517.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You promised me no sports talk today.  I don't understand what this is supposed to be a tech show.  Did you see my fancy new my new little phone?  Got the little Galaxy Flip 3.  And got the big old watch that goes along with it.

Start time: 517.90
End time: 525.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I forgot that I'm in the house.  Leah, do you know what that means?  They have a vault of like just electronics that we get.

Start time: 535.48
End time: 558.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I do have some dead drums.  This I was not a Galaxy Fold fan, to be honest with you.  I didn't really like it all that much.  But this makes to me for a folding screen, this makes sense.  It's so little folded up.  It's like a little pocket square.  In fact, I could put it in my coat pocket.  That's a great size.  And then it opens up to be basically, I'll put it next to the iPhone, a normal a normal  size phone.

Start time: 559.45
End time: 565.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I don't like that.  I don't need the book tablet phone folds because.  No, you got a tablet.  Yeah, that's not saving me space.

Start time: 565.58
End time: 579.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That also there's something about the smaller screen that folds.  It's not.  It really worried me.  The fold to.  Yeah, really worried me.  I didn't get the fold three, but I did think, well, I should try the flip.  And this this kind of you can you can you can touch it.  It's OK.

Start time: 580.60
End time: 584.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How's the battery life on it, Leo?  I've only had it since Friday.

Start time: 584.88
End time: 604.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It just came out.  But I went through all day Saturday.  And I went to bed with about 60 percent.  Same thing with the watch.  And I have the watch.  I have all of the things that are supposed to kill the watch, like constantly monitoring  heart, constantly on screen and all that stuff.  So I think the battery life is fine on both of them.  And I'm pretty happy.

Start time: 605.12
End time: 607.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It wasn't great on the fold of the flip, the original.

Start time: 608.16
End time: 612.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it's still not as good as, say, an iPhone Pro Max or something like that.

Start time: 612.46
End time: 618.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Man, this is great.  The camera's nice.  The fold is satisfying.  Yeah, it feels good.  I was worried it might be too stiff.

Start time: 619.04
End time: 619.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It feels actually.

Start time: 619.86
End time: 644.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you can just peep your little notifications on the front of the screen.  See, these, if I wasn't so cracked out on Apple, this is what I want in my life.  Well, I'm trying to get uncracked, frankly.  I just need to track my child at any given moment.  So that's why they got me stuck in the system.  She's got air tags on her boots she doesn't know about.  You know what I mean?  Oh, wait, never mind.  Oh, so yeah.  The thing is, that phone is amazing.  And so I put.

Start time: 644.22
End time: 652.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If you get uncracked with Apple, then you get tracked with Google.  So one way or the other.

Start time: 653.44
End time: 674.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that's actually a good question.  In fact, that might be our first topic, because Apple's getting, of course, a lot of heat  with the invasion of the iPhone with the CSAM technology.  And that's one of the reasons I'm thinking maybe I want to switch over.  Is it as bad on a Google platform, on an Android platform?  Is Samsung spying on me in the same way that Apple is?

Start time: 674.56
End time: 683.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's still Android, and it's still it uses the Google's apps.  And it's essentially that's it's that Google ecosystem.

Start time: 683.44
End time: 694.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, of course, I use Google for my search everywhere.  So they know what I'm searching for.  My photos, all of them, 60,000 plus on photos.  I guess I kind of don't.

Start time: 695.86
End time: 741.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've given up on I've given up on the privacy.  Maybe that's the device.  I have so many friends that just are.  I can't believe you have devices in your house or listening.  I'm like, you carry your phone with you everywhere.  Yeah.  Something is always listening to you if it was.  If you're that important, they're going to tap into something to get to you.  If nothing else, they'll stick someone next to you and just listen to you.  So, I mean, at this point, I I've given away the privacy as long as they're not  like throwing all my pictures on the Internet or like read my text messages.  Like that's like an invasion of my privacy.  But for the most part, I've given into that because I need the positive things  that it gives me and it's free.  That's the other thing, too.  If you want privacy, pay for it.  Nobody wants to pay for it.  Right.  Do you charge me that normally for it?

Start time: 741.88
End time: 750.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I actually I like that idea.  You know, Facebook, five bucks a month or whatever.  But but no spying if you could count on it.

Start time: 750.66
End time: 763.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They won't even roll it out because they know how people would enrage because even  if it was an option, you said, look, is it more privacy?  This is the option.  They say, see, they're tracking us anyway.  So they're going to do like no matter what you do, they can't win.  So they don't do it.

Start time: 763.76
End time: 776.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you think, Alex, though, that normal people, maybe you don't know any normal people.  Do you think that normal people are even aware of this?  Or is it just, you know, tech insiders that really are worried about this stuff?

Start time: 776.24
End time: 817.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's actually changing.  I think the privacy conversation has shifted in the last couple of years as people become  more aware of tracking technologies and so forth.  We all have that weird moment like you say out loud, like, I really got to buy a grill.  And then the grill ads appear and you're like, oh, they're on to me.  Yeah, some of that's coincidence.  Some of that's the technology stuff.  But like, I think people do care more than they used to, because they used to care not  at all. But no, the average Facebook user to Owen's point isn't going to start paying  them. But like, you know, for me, given that I haven't been on Facebook in years, like,  you know, sure, I'm happy to pay for privacy, to pay for no ads, to pay for a little space  for myself. And I'm just going to be boring about this until I either lose completely  or the Internet changes a little bit.  But I don't like the way it currently exists.

Start time: 817.16
End time: 830.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But an evil IRC in our chairman brings this up.  Do you want privacy to be a luxury good?  No, I mean, that's the risk of saying privacy, but you got to pay for it.  Well, I mean, that's the way it is now.

Start time: 830.52
End time: 887.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the way it is now.  And it may not necessarily be that way for much longer once US regulators get hold of it.  I'm curious as to what the data experience is in the EU, where there are a lot where,  you know, there are a lot more regulations about what what you could do with this.  Get this. And I think the people I think the people are  do care about it.  One of the last stories I did for Forbes was a piece on digging into Tim Cook's  statement during the last  Apple earnings call, where he said they had a really good double digit  quarter for switchers.  And and I talked to Tim Beharon for this story, who basically said  that their research shows that recently one of the big reasons for Android  switchers to Apple is privacy.  So people more and more, I think, are paying attention.

Start time: 887.24
End time: 910.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But do you think now they're going, oh, that was a mistake?  That was a mistake.  Or no, because I don't think what Apple's doing really is an impingement of privacy.  Although Edward Snowden wrote a piece this week that was scathing  about Apple and security, saying this is this is a bridge too far.  Well, as soon as you put stuff on the phone that is monitoring, it's done.

Start time: 912.56
End time: 918.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, think about the lack of ethics we've seen from governments  using NSO group tools. I think we actually have a story.

Start time: 918.66
End time: 920.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We do. We'll talk about that. Yeah.

Start time: 920.54
End time: 957.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In the rundown and think about the rise of authoritarian governments  with a special focus on digital surveillance and kind of like editing  of what people can say and think.  It's not just China. It's not just Russia.  It's also Belarus and et cetera.  And so if you build out this technology, people will use it for ill.  And it's fine for Apple to say we won't allow that.  But Apple's not king of the world.  And Apple will apply normal regulatory customs to their products.  And so it does worry me, even though in the best possible use of it,  it makes perfectly good sense.  But, you know, no cybersecurity expert that I know or follow  has been anything less than furious.  And I think that's a pretty good data point against the corporate spin.

Start time: 957.70
End time: 1002.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Edward Snowden's piece in on Substack, the all seeing eye,  the letter I. Apple just declared war on your privacy.  You were talking about the EU.  This is the story that kind of blew my mind this week.  The European Data Protection Supervisor, which is nice that they have somebody  with that job title, the Edps, sounds good.  Independent agency attached to the EU, advises policymakers on all matters  relating to the processing of personal data, has recommended  that personal data like search queries and Internet browsing history  should not be used for the assessment of credit scores  and credit worthiness.  Which tells me that they are that they are right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's I don't get me started.  I've got a very nice credit score.  I can't get Apple card.  And the only thing I can think of.  Yeah, I'm like, do you know that I'm black?  Because my name's Owen. I sound very white.  I don't know why on the application digitally.  I haven't gotten one stone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've shown up for many jobs and they look me dead in my face, say, Omar.  I'm like, no, Owen.  Oh, because they just assume.  Yeah, because it's like when I call in places like it's like  Owen, did they start with the weather like it's so Apple alone?

Transcript:  So we are learning more, as you mentioned, about NSO Group and Pegasus.  This is the software that was used to hack iPhones.  NSO Group, which sells this spyware to the highest bidders, I guess, they say,  oh, we don't sell it to repressive regimes.  We're very careful about how it's set.  We sold it to, apparently, they sold it to the government of Bahrain,  which has been using it to hack activists and journalists.  The hacked activists include three members of WAD, which is a secular Bahraini political society,  three members of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights, two exiled, they're not even in Bahrain,  two exiled Bahraini dissidents, and one member of a Shiite Bahraini political society.  They were all hacked.  And we know they were hacked because their phones were submitted to the Monk School in Toronto,  where they were analyzed, and they found the evidence of the NSO Group and Pegasus on there.  So, yeah, I guess, you know, maybe the NSO Group didn't think this was a problem.

Start time: 1392.05
End time: 1414.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Were they just operating on a, if we don't ask too many questions, we don't have kind of moral culpability?  Yeah.  Because every time the NSO Group is in the news, well, it's always the same story, Leo.  It's always a government that we know is repressive or sexist or horrible in some other way,  and they use the technology to abuse journalists and activists and so forth.  I mean, does the NSO Group have a client that isn't abusing the technology?  That's a good question.

Transcript:  Well, I'm sure that the USA uses their tools.  These are the zero-click tools that you can send a text.  In fact, there's some examples in this article of the texts that were sent.  Here's an SMS message that an activist received in September after updating iOS 14.  It looked like a tracking message, a DHL tracking notification.  They don't know if the target accidentally previewed the link in the message while trying to copy the message,  but he was immediately suspicious and sent it over to the Monk School for analysis.  Another activist who was living in London, a Bahraini blogger, Youssef Aljomri,  is in London because he was awarded asylum by the UK because he was tortured in the custody of Bahrain's intelligence agency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So when they say that they're vetting who is requesting these programs, how good are they even vetting someone?  Apparently not.  This person could be working for a high-level person in the government.  They could have fake IDs, aliases, background.  They can make themselves whoever they want to get information from you and fool you into thinking they're a legitimate source for using your product.  There's no real way for you to check up on who's using it for what, really.  Really, if somebody wants to use it.  So you're just selling it, but at least that's your facade to say,  oh, well, we're doing our best ethically to make sure, okay, well, how come people keep using it in the ways that they're using it then?  Which is scary.  Yeah.

Start time: 1505.70
End time: 1522.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, we know about this on iPhones because the iPhone preserves the log.  Google's Android deletes logs of these kinds of attacks, so analysis has yet been able to show this happening on Android,  but I am sure it's happening on Android as well.  It's just that we don't have record of that.

Start time: 1524.40
End time: 1540.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway.  Leo, I have a question about that, the last bit there with the Google thing.  I'm not a security god, as you know, so I'm very curious.  Where do we stand on just the general security level of Android versus iOS today?  Is it close to parity?  Is it still less?  Where do you think it is?

Start time: 1541.80
End time: 1607.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It really depends on who you ask, doesn't it?  I'm of the opinion that they're pretty close.  And the reason I say that is as far as the way the system is designed, all systems have flaws.  I would say both Google and Apple patch them as quickly as they're discovered.  There's a problem with Android because older phones aren't getting patched.  But if you have a late model phone from Samsung or Google, it is getting patched.  I would say you're probably as secure as an iPhone.  There's problems with malware in the stores on both platforms.  There maybe is more malware in the Google Play Store,  but we've seen plenty of examples of malware in the Apple Store.  So their automated checks in the App Store are not sufficient to prevent malware.  On the other hand, I've talked to hackers who say I would never carry an Android phone to Black Hat or to DEF CON.  I'd never take it to a hacker convention.  They all say we use iPhones.  In fact, Phil Zimmerman, the guy who invented PGP said, yeah, I would never use an Android phone.

Transcript:  If there's an overarching story to these stories, it's that Apple markets it and pushes it.  And just like I think Google works hard to protect you, but there's no perfect phone.  And you're hackable no matter what.  Yeah.  If you're a target.

In a world where you've got doorbell cameras, all these video cameras,  and people still break into people's homes with a doorbell.  Like they're literally looking at themselves light up on the ring and they still just go kicking someone's door.  You think there's not going to be more cameras when you get inside the house?  Do you think that we're not already trying to alert people like to come and but people still break in?  So, you know, security isn't real.

Transcript:  If you're a business and you are not, you know, it used to be, I guess in the nineties, you know, you had a fax machine, you had to have an email address, you had to have a website, then you had to have social media.  In the 2020s, you got to have text messaging.  That is how the best way to communicate with your customers, especially now as we've gone through the pandemic, because customers have everything's on demand now.  You know, curbside pickup from your favorite restaurant.  And by the way, you know, they text you when your order's ready.  I'm going to talk to my doctor via Zoom on Monday, remote health checks.  Customers like this friction-free way of doing business, no matter what you're doing.  And that's why 90,000 local businesses of all sizes have turned to Podium, the ultimate text messaging platform.  It's great for small businesses.  If you've got one location, it's great for big businesses with a thousand locations.  They can help you stay ahead.  And the thing you can do everything with text messaging, doing business with Podium, doing business is as easy as sending a text, because when texts get opened, business gets done.  All your employees can text from a single inbox.  They like that, by the way, because they don't have to go to a lot of different places to talk to the customers.  And it's a much better, much smoother experience for your customers.  If the customer has a question, you send a text.  If when a customer leaves your business, you could say, how'd you like it?  Leave us a review on your favorite platform and you will get those reviews.  You just send a text for scheduling appointments, for deliveries.  Send a text. You could even collect payments with Podium with a text.  And by the way, that works.  There was a dentist in New York City who was using the old school method of, you know, sending out a bill in the mail.  Everybody tears those up, ignores them.  He had a million dollars in overdue collections, sent everyone a text payment request.  Of the million bucks collected, $700,000 in just two weeks.  Wow.  70% texts work.  Car dealership sold a $50,000 truck, took four text messages.  Wouldn't you rather deal with a dealership via text message than going in or calling? Of course you would.  Retailers are increasing revenue by allowing customers to shop via text message.  A jeweler sold a $5,000 ring, a couple of text messages, and even coordinated curbside pickup with Podium.  Our local, this drives me crazy, but it works.  Our local ice cream store sends me a text message saying, every couple of weeks, we haven't seen you in a while.  Here's 30% off a pint of ice cream.  That is, that works, man. That works.  Today's customers expect and deserve on-demand everything, even from local businesses.  You can stay ahead of the competition with Podium.  Podium has free plans for growing businesses.  Plus, they're big. They've got the power a growing business needs to scale.  They can handle it. Get started free today.

Transcript:  I'll give you one more example on top of that for the power.  As many times as I've been on the show and I give out my email address or things like that,  I have wonderful people message me. Some people don't like me, which is totally fine.  But it's usually like in the 10 to 20 range of after every show that I'm on that I get twit people coming directly to me to speak to me.  When I put my phone up there, it has been the first time it was 112 people.  Then the next show it was like 150 people.  It's how people communicate.  It's because it's right there in their hand.  And again, like they were all shocked I was actually applying to them because I don't use it for a lot of marketing yet.  I'm just finding people that like the kind of vibe that I'm giving out.  I love that.  And so I can put them in the twit group. I've got a section off.  We should get you a Podium account.  We should set that up for you.  We should do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And again, it just makes it easier for the person.  They're sitting there with their phone in their hand, and especially if you want to have a conversation, so more than just writing an email.  You know, you write an email, you feel like you've got to write a novel because you don't want to waste someone's time as opposed to, hey, I thought this point was pointed for whatever reason.  And you can reply back and forth.  It's just more natural.  It's nice. It's a natural way of communicating.  And you know, kids nowadays don't want to pick up the phone and talk to you, but everybody can text.  I'm not reading messages or listening to voicemails, but I can read a text real quick. It's good.  So I got a text from T-Mobile.

Transcript:  Great segue.  I think it's 47 million customer records now.  That's what T-Mobile admits to.  I think it might be the hacker says even more.  In fact, a Wall Street Journal interview with the hacker said their security was terrible.  I used off the shelf hacking tools to find an unsecured router, and I was able to wander around inside the databases for a week, exfiltrating customer information.  And by the way, what did he get?  What's he selling?  He got drivers, license numbers, social security numbers, date of birth.  He got addresses.  He got pins.  Here's the text.  T-Mobile.  Thank you, T-Mobile.

I'm not surprised to see consolidation Leo, just to riff for a second, because think about the consumer market for antivirus and how it has decreased.  You would kind of expect to see fewer players over time.  So the dollar amounts are a little surprising, but I bet the cash flows are pretty good, even though they're growing very much.  If I had to guess, just thinking out loud.  But yeah, I mean, eight billion dollars.  What do you think their adjusted EBITDA is?  Well, I would say closer minus 50 bits compared to the last quarter.  So we'll have to see.  I'm sure Lisa will have the details on the spreadsheet.  She's all excited.

Transcript:  That was 2010.  It was 10 years ago this week.  Tim Cook became CEO.  It's actually a sad moment in Apple's life because Steve Jobs wrote that sad letter saying,  you know, I always said that when I couldn't do the job, I would step aside.  And that day has come.  And of course that meant that it was time for Tim Cook to become CEO.  He said, I always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as Apple's CEO,  I would be the first to let you know.  Unfortunately, the day has come.  Steve had pancreatic cancer and was really just months away from death.  I hereby resign as CEO of Apple.  I would like to serve if the board sees fit as chairman of the board, director and Apple employee.  As far as my successor goes, I strongly recommend that we execute our succession plan and name Tim Cook as CEO of Apple.  And he said something prophetic.  I believe Apple's brightest and most innovative days are ahead of it.  And I look forward to watching and contributing to its success in a new role.  I've made some of the best friends of my life at Apple.  And I thank you for all the many years of being able to work alongside you.  I remember, and I sure you do too, Dwight, when Steve took the stage a year earlier to show the iPad,  we all kind of at least inwardly, if not outwardly, gasped at how thin and ill he was.

You can look at Tim's success and say he took it, you know, from a company that was worth maybe I can't remember, I think half, maybe 500 billion to two trillion, two and a half trillion.  He had two trillion dollars to the value of the company.  So are you skeptical Owen, JJ Stone?

Transcript:  So, I mean, Tim Cook, great cookies and all that kind of stuff.  But Steve Jobs, like went in a time machine, came back and said, this is going to be it for 10, 15 years.  Now, in five more years, if Tim Cook keeps this art going and I get something else thinner, faster, stronger or whatever, I'll be like, chop, chop, great job.  But Steve Jobs is just one of those men in history in time that saw what he saw, knew what he wanted.  And so you think Tim has been riding that wave ever since?  He is in a Tesla on autopilot with a destination pointed in the direction for him to go to.

Transcript:  I'm not taking anything away from Tim Cook.  I'm just saying that when a great man in history comes forth and lays a blueprint for you, your job is to not fluff it up.  Your job is to make sure that you stay on course with what has been provided for you.  And he has done that in a great way.  He's done that in a great fashion.  There's all kinds of twists and turns that he's had to adjust to that we can't see.  But I know that his outline is following what the architect laid out for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's my position.  Tim Cook was the right guy to take the job because he was an operations genius.  He has made Apple run like a perfectly smooth machine.  The test will be, you know, this is a hard thing.  You're coming off of the most successful consumer product of all time, the iPhone, right?  There has never been a product like that.  And it has driven Apple's fortunes for the last whatever years since 2007.  The question is, what's next?  And if Tim Cook at the helm can find the next thing.  And Tim clearly thinks it's augmented reality.  He really thinks AR, AR glasses, maybe AR with a phone and the iPad, but I think it's got to be maybe glasses.  He thinks that's going to be the next big thing.  Maybe the second bet is cars because they're putting a lot of money into that.  The real test will be if they can bring that to fruition.  If they can't, then everybody say, see, he's a manager, but he's not an inspirer.

Transcript:  Look, I think Tim has done a simply tremendous job.  I think there's it's very fine to say that Steve Jobs was a visionary.  That's true.  And all visionaries are important.  And there's, you know, as Owen said, only a couple that really stand out here and there.  But I mean, the running of a business over a multi-year period, a decade or longer, means that you've made so many decisions incrementally along the way that you really have kind of forged your own path, even if there were some product lines kind of under creation when you took over.  I think we should give him more credit because business is a team job and he's done a fantastic job running that company.  Now, I will say I think there's some hubris at Apple now and we're seeing that in the App Store fees kind of fight that we'll get to, I'm sure later today.  But I mean, he took the stock price from like 15 bucks a share to like 150 while expanding the company.  I mean, my gosh, that's that's genius on a level that I can't really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think he definitely was the right person at the right time.  You talked about him as a supply chain genius, and that's exactly what they needed at that time.  I don't think that he I think he has tried to or he has let the press give him a lot of credit for the watch as his like his product.  And it really kind of is as Owen said, it was in the pipeline before.  And a lot of the things that Apple has done, they have there's already been precedent for doing it.  So the M1 chip, which I think is really genius and we have yet to see the full results of being able to have the same chip in a smartphone and in a computer.  I think that that that had been done before.  Apple had been through two other chip transitions.  They know how to do that and they had been working on this for quite some time.  There's a lot of precedent for what they do, but they're able to push the precedent forward and make it relevant to the current situation.  And that's as much genius as anything.

I'm just saying Tesla was built.  You drive the Tesla.  It's on the straight line.  Now we're at the end of the vision.  It's full self-driving Apple.  Till now.  We're at the end of Steve Jobs's vision of what he had put forth on documentation where you could read things that he said.  We're at the end of that.  And you can see that with the iPhone.

I don't buy that.  Is that a crazy rumor?  That can't be.  I don't buy that.  Bottom line, Tim's a genius.  I know he's a genius.  He's a good guy.  I know you want to give him credit.

We'll get it on in the future.  I was really interested to talk to him about how CrowdStrike works.  You've seen the headlines.  I mean, God knows we talk about it all the time on Security Now and all of our Twitch shows.  Ransomware attack after ransomware attack, costing millions, holding businesses hostage.  And if you're a business owner, if you run a business or you're in security or a tech  IT at a business, you got to feel like just a matter of time before they come for me.  I know I do.

Do we lose our data or we give them money?  You don't want to have to make that choice.  That's why you've got to take the third option, defeat your adversaries before the fight  even starts with CrowdStrike.  You're not alone in the battle against ransomware.  They've done something very cool.  It's called the threat graph.  It's on part of the CrowdStrike Falcon platform and it uses information from everybody so  that you know, it's kind of a, you're all together in this.  You know what's coming.  A secure future demands a shared defense and that's why CrowdStrike's Falcon platform uses  this threat graph power.  It uses advanced AI to analyze, like I said, a trillion data points behavior from devices,  servers, cloud workflows, all your allies who are also using CrowdStrike to find the  threats to say, Hey, here it comes and stop them cold because we know the response time  is critical.  You know, you try to keep them out, but if they get in there, being able to detect them  and respond to them and kick them out fast means the difference between losing everything  or paying a lot of money or just surviving.  That's why you need CrowdStrike.  Their security platform delivers the most powerful set of tools in the industry today  to fight the most sophisticated cyber attacks.  And I love it because it's all delivered through the cloud via lightweight intelligent agent.  And by the way, I can tell you it works.  Forrester did a study.  They found Falcon Complete delivers 403% ROI.  That's worth it.  And by the way, 100% confidence.  CrowdStrike harnesses the power of every click, every action, every ally to grow stronger  and stop cyber threats before they can stop you.  Check out Falcon Complete.  It stops breaches every hour of every day through expert management, threat hunting,  monitoring, remediation.  By the way, they put their money where their mouth is by CrowdStrike's breach prevention warranty.  They guarantee it for Falcon Complete managed customers, a warranty covering up to $1 million  in the event of a breach.  Terms and conditions apply.  That says, we know, they're your partner.  They're your partner.  Gardner Magic Quadrant named CrowdStrike a leader for endpoint protection in 2021.  That's exactly what you were talking about, Alex.  We got so far beyond antivirus.  For ransomware, you need endpoint protection.  You need AI.  You need those allies to keep you safe.  Join the fight.  Experience the power of Falcon Platform for free right now.  CrowdStrike.com slash twit.  It's actually a brilliant way to solve this problem.  CrowdStrike.com slash twit.  CrowdStrike.  Because what we've built together is worth defending together.

We want them to know you saw this ad on twit.  Thank you, CrowdStrike.  Back we go to the show.  Trial of the century.  I'm calling it the trial of the century.  The Theranos trial, which has been delayed because of COVID and then  Elizabeth Holmes had a baby on August 5th.  The trial begins on Tuesday in San Jose, just 20 miles from the headquarters  of Theranos.  Of course, Holmes is being tried for fraud.  Observers, according to The Guardian, are gearing up for fireworks.  Potential witnesses include such high profile investors as Theranos former  board member Henry Kissinger, Jim Mattis, Rupert Murdoch, Riley Bechtel,  the former chairman of Bechtel.  They'll be hearing from the jury.  You'll be hearing from doctors who use the tests on their patients from  patients misled by Theranos results, including a woman whose test results  falsely signaled a miscarriage despite a healthy pregnancy, a man who was  falsely indicated to have prostate cancer, and two others who received  false positive HIV results.  She will not be tried with her partner Sunny.  And now this is going to be the thing to be interesting to watch, to see her  throw Sunny Balwani to the wolves and then Sunny in his trial to do the same  to her.  Both are charged with defrauding investors and patients making false claims  about the effectiveness of their blood testing technology.  The government alleges the pair defrauded investors by presenting ambitious  revenue projections of a billion dollars in 2015.  The government says in truth, Holmes and Balwani knew that Theranos had and  would generate only modest revenues, roughly a few hundred thousand dollars or  so.  Already a TV movie is in progress.  There's a podcast called Bad Blood.  There's a book called Bad Blood that you should read.  Karyu's book is very good.  They made a documentary out of that, right?  Lisa and I watched that.  And there's now a podcast as well which Karyu hosts.  He says if she's convicted and does significant prison time, it's going to be  a shot across the bow to venture capitalists and startup founders in the  world.  So I think that there are limits to how much BSing you can do, how much  exaggerating and hyping you can do, and how many rules you can break.  You agree, Alex?

Start time: 4159.54
End time: 4199.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You cover this.  So every startup likes to tell a positive story about themselves, but usually  they get around stuff by just not telling you certain things like what was your  revenue growth?  Well, we're not sharing that.  Standard kind of BSing amongst startups is standard and fine, easy to see  through.  But the case of Theranos is kind of on a different level.  So shot across the bow seems to be a slight exaggeration, more of like a  cautionary tale for how bad fraud can be inside this world of startups.  But yeah, if you're going to do medical technology, you've got to have all of  your ducks perfectly in a row.  Otherwise, you will get into loads of trouble.  But here's a tip.  If a medical company has Henry Kissinger on the board, don't give it money.

Start time: 4199.74
End time: 4209.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

There is again, I'm not going to say any names, Cassie's person, but there has  been rife fraud, lies and scams with many a company, many a startup, many of  the capitalists.  But since this has to do with someone's blood or health, their well, you heard  it like that is why they're doing this shot across the board to scare people  off like this is more of the medical institutions like, yeah, you can't mess  with people's livelihoods and their life like this and play around and try to  make money off of it on top of it for no reason.  That's that's where they're like, we have to shut this down.  We can't allow this to happen.

Start time: 4255.54
End time: 4286.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is going to be a difficult prosecution.  You have to prove intent, which is not going to be easy to do.  And apparently, based on the witnesses that the defense is pulling up, Holmes  is going to they've got witnesses on domestic violence and mental health.  Holmes is going to argue she was influenced by an abusive Sunny Balwani.  And because he's not being tried at the same time as she is, that might actually  work.  His trial is in February and he could do the same to her and they could both get  off.

Like at this point, everybody should go to jail because again, it's not your  normal business scam.  You know, women thinking they're a miscarriage and losing their child.  Someone thinking they have a disease when they don't like.  I don't care what you say.  That's both going to jail.  You know, hopefully because that's something that needs to be shut down.  Shut down.  They're not going to put you or me on the jury and put me on there.  No, in fact, I'm impartial.  I just want to hear the information and the facts presented to me on each side.

The story was so good that the media couldn't help but kind of give her glowing coverage without any expertise, without really examining it.  And as you point out, the people on the board were not medical experts.  It was Secretary of Defense Mad Dog Mattis.  It was former Secretary of State George Shultz.  It was former war criminal Henry Kissinger.  Those none of those people.  I don't think you could be a former war criminal.  I think that sticks with you.  That's one of those career things.

Start time: 4516.58
End time: 4534.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love this story.  I've said on this show many a time how Twitter could make itself a bunch of money.  OnlyFans is one of those things where they were being attacked by a group that attacked  PornHub the same way and had them readjust and clean up their site, which is good because  they did need some cleaning up and that did need to happen.

Start time: 4534.66
End time: 4537.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  There was binge porn on there.  There was non-consensual porn.  Yes.

Start time: 4538.52
End time: 4591.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so all that stuff, they needed to be cleaned up.  But then that same company is like, huh, if we can make the biggest site bow down, let's  go attack someone else.  And they just raise money and raise money and raise money.  Again, people are pocketing money on the side just to go and virtue signal towards something  else.  So you want to go after OnlyFans.  And OnlyFans is like, I guess we have to curtail to you too because if you broke them, you're  going to break us and we need to get this money.  But guess what?  I will tell you one thing.  One of the oldest professions in the world is people paying for services that they want.  And so when someone is trying to take away the service you want, OnlyFans is like, what  do you mean 40% of our constituents have left in three days.  Wait, what?  Was that what happened really when they announced that?  Let me tell you something, Uncle Leo.  I'm just saying as a person who has manned people in these streets, I had many a non-tech  people calling me talking about where can I go?  How do I download my stuff to put it somewhere else?

Start time: 4591.84
End time: 4596.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A lot of people were making a living selling nudes and porno on OnlyFans.

Start time: 4597.86
End time: 4605.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And again, they're at home by themselves doing whatever they want to do for themselves, which  is great.  But they all want to know how can I download my stuff to move.  It's not illegal.  It is not illegal.

Start time: 4606.26
End time: 4647.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But this all started as you pointed out, Nicholas Christophs, and we talked about this last  week, a piece in the New York Times, The Children of Pornhub, in which he accused them, and  probably rightly so, of having exploitation, assault, rape, all sorts of horrific videos,  non-consensual videos, revenge porn on there.  Pornhub's still doing business.  But what it did do is it scared the credit card companies.  And that's really what's happening here.  MasterCard and Visa, October 1st, new rules.  And I think completely, by the way, legit rules that you have to keep records of this  and make sure this is all consensual.  Maybe it's a high bar for a company like OnlyFans.

Start time: 4647.62
End time: 4690.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's even less of a high bar for OnlyFans, because OnlyFans, now for nothing, is more  of an amateurish system where most people are, I can't say all, and I can't speak for  everyone, most people are doing their own personal content.  You can see who this person is, as opposed to porn, which is like Hollywood is produced.  You've got staff, you've got all these things, production involved in it.  So it's harder to find out what's real, what's not.  OnlyFans is like, this is the mom and pop shop of porn, and you're just out here trying  to take away this revenue.  And all they're going to do is go somewhere else.  There's other places to go to.  And OnlyFans tried to do what they wanted to do to make money, but people were leaving  an exodus, and they're like, whoa, whoa, whoa, too much money.

Start time: 4691.24
End time: 4717.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then some people are saying, well, why is it these bank business, the credit card  companies, these banks are deciding whether Owen gets a credit card or whether OnlyFans  gets to exist.  Now, Alex, you talked about this on your podcast, Equity.  Tell me, tell me what's your take on this?  Because it was, was it the credit card companies?  And then what happened for OnlyFans to reverse it?

Start time: 4718.44
End time: 4739.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we know most of that, not all of it.  So it wasn't just the fact that MasterCard and Visa were changing their rules and so  forth.  They were not the only bank partners that were banks in the system that were not processing  wire transfers for OnlyFans.  And so they were being frozen out, essentially, of the financial network slowly, or maybe  more quickly, in my understanding, even if we don't have the whole timeline in front  of us.

Start time: 4757.51
End time: 4771.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, but a multifaceted problem that was by building over time.  I think OnlyFans didn't get a foul of various financial groups because for a while they  were smaller.  Then it became very big.  OnlyFans became kind of a cultural force that showed up in song lyrics.  I mean, it became part of society.

Start time: 4771.78
End time: 4778.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and there are legitimate people, artists, recording artists, and so forth, using OnlyFans  as well.  It's not only porn.

Start time: 4779.90
End time: 4817.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely.  And there was some unclarity in the rules that they announced regarding what was actually  going to be banned because it seemed like still nude images.  So it's that gray line.  And then, of course, they said, look, we're just going to make this change.  And then the entire Internet lost its mind on Moz.  I was very impressed with how much my Twitter feed was just complaints about OnlyFans for  a while there.  And then they flipped around.  And so my guess is they found a way to handle the banking side of this and also the regulatory  side that's going to let them stay in business.  But OnlyFans has become an enormous company, like, I mean, billions of dollars in revenue.  And it matters to the quote, quote, creator economy, which is a wide net, includes a lot  of different types of content.

Start time: 4818.32
End time: 4827.21

Start time: 4833.46
End time: 4848.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the pandemic was very, very good for OnlyFans.  The user base rose from less than 20 million to 130 million transactions, increased to  700 percent to 2.36 billion.  A lot of lonely people can't go out.

Start time: 4849.06
End time: 4855.87

Transcript:  Can't, you know, so a lot of people who are unemployed turn to it as a way to make money.  And that's true, too.  Right.

Start time: 4856.48
End time: 4885.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OnlyFans is actually a better deal than Apple.  They only take 20 percent.  Yes.  So it's a good deal for the creators.  Right.  Yeah.  Take notes, Apple.  They must have also come up with a way to verify that these are consensual, that the  participants are of age, all of that stuff.  Right?  Because there is some illegal stuff you could be involved in.  Often porn sites are involved in that they would not want to be involved in.  So I imagine they figured out some way.  You think, Alex, to get around that?

Start time: 4886.80
End time: 4912.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they have to find a way to be legit if they're going to try to keep adult content  on the site, because otherwise their entire business is going to get frozen out.  And then no one, even artists, can't take payments through the service.  So I'm still waiting to get the details of how their new banking system is going to work.  But when I think it was the Bank of New York, Mellon just won't send wire transfers anymore,  you're starting to have serious kinks in the broader kind of financial framework that makes  payments possible.

Start time: 4912.30
End time: 4926.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In an interview with Financial Times, they said Bank of New York, Mellon, Metro Bank  and JP Morgan Chase.  That's like those three big ones blocked intermediary payments.  So that meant the creators couldn't get their earnings.

Start time: 4929.00
End time: 4963.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  At that point, you have to make a decision about what to do.  And if you don't see a way forward with keeping most adult content on the service, you have  to cut off as much of it as you need to to stay alive.  What I'm really curious about is between that decision, which they must have made reluctantly  because they're making so much money from this, what changed in that couple of days  in which they figured out what they needed to do to stay in the business that they have  been in?  Who stepped up to help them?  How do they figure this out?  I don't know that yet, but I'm so curious what on a technical and financial and regulatory  side was done.  So if you know, tell me because my gosh.

Start time: 5048.44
End time: 5076.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So like there are certain chains that have more privacy built in them like Monero compared  to, you know, Bitcoin proper.  But I mean, I don't think there's enough people in the broader crypto economy that have access  to, you know, cryptocurrency in a wallet to power an OnlyFans sized platform.  I think it's a great idea to speculate and play with and tinker with.  But I mean, it's not there yet, Leo.  Credit cards work.  OnlyFans work because credit cards are ubiquitous.  Yeah.  So it's easy.

Start time: 5127.78
End time: 5143.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I mean, the difference is too that they charge different percentages.  Some places charge 10%, up to 40%.  Other places do instead of like an OnlyFans, which is basically a Tumblr stream of your  content, they sell piecemeal things where you sell videos or photos.

Start time: 5143.58

Transcript:  Don't people do this on Patreon?

Start time: 5144.58
End time: 5174.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, they do do it on Patreon.  Again, the problem with Patreon and with this is ease of use and ease for the creator to  give out their content.  So if I'm a non-technical person, I go on OnlyFans, again, it's like Tumblr.  I just post my pictures and videos and it goes into a stream.  On Patreon, okay, now I've got a schedule away to get you my things.  I've got to host the content somewhere.  At which point I might as well be doing my own pay portal and then paying someone to  meet me at a site.  So again, there's multiple other places to go to.  But OnlyFans.

Start time: 5175.28
End time: 5176.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This was actually a good platform.

Start time: 5177.36
End time: 5186.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, not only smart, it's what they had to do.  Because again, I made up a number of 40%.  But I'm telling you that people were jumping ship immediately because there are other places  to go to.

Start time: 5186.98
End time: 5196.14

Transcript:  Well, and you have to, you figure you have to pay in your rent and putting food on the  table and all of a sudden October 1st, you're not going to be able to, you're going to find  another alternative.

Start time: 5196.64
End time: 5231.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then, literally the conversation is, okay, you find this backup site.  Now I've got 30 days to promote to the people that are already on board with me to transfer  to this backup site and start giving them money.  And that's exactly what happened.  OnlyFans isn't stupid.  They looked and must have saw advertising for another site or another site.  They're like, wow, people are already pushing because I've already got the fans, Leo.  I've already got the community and they're here paying me.  So as you know, people that are willing to pay you are more fervent for your content.  So they'll do what you ask them to do to keep getting said content.  So OnlyFans did what they had to do and survive.

Yeah, but everyone tried to do derivatives like, you know, I'm going to open a seafood  restaurant that only serves one type of food called Only Clams.  You know, I mean, like people were trying to make all sorts of jokes.  But keep in mind guys, like Tumblr banned adult content.  It was a hot mess.  Patreon has banned everything.  How did Tumblr do after that, by the way?  That really pretty much killed Tumblr.  Have you heard of Tumblr since?  Absolutely not.  And Patreon has hard rules about it.

Transcript:  Yeah.  And then Patreon banned pornography and only allows artistic nudes.  So that's not going to be a fit for a lot of the OnlyFans creators.  And you know, if you have to go to whatever the other services that we're talking about,  it's so hard to bring your paying community over.  It's like changing newsletter providers if you can't take your newsletter list.  You know, it's a real impediment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What I've suggested to people is it's free to start up an account for you anyway as a  creator.  So start up a backer page.  Make the page.  And again, if you have to switch, you have a month or two monthly time to promote to  try and get some people over and start going to something else.  I will tell you my favorite video of all time is like when kids mess with older family members,  a younger girl was talking to her grandmother and she's like, Grandma, do you have an OnlyFans?

We don't have the larceny in our minds so much.  It required the geniuses of twit.  You guys are good.  You guys are good.  By the way, I do want to mention that Dick's GizFizz is seen every week on our live stream  and then is available for download to Club Twit members.  It's one of the many wonderful benefits of joining Club Twit.  Seven dollars a month gets you ad-free versions of all our shows.  That's both video and audio.  So you never have to hear another ad, including this one by the way.  You also get access to the Twit Plus bonus content feed.  That includes the GizFizz, the Untitled Linux show, Inside Twit.  We had a good conversation before the show began about massive donuts.  All the stuff that happens before and after the show is a really good feed.  I think that's a pretty nice benefit.  Of course, the best benefit is knowing that you're keeping Twit going.  I forgot to mention the Discord.  There's a great Discord too.  The Discord is super fun.  I had used Discord but I'd used it more like a Slack a little bit.  I'm a member of Discords of programs I use or programming languages and stuff.  But I think it's the future of social networks.

And yes, while we have ads, I would more and more I would love to see the support come from our listeners.  People like you.  And thanks to all of you who are already Club Twit members.  We really appreciate that.  It helps a lot.  For more information, twit.tv slash club twit.  As Joe says in the Discord, we are the benefit of Club Twit.  Yes, that's true.  That's true.  Let's see.  We did OnlyFans.  That was the hot subject.  Here's one that will be a little more geeky, but a little less sexy.  So remember, I have this theory.  Microsoft has this new version of Windows, Windows 11, which is exactly like Windows 10,  except it got rounded corners on the windows.  They're going to center the start menu.  It's prettier.  And I know exactly.  I could see this conference room meeting where the executives are sitting around saying,  well, yes, so Satya, we got the new version Windows 11, Panos Panay, who is, by the way,  now promoted to being on the executive committee.  Panos Panay says, you know, we're going to do this.  It's going to be.  But is there anything new under the hood?  No, no, it's the same.  It's the same windows such as we got rounded and such as saying, you know exactly what's  going to happen.  People are going to come on Twitter say, I don't want that.  Give me some improvements.  I don't want rounded corners.  You're doing what?  You're centering the start menu.  Are you nuts?  Why would you do that?  And Panos says, well, we got this idea.  We'll tell them they can't have Windows 11.  They can't have it unless they have a brand new eighth generation or later Intel processor  and they have a TPU.  You can't have it.  And it changed the conversation.  Now everybody's saying, I want Windows 11, but I can't have it.  I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore.  So the conversation completely shifted.  Right.  No one said, I don't want a centered start menu.  You knew they were going to say that.  No one said that.  They said, why can't I have Windows?  I have a my computer is only three years old.  And such you said, yeah, but that's going to create some upset.  No, no, no.  Such a panosis.  I got this.  Three months later, we'll announce you can all have Windows 11.  We changed our mind.  And then we've dodged the bullet on the centered start menu.  Everybody's happy.  And that's exactly what happened this week.  The Microsoft had a briefing.  They didn't invite me.  Did they invite anybody here?  No, they invited Microsoft anymore.

Start time: 6035.56

Start time: 6042.60
End time: 6051.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, you do.  You can't handle the 11.  No, no, you hear me out.  Hear me out.  Windows 8 was an attempt to do something that didn't work was to bring tablet and desktop  together in one OS.  Didn't work out.  All right.  Fair enough.  Windows 10.  Fantastic.  Big Windows 10 fan.  Use it every day on my gaming machine.  Love it.  You don't need anything else.  It could it could it could do some polishing.  It's a little like the start me is kind of gross.  And, you know, there's some things about it that I don't love.  And it looks like Windows 11 is going to have the same like rock solid base of like security.  And they're not changing.  It works really well.

Start time: 6103.56

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, there was one other thing, which is there's a redesigned Microsoft store and they're  going to have Android apps in there, which I don't think is going to get anybody going.  Oh, I got to have that.  I mean, I think it's a benefit.

Start time: 6114.94
End time: 6150.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a small benefit.  Android apps really look at this point.  If you're not stealing stuff from Apple and integrated into your system, you're behind  on that respect, as opposed to where Apple does things where the exact opposite, they  give you the same thing for 19 years.  And then they're like, oh, we reinvented waterproof phones.  Everybody's had a waterproof phone for the last five years.  But when they do it, it's magical.  Windows is the exact opposite.  Yeah, we we're going to do some magical stuff in the future.  But you can't have it yet.  So when you get it, you'll find out how the corners around it.  OK, so statically, it looks better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I guarantee you all of the talk would have been about centered start menu.  Like why?  And by the way, it's easy to put it back to the left.  But it's like, what's the point?  Why do you do that?  That's just what it is.  That just you're just messing with my muscle memory now.

Transcript:  So Leo, in this later this year, I'm going to buy a new laptop.  I've got a 2014 MacBook Pro and I'm not going to be able to run the next version of the Mac OS.  And I've been thinking about replacing it with a Windows machine, a game, Windows gaming machine.  And and I was kind of on the fence about it.  But having seen Windows 11, I like the way it looks so much.  Maybe they're going after the Mac crowd.  Yes. Well, it looks like a Mac.  I mean, it's very similar to the design language is very similar.  And so I think it's I agree with Alex.  I think it Windows 10 needed a facelift.  They've done it.  They've done it in a way that I think probably Apple should do with Mac OS.  They talked about, you know, with Big Sur, how how was it overhauled?  Not really.  It's still kind of like gray with buttons.  And and I think that, you know, Windows 11 is is a lot bolder in terms of like a facelift.  But it is a facelift.  But for a user experience, that's good.  Yes, Dwight, you're right.

Start time: 6233.60
End time: 6250.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But also it has better multi-monitor support and it has some gaming stuff to make games load a lot faster, which matters to me.  And I think it has widgets, which I've wanted back since Vista.  Oh, boy, there's an improvement.  Widgets are back.  Hey, hey, hey, you can talk all the trash you want, but I'm still going to be a happy, happy boy.  I don't care about any of you all nerds.

Start time: 6252.20

Start time: 6262.70
End time: 6328.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think every computer should have widgets.  So, Leo, let me add one more thing about this.  You mentioned the Android apps and that nobody, you know, nobody's interested in that.  We had a surprise.  I helped that weather site, that Houston weather site that I mentioned, Space City Weather earlier.  Yeah.  I helped them develop an app.  Their users had wanted an app, so they asked me to project manage it and we put it out.  And it and it came out just a little bit after the M1 Max landed.  And one of the things we discovered in looking at the analytics after it launched is that there are a huge number of people running this iOS app.  Doesn't work on it.  It doesn't look good on an iPad.  It's not designed for an iPad on their M1 Max.  It gets a lot of launches on it, which kind of amazed me.  I thought nobody was doing that, but it gets used there.  And I suspect that the Android launch on Android capabilities on Windows 11 may actually be more valuable than people realize.

Start time: 6329.11
End time: 6335.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right.  You wait and see.  We'll talk next year.  See how many Android apps you've installed on your Windows 11.  Six.

Start time: 6336.88

Start time: 6359.56
End time: 6385.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  To be clear, though, do we all think that the work that Microsoft has done to bring Linux and Windows a little bit more close together is pretty cool?  Yeah, but you still get that with Windows 10.  Carry me out though.  I'm not going to use that.  That doesn't mean that making the OS, generally speaking, more open to more technologies is a bad thing.  Okay.  And sure, you know what?  I'm not looking forward to using Android apps because I happen to also be, as Dwight is, and apparently everyone else here, an iOS user.  But I love the idea of extending the platform to be more open.

Start time: 6385.58

End time: 6404.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I mean, for some folks, it's going to be fantastic because some folks will want it.  And I think, generally speaking, having a more open platform is how Microsoft wins long-term OSes.

End time: 6421.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's different on the Mac because essentially the modern Macs are iPhones.  Yes.  They are iPads.  So it's not a stretch to put an iPad app on a Mac because it's the same.  So really what's happening is Apple's turning its Macs into iPhones and iPads.  Yes.

Start time: 6422.72
End time: 6429.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So they briefed Tom Warren.  Yeah, you're right.  It's a little bit funky because you can't do it in the upgrade.  There will be a Windows 10 and Windows 11 upgrade through Windows Update.  That will only work with eighth generation Intel plus TPU.  But if you have an older machine that is, quote, not compatible...  And this was part of the problem was, what do you mean not compatible?  It's going to run perfectly well.  It's an arbitrary distinction that Microsoft just said, well, no, it's not going to run on these older machines.  Well, now, in fact, we know it is because you'll download an ISO of Windows 11 and you can install it manually.  And it should work.  It's not going to say you can't install it.  Now, there is a big question mark.  They didn't mention this during the briefing, but Tom Warren says, after we published this post,  Microsoft reached out to tell us that systems that are upgraded this way may not be entitled to get Windows updates, even security updates.  Which would make it really not a good choice.

All OS is that I use seem to have ossified.  They have stopped really evolved.  I think about your iPhone.  It's the exact same grid of apps and the phone.  The camera has gotten better, but it's still it's not very good at phone calls.  And it's really great at Twitter.  That's the same phone I've had for like 10 years.  That's fine.  It's good.  You know, Windows is trying to find a way to be more open and retain its Windowsness.  I just I'm not that mad about it, frankly.  You know, I love it.

You don't want to hear no if you want to learn or learn how to do Photoshop.  You don't want to hear no if you want to do Final Cut or Premiere.  You don't want to hear no if you want to play the latest Far Cry on a computer instead of a console.  You don't want to hear no.  A Chromebook tells you no.

Actually, I see nothing but help wanted signs all over the place these days.  That is the worst way, by the way, to hire for a job.  You're hoping that the perfect employee is going to walk by, see your sign, and apply.  When you could go to ZipRecruiter, amazing.  You could go to ZipRecruiter, post in a minute to 100 different job sites because one post  on ZipRecruiter goes to 100 plus job sites, social media like Facebook and Twitter.  It gets your ad out there to everybody.  That means you're more likely to reach that one person who is going to be the perfect  employee.  According to Forbes, nail salons are hiring, gyms are hiring, moms and pops stories are  all set to go on an epic hiring spree in the coming months because they're opening  and there's huge ped of demand.  I mean, I cannot wait to get my toenails done.  I know you feel the same way.  Oh, look, you got green.  Did you get a mani-pedi?  I did.

You can get that job filled faster than you can imagine.  Millions of jobs are suddenly opened up.  Where do businesses go to fill these roles?  ZipRecruiter.com.  And you, you lucky person, because you're listening, you can try it for free right now.  ZipRecruiter.com slash twit.  There's another thing ZipRecruiter does that a sign in the window won't do.  ZipRecruiter's matching technology scans resumes across its network of millions of job seekers.  It will say, oh, this person's qualified for your open role, proactively presents them  to you.  You can review the recommended candidates and you say, that one's good.  You can invite them to apply for the job.  You say, that one's no good.  No foul.  No harm, no foul.  You just put it aside.  But this encourages them to apply faster because they heard from you.  And according to ZipRecruiter internal data, jobs where employers invite candidates to  apply get two and a half times more candidates.  It's so effective that four out of five employers who post on ZipRecruiter get a quality candidate  within the first day.  Actually, we use it and it's usually an hour or two.  And I always love it because Lisa's always skeptical.  She says, oh no, I got to fill another post.  Oh no, I don't want to, I'm going to have to do it.  I said, Lisa, just ZipRecruiter.  And within an hour, she's going, oh, look, there's a great candidate.  Oh, there's another great candidate.  It's amazing.  Right now you can try it absolutely free.  ZipRecruiter.com slash twit.

I've realized for a long time I haven't talked to the wrong person.  Yeah, don't talk to me.  I'm coming on the show hanging out with this guy.  I got no power around you.  Hey, what do you say?  I see you wrote an article about this, Alex.  What do you think about?

Start time: 7217.24
End time: 7241.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's so interesting to watch companies that we're saying come back to work saying, whoa,  hold on.  Apple's now saying, yeah, probably next year, but we'll let you know.  Yeah.  I wonder if there's a new future where people are working remotely in almost every case.  What do you think?  Yeah, I think it's going to be a great opportunity to see what happens in the future.  I think that is the case.

Start time: 7244.02
End time: 7291.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, so I talked to a lot of early stage technology startups, companies with two, three,  five, seven employees.  And in the last 18 months, they've all become essentially default remote.  They have a couple of people in city X and they have a couple of people country Y and  they just kind of hired where they can.  It's a hard talent market and folks are online everywhere.  And so to me, these big companies that are thinking they're going to be able to just  command everyone to start commuting again and living in certain areas are kind of in  the middle of the road.  And if they're in demand at the company, at the big tech company, they can get a job  anywhere.  And so I think it's a losing battle to say that you have to go to an office.  And I think especially for smaller companies that are raising capital out there, selling  shares to raise money to build their stuff.  Why would they spend that on rent?  It seems very archaic to me.  Here's another data point that housing prices in this area, which is an attractive, attractive  area, is going to be a huge problem.

Start time: 7293.64
End time: 7311.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Housing prices in this area, which is an attractive outside of the city area, have gone through  the roof because I think a lot of people who work in San Francisco are saying, I don't  have to be here.  I can live in Petaluma or Marin or Sonoma or Napa.

Start time: 7311.52
End time: 7341.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, to what Alex just said, the basic point too is the larger companies.  I'm in a 12 year lease, Leo.  I can't just not have people in this office because I'm a big company and I'm paying  these leases.  Smaller companies, yes, they can transfer.  Because they're already nimble.  Yes.  So for smaller companies, say, OK, we figured this out.  This is working for us.  Why waste money on rent?  But for your larger businesses and companies, it's not like a one week or one month.  They're not paying month to month.  They're doing 10 year blocks.

Start time: 7341.75
End time: 7343.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a bad reason.  But that's one reason.

Start time: 7343.38
End time: 7348.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I'm saying that is one reason why larger companies are saying come back because they're  seeing that money they're just wasting.

Start time: 7349.54
End time: 7369.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think there's also this kind of industrial age conception of the workplace that is completely  outmoded now.  We've got an assembly line and you have to sit there and you have to put widget A in  socket B. And even if you're an information worker, you're still acting as if you're on  the assembly line.

Start time: 7370.40
End time: 7374.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If your business doesn't have 10 meetings a day, what are we doing?  Exactly.  And so I think it's bad for work.

Start time: 7374.92
End time: 7389.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's bad for employees.  But bosses, and as a boss, I kind of understand this.  We want to look at our guys working.  We want to know that they're doing something.  And so this is very antiquated.  This is this is industrial era thinking, not information age.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I can't speak for myself, but as Amp Pruitt, I can say that I've been doing a lot  of side fun at home.  I'm on the dime.  Uncle Lee, I'm just saying I'm out here.  Did I mention that OnlyFans has 700 percent of the time?

Start time: 7402.62

Start time: 7405.64
End time: 7409.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did I mention that?  A lot of people working from home.  What else are you going to say, Alex?

Start time: 7410.32
End time: 7472.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, no, no, I'm just thinking about the workspace and getting stuff done and all that.  I used to live half in Providence and half in San Francisco and I was on the two-week  schedule.  Yeah, yeah, for years.  And so I literally lived the working in the office and then working at home dynamic.  And it's amazing how much more I got done at home because I wasn't walking to a bus stop,  taking a bus downtown in SF, going into an office, making coffee, talking to a couple of  colleagues, then getting started.  I just walked to my desk and I start work earlier now.  I've never actually never worked more than during the pandemic and I've never been so  productive.  And so to me, like the argument that bosses need to physically look at you is silly because  they didn't anyways.  When I was in the office, all it did was make my life worse.  And because we don't have offices in our office, we just have rows of desks.  It's a miserable place to be.  And so I'm annoyed it took a pandemic for us to realize that we didn't have to do this.  But here we are.  And I think if you look at the young tech companies, they show you the future of management  to some degree.  Google did back in the day.  And I think we're going to a remote first world.

Start time: 7472.92
End time: 7483.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, I'm trying to think of what the negatives are because there is a benefit to being in  the same room and kind of look how we are jamming together, you and me, Owen, because we're  in the same room.  Right?  It makes a difference.

Start time: 7483.70
End time: 7541.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Leo, in one of the things that's happening also is that larger companies recognize that  Alex is right.  And while some of them are saying, you know, we want you back in the office, a lot of them  are kind of preparing for like a hybrid type of work set up.  HPE, which is has moved its headquarters to Houston and before that was in the process  of building a new building had altered the inside of the building to emphasize collaboration  versus coming in and working all the time.  And so as a result of the pandemic, they've created a workspace that people want to come  to when they need to be together.  But it also has the infrastructure to support remote work well.  And so, you know, companies like HPE, which is a tech company, have been smart about it.  And I suspect over time, other companies will do the same thing because ultimately, Alex  is right.

Start time: 7543.38
End time: 7562.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and we should also say there is no one size fits all either.  There are some jobs here, for instance, engineers have to come here.  They have to do physical things.  There are some employees who want to work in on premises because they miss the social  environment.  So is it possible to have a hybrid?  Hybrid works.  Alex, do you have kids?

Transcript:  To finish my point, first of all, if you have a son, Owen's a great name for your son.  I suggest that one to you.  Secondly, I just was not Omar.  Not Omar.  I was just visiting my friend who works for Lockheed and Martin and his son is four and  his daughter is one.  And I asked him, I said, I said, where's your dad?  He's like, he's either in his office or the bathroom.

Start time: 7606.57
End time: 7612.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 7620.88
End time: 7706.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And for him being in Lockheed Martin, he still has to travel the world for certain things  for his part of his job.  But just he enjoys so much by the way, the kids and being home for his kids.  Oh, it's great for a father.  That's really great.  Because he's usually in a situation where.  And it's good for the kids too.  And it is.  And the problem I have in my mind is that it's also spoiling the kids for when he has  to go back because I've always lived a fluent lifestyle.  I've been able to pick my kid up every day after school.  I coach all her sports and stuff.  So and just being a president.  You're a great dad, by the way.  You can tell when you see Aliyah.  I appreciate that.  I only got one real job and I was doing that for her.  So but it does make a difference as opposed to her friends whose dads can't ever even  come to a game or practice.  And it does.  So being a parent of mother or father and being in the household and getting things  done and still being in the general area in case there's a family need or emergency  is great.  And a hybrid situation would be the best.  It seems more civilized.  Because it is great seeing you.  I've been talking to Ant for years.  Is this the first time you've met?  First time we've ever met.  We call each other at two o'clock in the morning.  That explains why I've never seen the two of you together at the same time.  I mean, we spoke at the Black Caucus.  We weren't allowed to join forces at the same time until now.  But I mean, I've talked to him so much.  Like, I feel like I know him and that's great.  And it's virtual and all the visual things.  Well, that's another thing that's great.  But being in presence makes a difference.  We do have technologies that for the first time ever make it possible for this to get

You know what I mean?  Like, so you're living in a world where you can actually see your friends, get into little  group things.  They're playing games together.  They're streaming.  So even though they're not together, there's a downside.  What is the downside to this?  Mentorship to some degree.

Transcript:  So actually, Leo, that's not that's not very not where you and I thought it was going to.  I was talking to the CEO of a travel technology company.  I forget if it was Travago or someone else, but I was like, you know, what's going to  happen to business travel when we're all remote?  We don't go anywhere.  And he was like, well, actually, it turns out that companies that do go remote are flying  their employees out for, you know, two or three times a year, kind of get togethers  to do this in person stuff.  And so this person, the CEO, I just forget who it was, actually was kind of bullish on  the future of business travel.  So there's another side to that argument that I didn't initially foresee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

I can zone out on a Zoom.  But when I'm in your face and I'm signing, like the person, half of sales and marketing  is the person's belief in their product, which is getting you to believe it.  And there is something to be said about being in the space to see that.  So maybe you're not flying out 10 times a week, but when there's a big deal to be made  or something impressive on somebody, you would want to put to my face to face.  So I understand why they could be bullies on it.  I guess we'll have to wait and see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the answer is yes, because they're going to have savings in other places.  Yes, sales and marketing are still going to do their thing.  And I don't think that's going to change up everything.  My remote argument is more about like, are we going to see 500 developers driving across  Cupertino to arrive at an office park to write some code?  Probably not.  But yes, there will be in-person talent for people making hardware and people doing camera  work and lots of stuff.  But I mean, I think the general bias is going to go from in-office being the thing that  everyone does to remote slash some hybrid component.  And I don't know exactly what that looks like.  But to me, the trend line away from the old world is very clear.  And that is exciting because I'm the remote worker for a self-based company.  I would like to keep my job.  So there is.

Transcript:  It's interesting to see the lag between virus information and the response time.  CES, for instance.  Oh, this is exciting.  We're going to have CES.  Proof of vaccination will be required.  See, it's going to be fine.  But I think we're all learning now proof of vaccination don't mean diddly anymore.  Well, especially with people taking it.

Transcript:  So as a person who's just recently traveled and it's my first time traveling throughout  all of this, some places are people, like I said, I was telling you earlier, people  like, oh, what do you want to do?  And I'm like, I came here to see you.  Like, we're going to hang out here.  Like we went out to some place and we're going to have a little chat.  We're like, we went out to some places outside.  But it felt it really did put a worry in me.  And I'm not a worrying person.  I don't really care.  I care about anything.  But the fact that I'm traveling with my child, I'm like, I don't really want to do much.

Transcript:  And by the way, I'm knowing I know a lot of people now are vaccinated who have admittedly  not serious cases, but who have Delta variant, who are communicable, who are spreading virus.  It doesn't mean you won't get it.  Well, you have to remember that CES was considered the first.  That's where it began.  Right?  Right.  It began at CES.  Correct.  We were very lucky.  We went in and Larry Magid asked me on Facebook a little while after.  Did you get it?  I said, what do you mean?  He said, we all met with somebody who had COVID-19.  We just didn't know it at the time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then RSA shortly after that in February in San Francisco.

Start time: 8050.54

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not going to be hospitalized, but I may spread it.  And that's the point.  I could go to CES, bring it back here, not even have symptoms.  Yeah.  And so I don't know.  I think this proof of vaccination, which we have thought is going to be better than nothing.  We thought that would be the gold standard.  Everything would be fine.  Everybody's vaccinated or tested.  I'm not sure that that's going to fly in the next few months.  We'll see.  Answers are not good enough for me.  The air is a little different up there.  Tall girl, tall girl in our chat room.  She's tall too.  She says, CES, hell no.  Right.  Thank you, tall girl.

That is the joy of CES besides the people in the drink.  Wait, boss, sorry.  The technological hands-on is what it's all about.  To be able to do that, spread germs equally is what we want to do.

Let's just shoot down to Miami.  So I booked this trip in December or November to go down at the end of February, beginning  of March, before spring break would happen.  And then February hit and Florida was just on fire.  And I'm like, oh my God, OK, we can't go anywhere.  I can't get on a plane.  We can't go to Florida.  And then the next month, spring break happened.  And Florida's numbers just took off from there.  And I'm like, well, thank goodness I was at least smart enough to not go.
