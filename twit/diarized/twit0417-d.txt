Transcript:  It's those guys from five by five. I don't like spitting on bands with damn. Benjamin was here last week. I should have been here. I could have chewed him out for what they do. What did he do? I'm just kidding. We love to have. Yeah. You know what? It's a small universe of podcasters and it's great to have everybody on and I shouldn't even say podcasters. I include you. Molly would you at new media types? Because always on is a real TV show, but it's done on the Internet. Yeah, they got a budget to. I still, I still think everybody up.  I don't know. Vimeo and Redbox instant say we're going to Crow cast HBO. Go says we're going to Chromecast. This is the $35 dongle. You plug into your HDMI port and you can tell it to play video back from an app or from a Chrome tab. Yeah, and they sold quite a few. You know, we were speculated. They're cheap. Why not? I bought five. Would you? And for what reason? I don't know. I don't know.  I have that many TVs. I have five holes to plug. Yeah, exactly. But I put one on three TVs in my house and it's great because last night, for instance, I was thinking I wanted to see a YouTube video and I started watching it on the Nexus seven and I said, wait a minute. I can just put on the TV. It looks good. The sound went through the speakers and everything. It really sounded good. If you got him early enough, you only spent about 11 or 12 bucks because you got that Netflix deal where you got three months free. So it was pretty much too good to pass up. I bought it the minute they went on sale.  We're trying to figure out how many they sold and an Amazon, a guy who works for Amazon told us that he thought they, you know, Amazon sold out within a day, actually within a few hours. He thought they had four to seven hundred thousand, four hundred thousand to seven hundred thousand. So if that's how many Amazon had, Google sold out right away as well. You got to figure they sold at least half a million to a million. Probably sold a million. It's cheap. That sounds about right too, because that's about the size of kind of the Roku audience. And I think that is the most likely target.

Start time: 420.36
End time: 434.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I disagree with this. You do? Yeah, I mean, I'm not going to get one of these things. I've got a Roku box. I got a WD. I got all these boxes already. And I don't need another dongle thing to stick in the HDMI ports, which are full. Yeah, you would buy instead of.

Start time: 434.36
End time: 460.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I totally agree. Yeah, I'd buy instead of a Roku, not with a Roku. When this thing came out, I did a little count of how many devices in my home already do some version of what the Chromecast does. And I think I got to like six.  I mean, not including laptops and phones and tablets and just like the TV, the Blu Ray player, the TVO, the Xbox and the Roku all do that.  But I still kind of got suckered into buying one because they all do it in some form, but it's not as easy as it should be.

Start time: 460.82
End time: 493.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  They all do Netflix. Every everything. My refrigerator practically does Netflix. Everything does Netflix. That's the default. Right.  But what it's doing is a little different. So, for instance, instead of the Netflix interface on my Apple TV or my Roku, I'm using them. I, in my opinion, much better, much easier to use Netflix interface on my tablet or my phone.  And then saying, yeah, that movie, send it to the TV. That's a better experience. And I'm not denying, by the way, if you already have a Roku or an Apple TV, you really don't need this yet. But let's say they do get more than Netflix. Let's say they do, you know, Kusch, the guy who.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Have you ever looked at the lineup of what they have on the Roku box?  Oh, it's thousands of thousands of crap.  But you know what they don't have?

Start time: 500.41
End time: 538.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  YouTube.  Nobody. Yeah, nobody really wants that. Everybody wants to be sitting around.  The only reason that I ended up buying the Roku box is because what happens is like my brother comes over and a bunch of us are hanging out and we all start talking about that YouTube video that have you seen?  Have you seen the blah, blah, blah?  And then we crowd around a little tiny phone and we try to watch it and we pass the phone around.  And so if we could just go flick to the TV for thirty five bucks, that seems worth it.  I still don't think it's a giant market by any means.  Like everybody's really portrayed it as a huge low cost disruptor.  And I think that remains to be seen, especially because apparently when you flick video from a mobile to the TV, it stays in the mobile resolution and there's no way to change it.  That's not true. Kind of a letdown.

Start time: 538.82
End time: 567.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's actually not true.  So if you're using Netflix, it goes to 1080p.  And it looks beautiful.  Yep. If you and I did YouTube last night, as I said, and it started at the crappy resolution and YouTube sensed it and went to a high def resolution.  It looked gorgeous. Five, one surround two.  So it senses what's going on because it's the Chromecast that's doing the rebroadcast and does admittedly, I think probably all of these streaming systems.  It takes a little while for them to notice that you've changed, but they do adjust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My wife said we didn't really buy a new dongle.  We basically bought a fancy remote and we did it kind of in a weird way.  You buy the dongle, you plug it in and now your tablet or your phone becomes this thing that your other dinky remotes for your Apple TV or Roku or whatever never really accomplished,  which is a more dynamic sort of send stuff, get stuff back, find feedback.  All that kind of stuff didn't exist on your crappy little remote.  So you finally got to use an existing device in a way with your TV that you couldn't before.  And you did it with this tiny dongle.  And that's if you if you think of it that way, that's the genius of this thing.  I agree with you, Leo. The whole the whole power of this thing is cheap.  Number one, I mean, it's almost disposable at thirty four bucks.  And number two, you can you know, the way you interact with this thing is so much better than some crappy remote with a couple of double A's in it.

Start time: 616.48
End time: 632.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Those remotes are crummy.  I want to do say I want to say something about the about the Roku three, which I think people don't realize.  Awesome. Because it has a feature.  They don't list it. They don't tell you about it.  Headphones in the remote.  Well, there's that that's a feature, but the feature that really gets me is the universal search.

Start time: 633.78
End time: 635.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oh, really? It searches across all of stuff.

Start time: 635.66
End time: 646.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, I didn't know that to be.  I know they don't talk about it, but it's right at the opening.  You go you search for like a movie and it'll show you all the services that have the movie and all the prices.  You know who else did that? Google TV.

Start time: 648.18
End time: 650.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, Google TV will do that, too.

Start time: 650.64
End time: 653.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My TV kind of does that, too.  I don't think it shows me the price.

Start time: 653.68
End time: 695.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I think that's the Holy Grail, though.  I agree with you because we know you know the killing is going to be on somewhere.  In fact, this really pissed me off.  You can find it free. Exactly.  I bought it on iTunes and then I found it free on Netflix or Amazon.  I think Netflix. And it was like, oh, crap.  I just paid 50 bucks for something I didn't need.  And a global search would have solved that.  Yeah. To give you an idea, here's some numbers.  The best we can tell Roku has sold three million units.  Most of those units around ninety nine bucks.  You can get a fifty dollar Roku, but I would guess most people buying the Roku three for.  That's a good box.  Apple TV. Hundred bucks sold fifteen million total life of.  So that's eighteen million.  That's a small market out there. It's not a big market.

Start time: 695.50
End time: 699.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  However, people don't realize that you can even do this.  So it's amazing how well it works.

Start time: 699.24
End time: 709.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah. Only about half of all smart TVs are even hooked up to the Internet.  Because they should all be hooked up to the Internet.  Apparently, my my Moto X thought I said something that I should pay attention to.

Start time: 709.78
End time: 711.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It has things to say. What Internet? I'm right here.

Start time: 713.14

Start time: 714.82
End time: 719.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It won't. I don't you know, it shouldn't.  I don't know why I did that anyway.  It shouldn't have done that.

Start time: 719.60
End time: 729.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It did. I. My mom bought a brand new TV that does all the stuff you're talking about.  She has no idea. It's sitting in the corner.  It's not plugged in anything.  Yeah. It's you know, more than half of the people who have smart TVs

Start time: 729.90
End time: 746.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  don't even hook it up to the Internet, let alone know how to use it.  It's the blinking 12 problem.  However, I think this Chromecast for geeks is amazing for court cutters.  You do you do a cord cutting show on this network, Scott.  And I got to think that for frame rate, this is a big deal.

Start time: 747.10
End time: 792.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, having been on frame rate and talked about this all the time  and having been a cord cutter for five years now, I think maybe more than that.  How long does it take to cut a cord?  It took a while. I'm still gnawing at it.  But no, it's it's this is the kind of stuff that interests me.  So when other people are hearing about a new show coming to a network  or getting excited about a new season of something on HBO,  I'm that guy getting excited about a new piece of hardware  that let me stream these things. Exactly.  And the minute I heard about this, I was like, well, no brainer.  Even though I've got these other devices, they're all working fine.  I really like the interface on the PS3 for Netflix, for example.  It's not like I'm lacking in that department for that particular app or whatever.  But I'm happy to have new ways to do it.  And to me, the power of search is where this needs to get,  you know, where this gets crazy.  When that happens, and we're really going to love it.

Start time: 792.94
End time: 798.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I agree. And I don't know how you do that with Chromecast,  because it's kind of not a unified solution.  Every app is its own master.

Start time: 799.36
End time: 837.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think this is even targeted to geeks, though.  I think the price is really such a such a big factor here.  Thirty five dollars for you know, Netflix has what?  The 40 million subscribers.  This potentially opens up that market.  I think the mainstream is starting to hear a lot more about Netflix,  but they don't have the device to to play it on.  And thirty five dollars, you know, this is a perfect birthday gift, Christmas gift.  You know, these will be flying around.  These are easy to pick up if Netflix renews that  either a three month or a one month offer.  That was a good deal.  It's going to be hugely mainstream.

Start time: 837.32
End time: 843.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is anybody noticing that Netflix is losing a lot of their business?  A lot of studios are pulling out.  They're going to do their own thing.

Start time: 843.48
End time: 872.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  In fact, Amazon Prime just got Epix, which is going to be a big problem for Netflix.  Why do you think they're doing arrested development and House of Cards?  And I mean, and Orange is the New Black.  They realize they've got to create original exclusive content.  The good news is if you're Netflix,  you know, they estimated in their last quarterly earnings call,  they got 600000 new subscribers to watch Arrested Development.  The good news is these special shows are paying for themselves.  What was it, Scott?  A hundred million dollars to make House of Cards.  It was very expensive.

Start time: 872.20
End time: 932.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hundred and fifty something like that.  And it looks I was just talking to somebody about this this morning.  It looks like a HBO production.  It looks like a big production.  Yeah, it's not like 13 Emmy nominations.  Yeah, and I was reading reading something on the verge.  They were talking about in terms of like production value, effects value,  post-production, cinematography, all this stuff,  that they are either on par with what cable is doing or in a lot of cases  better than what any networks are doing.  Mainstream networks are trying to put together comparing it to say  under the dome, which is kind of cool.  And people are into that.  But under the dome has this weird kind of  everyone's too pretty and clean and kind of fake looking kind of quality to it.  These guys are digging deep into what people really want, which is, you know,  gritty and great looking and and they're pulling it off.  I think that's where they're banking.  Everything is original programming.  I mean, it's good. Great to have a back catalog.  It's great to have all this other extra content.  But I think original programming is where Netflix ends up.  I think that's where they think they end up winning this fight.  I mean, it's a huge promotional vehicle.

Start time: 932.46

Transcript:  People will talk about House of Cards.  It's up for for what? Emmys.

Start time: 937.44
End time: 944.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  13 Emmys. So imagine the conversation.  Oh, oh, Arrested Development. They're making it again.  Yes, honey. But we need to have Netflix.

Start time: 944.62
End time: 945.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, what do we do?

Start time: 945.86
End time: 955.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, here's a thirty five dollar device and it gets us three bucks of Netflix  and we can watch House of Cards.  That's a pretty much a no brainer.  Yeah, you're a big or Arrested Development.  If you're a big Arrested Development.

Start time: 955.64
End time: 970.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And nobody's saying, oh, did you hear that Netflix lost the stars deal?  No, I mean, that's not we are, but we just did.  But the mainstream hears about House of Cards.  They don't hear about the stars deal or them losing a few blockbuster movies.

Start time: 971.00
End time: 1002.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they definitely hear about that.  But do you think they actually really hear about the thirty five dollars  little jobby that they can plug into the switcheroo?  Make the thing go to the other thing.  If you you switch it from the thing, I mean, versus, oh, I can watch that  on my laptop or my TV does that or what my Xbox does that.  I still think Apple TV and Xbox have a stronger.  Well, they have better brand recognition, for one thing.  I think Chromecast makes no sense to anybody.  I feel like that's so much likely, so much more likely to sell to people  who want to watch YouTube on a TV better than anybody else.

Start time: 1002.70
End time: 1020.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's up to how Google plays it, because now it's still early.  They don't have the inventory to fill out any any sales right now.  But if they ramp up the promotional vehicle, I think is I don't  I'm not really sure what's in it for Google here because they can't  really be making much margin.  They watch everything that you watch.

Start time: 1020.74
End time: 1028.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I feel like Google will play it exactly the way they play everything else,  which is like release the thing into the world, let it be free,  and never speak of it again.

Start time: 1029.22
End time: 1035.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that will be interesting.  That's a possibility.  But do you think there's any meaning to the fact  there's a little microphone in each one of those devices?

Start time: 1035.94
End time: 1039.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  There isn't, John, stop it.  But they don't need to because they're seeing everything you watch.

Start time: 1039.84
End time: 1046.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Already, Google now, when I do, so you're telling me that if you go to Netflix  and start watching something, it's going to phone home.

Start time: 1046.74
End time: 1101.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, of course it is.  Not just to Netflix, to Google and the NSA.  And let me point out, when I launched my Google Now on my Wi-Fi,  my Wi-Fi connected phone, it says, oh, I see you have a TV on this network.  What are you watching?  And then asked me to press record and will listen to the TV show  and tell me the show and then give me more stuff about it.  They're very much playing that game.  And that's money for Google. Absolutely. Huh?  But I don't. Well, do you care? I don't care.  I don't. Well, I.  Who cares if Google knows what you watch on TV?  Unless it's homoerotic stuff.  I guess I don't even know what that means.  So I think the play is kind of interesting as a niche play,  because the way Chromecast really kind of plays itself is  every app developer will put it into an app.  So when Amazon streaming, for instance, puts a Chromecast,  that's going to be huge.  When you know, when Frog Pants, the morning stream, has a Chromecast button

Start time: 1101.64
End time: 1107.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  in its app. Oh, enormous game changer.  Well, I don't know about that, but it but we're going to.

Start time: 1107.28
End time: 1121.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  But we're going to have Chromecast buttons in our app.  Cush, the guy who did Clockwork Mod is working on it for a Twitter app.  So what happens there is each of these slices starts to say,  oh, I want it for this reason, for that reason, for this reason.  I think that's an interesting market. You're right.

Start time: 1121.90
End time: 1161.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Mark, Mark makes a good point about the way Google does this.  They didn't do an ad, you know, on NBC on Tuesday night.  They didn't do like an Apple play with this, where they make a bigger deal  out of it and spend a bunch of money on that.  They literally got up and showed it at a very small  conference on their own campus in front of a very small group  that was streamed to a bunch of us nerds. And that was your audience.  They didn't go further than that.  So now, in a way, we're part of their plan.  So we we start evangelizing and we start telling our, you know, telling people.  And then they'll make that decision that Molly's worried about,  whether they whether they put it out in the wild and just forget about it.  Google TV style, or if they really support it.  It's all about us from now.

Transcript:  But I think it's a new Google and it's a hardware manufacturer.  Same company. The next Google.  Yes. The Nexus seven is a tablet that kicks butt in that size.  There's nothing close, especially for 229 bucks.  The Moto X, their first Motorola phone as a Google company, is a phenomenal phone.  It's not as good as this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's pointing to my HTC one.  Yes, I'm pointing to his HTC one, which may be.  I think you should get you should keep this phone and you should give me this phone.  Oh, that's his play. That's what he's doing.

Transcript:  I love the screen feature that the screen just kind of lights up lightly.

Start time: 1200.48
End time: 1238.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So what they did with the Moto X is the AMOLED screen, which you can light up parts of.  So if it's been in my pocket for a while and I pull it out,  it will light up what time it is thinking, maybe you want to know what without me  telling it to. And it will also show notifications.  And without actually launching the phone, I can I can swipe the notification.  I don't have any or I would have I could show you this,  but I would swipe the notification, I could read it, put it away.  And it does that without turning on the whole screen because it's AMOLED.  It could turn on a little bit of the screen.  So it's battery.  The battery life is excellent so far.  It's about 15, 16 hours, even with heavy use, because I've been, you know,  I'm reviewing it for Tuesday and I've been using it like crazy.

If you want a 10 inch, I maybe go with a 10 inch iPad.  But by the Nexus 7 for 229 bucks is a very compelling product.  The point being, Google can make and we've mentioned this last week,  but Google can make products without making any money on it  because they make money on the back end, just like Amazon.  It makes it very hard for Apple and others to compete with Samsung.  And Apple have to make money on the hardware up front.

Transcript:  Well, I think we could draw a conclusion here that software companies and services  companies say we need to make hardware.  Hardware companies say we need to have retail outlets.  Apple is really the model for all of this.

Start time: 1509.70

Start time: 1575.56
End time: 1587.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  either. I did the column on this and I calculated the amount of inventory  they had left over.  They would have dumped it like HP did at the proper price for these things.  One hundred and fifty bucks.  They would have gotten nine hundred million.  Exactly what they wrote off.

Start time: 1588.34

Start time: 1599.02
End time: 1608.90

Start time: 1626.98
End time: 1688.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me tell you, the crowd that loves pros.  And here's the problem.  They're not big enough to be a market, but they're allowed to group.  And that is artists and illustrators.  So I've got back here, you know, a big way, I spent way too much money on.  We do what we can to do what we do as digital artists.  And it's great.  But the surface pro turned out to be a really  comparatively inexpensive way to get a stylus and a tablet and to do your work.  And you went to a cabin, didn't you, with a surface?  No, it wasn't me. But like my friends, my friends who do it.  A micro hooligan penny arcade, for example, is totally sold.  That's who uses it for everything.  It's great for that kind of portability.  But some people are just straight up using it and making it their replacement  digital art device.  That crowds awesome.  And they're loud and outspoken and all that.  They are not big enough.  And they're the only group that I've heard really positive things  about the pro from having not used them in my reserve judgment until I go  in on these hot stores that John's talking about.  But the point is that they're they're finding it some niches with this thing,  but those niches aren't big enough to take them to where they want to be,  where they have to be.

Start time: 1688.62
End time: 1773.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Microsoft found the same niches with the early tablets.  Remember, they they Microsoft for 10 years, flogged tablets,  couldn't get anybody to buy them except doctors and, you know, a few narrow niche  uses, but they were very successful there.  And then Apple comes along and says, well, wait a minute, reinvents it.  And finds a market.  I wonder.  I don't know.  I wonder.  I feel like we're at a transit, a very transitional time and getting back to TV.  Of course, the big Time Warner CBS kerfuffle.  Time Warner says CBS wanted a 600% increase in L.A., Dallas, New York to carry CBS channels.  Time Warner said, no, we're going to protect our users and our bottom line.  And they pull CBS off not only that, to add insult to injury.  If you're a Time Warner Internet subscriber, you can't go to CBS.com and watch full episodes  because CBS blocked it.  So this is a nasty fight.  And to me, no, there's no winners here.  There's losers.  The loser is the consumer, right?  Yep.  But I think it's the battle of the dinosaurs.  It's the end of times for these guys.  And they're fighting over the.  Well, that's why they want the more money.  It's almost done.  Isn't it? Isn't broadcasts almost dead?  Isn't isn't even cable decade, a decade.  All right. That's not a long time if you're a broadcaster.  We got 10 years left.

Transcript:  Well, it could be 20 years by.  I mean, if you look at what's happened with the with the Boston Globe, I think that's  one of the more interesting stories of the week where they sold.  They bought it for one point one billion and then turn around and sell it for 70 million,  which is almost like the joke.  How do you know do they sell it to?

Start time: 1788.98
End time: 1798.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Although they bought it in stock.  So the stock also depreciated quite a bit in value from that billion.  They would have lost the money anyway, in other words, money disappeared over those

They they said, look, we know big retailers like Macy's want to buy full page ads.  They literally they brought sheets started printing.  Didn't you tell me this?  Maybe they started printing in the 18th or 19th century as a vehicle.  They put some crap in between the ads so they could basically get these ads into  people's hands. And that's how the newspaper business was born.  And now it's fine.  Well, how the modern newspaper business, you might say, but not the original.  Ben Franklin wasn't doing that.

This would be akin to Leo, you or me in the Salt Lake area or anybody who's trying to  do media suddenly finding out that the station uptown, some small low band station is up  on the block. It used to be three hundred million dollar station.  Now they're giving it to me for five hundred K.  Well, I would probably be interested.  I don't have that kind of cash, but if I did, I'd be interested in picking that up.  Why? I don't even know.  I'd figure a way to make something out of that.

But he's in his implication is sooner than later.  Yeah. Well, even the guy who's in charge of business  at the New York Times realizes there's not a lot of time left.  Well, he probably really realizes that he knows better.  This is I don't know if you trust Henry Blodgett, but this is Henry Blodgett.  He says we estimate the Times spends two hundred million dollars a year  on its newsroom and generates about one hundred fifty million online revenue.  So there are 50 million in the hole on online alone.  Well, that's the problem is you can't do.  I mean, that's actually a lot of money from online.  That is. Yeah, that's right.

So they're earning a higher CPM on their online advertising.  So they're kind of like subsidizing both businesses, if you will.  They've done a clever job, I think, of working the online angle  so that they can keep the newspaper upload a little bit longer.

Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, this is the hardest thing for any company to do  is to make the transition from one business to another  without cannibalizing the prior business.  And so many companies like Kodak, which had a great digital strategy,  have not been able to do it.  It's a hard part.

Start time: 2204.96

So you're trying to transition to a thing that Google's figured out  and is making money handle or fist at.  And you're just trying to keep your one East Coast newspaper alive.  It may be venerable. It may have been around forever.  People may see that name and go, wow, that is the that's the name of journalism.  Ladies and gentlemen, it doesn't matter.  They're trying to uproot themselves from this old cemented thing  into this thing that someone else is already stealing their lunch with.  I don't envy any of them.

You know, that net neutrality thing now that we're an Internet service provider,  maybe that's not so important after all.  Broadband Reports has an article that says by Carl Bodie saying, you know,  it's not it's being overblown.  No ISP currently allows you to run a server.  On the other hand, there are many of us are because if you're running a sling  box, that's a server. This is terrible, by the way. Terrible.

Back to your theory. My theory.  Well, I don't know.  I mean, I think on the one hand, Google has been very outspoken  that nothing should affect how you use the Internet.  It should be wide open. Right.  They should not do what they and nevertheless, they're telling people  who have Google Fiber in Kansas City and presumably they'll do this  in Austin and Provo. You can't run a server.  Now, Carl Bodie's writing, well, this language is very rarely enforced.  Ha. Comcast does it  because they don't want you to run a mail server.  They don't want you to run your.  And Google does. And this is the other side of it.  Google, like these other guys, offers a business class product  that does let you run a server. Right.

Start time: 2629.88
End time: 2653.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the idea. So it's coming to Provo, right?  We're the third city. I don't live in Provo.  I'm about 20 minutes north of Provo.  But I have friends in Provo who have plans and their plans consist of this.  When Google Fiber comes and they get on board,  they were going to run a bunch of game servers.  They're going to launch a company.  They were going to go crazy with it.  This news has to make them shake just a tiny little bit. Right.

Transcript:  I was going to move the entire Twitter operation to Austin

Start time: 2657.16
End time: 2719.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because there's also, you know, an entire sort of like startup  economy that now exists in Kansas City just because of Google Fiber.  That presumably is affected by this.  I mean, it's sort of it's kind of like if Google considers them  in the ISE themselves to be in the ISP business,  this is the kind of policy you would assume that they had in place all along.  If they are in the kind of marketing about Google Fiber business,  then why are you going to put these kind of restrictions on it?  Why not just sort of let it breathe, see what kind of changes it allows?  Because clearly they can afford to do that because they're like nothing  but bandwidth if they're going to let people with 100 YouTube subscribers  start streaming live. So it feels.  It feels like a weird reversal.  It also feels like it was lazy terms of service writing,  like they just cut and pasted terms of service from some other ISP  and that are having to spend all their time in their own forums saying,  oh, well, we don't mean commercial.  We just mean if you're running a commercial server, we don't mean slingbox.  We don't mean this. We don't mean that.  Like, come on. Well, you guys are smart enough to write your own terms  of service that makes some damn sense. Right.

Transcript:  Well, in the chat room, just pointed out that freemium is the reality.  TV of gaming, because at this point, the game makers,  that's just such a great quote.  And at this point, the game makers have they put the barest  minimum of effort into the actual game.  The first the first incarnation of it.  And that, I think, is what's changing it.  So tragically is that you can't even really have a good game experience  until you start spending money.  So you're getting ripped off from the first day.  I didn't feel that way.

I'm sorry to know that your game force closes on any of the device  you've tried to access after installing the new Krustyland update.  Even that sentence alone is worth $300.  Don't you think if the same issue is happening on all the devices  and removing reinstalling the application doesn't resolve the issue,  it could be a server or an account issue.  Duh. So now they say, please provide the following information  so that I may escalate your issue to our higher level of support.  Level of support. Another Indian.

You go check their Twitter accounts.  They have like 1100 people following them.  But on Vine, they got a million people.  They show up in New York.  They'll show up at like, I don't know, some central location  somewhere in some major city and hundreds, maybe thousands come  and crowd these people and they make videos all afternoon.  It's it's insane to me what they're doing.  And I kind of understand it because that's what all these other things are,  to some degree. But this one's new and weird and scary.

It only records video when you press the screen.  So you can do, you know, as many as, you know, I don't know.  What's the largest number, like 20 or 30 individual frames?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So so I don't know.  I mean, this is this is interesting, I think, from a tech perspective,  but there is there are two two Viner's in particular, one is named  this Chris Lepore guy who I don't know what he does.  Something with a band travels a lot covered in tattoos.  Cool guy. Does funny videos.  A dog's adorable.  He has tons of followers, over a million over a million followers.  There's this other girl, I forget her name.  They meet through Vine.  Just I don't know how you do that, but you saw each other's videos.  You like each other.  So today they got together in New York, Central Park.  Everybody else was told about it.  They made out essentially in front of everybody and essentially said,  they've never met. We are now dating.  Yeah, this is the first time we've met.  They've been communicated on and off, you know, over across the coast.  He lives in L.A. She lived in New York.  They get together today.  And it was like a wedding with thousands of people clapping for him  and people revining it up and down like Vine was was was smelly with this thing.  Like all day, all you get with these revines.  And I just I at first you kind of just go, I have Vine.  It's an app. Big deal. No big deal.  I'm starting to wonder, though.  Like, that's a lot of people with a lot of interest in a big demographic.

Start time: 3754.56
End time: 3756.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Start time: 3756.88
End time: 3791.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's super. It's really interesting, too, because it's people who maybe previously  would have been on YouTube.  But it's so hard to stand out on YouTube now and so hard to get any attention,  regardless of whether you're doing something creative or not.  I mean, I felt like Vimeo was the outlet for people who are really doing  kind of clever artistic stuff.  But now there's this whole new platform that kind of no one was on  and nobody knew exactly how to use it.  So you can create these really attention grabbing things.  And it's basically just like a new avenue to celebrity, because honestly,  let's admit like YouTube is kind of closed unless you're actually already famous.

Start time: 3791.98
End time: 3797.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_11

End time: 3818.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  No, I mean, I think it's great.  There's a lot of creativity on Vine.  And I know my kids, both my kids love Vine and do a lot of vining of videos.  It's easy to do.  That's probably it's like Twitter.  It doesn't take a lot, although if you put a lot of energy into it, it's amazing.  Some of the animations.

Start time: 3818.22
End time: 3828.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's sort of like blogging.  When Twitter came along, it's you know, Twitter, the barrier to entry was so much lower.  It kind of opened this entire new platform for YouTube to have money.

Start time: 3829.64
End time: 3888.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know that they should worry.  I mean, some of these people are they're they're parlaying  Vine, Vine popularity into YouTube popularity.  So a lot of these guys have started YouTube accounts now and they're already,  you know, they have respectable followings there and they're growing.  I don't think it's so much that.  But what Molly said, I think is prescient to the whole point, which is  there is this limited window to grab on to whatever it is.  So I have this I have this eight year old World of Warcraft podcast  that stays number one in that category and has since the day we launched it.  Well, that was timing and nobody else was really doing it.  And now there are dozens and dozens, but we still kind of stay there.  And I think it's because you got in early and you got a name for yourself.  And now you're kind of sort of there.  I think Vines already hit that.  There is there's probably a stable of 12 or so people  that are hugely popular on there.  And now it is all trash from there.  And I think YouTube's kind of in that same boat.  It's just I think we're getting smaller and smaller windows of opportunity.  People have to jump on these platforms quick, hope that they take off.  And if they do, that they're one of the ones, you know,  holding the flag at the end of the road.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that's the same thing.  That's why I think Google Plus is not as powerful as I know it does.

Start time: 3912.72
End time: 3928.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You could make a 16, 6 second video on Instagram,  but for some reason, the fact that there's 15 seconds available killed it.  I don't understand it at all.  So so Scott, you jumped on Vine very early.  In fact, you have a good you have a pretty good Vine channel.  You do a lot of creative stuff on Vine.

Start time: 3928.92
End time: 3975.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, some fun on there.  And a lot of it, again, what I end up using it for is kind of when I end up  using all these services for I end up using them to do things for the existing base.  So this is a chance for me to say, all right, well, here's a new way.  I'm putting myself out there for all you people who already are there  and support me and whatever.  This is probably more meaningful content for them.  But to go viral on Vine requires like a lot of crazy acrobatics,  being willing to do things in crowds with strangers you're not willing to do.  Otherwise, like it's a it's a very I think it's a pretty steep wall  to get over to get that that kind of fame in there.  So I think it's actually a pretty good tool, like most other things like Twitter  or like Facebook or whatever, to connect with your audience,  to extend that relationship just a little bit more.  And that's how I use it.  And I think it's a pretty good tool that way. It's all right.

Start time: 3976.00
End time: 3985.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  A lot of people, I mean, we got to say a lot of people like my kids  just use Vine because they like Vine and shares share it with their friends.  And they're not trying to become celebrities.  You're just posting stuff on Vine.

Transcript:  YouTube seems a little less interested in that market now.  Oh, they want big business, right?  They want. Yeah, they want high production value.  I mean, they can sell some some high value ads next to those videos.  They can't.  They're not really interested in the next ball pit meme.

ABC, ABC, there's one more.  So they're they're absolutely moving out of casual sharing  because it doesn't make money for them.  It doesn't allow them to become the next sort of post-broadcast network.  It you could almost argue that they're in wildly different businesses.

Transcript:  Yeah, the sixth second part of it, not to belabor it too much,  but that part seems to be the magic.  And it's like that one little thing nobody thought would be the good part  and turned out to be pivotal, like that is the most important.  It's like saying I was watching the baseball documentary from Ken Burns  as I've seen three times and I freaking love it.  And they were talking about how when the decision was made.  By the way, about 600 hours.  Oh, it's huge. It's two hour innings and like nine innings.  But anyway, it goes.  They were talking about the distance between home plate and first base.  And I forgot the finite number that is.  But when it was decided to be that made everything,  made all the 90 feet, six inches is exactly.  It made all the difference in the game, because without it,  there'd be none of these double outs.  There'd be none of these like stealing bases,  none of these exciting moments in baseball that have made the sport what it is.  And you just think, man, that one guy with that one decision  made all the difference.  And I feel like that six second thing.  And you use the term double out.  Yeah, that's wrong, isn't it?  Yeah. Double play. Double play is what I meant.

And Ben Kingsley narrates it, which would make it great.  This is abridged, unfortunately.  I wonder if they have an unabridged version of it.  A lot of the books now are unabridged.  I think they realize that people want to hear every word.  When books were being put out in cassette, that's how this whole thing started.  They didn't want to give you 50 cassettes.  So they cut them down.  But really now, thanks to downloads, automatic, you know, digital downloads,  you don't have to worry about the length of the book.  So most of audible books are unabridged.  Of course, sometimes the publisher doesn't offer it.  But here's what I want you to do. Browse around.  Pick a couple of books, not just one Schindler's List to be a great one.  You know, I don't know.

My son was very interested in the Boston bombing.  So it's been a lot.  My 20 year old son spent a lot of time looking at stories.  She presumed that somehow the feds had been watching her internet searches  and came to her house.  They were polite. They were nice. They walked around.  They said, can we see your son's bedroom?  She said, well, he's asleep right now.  They said, that's all right. We don't need to.  They petted the dog.  All without a warrant. But that's all without a warrant.  But you know what?  You know, the feds, federal terrorism task force shows up at the door  and says, can we look around?  Are you going to say, kick in? Where's your warrant?  Are you going to do that? Yeah, you would.

This is actually worse than the other story line, which was all the feds.  You know, they're listening in on everything you do.  I think is less fascistic than having your next door neighbor, essentially, or  your co-worker turn you in because they didn't like the way you're searching for stuff.  Right.

And that somehow makes me feel better about it.  For I don't know why, just because they're a couple of schlubs.  And I know they're idiots and there they are working.  And it's not like all just government agents and weird, you know,  guys from alien planets that are here checking us out.  But it is a massive, massive facility.  It is very hard not to see it from the road.  And it seems kind of remote where it's at.  And I tell friends about it and they're like, well, does that make us a target?  And I'm like, no, no, no.  See, I think this actually makes it less of a target from I don't know who,  who would ever target it.  But having this not on the East Coast or the West Coast or somewhere like that  probably keeps it a little safer or whatever.  But I just I want to know what's going on in there.

They decided that they didn't want to do that because it turns out  that the head of our neighborhood watch is a retired FBI agent.  And so they said, you'll be good at it.  But that's what's so amazing in it.  Like it was to me, it was a sign of how completely and forever  things have changed that the neighborhood watch was like,  oh, we can't have that guy.  I get an R info. Yeah.  Like really?  I mean, 20 or 30 years ago, you would have thought that the guy  who was a retired FBI agent, the neighborhood would be like,  thank goodness, that's perfect.

And then, of course, if you're in Australia or England or  Asia, you might want it. You can't get it.  Motorola's even said, no, we're not going to sell it.  We don't care.
