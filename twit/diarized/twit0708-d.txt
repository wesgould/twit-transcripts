Transcript:  Well, we'll talk about that.  And I'm thrilled to have back because she was just here on Friday, but she's back.  Amy Webb, our futurist.  We love Amy. Amy Webb dot I.O.  She is she is the founder of the Future Today Institute,  the author of a number of books.  Her first, The Signals Are Talking, which we had her on for,  where she teaches us all to be futurists.  Her brand new book is The Big Nine.  And we'll talk a little bit about that as we did on Friday.  How the tech titans and their thinking machines could warp humanity.  It's all about A.I. Amy. Great to have you back.  Thank you. I always love being here. Oh, it's rare that we get a professor  of strategic foresight from the NYU Stern School of Business on our airways.

Transcript:  So it's not actually that rare.  Oh, come on. A few times.  I was I was saying before the show, I just wanted to thank you.  We had talked the last time you were here some time ago  about how you consulted Hulu show called The First,  which is about the first manned mission to Mars.  It's fiction. Sean Penn is the astronaut.  It's got a lot of drama in it.  And you did all the kind of the future prediction for it.  And I just wanted to say how much I loved the show at the time.  I said, Sean Penn. But he was great.  And I really thought he was great.

Start time: 240.50
End time: 265.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Thanks for watching it.  We had a small but mighty audience.  And it's worth watching.  Yeah. And I think what was so great about the show was that the the acting was amazing.  But this was all about being as true to what's plausible for the future  as we possibly could be.  So it's set in the near future.  And the world looks different, but eerily familiar, which I think is great.

Transcript:  Yeah, like they're all using and this is one of the things  I think we all agree is probably coming.  But they're all using augmented reality spectacles that look like regular glasses.  But they're but it's really fun because, you know, at one point,  Natasha McAlone, somebody will come into her office and she said, let me share this.  You could see what's going on.  She swipes the video over to their glasses.  It's so cool.

Transcript:  And oh, there weren't any were there?

Start time: 292.96
End time: 316.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's because one of the things that we've modeled, we being in my shop,  is that this is the beginning of the end of smartphones and we're probably  and I know that's a hard pill to swallow, given what just debuted at Mobile World  Congress, but all of the data point to less and less mobile phones,  more and more peripherals over the next decade.  I bet there's I think that sounds great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I bet there's a precedent for what's happening today,  because it's the silly season for phones.  We've got foldable phones.  We got snap bracelet phones from TCL.  We got the weird form factors.  I bet there's a precedent in technology that when  sales flatten, people start going weird.  That's a sure sign that you're at the end of the line for a product.

Start time: 340.88
End time: 418.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There totally is. I can tell you exactly.  So if you go back to 1998, 99,  if I'm sure that all three of us were in the same boat, I was carrying around.  And that'd be fair. I lived in Japan at the time.  I had a digital camera that doubled as an MP3 player.  Oh, yeah. Like an old school digital camera.  I had a mini disc player.  I had a separate Wi-Fi sniffer made by Canary that I carry around.  I remember those. Yeah. Yeah.  Oh, yeah. I had a GPS device that turned like  connected in a weird way to my Blackberry once I bought a Pearl.  And that kind of sort of generated GPS using the  the waypoints from the phone.  So I had all of these all of these devices started getting weird. Right.  And there was this convergence that happened over the next couple of years.  And the end of that convergence was the beginning of the iPhone.  So the iPhone comes out and suddenly we have all this compute  in just one device and all these features.  Well, now, two decades later,  we're starting to see a divergence back in the other direction  as we have things like smart earables, which collect our bio data  and also let us play our music, smart yoga pants.  Dog better. Right.  There's all these other things.  And the phone is once again retreating into the background.

Start time: 419.86
End time: 443.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it's something I think about a lot is I don't think it's just me.  I have started to get the thing where my neck is just killing me  from looking down at my phone all the time.  Do you know what I mean?  And like just I don't know, being in this position all day,  I don't think humans are meant to bend like that.  And I can't wait for it to get to the point where it's in your glasses.  And you just don't have to deal with all of that.

Start time: 444.52
End time: 516.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's not just bending down.  So there's some really interesting work by a couple of them  ophthalmological and optometric associations.  So not lobbyists like credible researchers  within the next couple of decades of the overwhelming majority  of people in Western countries are going to be nearsighted.  And the reason for that is, oh, and there is a reason.  The reason is that our our biology is not evolving as fast as the technology.  And as humans, we our eyes have been engineered to see far, not near.  And most of us are increasingly.  And I happen to know all this because my husband's an eye doctor.  So so so he there is a whole new disease called computer vision syndrome,  which causes it's a real thing, and it causes dry eye and neck cramping.  Some of the stuff you're describing.  And it is all because our eyes were never meant to stare at a screen  that like very close to our faces all day long.  And certainly not to go between near and far continuously,  which most of us are now doing.  So that's going to make this transition into wearing smart glasses  and possibly contact lenses, though, that'll be much further out in the distance.  That will help accelerate that process.

Start time: 517.54
End time: 538.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're not meant to sit either, I suppose. I mean.  What's that doing to us sitting in a chair all day?  Yeah, so we're really in an unnatural kind of situation.  Are you saying that I wouldn't be nearsighted today if I  what did I do when I was a kid, read a lot of books?  I always thought that was a kind of not true.

Start time: 539.38
End time: 561.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it is true.  So if you're somebody, I mean, it's it's a it's heritable.  So if you have nearsightedness or extreme farsightedness or whatever else,  it's probably because your parents did.  But for kids who spent a lot of time reading.  Yeah. Or for kids who are now spending a lot of time looking at screens,  they have a much higher probability of having sight visions much earlier in life.

Start time: 561.54
End time: 564.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Holy cow. Well, that's cheerful.

Start time: 565.64
End time: 567.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a good lead into HoloLens.

Start time: 568.90
End time: 591.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. What's going to happen when we get augmented reality?  I mean, I honestly, once they're like they were in your show,  that seems like the glasses that both of you are wearing.  I would be wearing if I weren't wearing contact lenses.  And maybe they'll even be contact lenses.  And you maybe you will have something in your ear so that you can hear.  And that's right. That seems like.  So do you think that's what's going to replace the smartphone?

Start time: 592.18
End time: 656.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, again, this is the models that I've been working on for a while,  the data driven models.  But right. So so what we are probably looking at is a slow transition away from our smart.  Like in a decade, the smartphone functions that we currently have in our  Androids and iPhones are going to look a lot like the flip phone of yesteryear.  And there will be holdouts, but more and more people will transition into wearing smart  glasses, which for a time will still require a secondary device like a ring or a wristband.  And in the early days of this, they'll use our phones as connective tissue because the  compute will still need to happen somewhere near us.  But increasingly, as we've got AI in the cloud and serverless computing and all these other  things happening and we can once actual 5G networks, not what people are calling 5G  right now, are deployed, we won't have issues with latency, you know, all of the other  challenges that we have today.  And so that that transition from thing that we hold in front of our face to thing that we  wear on our face will become much more seamless and natural.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And in the interim, we're doing, you know, you made me think of my Palm 7, which I had.  Remember that crazy?  I loved it.  It was a palm, but in order to give it wireless connectivity in the days before we had  smartphones, they had a crazy antenna.  And in order to make it useful, maybe you had to get a folding keyboard.  And I think the folding phones are kind of in that same goofy ballpark.  This is TCL's foldable phone, which turns into a bracelet.  Is that why you're wearing the flip bracelet?  This is yeah, because because it kind of is like a snap bracelet.  I don't I don't think that the way that you put it on is like that.  See, I'm terrible at this.

Start time: 700.24
End time: 712.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You've already cracked the screen.  But here's here's a question I have about screen.  So so Samsung has a folding folding phone.  The fold.  I swear to God, you look at the S9 the wrong way and that thing cracks.

Start time: 713.56
End time: 715.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How are they going to keep these from falling apart?  I don't know.

Start time: 715.84
End time: 721.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, the better question is, what's how do you have a phone case for a folding phone?

Start time: 722.46
End time: 735.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, in a way, I think the Galaxy Fold, because it has a screen on the front small  screen and then you open it up for the big screen, that's a little easier to put in a  case because closed.  It's kind of like a case.  You'd have to have a case that opened up.

Start time: 736.24
End time: 741.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's kind of like a traditional back to like those leather cases that my parents had  with their notebook early.

Start time: 742.40
End time: 744.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know.

Start time: 744.58
End time: 758.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think I definitely think there's a there's a use case for these foldable phones.  Like I get that a lot of people, it seems gimmicky.  I really agree with you, Leah, when you're saying like when they start rolling out  bracelet phones, goofy.  That's when it's really not.

Start time: 758.96
End time: 790.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a day.  Yeah, yeah, that's.  And it's a little bigger than that.  The weird one, though, I don't I don't think what makes any sense is the phone from  Huawei, which folds out.  So I don't know how you put that in a case, because that has its screen on the outside.  And but apparently there are cases people are making cases or planning to make cases.  The other issue with these is they're ridiculous.  The three thousand dollars for the Huawei, two thousand dollars for the fold.

Start time: 791.92
End time: 818.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We should also the idea of a dual screen phone has actually been around for a while.  And there's been a bunch of Chinese companies making literal flip phones,  so screen on either side has got a new one.  There was a meizu phone out for a while.  These were crazy looking dual screen phones that very few I never saw anybody using.  But the difference now is the sort of folding without losing the pixels.

Start time: 820.24
End time: 856.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, I'm really into the idea of a foldable phone everywhere.  I go, I carry I carry my iPhone 10 with me.  And I carry my 11 inch iPad Pro just because, you know, if I have 10 minutes,  like read the New York Times, I just like the bigger screen.  It's easier to type on there.  And I just think about like an iPad.  How can they really start innovating on the iPad?  It felt like more than the iPhone, they hit a wall with what was bringing consumer value.  And I think something you could fold up more easily to put into a purse.  I just that's a gadget I would very seriously look at.

Start time: 856.74
End time: 886.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is a question about, though.  As you pointed out, this this one screen that bends in the middle.  What's this bend going to end up?  How many times can you close that before it starts getting a crease?  Yeah, this I kind of like this model.  This is more I think what you're talking about.  This is from TCL.  They're not making it. It's a concept.  But it's two screens with a hinge in the in the middle.  Yeah, you know, you want a big screen.  You want a screen all the way across.  Yeah, I don't want to research a lot of this going into the show.

Start time: 889.26
End time: 910.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And ultimately, I kept coming back to folding is interesting.  Retracting is better. Oh, right.  I could see a device that we retract or it's almost like tiled  and more modular.  So at one point, Google had something called the Aura phone, which never actually went.  Right. They had a testing bed in.

Start time: 911.32
End time: 926.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They inherited this from Motorola when they bought them.  It was a modular build your own phone kit.  The series there was not everybody wants the same capabilities.  So you could buy the modules you like and snap them together into a phone,  which sounds like a Lego phone.

Start time: 926.32
End time: 963.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But a little bit.  But it kind of made sense.  And Sony has been Sony now has these panels, these sort of Sony tiles.  And you can fit together any number of them to sort of build your own display.  So I could see in a handful of years a tile concept phone that,  that, you know, again, allowed you to build some more functionality.  But Leo, I have to agree with you.  I mean, once technology starts getting silly,  that's usually an indication that we're on to something else.  And, you know, we how many people use a physical typewriter?  How many people use a I had a brother word processor, you know, just  something that was an interim device, right?

Start time: 963.52
End time: 967.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A little bit of computer, a little bit of typewriter.  It had a little tiny screen.

Start time: 968.18
End time: 970.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think we're in the interim device space.

Start time: 971.20
End time: 988.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That could go on for a while, though, because 5G is at least two or three years off.  Definitely. In fact, I saw one analyst say, oh, good news.  5G will be available in 2025 to a full 32 percent of the nation.  It's like, well, that's a third of the nation in three years.

Start time: 988.34
End time: 996.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's not where the small cells coming from.  We've got an antagonistic relationship with China right now.  Who's going to build these?  I mean, there's there's a lot to be figured out.

Start time: 997.12
End time: 1014.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So and I agree with you, that's a prerequisite.  You have to have fast, easily available.  Low latency is important, too.  And that's one of the features of 5G networks.  We've got to solve the battery issue.  Yeah, the HoloLens is a fairly hefty device with only three hours of battery life.

Start time: 1014.44
End time: 1071.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. So and if you start reading about how they actually do the  the lenses inside to go into your eyeball, like this is a very, very,  very complicated gadget.  Like if you start reading about how HoloLens and the pupillary distance  that they calculate every time you put it on, I just it's like an iPhone.  I could always see how that would get to the point of being  a mainstream consumer thing that anyone could afford.  But I'm looking at the technology for these glasses.  And you start thinking about miniaturizing the battery  or producing these very, very complicated lenses  that really need to be made individually for the person.  And I start wondering if it's going to be something like HoloLens  or if like that's just a stop off place before we get to neural interfaces.  Like, so it's going to be easier, like replicating that through the eyeball  or just telling your brain what you want to see.

Start time: 1072.26
End time: 1183.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I think the other important thing is  we've gotten used to a mobile phone as a singular device  that does a lot of things, whether it's for enterprise or for individuals  or for government.  As we diverge back out for a time, we're going to have different headsets  that serve different purposes.  So HoloLens, this new version of HoloLens is just for enterprise.  It's not for individuals.  And it has a limited number of applications.  The applications that it does have are pretty awesome.  I saw there's a really cool application where you can see through walls.  So if you work in contracting and construction, you know,  exactly they can overlay the blueprints, which interestingly is where  all this AR started, right, in industrial assembly lines.  Yeah, that's where it came from.  So that's kind of interesting.  There are some really interesting applications for training  for like surgeons and other things like that.  Then there's the magic leap side,  which at the moment, the battery pack, the compute sort of happens  on your body and the glasses look silly.  But the idea there is that those would become a more  easy to access consumer device, and the glasses will look more like  what I've got on, which are just normal looking glasses,  you know, that can also provide that refraction.  But then there's this whole other school where maybe the future  is more about retinal projection.  In some cases.  So again, like, I think this is one of those things where we're going to see  wacky, weird technology for the next probably 12 to 15 years  as all of this gets sorted out.  And there's experimentation and there's convergence and divergence  over and over and over again.  So if you're into gadgets, like we should be in the golden era  of wacky gadgets for the next decade or so.  I think what I don't know if either of you read Blake J.

Start time: 1183.22
End time: 1272.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Harris's new book, The History of the Future.  He basically had a ton of access to Facebook and Oculus, and he was there  basically chronicling the downfall of Oculus and following Palmer Lecture.  Following Palmer Lucky around for the entire time.  If you read why Oculus ultimately failed, I think it's because they have like this.  They were over promising, right?  They have this big grand vision of us basically living in Ready Player One.  What I like about HoloLens and what they're offering this time is it's  it's such a narrow vision of what you need.  A really good example, I ride a motorcycle and often I like to ride motorcycles  to like events when I can.  You can't touch a smart screen when you're on a motorcycle  because you have on gloves, right?  Like capacitive touch screen.  It can't access that.  So a motorcycle helmet with a built in to show me  like map to show me information that I can't access on a phone.  That is something I would very happily pay three thousand dollars for  because it's about my safety.  So I think like I think almost the reason all of these ideas failed  is we tried to promise everything.  And I think Microsoft is doing the right thing by focusing on just a few things  and doing them very well.  Contractor schematics like, you know, doctors and operating rooms, all those things.

Start time: 1272.88
End time: 1370.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's also good for Microsoft's business because it sells Azure,  which is really the really all Microsoft cares about.  I wonder. And Amy, you could probably correct me on this.  But I wonder if we're not making the Malthusian mistake.  So Malthus predicted that we the world population,  if it continues to grow at the rate it's growing, we'll run out of food.  And everybody will die in like the year 1910.  It didn't happen.  And I think we may be making that mistake with technology  because we've been living in this era of Moore's law,  where just things got cheaper and faster, doubling every 18 months.  And we kind of expect that to continue, except that I think we're kind of  I believe we're kind of hitting the hitting the edge here, the wall.  Battery technology, we're stuck.  Somebody's going to have to make an amazing breakthrough.  There's some huge paradigm shift.  That's it, because we've been trying to make this better  for a long time with little success.  5G, I think, is a lot harder to implement than anybody admits.  And there's a lot of issues that are going to get in between us  and 5G, including the Huawei issue, which we'll talk about.  Computing technology is going to get smaller, but we don't.  But interface design has not advanced at the rate it needs to for us.  Look at the Apple Watch, which is smaller and clever  and has the worst interface ever designed  itself, but despite the interface.  Do you see what I'm I'm sure as a futurist, you think about this.  We can't just assume it's straight line.  Sure. So so right.

Start time: 1371.52
End time: 1470.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So as a futurist, my job is not to make predictions.  It's to gather data, run models, using that data and make connections  to try to figure out where we're headed.  So for a while. So, you know, there are some linear  throughputs that sometimes make sense, but we've sort of reached this point where  breakthroughs in one technology are not going to be as easy  as they are in another technology tend to cause an acceleration  in the research and the breakthroughs in other technologies.  The problem is when our patients level  and our enthusiasm for technology butts up against reality.  And that happens a lot.  It happens. It happened in the 1980s when  after lots and lots of promises about artificial intelligence  that failed to materialize, people started investors.  They started to run away funding  because the practical realities and the commercialization of technology  didn't pan out the way that they sort of that the hype had promised.  So we do run into a problem over and over again, and it's cyclical.  When we do, we get these, like, inflections across lots of different  technologies that cause this burst of activity.  And then all of a sudden, everybody expects sweeping change quickly,  which, of course, never comes.  And so that, you know, in order for us to have, for example, 5G,  like who's going to build that?  It's it's not part of our national infrastructure.  We have four major wireless carriers.  And at the moment, it would cost a lot of money for them to  build out all of those cells.  And there's a there's a lot there.

Start time: 1471.46

The problem is when I hear the Trump administration say that,  you have to read between the lines.  It's not really nationalize it.  They're they're against nationalization of anything.  That's socialism.  What they really are saying is we're going to have a consortium  of corporate interests that will determine.

Transcript:  We got fiber.  And I've heard it said that we got fiber because of the dot com bust  that there was so much money flowing into the markets at the end of the century.  People were overbuilding fiber, much of it still dark.  And then it crashed.  But just the same way we got the railroads in the 18th, in the 19th century.  And then all the railroad companies went bust.  But we still got an intercontinental railroad.  We have intercontinental fiber, but it's all dark. Right.  So a couple of quick things.  Yeah. Correct. All my historical mistakes.  No, no, no, no.

We're just our culture has evolved.  And so this is why you don't see a lot of transportation changes.  And to lay fiber means to temporarily disrupt  or permanently disrupt some of our streets and some other things.  And we have enough transcontinental fiber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The last mile problem in, you know, I'm I think, again,  a lot of times the big companies get this get a bad rap.  You know, I can I can tell you because I know some folks  who worked on part of this project that in Philadelphia,  where Comcast is headquartered,  you know, several times in Philly, in Baltimore,  in some East Coast cities, Comcast was working with the local city  government to to bring fiber.  And the city governments, the individual city governments  were expecting all of these big concessions and big payouts.  And, you know, and they thought that they were playing hardball.  And in reality, what they were doing was making it so extraordinarily  expensive to lay fiber per foot that it was easier for Comcast to say,  you know what we like, why would you know, why would we bother?  Why are why are we doing this?  So. I think I think that this is another key piece of this,  whether we're talking about 5G or we're talking about AI or whatever technology.  You know, there's always multiple sides to what's happening,  and it's easy to blame the big tech companies.  It's very complicated. Yeah, it's complicated.  Yeah, it really is. Yeah.

You can't get very far in gadgets without talking about politics,  especially infrastructure politics. Yeah, definitely.  And yeah, I just so sometimes I feel like we have this the potential  and this great vision for the future, but we lack the wherewithal  to make it happen for a variety of reasons.  And I won't blame I won't ascribe blame to any one entity, you know,  because it does feel a little science fiction to me that we will someday  in my lifetime have spectacles that we could send videos to each other like that.

So, you know, just as it took a couple of times to get to social media  that we all accepted because remember, there was Friendster.  And then MySpace and then Facebook is when that concept finally hit.  There have been AR glasses now in existence since the 90s.  And they were around Google Glass.  You know, I think what we're going to start seeing is a rapid acceleration  as all of these other pieces fall into place.  So it feels very sci fi.  But I think if you had gone back, Leo, to 1998 and told yourself, guess what?  All of these crazy things you're using, your canary wireless sniffer,  your Toshiba satellite pro that's heavy enough to double as a self-defense weapon.  But, you know, I do have to say.

Transcript:  Maybe not. That's why the Palm 7 came along.  But at the same time, it's like we've got to be we have to be realistic.  I mean, I think when I was a kid, we all expected we'd have flying cars.  Yeah, where are those?  And there's there's a realistic risk to the public  if you're giving them like control of a device that can fly.  And I think in the same way,  you one of the things I thought was so interesting about this book about Oculus  is a lot of their research that they did leading into it  was about are people going to basically wear this goofy gadget on their head?  And they decide because it's virtual reality and you're in your home.  And no one can see you.  You're not worried about the social cost.  But when I think about glasses and how you might eventually miniaturize that,  you've got to get around the computing power.  You've got to get around the the batteries, the really big  like 3D graphics.  I can tell you firsthand how computationally expensive it is to like positionally track.  So I think I think sometimes you hit a hard limit.  And I just yeah, that was my question.  I'm imagining. Yeah.

Transcript:  But I don't know what I've seen.  And I was down visiting the Magic Leap guys not too long ago.  What I've seen out of that shop, my experience using the headset.  To me, this is not a big leap at all forward  to think that we will have that compute the all of the all of the now, not tomorrow.  You know, I think a decade from now, this is entirely within the realm of plausibility.  And if I can just add one last thing about our expectations versus reality,  when we think about the future of transportation and for some reason,  when we think about the future, we always come back to the idea of flying cars.  And we think that oftentimes we're the first ones to be to be disappointed.  The very first patent, the very first patent for a flying car.  It's called the Curtis airplane autoplaying.  It was filed in 1913 and a concept was built the following year.  For every decade since since 19, I'm sorry, it was 1917.  So for every decade since 1917, there has been a brand new set of prototypes  of flying cars that have actually taken off.  And those early models are hilarious.  Yeah, that's the Curtis autoplaying.  Some of those early models are really funny because they were just whatever,  like the existing car of the time with some wings stuck on  it in a stronger engine.  And you have to stop and part of what happened, part of our difficulty  in approaching the future in a way that doesn't fetishize the future,  but instead take a really pragmatic look is pop culture.  So we've lived with the idea of flying cars for so long that it's really hard  for us to conceptualize a future mode of transportation  that doesn't involve a flying car.  And for God's sake, like two weeks ago, Boeing released its latest  version of a flying car, which is like a quadcopter sort of thing  with a like a helicopter cockpit, you know, and instead  there's lots of other ways to get around.  So there's tunneling underground.  There are personal low energy vehicles that were, you know, like scooters  and golf carts, and they're all different types of futuristic  modes of transportation.  We just don't we don't give them as much credence or credit  because they're newer to us and we have a cognitive bias against accepting  things that are new as plausible for the longer term.

Transcript:  That's really a good point.  We're comfortable with the ocean of notion of flying car.  We are going to continue this conversation.  I don't want to interrupt it. We have to.  But you probably all could take a little break, let your minds cool off for a moment.  Amy Webb is here. Her new book is great.  The Big Nine. We talked about it on triangulation this week.  How the tech titans and their thinking machines could warp humanity.  And she has some great acronyms in here for the Chinese  AI giants, Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent.  Those are the bats.  And for the for the American AI  giants, she's got the G mafia, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook,  IBM and Amazon, the G mafia.  And and never the twain shall meet.

Transcript:  May you live in interesting times. Definitely.  Our show today brought to you by LastPass.  We know that, you know, that the current password system is broken,  but no one's come up for with a replacement quite yet.  So until they do, may I suggest a little password hygiene?  LastPass is a password vault, a place, a piece of software  that works on every platform you use, Mac, Windows, Linux,  iOS, Android works with every browser to generate long, strong passwords  you couldn't remember in a million years.  But don't worry, LastPass remembers them, records them, stores them securely.  They're so encrypted that only you can read them,  not even the folks at LastPass can read them.  They're only decrypted at device level and and makes it easy to do,  makes it convenient.  So for so long, we've been talking about the tradeoff between convenience  and security. Well, this is one security trade off that actually is more convenient  because LastPass will fill in the passwords in your browser,  on your mobile phone, iOS 12, Android.  Now you just get to an app that you want to log into.  LastPass fills in the password. It's actually fast and fun.  You won't worry about reusing passwords because LastPass will generate  new passwords for you. In fact, they even have a great security check  and a new feature in LastPass that I noticed just the other day  will warn you when you log into a site, you've used that password elsewhere  and give you the chance to clean that up.  LastPass is used.  It's the number one password manager out there.  It's been used, is used by 13 and a half million people worldwide.  But it's also important for business.  And that's really what I'd like to pitch you today. Your business.  And if you own a business, you know that, you know, you have to have employees  and you know that most of your employees don't know as much as you do  about security, about passwords.  They're still using monkey one, two, three.  Their dog's name and their birth date.  Or worse, they're posting it on the post it note on the front of the monitor.  Or even worse than that, we know more than half employees share passwords,  not only with other employees, but with friends and family.  You need LastPass at work.  It'll keep your password safe.  You can actually give employees access to vital assets without giving them passwords.  You let you have complete administrative oversight.  You can set master password requirements, enable password resets,  restrict access when needed over 100 policies.  You get actionable security reports, shared folders, which I love.  That means everybody in our ops team gets a full set of passwords  in the shared folder.  You just add them to that group.  Same thing with our business department.  Protect yourself and your business with LastPass, the number one  most preferred password manager over 43000 businesses, including Twitter.  And we've used the LastPass enterprise for many years,  ever since one of our employees posted all his passwords on a public website.  Oh, God. Well, no, seriously.  Yeah, he's a smart guy. He made the website.  It wasn't like, you know, Facebook, but it was also a public.  What's he doing now?  Yeah, we took it down real quick and installed LastPass.

And they found out I was glancing at our team email  and I found out that they were just emailing their passwords,  like all of our financial credentials to each other.  And I hit the roof.  Oh, that will do that.  People in that you go into politics, you don't necessarily  think about information security.  And this is why the DNC was hacked in 2016,  because people don't think about this stuff.  So you better believe like we are looking at solutions like LastPass.  You've got to take this seriously.

Start time: 2390.42
End time: 2492.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We use it and we started using it ever since that happened.  You can also say, for instance, and we do this,  you have to have two factor authentication.  LastPass works with all the devices, Duo, security, Ubiqui.  They have their own authenticator, of course, it works with Google authenticator.  The LastPass authenticator is pretty cool because it's not a six digit code.  It's a push pop up that says approve or deny, which is very easy for employees,  but also more secure than text messaging.  I just everything they've done at all.  They've thought about it all.  We interviewed Joe Segrist, the founder of LastPass.  Steve Gibson looked at the code and gave it his thumbs up.  He uses LastPass. That ought to tell you something.  In fact, it's it's everybody ought to be using it.  There's LastPass for families, LastPass premium for personal use.  There's LastPass teams.  If you have 50 or fewer employees, but we use the big boy, LastPass,  LastPass Enterprise, and we would never go back.  And it's just awesome.  You need LastPass.  Lots of people use LastPass, but really all that matters is you and your security.  LastPass.com slash twit.  And if you are a LastPass fan and you're going to the security conference  this week in San Francisco, the RSA conference,  I'm going to be hosting the cocktail party  after the show at Bourbon and Branch, along with Jason Howell and Megan Moroney.  We're all going to be there. I love the LastPass team.  So we just volunteered. Hey, if you'll let us in, we'll go.  You have to say, speak easy.  So you have to have a password to go to the party.  But if you're at RSA, just go to the LastPass booth and say, Leo said,  what's the password?  And they'll tell you what the password is so you can get in.  Lots of we'll see on Wednesday if you come to that LastPass.com slash  twit. What is the password in?

This person does not think it was you, Amy, right?  This person does not exist.  This is a really creepy site.  That person doesn't exist.  That's an AI generated using a technique called GAN.

And if you go on the site toward the bottom, it was there the other day.  I don't know if he took it off.  There's a little explainer, a couple of links that shows the research  and like where all of this came from.  There you go. And how he did it.  The short answer is this is actually not all that complicated to do.  And that is why after this came out,  there were many other copycat sites making automatically  generated images of other things.  Oh, really? Oh, is there a cat's version of this?  There is. So so go. So the  really quickly generative adversarial networks are kind of like two systems  playing the Turing test against each other, trying to fool each other  until they come up with something that's believable.  And so Nvidia's. So that's the adversarial part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, but but it is important because this same idea.  So if you think about artificial intelligence from the very beginning,  we've sort of built AI with the understanding  that it would either beat us or replicate us.  So so that is what we're starting.  That's that's what this is.  So this person does not exist as a generative adversarial network.

But, you know, they're one of the ways you find out if someone  like harassing you online is a bot is you look at the picture that they're using.  And generally it comes from another person's like photo online.  There was a piece this week  basically by women of color talking about what they were talking about  as digital blackface, like basically people  using avatars of people of color online to kind of.  Represent themselves.  We've had that happen to real right to derail conversations.  It's easy for me to imagine this technology being used as another component  in information warfare to basically give bot armies  that much more believability might be the word.  So I realize like this kind of you've got two AIs battling each other.  It's not hard to do.  This kind of technology is inevitable.  But I do think it's worth thinking about how this is going to affect information warfare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think it was.  I know the I know some of the guys that worked on that.  OK, that project.  So I don't think it was publicity.  I think, unfortunately. So quick background.  Open AI is a group that was has had some personal changes.  But partially was founded partially by Elon Musk and some others.  And it's it's intended to be a consortium  where research is done for everybody, not just for singular companies.  What they've done is built a random text generator.  But it's it's very good and very convincing.  So basically you start with a human prompt.  One example is like a teacher asking a student to write an essay on the Civil War.  And the resulting text is, you know, really, really convincing.  And what's different between that and, for example, narrative insights,  which is an example, is one of the companies that's taking structured data  like stocks or sports scores and generating automatically content  that runs in news organizations.  The difference that this is more open ended and the and obviously far more complicated.

Transcript:  Now, I would argue that when it comes to college essay writing,  that maybe all of our communications when done well are the result of formulas.  So this is essentially building an algorithm that represents the formula  that takes the information and spits it out in a way that we might.  But here's what I think is, well, the thing that went wrong  is that the press release and the way that it was discussed  made it sound so scandalous and, you know, sort of  made a big deal out of something that I think is remarkable.  Not. Like the sign of the apocalypse or something, you know,

Start time: 2945.44

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the paper is very measured in the press release.  That's right. They said we're not going to release this technology  because it's too dangerous.

Start time: 2954.96
End time: 3003.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which but this is a problem when it comes to artificial intelligence.  There is an extraordinary amount of misplaced optimism and fear.  And I would put that description because the paper was fairly measured  and interesting. And honestly, it wasn't that remarkable at all.  However, the announcement, right, the announcement,  you know, was would be in the misplaced fear,  you know, and intentionally drawing sort of scandalizing something,  which is not good for the community at all.  Again, it changes expectations.  And the last thing we need is to change expectations and and  get people, you know, either fired up about investing  a ton more money and expecting products really soon or taking money out.  We have to we have to go forward with, you know, clear minds.

Start time: 3004.28
End time: 3035.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I do bring it up because it's directly in response to what Brianna was saying.  And in fact, they say this in the summary of the paper.  We can imagine the application of these models for malicious purposes.  Information jamming, generating misleading news articles,  impersonating others online.  I think the biggest issue would be perhaps comment jamming  with seemingly real comments that are so quickly  generated in such volume that it overwhelms the normal, the humans.

Start time: 3036.40
End time: 3037.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I think it's important to.

Start time: 3038.76
End time: 3044.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, sorry. Because humans are already malicious.  There are plenty of malicious actors who could write better than this.  But there are fewer.

Start time: 3046.24
End time: 3079.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is automating malicious propaganda.  So instead of having instead of the the United States  employs people to do the same thing that the paper is predicting  that began could be used for.  So what I would say is we should all wait.  Technology always evolves in ways that we don't think through in advance.  Something always goes wrong.  So it's incumbent upon us to, you know, again, lay out far in advance.  What are the scenarios for the catastrophic scenarios,  the pragmatic scenarios, the optimistic scenarios and think all of this through,  which which we should already be doing?

Start time: 3079.98
End time: 3191.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a lot of I would I would I would want to add to that.  You know, we don't have a choice whether this is going to happen.  You could have magically every tech company in the United States  and all of our startups tomorrow decide, oh, you know what?  We're going to set this one out. It's too dangerous.  We don't like it.  You know, there was a story that came out of the Wall Street Journal  just a few months ago talking about how China in using AI  for hacking foreign governments, this is something they're really,  really getting serious about.  So when it comes to propaganda, even if we put the brakes on this,  someone else is going to develop it in another country.  So, Amy, I would really agree with you.  I think the solution to this isn't to ban technology.  I think it's to get a lot more cynical in our  models for like social media, something I think all of us,  like we've got a pretty large social media presence is  I think we're all used to kind of the anger moms that can come towards you.  And for me, I know I take someone that uses their real name  a lot more seriously than someone with two random words  and eight digits behind their Twitter handle.  I think like the answer for this particular model is going to be  we need to put more emphasis on identity.  We need to put more emphasis on verifying that people are who they say they are.  And I realize that has very serious implications for, say,  you know, LGBT people that may be coming out of the closet.  They're trying to find an authentic self.  They're experimenting with their identity online.  I don't want to erase people like that.  But at the same time, we've got to be a lot more suspicious  that just because a Twitter account exists,  I've begun to increasingly doubt if there's a real person behind it.  If that makes sense. Yes.

Start time: 3192.56
End time: 3224.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And in fact, I think the the actual paper  and its summary from OpenAI was much more measured and said exactly that.  This is the paragraph I found most compelling.  These findings, combined with earlier results on synthetic imagery  like deepfakes, audio and video,  imply that technologies are reducing the cost of generating fake content  and waging disinformation campaigns.  So the public at large will need to become more skeptical of text  they find online. That's all.

Start time: 3225.46
End time: 3281.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or there are other ways around this, too.  I mean, you know, there's there are ways to digitally watermark content.  There are plenty of ways to authenticate.  I think that the key here is most of the content  that's distributed online and certainly news organizations  have not been fast enough to advance.  You know, they're only recently.  And I think in a large part due to  Craig Newmark of Craigslist,  who's who's really been focused a lot on trust,  only recently have news organizations started to think  through the technology side of this.  So, you know, we can't say like there are plenty of ways to create fake content.  It's much easier now. It's easier to distribute it.  So there's no way to put a lid on it.  So the best way around it is to figure out how to authenticate  real content.  To make it more difficult, though, there's also a, you know,

Start time: 3281.72
End time: 3313.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  sometimes people say, well, Twitter and Facebook and all these sites  would be fixed if everybody just had to be their real person.  They couldn't create fake accounts.  But there's also a genuine need, I think, for anonymity online.  Sure. So that's the challenge is, yeah, if everybody were forced  to use their real names and you had to prove your identity before you could post,  I think a lot of this would go away because most of these trolls  don't want anybody to know it's them.  But at the same time, you know,  it's them. But at the same time, it would eliminate some very valuable  conversations that occur in anonymity.  Yeah. So how do you do that?

Start time: 3315.52
End time: 3340.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think a lot of these issues, you're trying to compete to fundamentally  different principles here, because I think all of us are here.  We value anonymity, right?  Like we value privacy online.  So if you're talking about free speech and free speech,  if you're talking about authenticating every single person,  I would point out that is a policy China employs.  I don't think many people would praise their Internet as one of the more open

Transcript:  The founders, I don't know if the founders could not possibly have imagined  the world in which we live, but also the ways that our behaviors have changed  in response to all of this technology.  You know, there's there's a statesmanship that doesn't exist anymore  in Washington, D.C.  If you think about FDR, who suffered from polio,  who couldn't walk, you know, who had serious physical issues.  And it was never brought up.  I'm not, you know, and maybe there were reasons to have brought it up,  but it wasn't brought up.  And I think, you know, he did very well by Americans.  The problem is that some of the laws that we have, like free speech,  don't entirely make sense in the era of technology  and certainly not necessarily in an era of automated content generation.  So, you know, we have to, I think, be more flexible  in how we think about what the founders intended.  And we have to approach a lot of our information laws  with more sophistication than we have in the past.  And I know that's an unpopular unpopular thing to say,  but this is only going to get worse if we don't shift our thinking going forward.

I mean, if I critique someone online, my name is right next to that.  I have sure had bad tweets like held against me in my professional career.  I just I don't know.  I think like outrage as a political force online.  I don't think if that if questions were brought into the mix  about the legitimacy of that, I don't think that would be the worst thing

But on the other hand of that, you have like game developers  regularly like harassed online if like a Call of Duty patch  changes the strength of a gun and people don't like it.

People throw bricks through your windows.  And I would say, I mean, maybe a lot of that happened, I don't know,  on 4chan and Reddit or somewhere.

And I've seen them really work their butt off to address those issues.  And I could point to at least 10 things that happened to me  that Twitter worked to change so it doesn't happen to other women.  So I don't think Twitter is perfect.

I found it difficult to have a conversation.  So I use it as a listening post.  Mostly, I agree.  And I use it in conjunction with Nuzzle, which is this really amazing app  started by the guy who founded Friendster.  And it's recently been bought by Chartbeat, not Sharpie, by a scroll.  And I think is the name of the company, Tony Hale, who was at Chartbeat  his startup. Anyhow, what's cool about it is  I have like I have dozens and dozens of Twitter lists that I keep private  and they're all super granular on very, very granular topics.  And I spent I spent over a year putting all those lists together.  And they're really representative of multiple viewpoints.  And I update them all the time.  And I use Nuzzle to surface  when enough people have shared  that that that those lists follow have shared or posted content,  similar content.  It will get aggregated by Nuzzle.  I use Nuzzle. I love Nuzzle.

And when the whole deepfakes  thing was first happening, I guess, last December or so earlier than that.  You know, a lot of that content was being shared out on Twitter.

Transcript:  Yeah. So I use it for that.  I use it to I speak, you know, when I speak at conferences  or I do book signings or whatever, I can engage.  Yeah, actually, I have a little script that runs.  So for those of you who are listening in, who speak at conferences,  here's a very clever way to use Twitter.  So there's a little script.  It requires a little bit of know how and breaking keynote if you use it.  But you can you can put in the presenter notes a little.  You have this script running.  You've got a little bit of code in the presenter notes,  and then you can live tweet while you present.  So it's all be at South by this weekend.  Oh, that's cool.  I'm one of the big featured room.  There's thousands of people there.  I'm going to go through a lot of information.  We always I always show my tech trends because this is when the report comes out.  So what I will be doing is I will be sharing out and live tweeting my own talk,  sharing all of the data, all of the links.  Wow. So that's a really great way for people again.  So like if you think of Twitter more as a utility, that is a way to communicate  with other humans.  You know, I think of it as a utility.  And I find when I'm specifically using it as a utility, it to be quite useful.

Start time: 3884.76
End time: 3911.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, it's not anymore, but it is a good utility.  And I think if we read, you know, years ago, I many years ago,  I told Jack that they ought to.  This was the beginning, the sort of beginning of some of the fake issues  that we're dealing with now and the harassment and everything else.  You know, Twitter's if you look at Twitter's numbers, their stock,  like their valuation, it is not trending upward.  I could buy it. It's not trending up.  It's trending down.

Start time: 3912.50

Start time: 3915.18
End time: 3938.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but let's think about it.  So this is this should be Twitter like Trump getting elected  should be the greatest thing that ever happened to Twitter.  Yeah, the president uses it.  And yet they're not like they should be swimming in money and they're not.  So if their investors were smart, if everybody was smart,  they would turn this thing over to a foundation, let a foundation buy it out.  And it should be turned into a newswire for the 21st century.

End time: 3967.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and still have functionality still.  But but but enable it.  And there are ways to build in different layers of verification  and authenticity and all of the other things.  But I mean, it is not rocket science if they wanted to weed all the trolls out  and to, you know, there are ways to make sure that it's humans  who are actually sending out content.  But that's not complicated.  Well, OK.

Start time: 3969.02

Start time: 3974.62
End time: 4057.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I'll give the example of one and addresses what you were just saying, Amy.  It used to be where Twitter, if someone sent me a death threat  and I reported and they got suspended, they could take 10 minutes,  make another account and just get back on there.  Right now, what happens if you get suspended from that  and your IP address looks suspiciously like one that just got suspended?  It's going to ask you to have to give a phone number along with that.  I do want to point out, though, that that solution is a very Western solution,  because if you start thinking about, you know, around the world,  like a lot of people don't have a dedicated Internet connection.  They use their phone as their only Internet device.  So like these problems, like one of the biggest things I've learned  in talking to Twitter about these issues is just because something is a solution  in America that doesn't mean it doesn't have consequences to other societies.  Like, look at look at, you know, WhatsApp and how that's being used  to spread misinformation in India.  Like, it's really terrifying.  We think, oh, this is great private conversation.  And then it's kind of being used as a vector to spread things that are not true.  And there's no way anybody can stop it.  So, you know, there's a there's a more global view here  that does make what Twitter is trying to do difficult.

Start time: 4058.92
End time: 4134.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I agree. And I would just say, I would just say,  it's not as though all of these problems with Twitter popped up overnight.  And if we're talking about, you know, and that's sort of one technology in one space.  You know, we start thinking about other technologies like  all of the things happening within an artificial intelligence,  genomic editing and CRISPR, autonomous transport.  And there's all these different areas of technology.  It is incumbent upon the people, people, I think,  building the technology to model out risk in advance.  And I've had conversations with Twitter multiple times.  And the thing that I've always heard is, well, we just didn't.  We were just working on the product.  We're just focused on the product.  We weren't thinking about making money.  If I hear one more person say they're focused on the product,  you know, it's possible to focus on the product  while thinking about the ramifications and implications of that product.  And quite honestly, that's what the management team should be doing.  Risk profiling is should be part and parcel of what every tech  company is working on.  And, you know, that that's how we prevent that's how we,  you know, that's how we reverse engineer preferred futures to now  so that Twitter isn't the, you know,  that it doesn't have the kind of problems,  the world changing problems that we're now starting to see.  It didn't happen overnight, you know.

Start time: 4149.04
End time: 4269.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just for the first time in a long time.  And there was a character in there that I was not able to appreciate  as a young person, but as someone 41 in 2019,  I really saw in a different way.  And that was Miles Dyson.  So do you all remember the scene in Terminator 2  where he's got the model of the Skynet thing in his office  and he's ignoring his family and always talking about all the glorious things  Skynet is going to be able to do when it's built?  It's going to be a jet pilot that can fly and will never get tired.  It's never going to make mistakes.  You can be in charge of weapon systems.  And I saw that and I had not seen this movie since I was  like a young 20 something really getting interested in engineering.  And I thought about my perspective back then where I could only see  the glory and the promise about all the things we were building,  like connecting everyone online, you know, information online,  like all this stuff, music online.  And I hadn't really had the capacity in my 20s to think about,  well, what's going to happen to music artists when the only way  they can make a living is to go on tour for forever?  Or what's going to happen to our democracy when there are no editors  deciding what stories are or are not important.  And most of what people are watching is cat videos.  There's something fundamentally  naively optimistic about engineers.  And I count myself among that where we don't think about the ways  the things we build could be misused.  And I think that's something we need to start having very  serious conversations about in school.  Because like you said, Amy, this is over and over and over.  And we just seem to not have the cognitive capacity to think about this stuff.  Well, there's two things I agree with both of you.

Start time: 4269.32
End time: 4291.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They ought to.  So that's the first thing is we've got to stop being naive and start  kind of really thinking of the consequences.  But there's also the issue.  I don't know how doable that is.  I mean, you're a futurist.  Did the tools exist, Amy?  Did the tools exist in 2006 for Jack and Ev to say, well, this is really cool, but.  Yeah.

Start time: 4292.88
End time: 4305.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  So, you know, the role of again, like.  The role of a futurist is not to predict the future.  It's to model out risk and opportunity.  And as a discipline, this has been around for a hundred years.  And it would work.

And that requires data evidence.  So there are plenty of tools.  In fact, all of my I've open sourced all of my research.  So every all of our research, all of our tools, everything is open source.  It's all free.  You can take it, use it, I hope.  Remix it, do whatever you want with it.  And it is totally possible to model out what are all of the plausible ways in which things can go wrong now, just because.  And that is what I do for a living.  So my job is to work with lots of different organizations and all around the world, mostly on risk.  Sometimes on growth and opportunity, too.  But my I'm good at risk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's right. Now, it's really interesting.  But then once we have the risk profile set up and all of the possible ways in which things can go wrong.  First of all, that's not static because there are brand new variables that get introduced all the time and things are constantly changing.  Second of all, somebody's got to be willing to take action.  So the other piece of this is because Brian, I totally agree with you.  Most of the engineers that I know are pretty happy people and they're pretty excited about changing the world in positive ways.  They don't love it when I come in and tell them all the ways in which all of their wonderful work could go horribly, horribly wrong.  Yeah, you know, but but but but better that we acknowledge it so that we can say, well, if this is the case, now we build in this extra feature or now we we erase the corpus that we're using to do this training and we start with something totally fresh that doesn't have all the bias.  Whatever it might be. Or maybe we slow down development a little bit, or maybe we sandbox part of what we're doing and test it under these different circumstances.  What winds up happening is it takes a little longer and it may cost a little bit more money.  And in this day and age, unfortunately, the investors have very little patience.  And so there's this rush to productize and commercialize everything fast, which unfortunately butts up against a lot of risk modeling.  But anyway, Leo, to answer your question, of course it was possible.  You just have to have the fortitude to do it.  And then once you see what the risk profile is to take some kind of action, it doesn't mean that the product has to die.  Or is it too late now?  Yeah. I mean, yes, we've we've seen the risk profile.  I created some of the risk profiles.

Transcript:  I do think computer science is getting to a point where we've kind of tackled the low hanging fruit.  I don't think there's going to be another breakthrough that's happening by the equivalent of like Mark Zuckerberg in his dorm room.  You know, really, really?  Well, yeah, I do, because I think if you think everything that's going to be invented has been invented.  No, no, that's not my point at all.  I think that there is how can I put this?  If you read the Elizabeth Holmes book, one of the things they talk about is how it takes so long to get like next leap breakthroughs in medical science.  And there's a reason why people to get their Nobel prizes there in their 70s, because it we've kind of taken the lower hanging fruit there.  And now it takes like years of research and real understanding to hit breakthroughs.  I think computer science is getting to a point where, you know, there's certainly work smaller teams can do.  But I think increasingly as we're moving forward, it's going to be like teams of 20, 30 people and millions of dollars to build things that are truly useful.  And one of the reasons that makes me feel a little hope for the future is I think that as we think about what the structure of engineering teams needs to be moving forward, I think there is a spot there to have like  ethicists on hand to start thinking about these models and how how those need to be how the things we build could be misused.  I think there is room for a professional standard of ethics for engineers the same way we have those for lawyers.  So I think moving forward, I do think we're going to see a more of a professionalization of software development that I think could help us kind of keep some of these issues in check.

But let's move on because you said something, Amy, that kind of scared me a little bit, which is Hitler would love AI.  And I want to talk about that when we come back.

Transcript:  No, no, I can't put Hitler in the name of the episode.  It's too horrible.  But but but but your point is well taken.  A demo, let's put it this way, a demagogue.  That's right. Would love AI.  And what does that mean?  And I have an example which is going to come up in just a moment.  But first, a word from this is this is the good AI, the nice AI, the AI that aims to please thousand eyes, which really it was.  It's kind of a cool story.  It was founded about 10 years ago at UCLA with really breakthrough research in networks and how they work.  And they got funding from the National Science Foundation.  They created a great company.  And now their tools are available to you.  And I think you should really call it million eyes because what it is, is it's sensors in every part of the Internet.  Thousand eyes, unique path visualization technology extends beyond boundaries.  You can see, understand and improve the experience for all your apps, services and websites right down to the coffee shop from all the way from the cloud to the coffee shop.  There are other typical IT monitoring is kind of passive.  It operates in the silo.  It could see your data center.  But the world is moving to the cloud.  It is a very different experience.  And if you offer software or tools or cloud services, you know, if you're in this business, the things happen and you just go, we can never know.  That's why they draw the cloud as a puffy little opaque cloud.  You we can never know what happened there in the cloud, except now you can't.  It's like you've been looking through a mirrored, smudged window and somebody comes along with a squeegee.  Thousand eyes is the squeegee that gives you a perfect, immediate, unmatched view of all the networks, all the dependencies that impact your users digital experience.  This you are as soon as you try this tool, you're going to say, how did we live without it?  And we can never live without it again.  You know how it is.  You've got a cloud app or a service.  It goes down or worse.  It's worse.  It's not even down.  It's like weirdly slow in certain regions or just something strange is happening.  And you just you have no idea with thousand eyes, you can you can see exactly what's happening.  You don't see people when they're moving to the cloud.  One of the things business loves the cloud.  There's a lot of but one of the things that scares people is as you gain agility with the cloud, you increase risk.  And this is what really scares people.  You lose control.  So suddenly something's going on and you just can't tell what you're scrambling to find the cause.  You're losing revenue.  Employee productivity is declining.  Your brand image is going down.  Your users are clamoring.  They're at the door with pikes and torches going, we're fix it.  What if all of a sudden you had instant visibility into your entire service delivery path from the cloud to your end user, even all the portions you don't own, you don't control because a lot of it you don't.  Thousand eyes is cloud based software.  It's unlike anything you've seen before.  Sensors all over built to help organizations do the cloud right.  A massive array of vantage points.  They span the global Internet, private clouds, even the Wi-Fi in your local coffee shop.  It's it is amazing.  Top banks use it.  Some of the biggest companies in the world, enterprises, SaaS companies, the world's largest and fastest growing brands all use thousand eyes software to do the cloud and do it right.  All I could say is if you are in this business and you do not know what's going on with your cloud, you need to know you need thousand eyes.  Go to thousand eyes dot com slash twit.  See what you've been missing.  They have a great book you can give the boss.  It's an e-book called Five Cloud Migration Challenges You Shouldn't Ignore.  But really, if the cloud is important to you or it's going to be important to your future, you've got to find out about this.  It is an amazing tool.  They just blow me away.  Thousand eyes dot com slash twit.  Thousand eyes dot com slash twit.  Thrive in a connected world.  Have a thousand eyes.  So we've been talking about AI.  We've been talking about social.  We've been talking about how repressive governments might use it.  Now comes the statistic.  We've talked before about China and their social credit scores.  We're now learning that it would be air travelers in China last year were blocked from buying tickets 17 and a half million times for social credit offenses,  including unpaid taxes and fines, five and a half million times from buying train tickets.  This is from this is Chinese information from the National Public Credit Information Center.  In addition, 128 people were blocked from leaving China.  This is social credit.  We talked, Amy, on Friday about China's BRI, their foreign investment and outreach,  and how you think they're going to export the social contract.  Social credit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so that's part of what my new book, The Big Nine, is about.  It's about the nine big companies that control the future of artificial intelligence because they have the lion's share of patents.  They are building the frameworks, the chipsets, the custom silicon.  They are funding and partnering with the schools and the universities where courses are being taught.  And three of those companies are based in China.  Those are Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent.  And while they're independent companies, they very much work under the thumb of Beijing.  And there have been a couple of sort of important things that have happened in China over the past couple of years.  For one, China's president is brilliant.  His name is Xi Jinping.  President for life now?  And they've recently changed how things work.  So he's effectively president for life, which is a very easy way to consolidate power and to push new regulations and big strategies through.  So one of those big strategies is something called the BRI, or the Belt and Road Initiative.  And initially, people thought that this was about China rebuilding its old silk trading route for the purpose of economic development and trade.  However, it's important to look at all of these things with a bigger, broader lens.  So China currently has 58 pilot countries that are not just getting physical infrastructure built, but also digital infrastructure, which is why there is 5G rolling out.  It's just not rolling out in the US.  It's rolling out in part in China, but also among these 58 countries.  They're laying fiber.  They are helping these countries, many of which have autocratic leaders like the Philippines.  They're helping them start to collect data on all of their citizens using many of the same tools and AI and recognition systems and all the rest that are currently in place in lots of vast parts of China.  And this same social, the parts of the social credit score is now being deployed to other countries around the world.  And you may say to yourself, so what?  Like, I'm an American or I'm wherever you have a Canadian, I'm German, I don't I don't live there.  What does that matter?  I think the reason that this matters is, again, if you model out what this looks like over many years to come, to me, it seems entirely plausible.  That China is building, rebuilding the world and subdividing it in a sort of new world order with China at the helm.  And it's entirely plausible.

Transcript:  So I think it's both.  When we talked a little bit about this on triangulation, some of this is that China's got China's approaching one point four billion people.  It's a lot of people spread out over a very big swath of land.  So part of this is social control, in part because while China's economy may have slowed down a little bit, it's on and up.  It is over.  It's upwardly trending.  And all of those people are about China's about to see upward social mobility at a scale we've never seen before in human history.  These people are going to want to buy stuff.  This is good, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The problem is that China can't build and manufacture all the stuff that all of these people need.  So part of this is renegotiating trade agreements and building new trade partners.  So that's part of it.  I will be perfectly blunt.  The other part of this is that China really doesn't love our Western democratic ideals.  They would much prefer to see, you know, a world reshaped where the United States and our allies and our Western democratic ideals are not  the de facto global standard.  They would much rather see their sort of market communism, their sort of special brand of communism as a predominant ideology all over the world.  And if you're not worried about this, take a look.

But I would say I have a father-in-law who is Chinese and immigrated here.  I think it was 1963 and I have a lot of relatives through marriage.  They're native from China.  And I want to say those relationships give me a different perspective on everything that we're talking about here.  I think you're right on, Amy, when you say the structure of China is not really well attuned to American style democracy.  I also want to say it like when I've told Chinese family members the story about Gamergate or they see me in the news, it seems insane to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm trying to be very clear here.  So I'm not defending that.  What I'm saying is there are paradigms in China that took me a while to understand being a Western white woman that kind of married into that family.  Some of them are very, very sexist.  I will never forget when I was at one of my first Christmas dinners with my family of in-laws and all the women were dismissed to the kitchen to go wash dishes while the men sat around and talk politics.  I didn't like that very much.  But there were also paradigms there like the head of the house, the father, ultimately makes the decision.  But every single child has a right that is really recognized in the culture to come forward and plead their case.  So I just want to say like what my experience has been spending 10 years in a marriage to someone with a family from China has been some of my Western assumptions about them socially.  I can see upon reflection how they were a little bit maybe condescending might be the word.  Vice did a really interesting story about the Chinese social media score system.  And it's exactly as you said, people are prevented from like buying tickets to go on high speed trains and they definitely pay a penalty.  But the other side of that I had not seen in Western media was like elderly people paid to go around their town and like find people doing good deeds and reward them with social credit for doing that.  So I want to be clear.  I don't think this is something that we should implement in America.  I think it's contrary to our views here.  I'm just saying that particular society values the whole and the health of society as a whole more than ours does.  We really praise individuality.  And the last I want to say on this is David Brooks.  I saw a video from him this week where he was talking about what ails America.  And yet this guy is conservative.  He's not someone I agree with.  But he was talking about how in America we don't know our neighbors.  We don't. We're suspicious of our neighbors.  We have half as many events at our house today as families did 30 years ago.  And we're more and more distrustful of people.  So I'm just saying they are making a societal choice to use technology in a way that values the whole harmony more than ours does.  And I think ours is better.  But I don't want to just dismiss that as evil because I think that's not really the whole vision.

Start time: 5609.38
End time: 5780.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sure. So there's been quite a bit of fear mongering when it comes to China and a lot of vilification.  So I lived in China and I lived in Japan.  And part of the social credit score system, you know, if you talk to a lot of Chinese people who are not Uyghurs or ethnic minorities of other kinds,  they don't a lot of people don't see this as that big of a deal.  Partially, this is because in Chinese culture, tattling on somebody else as a way to create social harmony is a longstanding tradition that goes back to feudal times.  So this is a way of automating that.  So for us, this seems very strange, the social credit score.  But for others, until they run until they find that they are being restricted, it's not it's not doesn't seem like something that is all that horrible.  Now, the point is, when when this gets exported into other countries where those traditions are not native and the purpose of this is to create control.  And let's again, think this through over many years.  If you have a social credit score and somebody else is determining whether or not you can move freely,  whether or not your kids can go to some good schools or bad schools, whether or not you can apply to get a car or a home loan or any other number of things,  it's likely that your travel to other countries will wind up being restricted to.  From my vantage point, given the data that we have access to right now, it's entirely plausible that the countries that are aligned and using the social credit score  with individuals having social credit scores and perhaps companies having their own version of that kind of a score becomes the new de facto way of making decisions.  And those decisions are being made autonomously by system by AI systems, which means that Americans could wind up not able to travel into countries because we don't have a social credit score.  Or maybe our companies can't do business in certain places because they don't have a social credit score.  So I think we need to take a lot of this much more seriously than I think we have been.  Not in a sort of way that not like looking at this in a fascinating way or fear mongering,  but taking a very pragmatic, practical look at how like what the implications downstream, implications of of all of this is into the future.  We're not thinking about it that way, and we're certainly not looking at how autonomous decision making systems built by a relative few number of people intended to optimize everybody's life  intersects with other areas of life like governing and travel and health and on and on and on.

Transcript:  I agree with every word you just said strongly.  And I think this really backs up one of my main critiques of the Trump era of American government, where we are withdrawing from the world.  If we're not out there bringing our paradigms forward, if we're not talking to other countries about what you know,  how this needs to affect travel, how this needs to affect the things we adopt with loans, if we're not engaging other countries, someone else will.  So I very strongly agree with everything you just said.  And I think it's really on us to to go out and to argue the other side of this.

Transcript:  It's difficult, of course. Cultural differences are very difficult to navigate.  You mentioned cognitive bias a little while ago.  I mean, cognitive bias are us.  We, you know, we, for instance, I've always thought that the collectivist style of life in China had a lot to be admired.  And that here in the United States, where we celebrate individualism, often that's pathological in this country.  And it can be pathological collectivism as well.  So I think it is important to say maybe we need to understand other cultures and maybe understand them a little bit better before we criticize them.  I'm going to take a break. When we come back, we're going to highlight this because there's a big furor.  Talk about outrage, moms. There's a big furor because Google has refused to pull an app from Saudi Arabia  that attracts women, which sounds like a bad thing, but it's complicated as everything is.  And we'll talk about that when we come back.  But it's great to have two brilliant minds here.  And I could just sit back and be the Jell-O boy that I am.

Also, Amy Webb, her book, The Big Nine, talks about these issues in a very trenchant and accessible and yet really provocative way.  I think it's well worth reading how the tech titans and their thinking machines could warp humanity.  Well, I want to talk more about AI, too, because that's really the meat of this subject.  And it is really where we're kind of going to be coming up against some that and CRISPR, I think, in the next few years are going to change everything.  And I wonder how well we can predict what that's going to be like.  But I'd like to hear Amy's suggestions for that.  Meanwhile, let's take a break.

It all came through. See, I wasn't a grown up, so I didn't get bills.  I didn't get any of the negative stuff. I only got the good stuff.  If mail came from me when I was a kid, it was good.

I said, yeah, you want some? Oh, yeah, I'll take some.  It's great.  Will she deliver to the East Coast?  I wish.  No, she's great.  Yeah, I get that postal thing where they send the it's coming.  You know, it's coming. I love that.  So this is controversial.  And I but but but I think if you dig deeper and I want to thank Hacker News, which is a great service,  a new service provided by Y Combinator, because I, like everybody else, read the Business Insider column or article.  If you just even if you just read the headline, it's incendiary.  Bring out the outrage moms.  Google siding with Saudi Arabia refuses to remove widely criticized government app,  which get this, lets men track women and control their travel.  Google has rejected calls to remove a Saudi government app.  They called the Jackie Spear called him, your future colleague, Brianna, from the House of Representatives.  And she said they said, no, the app doesn't violate our terms of service.  Now, you just read this news, you're going to say, oh, but see, I think there's another example of maybe some cultural misunderstanding  and and and and on misunderstanding of what this app really does.  So it is a governmental app.  That provides official services, among them.  A digitized version of the yellow sheet.  So this is the law in Saudi Arabia.  I mean, this is really the problem is this the law in Saudi Arabia for a woman to leave the country.  Her legal guardian, her husband, if not her family, has to fill out a form, not her.  She can't do it.  So she has to say, well, husband, I'd like to leave the country.  Could you sign this?  And and by the way, to prevent forgery, the legal guardian or husband has to show up at the office with the form.  So the point being made by a lot of women in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere is no, this app is great  because, first of all, you don't have to go to the office.  It facilitates getting this permission, which we have to get anyway.  The app doesn't change the rule.  I'll quote a tweet posted by Mona El Tahaoui, who had a female relative in Saudi, a fat Saudi feminist.  Send this, Mona, I hope you're having a great day.  Just wanted to bring your attention aside.  Most feminist activists are forgetting right now.  Abshir, that's the name of the app, is a symptom of a problem, not the problem itself.  In fact, if the public pressure currently circulating on social media against Google and Apple continues,  this could be troubling to Saudi women.  The app is an abomination, of course, but it has helped women rather than the opposite.  Those who want to flee can do so with app access, but never could before with actual paperwork in the previous bureaucratic system.  Guardians would use it as an excuse because it's such it's so hard.  They would use it as an excuse.  My father used to have to physically file paperwork in order for us to travel.  So this is actually in a very perverse way and enabling technology for Saudi women.  And this, to me, is kind of similar to this problem of understanding what the Chinese are doing.  I'm going to give Google a pass on this one.  What do you guys think?

And that's it, which would mean that their app stores and all of the content is not aggregated or I mean, it's it's sort of there's no weight to how any of its aggregated.  There's no recommended lists.  There's nothing like that.  Right.  Or they have to say, you know what, we're a platform and we are making decisions.  And then when they make those decisions, I think they have to be extremely transparent and consistent in how those decisions are being made.  And the problem is that at the moment, they are not doing that.  And to do, you know, and so this is a hard one because this is if they didn't make sure that wouldn't change the law wouldn't change the requirements.

Transcript:  So get out.  So my point is, get out ahead of it.  And, you know, the we the big tech companies are eroding our trust as every day.  Yes. And it's going to be hard to regain it.  However, we can't divorce ourselves from the technology companies either.  So this is creating an acrimonious relationship that I can guarantee you ends in regulation.  Yeah, we are. Right.  I mean, that's right.  And regulation is not good at all because there's not going to be a singular regulation all around the world.  There's going to be lots of different types of regulations.  And ultimately, regulation is going to stifle innovation.  So guardrails are good.  Regulation is bad.  But the only way to avoid that situation is to be very upfront before people get upset, before it's discovered that there's a microphone in your in your thermostat that nobody knew was there.  Right.  And before you put an app in the app store that you know is probably going to be controversial, be transparent in how and why those decisions are being made.  But that sort of thing takes courageous leadership, which we need to start seeing demonstrated now.

But I think a a brave and savvy political leader like you will take this on.  Let's do it.  And this is to me, this is challenging.  So you know, the Jedi contract, which is an artificial intelligence face recognition contract that Google was a it's a 10 billion dollar contract.  Google was going to try to get in the running for.  And thanks to a petition of thousands of Google employees decided, maybe we better stay away from that.  Meanwhile, Jeff Bezos said, well, what the hell's wrong with United States technology companies helping the legally authorized military forces do their job to defend us?  We've got a military. What's wrong with us creating products for the military?  And took the contract or said, I don't remember if they got it or they said they'd take it.  I think they got it. Ten billion dollar contract.  Microsoft, same issue.  Microsoft has faced a petition by a smaller number of employees, 50 employees saying, we don't want you to take this four hundred seventy nine million dollar contract to supply HoloLens to the military.  Sacha Nadella kind of did the Jeff Bezos thing saying Microsoft, this, you know, Microsoft would not withhold technology from democratic governments.  We made a principled decision that we're not going to withhold technologies from institutions that we have elected in democracies to protect the freedoms we enjoy.  I have to say it's very interesting in this country that, you know, it used to be, you know, World War Two, everybody pitched in.  Rosie the Riveter built fighter planes, used to be patriotic.  Now it's it's kind of in some quarters quite the opposite.  Is it because it's AI, because it's such double edged technology?  Is it because it's augmented reality?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think if you know, Amy, you were talking to people at these tech companies speaking up, having more of a voice doing the right thing.  I personally think that's a little bit of an optimistic vision of the future.  But one component of that would certainly be people at these companies having conversations internally about what they're comfortable building.  And I think those are great conversations to have.  I have friends on the Microsoft Azure team that had conversations about their databases being used by, you know, ICE.  So I think that's really good for me personally.  I am running for United States Congress.  I believe in the United States. I want the United States to be safe and secure.  I'm not like an anti-military pacifist.  My father served in the Navy. My grandfather served in World War Two.  So personally, I think when it comes to AI technology, we need to realize that China and other countries are employing this to basically use an information warfare and cyber warfare.  So I think we need to reach out to companies like Google, see if there's work we can do together that everybody can feel good about.  If there's not, I think there's a place for the DOD to fund that research.  But the bottom line is other countries are going to research these things.  So, you know, it's like if you've got the nation next door that's inventing bows and arrows, like we've got to be looking into those things as well.

Start time: 7025.80

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I understand why engineers would say, well, we want to say in what we develop and some pacifists might say, well, we don't want to develop military technology.  But ultimately, the company that you're working for is going to make that decision.  And Nadella says, we'll have conversations with all our employees.  We want to hear them. But at this point, we think it's right.  Now, Amy Webb, I guess I'm going to guess that you're no stranger to the halls of the Pentagon.

Start time: 7049.36
End time: 7242.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I have spent time in the Pentagon.  So you've made that decision personally.  Sure. Listen, I.  The future of the future of our future wars are going to be fought in code, not combat.  They're not going to look anything like we've seen before.  And the reality is that our government outside of the military, but I would argue also inside of the military for many years, wasn't developing and funding.  Our readiness and as a result of that, there are other countries around the world that have become a pacing threat.  So we need to consider that as well as the role that large technology companies have have always played in shoring up our national defense and security.  We've always had that relationship.  I think what's different now, again, is that that society has changed and employees of companies feel that they are that that their employers should be responsible and tell them and be very transparent about all of the projects that they're working on and why.  It was not like that in the 40s, 50s and 60s.  So that has changed.  And and.  There's a there's a pretty big difference between systems that don't require boots on the ground to blow things up and autonomous systems that and vehicles and everything else that are doing that.  In communities where that there are likely to be other kinds of casualties.  But what I would say is.  You know.  That most of us are protected every day from all of the evils that that happen outside of our homes and offices.  You know, we don't have to deal with.  We don't have to really.  I mean, even when things are really bad, like we don't have to think about shoring up our nation's security, somebody's got to do that.  That's, you know, and not just in our country, in every country.  So this this this is challenging.  This is really difficult stuff going forward.  And, you know, it would be terrific if if we could be in a position where there was more collaboration between Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C.  in a way that wasn't purely transactional, because right now it is a transactional relationship and oftentimes antagonistic.  So it would be great if the engineers got to go to the Pentagon and the people in the Pentagon spent significant time out in Silicon Valley.  And there was more of a revolving door between the two so that it wasn't we weren't just talking about Bezos and Amazon negotiating at whatever.  How many billion dollar deal to to build to to use facial recognition technology in a way that makes us all feel bad.  You know, we just we're not in that situation culturally right now, and it's going to take us a while to steer the ship in a slightly different direction.  There are people that are working on this, but there but it would be great if there was more interplay between the Valley and D.C.

Transcript:  Amy, can I add something onto what you just said about future wars being fought in code?  I think that is so dead on.  And if you're someone like me that thinks of violence and war as a last resort,  I would really encourage you to go read a fascinating book by Kim Zetter is called Countdown to Zero Day.  It's about the development of Stuxnet source.  And this is one of the most fascinating cyber weapons has ever been developed.  So we have two choices here.  Iran is developing nuclear weapons and we can either go in and like target them with missiles or send in special forces or, you know, like have a war.  That's option A. What they did was option B.  It's absolutely fascinating what this cyber weapon did.  It was propagated to different versions of I forget which operating system.  I think it was Windows.  It was this one version of this and ended up being targeted towards their centrifuges.

Start time: 7304.68

Transcript:  You know, the scatter controllers in the centrifuges.

Start time: 7307.42
End time: 7378.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. And it got there and started looping the video while controlling the motors inside the centrifuges to make the malfunction and to slowly run until they just ended up like basically breaking down.  What I appreciate about this is it was a solution to a problem where no one was hurt, like no bullets were fired.  And I think this has a lot of things we've got to think about defensively because right now America is on the defense.  But like offensively, I think you would have to be a really extreme kind of pacifist to not think we need that to feel suspicious about employing,  say, facial recognition at our borders to see if like members of ISIS are trying to get into the United States.  Like there are there are there solutions here that save lives.  And I think we should be clear eyed about the abuses that are possible.  And I think that's why technologists need to be in those decisions.  But I think there's a way to really get around some of the horrors of war by engaging in this.

Start time: 7378.34
End time: 7388.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but even Stuxnet isn't all positive.  By the way, does Zetter ever answer the question of who developed it?  Was it the Israelis? Was it the U.S.? Was it a joint effort?

Start time: 7388.32
End time: 7389.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've heard Israelis, but yeah.

Start time: 7390.14
End time: 7485.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. So it's not a complete positive because a Stuxnet escaped, weaponized against all of us.  And there's some argument that even though it might have initially slowed down the Iranians, all they did was secure their systems better.  And step up their nuclear development program.  So maybe that's a fair point. Maybe it works. Maybe it didn't work.  It's you know what? Here's the deal.  In everything we've just talked about, it's complicated.  It's really, really complicated.  And, hey, I want to say, Brianna, I think it's a temptation for politicians to avoid these very difficult moral quandaries  because there isn't a black and white right answer.  And I think also I want to pat ourselves on the back because I think generally in news, people go for the hot take  instead of the nuanced, difficult conversations because there's no obvious answer.  It's difficult and it's thorny and we have to really deal with it.  And I admire you, Brianna, for being willing to say that, to talk about these complicated situations without the obvious hot take  that is the best way to earn votes, unfortunately.  And I want to commend our audience because you have the patience for this.  This is be a lot easier and certainly a lot of news organizations just go for that hot take.  There's certainly a better way to get an audience.  But I think we need to talk about this.  Yeah.  And it's challenging. It really is.

And so peace through strength is is absolutely part of that.  And I'm honestly, if I had to choose, I'd be a pacifist.  But I realize that that's probably not a viable strategy for nation states.

Transcript:  Jonathan, you know what?  People got it, which was kind of cool.  I thought maybe that's too obscure, but no, no.  We're talking to geeks here.  All right. Coming up, our hot take outrage session.  All it takes is one word for me, Facebook.  And they're in it again, ladies.  They are in it again.  But first, a word from our sponsor.  And I love this sponsor, Sophos Cybersecurity.  We use Sophos.  That is our protection at Twitter from the outside world.  We use Sophos hardware and Sophos software to protect ourselves  from all the threats that can bring any business to its knees.  Sophos is really sophisticated.  They are now using artificial intelligence.  They're using deep learning.  Here's the problem.  Hackers can come up with threats faster than the security companies  can come up with defenses.  Well, at least it used to be that way.  Now, thanks to deep learning, which uses neural networks,  to interpret data and respond to threats it doesn't even know about,  you're now safer.  It works instantly.  And this is exactly the kind of protection you need.  No wonder Sophos recently ranked number one.  SE Labs did an independent security test.  The best protection ratings across the barb for both large enterprises  and small businesses.  And now I think they've done something kind of interesting.  They've made they've take this advanced technology that businesses use  and made a premium version for the home for your Mac and for your PC.  It's called Sophos Home.  Real time protection from the latest ransomware attacks,  malicious software hacking attempts.  It can it can detect hacking attempts because it knows what they look like.  Right. It's incredibly easy to use, whether you're simply securing  your own laptop or managing the security of multiple devices in your own home  or around the world, because it is a cloud based system  with an online console.  That means you can sign up for one account and protect all the Macs  and PCs in your home and even in your relatives' homes.  You can keep friends and family secure, even if they're thousands of miles away.  You can remotely manage security, clean up threats, keep systems safe.  I think a lot of us are the IT department for our family members.  And this is a great tool.  You may know Sophos' tagline is security made simple.  The whole thing very easy.  You log in from your browser and you secure your systems today.  And you know everything that's going on.  I really like this method of of kind of keeping track of what's going on.  So bottom line home user or enterprise.  Sophos has you covered some of the largest businesses in the world  use Sophos to stay protected from those ransomware attacks.  Third party reviewers consistently rank Sophos among the best cyber  security providers.  And I love that synchronized security that can manage all your products  from a single cloud based console.  You're going to love it, too.  And it's free. You can try it for free.  It's not free forever, but it's free to try.  And they always have offered.  And we've mentioned this many times, a really good free security scan  that you can run at Sophos, S O P H O S Sophos dot com.  That's it. Just Sophos dot com.  We thank them so much for their support of Twitter.  Facebook. Oh, don't you love Facebook?  And let me just ask before I delve into this.  Do we even need Facebook?

And they sat down with me at the cycle and they're like, Bri,  we know you hate Facebook.  We know you find them epically objectionable.  But the cold, hard fact of it is we ran the numbers  and 20 percent of the people in the district that you need to vote for you  are on Twitter and 83 percent of them are on Facebook.

Transcript:  So Facebook is one of the G mafia in my book and in life.  And and so the center part of the book, I go into an optimistic,  pragmatic and scenarios for the future.  And I guess I will spoil this a little bit, but Facebook doesn't exist  in the future in two of those sets of scenarios.  What's going to take them down?  I don't think it's a matter of what takes them down as much as  how does the business model survive once there are two things happening.  One, again, like I think if we are if regulation becomes unavoidable,  that is a catastrophic blow to Facebook.  And to Zuckerberg said as much to Congress.

Transcript:  The second thing is the what I like to call the diet coke test.  So have you ever noticed that you'll notice if you start looking around  that people who are drinking diet coke tend to be of a certain age  and younger people and by that, I'm like very older millennials, young  Gen X and above drink diet cokes.  Kids don't because they have a good taste.  Well, because they didn't grow up with it, because it wasn't  a cultural touch point.  And there was a and people are they the Pepsi generation?  Is that why? No, they're the bottled water generation.  The energy drink generation.  Right. So anyhow, so Facebook is, you know, has has its own diet coke test coming up.  There's an entire generation of people who who not only didn't grow up  with Facebook as their primary social network, but have been told over  and over again that Facebook is evil.  So I think Facebook, you know, if I would put the odds against Facebook  surviving in the long term, but it exists for right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This explains actually something because and this is one of the stories.  I won't go into all those things that Facebook did wrong this week.  There's not enough time. I want to talk about Elon Musk.  But remember when we were talking about that research program  that Facebook had put on Apple after Apple banned the Onavo  program because it was spying on users.  And so Facebook took the Onavo code, put it in a program with a different name  and then put it out.  And then Apple said, no, no, you can't do that.  Facebook said, no, no, no, less than five percent of the people who,  by the way, chose to participate in this market research program were teens.  Is that legal?  Well, they got oh, and we had and we got written permission from their parents, they said.  Well, it turns out  TechCrunch has obtained Facebook's unpublished  February 21st response to questions about the research program  to Mark Warner, Senator Mark Warner, in the letter to Mark Warner.  They admitted, well, it wasn't five percent, it was 18 percent.  And of course, as you might imagine, the real reason that Onavo existed  and the Facebook research app existed is because they were trying  for the life of them to figure out what the hell kids are doing.  What are they doing?  We got to what program should we buy next?  18 percent.  So they lied.  Fine.

Start time: 8095.10
End time: 8113.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's become the there's it's a pathology.  That's the problem.  Lie and then apologize, then apologize later.  And there's never any consequences.  There's there's I mean, and a fine,  even if a fine gets levied, maybe that irritates investors for five seconds.  And then we all go back to business as usual.

Transcript:  I love Jeremy Birch. We love he's on the Unicode.  It can be the founder of a Moja Mojipedia. Great tweet.  For years, Facebook claimed adding a phone number  was for two factor authentication, right?  You secured your Facebook account.  You had to give a phone number so they could text you, right?  Well, now now it can be searched and there's no way to disable it.  There's no way the original Facebook  number prompt never mentioned that it would be used for anything but two factor.  It does now. They added that months after months afterwards  because they got caught and and they're going ahead.  So you're we knew this because they were because of excellent research.  I think it was from ProPublica, but I can't remember  where they bought ads based on people's phone numbers,  people who had never given their phone number to Facebook except for  two factor.  And just it's I could go on, but I won't.  I did because we want to talk about Elon.  I promised that we would talk about Elon.  Brianna Wu. Yes.  Elon in the in the in the something again.

He would he would get reprimanded.  He would he would get approval from the SEC  before he made any material tweets about Tesla's business.  He just tweeted that Tesla would make 500,000 vehicles this year  and then four hours later saying, I mean, the company's annualized  production rate at the end of 2019 could be around 500,000 vehicles.  The SEC went to the court saying Musk did not seek or receive preapproval  prior to publishing this tweet, which was inaccurate and disseminated  to over 24 million people.  Musk has until March 11th to explain to the court  why he should not be held in contempt.

Transcript:  So I've I've sat there and covered rape cases, murder cases,  really, really serious things.  And one of the things that experience taught me is  you've got to treat judges with an immense amount of respect  and take that process unbelievably seriously.  They're cranky.  What it really bothers me about Elon  is he had the SEC thing before he got his deal  and then he goes on CBS and is just blasting  everyone involved in the most conceited interview I've ever seen.  And then he comes back and he does this.  And I just I I have to say it's like it's so unbelievably arrogant.  I cannot process it.  I understand there's an argument that, well, if you look at what he says,  it could be seen as an honest mistake.  And, you know, let's give him the benefit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He dug it deeper, of course.  He did afterwards.  You know, and he was dissing the SEC.  He said something's broken with the SEC.  So he he, you know, it reminds me of Roger Stone.  And I who was again in trouble with the court after being told, stop it.  He used a great documentary.  Yeah. Isn't it? Get me Roger Stone.  Yeah. On Netflix.  Love it. He used Instagram, not Twitter.  But I would I would I would submit that there's just some people  who should really not be using social media.  And I'm one of them.  I don't because I don't I'm afraid of, you know, the backlash.  I mean, I don't know.  What do you what are you going to do?

But here's what I would say.  We don't know him, but I have to think that as you ascend  throughout the various social strata and economic strata,  I think the closer that you get to the top, the more lonely it is  and the harder it is to get probably affirmation that that feels genuine  in any way. And I just wonder if he tweets stuff out like this,  because he's he needs somebody to sort of like, say,  you're doing a great job.  And he doesn't I don't know.  Maybe maybe he's something totally different,  but maybe he's just very lonely and needs somebody to tell him  he's doing a good job.

Transcript:  The great Gatsby F.  Scott Fitzgerald, let me tell you about the very rich.  They are different from you and me.  They possess and enjoy early and it does something to them,  makes them soft where you're hard and cynical.  We are where we are trustful in a way that unless you were born rich,  it is very difficult to understand.  They think deep in their hearts that they are better than we are  because we had to discover the compensations and refuges of life  for ourselves even when they enter deep into our world or sink below us.  They still think they are better than we are.  They are different.  He wrote that 90 years ago.  It's still true. Gosh. Yeah.

Transcript:  I want to say like you're reading this book about Palmer Lucky recently.  He is someone who got a lot of blowback and ultimately was pressured  and forced to leave Facebook because of some memes  he allegedly funded that were kind of very anti Hillary  and kind of allegedly terrible.  Something I thought that was very interesting about this book  was how much it humanized him.  And I walked away from this book like really feeling like  there was never a story told about this kind of brilliant engineer  that was 19 years old and trying to revive like this dead technology  and trying to figure out positional tracking when no one else could.  It just gave me a very different perspective on that.  And Amy, just bouncing off what you were saying, I have no doubt  there is a a flawed and very likable person there in Elon.  But at the same time, like this isn't  you know, like the SEC is not a show.  Like we have people's life savings tied up in these companies.  And like after Theranos, like if you listen to the podcast,  the dropout, you get to listen to investors that put their life  savings in this company and were destroyed over it.  So I would say it's not personal in feeling like he needs to be held to standards.  This is just the law.  And if he's not going to take it seriously, I think he should meet  his consequences in front of a judge and with due process.

Start time: 8597.10

Transcript:  Yeah, TikTok find five point seven million dollars.  This is the number one app, especially with young people.  If Facebook were wanted another app, this would be the one to buy,  except it's already been bought by ByteDance, a giant in China.  TikTok, which combined musically with TikTok  and is the biggest social media network for the under 20s,  has been apparently collecting information  and illegally collecting information from children under 13.  FTC sued and 15.  I'm sorry, five point seven million dollar fine.  Actually, this goes back to the musically days.  So TikTok kind of got in the heat by buying them.  OK, I'm going to end with one last story that's, I think, an upbeat story  to cheer you all up.  Santiago Lopez from Argentina.  He was a young kid, didn't have a lot of money,  was inspired by the movie Hackers, taught himself how to hack, watching.  And I love this free online tutorials and reading popular blogs.  At the age of 16, he earned his first bug bounty, fifty dollars,  continued to hack after school.  He is now 19 years old, hacks full time.  He's the first teenage hacker to earn one million dollars in bug bounties.  He's reported more than 1600 security flaws to organizations,  Twitter and Verizon, among others, private enterprise,  as well as government entities.  I love this self-taught hacker  from Buenos Aires, from Argentina, Santiago Lopez.  And he learned online.

Start time: 8710.38
End time: 8759.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that's a really great story, the bug bounties work as far as  being not the only component of cyber security, but certainly a component.  And I think for me, one of the plans I would have for United States and cyber warfare  is I think we should radically expand our bug bounty system.  I would love to have people penetration testing, like schools, hospitals,  other non-military infrastructure and figuring out how to make it more secure.  And I think about the number of women I know personally who have amazing engineering skills  and have left the field because they feel like the culture isn't worth it.  How awesome that would be if they could do this kind of work and pursue these bounties  in making our schools and hospitals safer.  I think it's a great idea.

We're having a really big release this week.  It's a completely redone site.  But one of the things that it was really hard for me to do as a candidate is we have a bunch  of videos telling people about my life.  I can tell people about Gamergate, but one of the things that is really hard for me to  talk about as someone running for public office is, you know, I was adopted, which meant my  first family just threw me away when I was born.  And then when I came out to my parents in my 20s, they disowned me instantly.  And I lost my second family as well.  And I talk a lot about how that struggle to find myself and to come back really kind of  defined my politics and my commitment to my neighbors and the people around me.

Start time: 9059.27

Transcript:  Yeah, it may be a little later because I'm getting off the radio show at 2.  And we'll come over.  It's a long commute across the hall, but I'll try to make it in 15 minutes.  So if you want to watch the show live, start thinking about doing it at 2 15 Pacific,  5 15 Eastern.  That's 22 15 UTC.  You don't have to watch live.  It's fun too if you do go in the chat room at irc.twit.tv.  Everything we do really is on demand.  That's the whole point of it.  And you can find those shows on demand at our website, twit.tv.  Just subscribe if you can.  Find your favorite podcast application and say,  I want to listen to This Week in Tech every week.  And that way you'll have it for your Monday morning commute.  If you want to be here in studio and a great studio audience,  all you have to do is email tickets at twit.tv.  We'll make sure there's a chair out for you.  Thanks for being here.  We'll see you next time.  Another twit is in the can.
