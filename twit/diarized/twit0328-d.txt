Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh I didn't know that. That's neat. I haven't seen that part yet. I'll show you. Yeah we'll do a little demo.  Also here Mike Elgin, Mr. Google+. You don't work for Google+. But you should. I don't get paid by Google+.  I certainly help them a little bit. You certainly spend a lot of time there. It's where your newsletter  originates. Of course Computer World is the place where... Do they still do paper edition?

Start time: 219.38
End time: 224.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think so. I don't get involved in paper edition. So you're just the online owner. I'm also on Cult of Mac.

Start time: 224.42
End time: 259.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah I've been reading your Cult of Mac column. Is that something new? You've been doing a lot of stuff there.  I've been quoting that a lot. Your ears are burning. Because I'm always saying, Mike Elgin told me.  My eyes are burning too because I watch it. I watch your shows. If your eyes are burning consult a doctor.  Speaking of consulting a doctor, Kara Swisher is here. And in good health and we're so happy to hear that.  We were a little worried. She was at All Things D Asia. Asia D. And had a little temporal ischemic attack.  No it was a stroke. I had a stroke. Don't be scared of the word.

Start time: 260.32
End time: 271.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not a TIA? It was technically. Most TIAs are strokes. They just don't have an MRI.  People don't do MRIs when they have these TIAs because they're so small.

Start time: 272.38
End time: 281.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's good you got an MRI. You got great care. You felt better quickly. You were blogging within minutes I think.  I couldn't believe how fast you were writing. But you did miss, unfortunately you missed the stage stuff.

Start time: 282.80
End time: 298.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes I did. But my fantastic staff, Ina Fried and Peter Kafka filled in for me. And Walt of course was on stage.  And they did a great job. It shows that I'm completely not completely dispensable. Which is great.  That's bad. No it's good to know. My grandmother used to say that the graveyards are full of indispensable people.

Start time: 299.36
End time: 302.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's true. Well it's so good to see you and have you back.

Start time: 303.14

Transcript:  Thank you. I'm very well. It was the shortest stroke in history.

Start time: 307.42
End time: 313.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Short stroke is probably better than a long stroke. But no stroke is a good thing.  You can make a joke. It's okay. It's fine. There's plenty of jokes.

Start time: 315.58

Transcript:  Oh that's mother material. That's power.  I do not do that to my poor children. That is power. I love that.  So it was Internet Censorship Day on Thursday. I hope you all called your congress critters to complain about.  I think it was SOPA. And in the Senate it was IPProtect.  Protect IP. I'm hoping that one person on this panel will argue in favor of these measures.  There are some people who say... Well the guy in charge of the RIAA said it's not as bad as you think.

Start time: 358.40
End time: 368.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well I had Mitch Glazier on my show on the round table.  He made a compelling case. Of course that's his job. It's his only job.  As far as I can tell. To have the lines to make the case.

Start time: 370.40
End time: 382.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stop Internet Piracy Act and IPProtect.  Both do essentially the same thing which gives the government the right to break DNS if a site is a pirate site.

Start time: 382.88
End time: 413.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What they do is they give the... DNS companies have to subscribe to this list of bans.  A black hole.  Yeah. And then if a site comes up on that they have to make the DNS not refer to it.  That becomes illegal to refer to a site that is on the black list.  It's a federal offense to resolve that IP address.  It is a federal offense to give anybody a direct link to one of these sites.  It also means you can't publish a list of physical IP addresses.  A printed list and hand it out. That would also be illegal.

Start time: 413.48
End time: 432.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It would be also in some versions illegal to circumvent using proxy.  They want the ISPs to assist and they're looking to web hosting companies to be a little bit more assiduous in preventing copyrighted materials from being on those sites.  They're really putting the responsibility in their hands.

Start time: 433.32
End time: 460.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are two businesses that get wrapped up as the enforcement arm of this.  One is the web host. Anybody who has links could get wrapped into it.  And then the backbone of the internet, the DNS.  Which would make the United States internet different.  It would be like China or Iran where the internet that we see is different from the internet that everybody else sees because the DNS is under the control of some government arm.

Start time: 461.48
End time: 473.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that the chief complaint against this?  Is that it changes how the internet works?  Is it the fear that content companies will be overly aggressive in pursuing companies?

Start time: 474.80
End time: 508.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like the DMCA, and I'm going to start throwing these letters around and start getting them wrong probably.  Like the DMCA, some of this isn't necessarily legal, requires a warrant.  That's an issue. There's no due process. That becomes a big issue.  The issue of due process is the main one.  Commercial interests can basically, the argument goes, end up taking a site down by having it poisoned out of the DNS system.  The guys at the RIAA will say no, that's not the case. But that is the main complaint I think.

Start time: 509.96
End time: 522.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Microsoft's position on SOPA, no comment.  They did support the Protect IP Act.  Apple and the Business Software Alliance and others support it.

Start time: 523.80
End time: 528.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are they tying this to domains? Are they tying this to IPs? How are they actually going to stop this?

Start time: 529.48
End time: 542.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think what they do is they say if you search for a domain and it has offending IP addresses the result,  you will get either nothing or in some cases you will get a site that says piracy is very bad.

Start time: 544.10
End time: 552.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Pirates are going to swap their IPs out in 30 seconds and have a new IP and then all of a sudden another one gets added to the list.  Does the old one come off? It's just a nightmare.

Start time: 553.16
End time: 571.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly. The poor hosting company, innocent hosting company, who put up this site, gets taken down completely.  Although again, the guy from the RIAA says actually it's the page that becomes illegal.  That page has to be taken out of line.  You know that's how impossible that's going to be to manage.

Start time: 572.52
End time: 621.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have a number of sites, including my personal sites, not Twitter, but my personal sites had popped up on Thursday.  Internet censorship day. This site could be blocked. This is what you could see.  Call your member of Congress.  Tumblr did an amazing thing. They got 87,000 calls to Congress.  The average call length, 53 seconds. The longest call, 31 minutes. I wouldn't want to be on the other end of that one.  1,293 hours talking to representatives. That is amazing.  Good for Tumblr. I understand why Tumblr would be worried because there's a ton of infringing content on Tumblr.  And a ton of great content on Tumblr.  Should we defend Tumblr? This is the thing. I'm trying to find somebody who's going to say,  well wait a minute, maybe I'll say it. Wait a minute. Piracy is bad. It costs everybody.  Shouldn't we do something to protect intellectual property? Is there something so wrong with this?

Start time: 622.48
End time: 629.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This particular method is wrong. But no, of course you should protect.  Go after all kinds of things, but this way is kind of ridiculous.

Start time: 630.56
End time: 694.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The thing I don't like about it is that the fear is that offshore companies that are outside the jurisdiction of the U.S. government  will be doing all these things and they are unreachable essentially.  So let's strangle the throats that are available. Companies that are in the use, put the burden on them.  Create potential security problems for them. Create all these workload problems.  And essentially change the way the Internet has functioned before, which is that people who are just conduits for content  are not liable for that content. Now they're switching it around and saying,  okay, well you have to do something about content that somebody said is pirated content.  That's a shift in the traditional approach that the U.S. government, not the Chinese or the Iranian governments,  the U.S. government has taken toward the Internet. It's a bad trend.  And for the most part, most of the defenders are saying, well, probably nothing is going to happen in real life.  And that may or may not be true, but that's not how laws are supposed to work.  It's not supposed to be a situation where...  Don't worry, trust us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mel Watt, Democrat, North Carolina, in a Judiciary Committee hearing early this week,  says it's beyond troubling to hear hyperbolic charges that this bill will open the floodgates to government censorship.  It's a long way saying...

Start time: 715.12
End time: 724.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I love trusting those politicians to Internet stuff.  They've always been...  It goes back to when I used to be at the Washington Post.  It's the same business they like to make noise about and then they settle down.

Start time: 725.42
End time: 742.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The bigger picture is that every new technological change, there's a power grab by officials and governments.  Let me give you one example that sounds completely unrelated.  It used to be 100 years ago when the police would interrogate someone.  There were no cameras, no microphones running.

Start time: 743.10
End time: 744.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We know there are cameras now.

Start time: 744.66
End time: 777.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We'll talk about that in a bit.  Only for the other side.  See, now that there's cameras, the law enforcement agencies have reserved for themselves the right to record interrogations.  But they don't let you do it.  So they've seized on the development of this new technology to change the balance of power between suspects and the police.  This happens every time there's new technology.  This is another example of that.  Where there's new technology, there's the Internet, people can pirate content now and distribute it globally.  This provision in this House bill is a grab.

Start time: 779.95
End time: 787.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A grab from the big media companies.  The U.S.-based big media companies.  Exactly.  Using their paid henchmen and women to converse.

Start time: 788.36
End time: 807.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One of the great things about SOPA, according to Larry Downs, is that part of the bill is a study to figure out how much piracy is actually costing us.  It's funding.  So we don't actually...  We don't know.  We're going to find out.  After we pass a bill against it.

Start time: 807.68
End time: 815.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I already doubt the results.  Because what they're going to say is the value of what was taken is equivalent to what would have been sold.  They can't solve any questions.

Start time: 816.22
End time: 841.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They can't deal with this many years ago if they hadn't been so onerous in releasing stuff digitally.  They taught a generation of people to steal.  I know that's unfortunate for them, but I used to cover them all the time.  They just wanted the Internet to stop.  I remember after the Web 1.0 thing collapsed, a pretty prominent media executive said to me,  Thank goodness that's over.  They meant the Internet.  I was like, it's not.

Start time: 842.74
End time: 867.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Remember when the Black Friday ad sites popped up and retailers sued them.  Saying you're publishing our coupon information prior to Black Friday.  This is going to kill us because people will know where the best deal is.  And that's going to put us out of business.  Fortunately they've kind of wised up.  But this happens every time, doesn't it?  That the rights holders, the people in power, the people who say, God, the Internet's going to kill us.

Start time: 867.76
End time: 883.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We see our stuff getting stolen on lots of sites.  All things D.  I'm sure Mike, you have the same experience.  It's not something we like, but it's also not something we're going to attack everyone.  We're going to shoot everyone for the problems.  In fact, you can make a case of giving stuff away as a good way to promote the stuff that's paid.

Start time: 884.24
End time: 884.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Some of it.

Start time: 886.32
End time: 908.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just you have to have this idea.  The ideas I always say in a lot of these meetings is the kids seem to love this Internet thing.  So you might want to get on board.  They're like, haha.  No, no, really the kids love it.  It's done.  It's a question of how, you know, they certainly come a long way.  I mean, the things you could get now are available on streaming.  I mean, I now use Roku.  I've got Apple TV.

Start time: 909.76
End time: 913.74

Start time: 917.76
End time: 921.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I still use cable.  I mean, Law and Order is still not on the Internet.

Start time: 921.76
End time: 922.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and you need the Internet.

Start time: 923.90
End time: 935.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The problem is you're buying the bits wholesale.  Yeah, absolutely.  And I spend a lot of money, actually.  I spend a lot of money on the Senate version of the bill.  It's not going through.  It's not going to happen.

Start time: 936.40
End time: 937.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pelosi's on it.

Start time: 938.28
End time: 965.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's in committee.  He told Don Risinger on CNN.  I don't believe this bill has any chance on the House floor.  It's way too extreme.  It infringes on too many areas that our leadership will know.  Thank God we have leadership.  That our leadership will know is simply too dangerous in its current form.  Is there a tempest in a teapot, or is there really a threat?  I mean, this is not the first time IPProtect.  There was Kauaika.  This is a guacamole.

Start time: 966.80
End time: 969.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It keeps happening again and again.  And it will keep happening.

Start time: 970.84
End time: 974.74

Transcript:  They won't pass it.  The tech companies now have two good lobbies themselves.

Start time: 974.80
End time: 984.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're starting to really...  The House does this a lot more than the Senate.  They throw stuff in there, and they're like, hey, what if it passes? Wow, wouldn't that be great?  These are the same guys who declared pizza and french fries as vegetables this week.

Start time: 985.04
End time: 1009.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because pizza has tomato sauce.  Exactly.  That's an argument out of the 80s.  I know! Reagan saying school lunches had ketchup.  It's back, baby.  Well, good.  I'm glad we can declare victory on this.  I think one other thing, it's not just the internet companies.  I think that voters are a little more aware.  And I think that that campaign, that internet-wide campaign to stop censorship is probably pretty infective.  Well, back to your point about tempest in a teapot.

Start time: 1009.42
End time: 1023.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think it was the tempest that shuts this down.  I mean, we really need to have the kind of response that we need.  We really need to have the kind of response that the public had over this in order to shut these down.  Because without it, it would have just possibly sailed through and become the law of the land.

Start time: 1023.84
End time: 1026.89

End time: 1042.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the kids...  Well, you know, you were talking about cameras.  We're going to take a break, but I want to talk a little bit about the UC Davis thing.  Because that's interesting.  There are cameras everywhere now, and they're not just in the hands of law enforcement.

Start time: 1043.40
End time: 1048.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Why do the police keep doing these things?  Do they not see the 50 cameras that are pointing at them?

Start time: 1048.36
End time: 1051.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that scares me a little bit. Maybe they're going to wise up and do it in the dark from now on.

Start time: 1051.48
End time: 1059.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's almost like they have to be on the side of the protesters, because nothing helps the movement more than spray painting some sophomore in the face with a spray.  With a pepper spray.

Start time: 1061.36
End time: 1068.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Talk about that in just a bit.  You know what I'm going to bring with me? My clipboard.  So you're going to have to tell me, Eileen, what fine sponsor we're talking about today.

Start time: 1068.36
End time: 1071.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, first up is our fabulous sponsor, GoToMeaning.

Start time: 1071.88
End time: 1250.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How did I know? GoToMeaning from Citrix? Of course it is.  If you have tried to have a meeting with your far-flung colleagues and clients, you know that nowadays we live in a global world, and it's so hard.  Global world. That's kind of redundant, isn't it?  We live in a global business environment, and it's so hard to gather people together, especially for an impromptu meeting.  But even just for that weekly staff report, this is GoToMeaning for years.  I've used it as a really effective way to get these meetings done.  First of all, easy to start a meeting. You click a button on your Mac or your PC.  The email goes out. They get a link.  Very easy, even if it's a client that you're pitching, and they don't know what you're talking about.  They click the link. The Java thing pops up and says, allow this?  And they say yes, and they've got it, and it's running.  Now they're seeing your desktop, but it's more than just your desktop now.  GoToMeaning has just added HD video conferencing.  And this is, we've been doing these.  The quality, everybody now has such great cameras in their laptops.  They've got Internet. The quality is so good on these.  It is actually rivals the $100,000 telepresence systems the corporate boardrooms installed a couple of years ago.  And you can use it right from your desktop. It's so fantastic.  I want you to try it for free.  I'm going to give you an offer code in a second for 30 days free.  GoToMeaning.com, and the offer code is TWIT.  And you know what else is really cool?  GoToMeaning, now you can attend meetings not just from your desktop, your computer,  but from your iPad, your iPhone, your Android phone too.  It means more and more of these meetings will be held in unusual locations, shall we say.  Yeah, I think you know what I'm talking about.  GoToMeaning.com.  Yeah, I know it's a little echoey, but I'm here. I'm watching the meeting.  It's amazing. GoToMeaning.com.  Try it free.  Click the try it free button and use the offer code TWIT.  You'll be amazed. Don't turn on the camera though.  Actually, I don't think you can use the camera if you're on an iPhone or Android phone.  Just the desktop.  It's probably a good thing.  GoToMeaning.com. We thank them so much for their support.  They're great folks at Citrix.  Yeah, I thought it was very interesting. This is a big meme going around now.  Of course, it was Google Plus, Mike, that I first learned about at the UC Davis protesters.  First of all, I don't want to weigh in on the politics of this or the law enforcement of it.  Because all we see is a camera phone video.  But it sure looks like they were sitting there quietly.  And one of the police officers came up and just kind of sprayed them a little bit with pepper spray.  And whether there was rationale for it, we don't know.  Maybe one of the kids was about to... I don't know what was going to happen.  But it just shows you there's cameras everywhere, there's camera phones everywhere.  And this stuff goes straight to the Internet.  And to watch those pictures on Google Plus, kind of side by side with Tahrir Square pictures of protesters throwing back tear gas and things like that.  Pretty dramatic. I thought it was very interesting.

Transcript:  What's interesting about all that is that all of these confrontations between protesters and police are about the protesters saying,  we can be in some location, and the police saying, we don't want you to be in that location.  Because they've been given orders by somebody else.  They don't want them in the park. They don't want them in the sidewalk.  They don't want them in the street. They don't want them blocking businesses.  Whatever it is.  And so there's this... the argument over where you're allowed to stand as a mob is fueling this entire movement.  Because it's those images that's drawing people to it, to feeling outraged and stuff.  It's completely unrelated to the issue of so many rich people, so many poor people and all that stuff, which is really what it's all about.

Some protester said something to one of the white-shirted New York police officers, who's one of the senior guys.  And he just hauled off and clocked this guy.  And the cameras that came out of the woodwork and everything pointed to this point where this was happening.  It was just amazing. Literally like 500 cameras came out of nowhere and were filming the whole thing.  Incredible.

Transcript:  The big difference between 1984 and what we have now is we have cameras in every home pointed at everyone.  The difference is that the government didn't put them in there to watch you in one direction.  We went out and bought them. We sought them out.  And we opened the doors to our private lives because we love it.  And so it's a democratically grassroots incentive rather than a 1984 thing.  In North Korea, of course, it's 1984 where they actually have radio broadcasts that you can't change the channel.  You can't turn it off.

It was actually being discussed the way that the government found out about it.  The prosecutors was. It was in a discussion group online.  And then they started investigating that.

I'm surprised Apple didn't buy a big full page ad in the New York Times.  Welcome Google. Seriously.  That's understood.  And yet I think there's some important things.  Yes they are missing a big label, Warner Music.  But they've got the rest.  They have 8 million songs but they say we've got to upload them.  Or whatever it is they do.  What do they do?

I wish maybe Spotify could take a page from this.  If you're an independent artist you don't have to go through CD Baby.  You put your song up there. You create a page.  You get 70 cents on the dollar for the sales.  It's very good for independence.

They're so glad for this moment in time that they are here on the show.  Actually, Ford is doing some amazing stuff.  Thanks to their new CEO.  He's been there three years, four years now.  Alan Mulally.  Came from Boeing.  Engineer, I like that.  He was the guy who said, you know what, there's going to be a little tough time in the economy.  Let's make sure we shore up our finances so we don't have to take money from the government.  They didn't take money from the government.  He also was the guy who designed the 777 cockpit at Boeing.  And I think if you look at modern Ford vehicles, you might see a little correlation there.  He's a great guy.

I think that this vision is happening thanks to Ford Sink and my Ford Touch.  By the way, it's interesting.  I can't remember, used to be a Ford.  It used to be you'd buy a car and it's unchanged until you sell it.  My Ford Touch, they're going to send out next year 250,000 USB keys so people can plug it into their car and update the My Ford Touch software.  Because people were saying it's too hard to use.

I understand some people did.  It's going to be updated because it's software.  The Ford Sink, you talk to your car.  This is Siri three years ago.  In fact, now they've got the Wi-Fi access spots.  We always talk about Ford Sink and I always forget that primarily this is a GPS system.  It is simply put the best GPS system I've ever used.  If you haven't used the Ford Sink GPS, you're going to be in trouble.  It will get you there.  Little things that are nice, better than an aftermarket GPS because it integrates with the car.  For instance, when you get to the 50 mile left warning,  all the gas stations pop up on your GPS.  You just know where the nearest gas station is.  It will tell you where the lowest prices are.  The incredible EcoBoost engines, the electric engines, the plug-in hybrids.  I'm on the list for a 2012 electric Ford Focus when those come out.  I'm very excited about that.  In fact, that's where you'll see this MyFord Touch and Sink.  It's best advantage is in that 2012 Ford Focus.  My key for teenagers, you don't need this yet, Kara, but you're going to.  It tells the car what the maximum speed can be,  the maximum volume on the audio.

Transcript:  It is about price. And here's what I think Amazon is going to do  with the upcoming phone.  They're going to target the youth market.  They're going to have a subsidized phone.  Free? Might as well do it free, right?  Free or close to free.  You don't want it to be completely free because then you get all the people  who will never spend anything gobbling up resources.  You get people to sign up for a music service, for example,  and they get a free phone.  This is really compelling to a lot of teenagers  and young people who don't have parents  who buy them their own little iPhone,  which is the majority of young people.  And this could be a huge problem.  This could be a huge benefit for all of Amazon's digital offerings  and movies and music and stuff like that.  Where's the new sidekick going to be?  Sidekick?  Remember sidekick for a while?  Yeah, I remember sidekick.  It was the hot phone for young people.

The expense of creating these things  could be quite high and the expertise levels that are needed.  But it seems like mobile is where  most of Microsoft's customers are using Facebook.  You either decide your HBO and all the cable companies  have to have you,  or you worry that perhaps someday they might not have to have you.

Transcript:  When they're saying that they're Facebook,  they are terrified of Google.  And they don't have a good relationship with Apple.  They've tried at various times.  I think they were...  Someone just the other day who would know was telling me  that they were surprised by the Twitter deal that Apple did.  But they've had a very difficult...  Not the same kind of bad relationship  they have with Google, but it's definitely  a very troubled relationship with Apple.  And so, and that's their natural ally, I would think.  Well, Microsoft is their natural ally now.  No, it's their ally.  Their only ally.  Well, Microsoft has Skype.  I just think Skype is one of these things they bought  that didn't really... I think it's a very valuable thing  in the phone area. It could be.  Skype replaces cell phones.  What if they... I mean, this is just me.  I sit around and a lot of people say,  how do you come up with your scoops?  I just sit around and think of what could happen  and then start to check it as if it's true.  Sort of like three days of the condor,  and like imagine things.  And one of them to me is, what if Microsoft sold Bing  to Facebook or gave Bing to Facebook?  What if they sold Skype to Facebook?  Or did something where they got more stock?  I mean, you could start to think of some really  interesting scenarios in that case.  And so you need a phone.  Like, what if there was a Skype integration with a Facebook?

They have all this huge install base.  That's great.  But these aren't really the people that are going to be using my app.  They're going to install it and actually get some use out of it.

And of course I would never have gotten 25 hours in 10 minutes.  Dylan Baker reads it.  I would not have gotten through it had I not had the audio version.  But I listen in the car. I listen at the gym.  I listen at night. I listen while I'm washing the dishes.  And you know, it took me less than a week to read.  What is normally a very long read.  Because of that.  So really that's the idea.  You get more reading done.  They've got 100,000 titles.  And if you go to audible.com slash twit2  You can pick two of them.  That's a two book a month subscription.  And the first month is free.  The first two books are free.  You can cancel it any time and they're yours to keep forever.  As you can see, current events.  Classic science fiction.  Childhood's End would be such a wonderful book.  I won't tell you that there's a little bit of a twist at the end.  I won't tell you about that.  In fact all the Arthur C. Clarke stuff is now on here.  Because Audible has a program to record.  They call it Audible Frontiers.  Classic science fiction that's never been available in audio.  It's a great way if you're catching up or your kid is catching up.  The Solaris that they did.  They actually commissioned a better translation.  Because Lem always thought that the translation of Solaris was a botch.  And so he supervised a new transition.  And this is fantastic.  If you haven't read.  Maybe you saw the movie.  There was a terrible movie that was very dull.  But this is a great book.  Solaris, the definitive edition.  And it's a great book.  And it's a great book.  And it's a great book.  Solaris, the definitive edition.  It's a brand new translation.  Anyway, audible.com slash twit two.  I hope I've shown you some great things.  I just read The Wind Up Girl.  That's really interesting.  It's really good.  Paolo Bacci Gallupi.  Very interesting book.  My next book is 1Q84 which is about 500 hours.  But that's the thing.  You can get aggressive about your reading.  And you get much more time to read.  Or Breaking Dawn, The Twilight Saga Book 4.  How could you like the movie and not want to read the book?

He's the worst actor but then he pulls off his shirt anytime something goes wrong.  And then that's fine.  That's what I do.  He's very nice.  He's a very handsome man.  But it's interesting.  What was interesting is a lot of the tech in the movie.  There's tech in Twilight?  At one point they pull up a lot of Apple computers.  I doubt Apple paid for anything because they never pay for placement.  But then he's going to look up the whole baby thing.  Like what the hell is going on with Bella?  She's dying.  And he pulls up and he goes to search and it's Yahoo search.  And the whole audience goes what?  The most unbelievable moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it was interesting to watch their tech.  So they're telling me that 1Q84 you should say 1984.  It's pronounced Sade.  It's spelled 1Q84 but it's pronounced Sade.  I don't get that.  Because Q is 9 in Japan in Japanese.  So you pronounce it 1984 but it's 1Q84.  The vampires and werewolves were more believable than Yahoo search.

Start time: 5001.04
End time: 5012.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Exactly.  And so there's no question that TV is part of that  because it's a horrible experience for everyone.  We just were talking about how horrible it is.  I mean, the cable companies, everything about cable companies is awful.  Especially the interfaces.

Start time: 5013.88
End time: 5016.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's funny because the previous thing was cell phone companies,  which is also awful.

Transcript:  We got the Apple TV and I had the Comcast.  The Roku controller is very simple.  But I literally...  My mother, I was trying to explain Apple TV to her  and I go, look at the Apple thing,  look at the Comcast thing.  And she's like, gosh, those are different.  She had the Apple one in two seconds.  She was able to use the Roku one, but it was still confusing to her.  But it was interesting.

Start time: 5037.90
End time: 5053.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they're software guys. They know how to put on the screen  what apparently Comcast puts on the remote control.  I think it's interesting though that Netflix is...  So that's the delivery side,  but on the content side,  Netflix is essentially trying to create an $8 a month HBO.  But I love this concept

Start time: 5054.49
End time: 5059.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  that the Internet is a farm program  for a TV series.  Well, this is the opposite.

Start time: 5059.88

Transcript:  One in development becomes really popular online,  then it goes to the prime time.  And then when it fades and it still has some hardcore fans,  it goes back to the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think, in fact, we had Dana Brunetti on,  who's the guy who sold House of Cards to Netflix.  His company Trigger Street is Kevin Spacey's production company.  And Dana said, look, this is the future.  This is the way it's going to be.  There's a temporary period where you have these players.  But ultimately, content creators are going to sell it  as close to direct to the customer as possible.  I think an app is the best way to go, right?  Instead of an arrested development on Netflix,  an arrested development app.  That'll make sense.  You pay a couple of bucks, now that's my app.  And think of all the additional features you can build into it.  Let's say a Glee app.  Well, the Glee has a great app, actually, a karaoke app.

Start time: 5105.56
End time: 5113.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It'll probably be subscription based, right?  You'll go and you'll get ABC and you'll pay like the $5 a month  or whatever.  Forget ABC. That's the point. Forget ABC.

Start time: 5113.56
End time: 5140.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You just say they'll just be able to create their own.  Then you have the same problem that you have  with the music industry  and with publishing, which is that  the word has to get out.  Now, social media can do so much.  The challenge with television is that it's expensive to produce.  It's not one guy in a garage  for three years writing a book, which then hopefully  he can sell either by himself or with an agent.  TV requires a whole different infrastructure  to make the advertising model work

Start time: 5140.52
End time: 5151.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  because it's expensive.  That's the difference between apps that are self-funded  versus, you know, like right now,  what was lost, a million dollars an episode  or something like that to produce.  Who's going to put the money up front for that?

Start time: 5152.42
End time: 5154.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you still need these big production companies.

Start time: 5154.40

Transcript:  The thing with apps is, I mean, Angry Birds  was probably created for 50K or whatever.

Start time: 5159.44
End time: 5161.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it was like their 60th app, by the way.

Start time: 5161.75
End time: 5164.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But there are TV shows that can be done  as cheaply as Angry Birds.

Start time: 5165.24
End time: 5166.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 5167.24

Start time: 5175.24
End time: 5190.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But that's one type of TV that is inherently expensive.  But things like reality TV, like,  you could do a reality show for a thousand bucks.  Please don't.  I think we call it twit, actually.  Or Jersey Shore or something like that.

Start time: 5190.42
End time: 5213.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That costs a lot of money.  If everybody would please talk like this, I'd be much happier.  There's money in it.  Well, the thing is,  once you see that there's money  in creating these apps,  you take the successful app  and then you reinvest them.  I mean, it's just building a new business.  It's not that you don't have to go back to ABC  to make a hundred million dollar show.  You just have to make a hundred million dollars

Start time: 5214.16
End time: 5222.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  then you can make the hundred million dollar show.  Or you look at something like Annoying Orange this week.  It finally got the Cartoon Network deal.  But it got really popular online and it's really funny.

Start time: 5222.92
End time: 5224.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 5225.30

Transcript:  I don't believe they do.

Start time: 5226.96

Start time: 5229.75
End time: 5238.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe millions of dollars.  But they're doing everything.  They just move from thing to thing that makes sense to them.  So, to me, that's what's going to happen.  You must know a little bit about this, Kevin,

Start time: 5238.94

End time: 5261.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do they make more money now than they were making as a YouTube hit?  Oh, sure. Absolutely.  So maybe that is the case, that you have to migrate then from YouTube.  Where it makes sense.  They can sell your ads in their case, because their content is free.

Start time: 5317.44

Start time: 5319.56
End time: 5325.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think he had it before they go out on the road show.  So he was planning to leave, you can't go on a road show and say,  by the way, our chief business officer is going to quit.
