Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  personal bartender I like to I you know that when you talk about drinking I like  to take my own personal bartender with me can you believe that is that wacky  we're not joking Alberto went with him yeah so Alberto from cocktails on the  fly came out we did a little get-together which was a lot of fun yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  taking my breath away I'm telling you we are also we are also streaming this for  the first time we've used talk shoe in the past to stream audio and and now I'm  streaming video and audio which is really wacky unfortunately I hadn't had  time to get the principles to set up their own streams but but Jonna and  will and Alex and Doc I think in future it's a very simple thing to do you  stream just uses flash to capture any webcam so in fact we could have and I  would love to do this a page of all of us and people could sit watch the page  and watch all of us and really don't think that's kind of screw up the Skype  connection a little bit I'm using it right now it doesn't seem to be making  well yeah but you're sitting on a big pipe it's nobody it's a single flow  understands a single flash stream I mean they're doing all the other streams  it's kind of interesting we have two hundred twenty one people in the chat  room seventy five live video viewers I think it's a very interesting idea  anyway we'll play with this in future be a way to do a video twit without ever  having to leave our homes which is frankly our dream I don't think it's a  dream of Alex's Alex travels on when are you going to Africa I leave next week  all right so the last one let's let's start with the somber story but but the  big story you couldn't get away from all week long which is of course the  shootings at Virginia Tech I'd like to establish a ground rule I don't want to  mention the name of the bad guy refer to him I just think that's to me I was  disappointed by all the coverage he got he was on the cover of everything and to  me that's just so then now what do you hope so so by establishing this ground

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  rule you expect this the guy's name to be forgotten I mean I don't understand

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  no it won't be I just don't want to be party to it it's just a shame I mean I  think it encourages copycats that's why people do it for that kind of attention

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so this was a controversy I got caught up in because Dave Weiner myself Jeff  Jarvis and some others thought that the right thing for NBC to have done with  police is just put it all up on the web and say here it is here's what the guy  gave us but not put it on TV well do put it on TV but do it on there in other  words not not hold it and used it only for their own purposes and then sit on

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it for the duration so you guys have never worked in broadcasting I take it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  oh yes I have where I know exactly why they did it there's a tense pressure to  do it I mean it's very it was another point of view I so you say but yeah but

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  what you're saying is that you've got some idealistic thing now you're not  working there and you would you really expect in a million years that these  guys would ever follow that kind of thinking no I would actually but well

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  maybe if the public demand if there were enough pain doing never gonna demand  they want this cover that's why they do it isn't it because the public wants to  see it this was this guy was multimedia savvy he sent them audio he sent them  video he sent them stills it was almost a press kit he said it's ridiculous but

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you Leo do you remember the years when you were at MSNBC doing the site and  that was the reason the site was was dropped from MSNBC's line of effect the  entire theory of the network was changed because of the 24-7 coverage of the  Diana death that took place during the little absolutely right that's what  killed it and they said they took a look at the numbers and they took a look  at the site numbers and they said well screw that you guys are out yep Halsey

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  minor very famously the guy who started CNET said they've got an audience the  size of a middling high school which was probably true as soon as Diana died and  they went to wall-to-wall coverage their numbers quadruple by the way they  haven't number had numbers that good since they needed a new princess every  few years I guess but that is still depressing and I tell you when I see his  picture on there I have to say people magazines was the one that put the  cover the victim was on the cover not not him one of the reasons is important  for us of course is we had many listeners at Virginia Tech it was an

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  engineering school they have this right with but can I add one more thing since  I'm on a roll here mr. mr. media it seemed to me that they never gave you  there's one hero in this story that that Israeli professor who like you know  blocked the doors and saved those kids yeah from sheer death and got killed and  he was like a guy who was in the Holocaust Holocaust survivors in the  Holocaust the Holocaust survivor and and this guy has gotten you know once in a  while he gets mentioned you know rarely he wasn't mentioned in the Convocation  it was just really completely you know it was the hero of the story well he is  the hero but it was like you know let's go back and show more grisly details and

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  forget this character no I agree he was that was a remarkable story of of  heroism anyway that's my two cents I agree with you I you know the coverage I  saw and I tried to avoid it because I it was just too grueling to watch he was  CNN I think was on CNN he was they told the story of his life and they so forth  but but maybe not as much as the other guy got so doc is why is it that you  think the NBC should have put it on the net all at once public's right to know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  well here's the thing and and and I think that there are many points of view  on this and all of them have some merit and I think John's right but you know  there they would have done what they would have done as a broadcasting  organization but the assumption that the only authorities that are qualified to  look at this are theirs is is too narrow and false I think that there's a it  isn't a matter of the public's right to know it's a it's understanding what this  guy as best we possibly can and my feeling and we have no way of testing  this really is that more deaths will be prevented by understanding serial  killers the best we possibly can then will be produced by copycatting which  you don't need them in much more detail to do so the interesting thing to me  about that is not so much that the that particular point of view but how little  discussion has actually happened around it that that's actually useful I mean of  of all the things that I do that might be useful might not be useful I feel  like one of the most useless idea was expressed that opinion even though it  got me an NPR a number of people agreed with me a few people disagreed with me  but I didn't hear a lot of discussion about it it just hardly happened it was  like I got condemned for having the opinion and encouraging copycat killers  and a few people said yeah he's right maybe but nothing no difference will be  made I think that you know what one of the things that discovered you know seven  eight years into it is that there are things that blogging and speaking out  are good for and there are things they are less good for and and this seemed to  for examples in other words I think I think I had an opinion it was maybe worth  something it didn't make any difference at all and it sucked up a lot of my time  which is sort of an interesting thing too VT.edu is the website there is a

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  book of condolences and I would love it if a twit listeners would go there and  write something in there and you know I have it the computer that's in your room  Dan is from Virginia Tech it was from the Terra skill computing project there  they had the supercomputer out of Macintosh's and when they took it apart  to put X serves or X whatever you know the you one you computers in there I  bought that it has a we have a yeah I have a certificate from VT and  everything anyway it just I know we have a lot of listeners there in our hearts  and prayers thoughts go out to you just a tragedy anything else anybody wants to  say about I'll tell you one thing I actually I would like to bring up and  will I'd like to get your opinion of it dr. Phil says it's because of violent

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  video games well yeah dr. Phil being the authority on everything well it's a  pretty much conclusive evidence that he barely played many computer games like

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  he'd once maybe he was saying I'm gonna give him the benefit of the doubt that  it's a violent culture that that that causes under something like that I mean  there was no evidence of video games are involved at all they he had no video  game that the shooter had no video games in his possession I mean there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  was no video games anywhere near this and I think that I don't say refreshing  because the wrong thing to say but I mean it's it's nice not to have video  games made the scape right this all the time right he did it was not only to get

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the guns very easily to pawn shop across the street but yeah he needed  hollow-point bullets guess where I thought eBay had banned that I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  think you can buy weapons I think just just the bullets you can buy bullets

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  everywhere it's not a big deal you can buy bullets at Walmart by way you can  and go to Kmart too I think I maybe they don't sell them anymore whatever the  case is I think this this thing dr. Phil did with the video game thing was was  really incredibly insincere and borderline sick cynical and totally  cynical I mean it's unbelievable that he would open himself up I mean I'm  surprised you know the bloggers haven't gone after him seriously with this

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  nonsense it's ludicrous yeah yeah well I mean it is it is patently ludicrous and  I guess the only thing you could say is well maybe if he's criticizing a violent  culture but it's not video games and as you know you you play criticize the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Iraq war then why you're at right good point all right moving on NAB you were

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  down there Alex Lindsay Apple made some big announcements in terms of Final Cut  Pro 2 which is out there was it soon yeah yeah there were there were a few

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  big announcements I mean there were a few big things there I mean there's a  lot of the same I mean there's a 90% of any B doesn't really change from year to  year and you get usually a handful of things Apple releasing app Final Cut Pro  Studio 2 was a was big in the production area you can see that they're really  focusing on they're focusing heavily on getting into newsrooms getting into  larger organizations with Final Cut server which lets people really automate  and let's a lot of a lot of people integrate with each other color is a  brand new application they actually bought a company called silicon color  last year and it is a color correction tool this kind of stuff is normally cost  you know it can cost as much as a half a million dollars and they're just  bundling it in with with the new it's a pretty it's a pretty scary thing  actually for other scary doing this kind of stuff for other people who are  doing this kind of stuff oh other other people it's good you know who's also

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  scared is Sony because the red camera finally made its debut although you  told me they're only gonna be able to make one red a week well they actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the schedule has the first 200 it's one a week maybe in May you know late April  and early May but the schedule some of our members we've about where we've got  about 15 members who have are on the list of red buyers and I think 200 in  the one and we have one that's a 230 and I think he's in July so though it'll  it'll accelerate they're just slowly trickling out why is red such an  important deal well it's actually you know what's fascinating about red is  what you have is this guy you know glee decides loves cameras and decides  everyone's no one's doing it right and everyone's charging too much and he can  do it he can do it better and and he's and everyone thought that he was  absolutely insane when he started and now he's producing cameras that and to  give you an idea that they have what they call 4k cameras so it's over 4,000  pixels wide every frame up to 60 frames a second that so that's twice the  resolution and frame rate of HDTV yeah technically it's four times as many  pixels but yeah it's twice the twice the width four times the pixels Wow right  and so it is an enormous amount of data and but they've also found great ways to  compress it down so that you can capture it on a hard drive that's connected to  the camera you can capture directly to you know through final cut onto your on  your computer and it's still usable I mean because the other the other problem  4k is uncompressed it's 1.5 gigabits per second you know and so it might be more  than that actually so I think it's actually yeah so it's a lot of data  1.5 gigabytes a second that's what that's what a second a second uncompressed now  what they've done is they figured out a whole bunch of ways to make it a lot  smaller than that to make it a lot less you know to compress that the the thing  is is that you have all these companies like Panasonic and Sony and even Canon  who have these high-end cameras Sony's camera high-end film camera or the Dalsa  all these other ones are you know quarter million half a million dollars  you know at least 150,000 and you got this camera the red camera coming in at  17,500 for the body now that may seem like a lot for a prosumer camera

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it's not a consumer or even it's not even a prosumer camera at that price it's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  pro camera now the other thing that they said though that everyone got excited  about is they said they're gonna make a professional pocket camera and they  won't tell us any anything else other than it'll be professional and it'll fit  in your pocket wow I don't know you know and that's gonna be but that won't be a  thousand dollar camera no most likely it'll be less than most of us are  guessing it'll be less than ten thousand and and the thing is is that  it's not as I said as a consumer this doesn't really affect you that much  except for the fact that all these podcasters moving towards wanting to do  film quality work or TV quality work or so on so forth are gonna be armed with  a lot of this high a lot of these higher-end tools can we can we stop here

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  for a second and just back off and go back to the one camera a week thing that  you mentioned earlier okay two running up advertisement for these guys and if  they're pretty no no no now promising a I'm not seeing you know why they'll have

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  200 out they'll have 200 out by the by by the end of July that's what okay so

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it's still a mass production well no why don't you get into that part of the  story how come they can't produce them more I mean it seems to me that once you  get the whole idea down you should be able to crank them out unless they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  being handmade by you know one guy well I think the first ones are just you know  these are they are a animal than every other camera ever made it's a new chip  it's a new they want to make sure that the quality is really high I wonder all  the fields are a problem I'm wondering there's a chip what are these cameras

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  they have to do using kind of screws with reverse threads I mean what's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  different about it no it's got to be something like the chip you're very low  there's got to be something like that if you're talking about 200 the chip

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  yields aren't low that they're ridiculously low can't even make a chip  with 200 copies it's got to be in the time I just want to I just want to put

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  this in perspective though Iona you know the fixacore has a Sony f950 this is a  you know digital film camera and 150 of them ever made so well because there was

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  no market now at 17 grand there might be a little bit of a larger market for the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  there's there's already there's already over 1,500 people on the waiting list  for the camera and but but still all I think John does raise an interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  question why can't they ramp this stuff up well it's you know the thing that you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  have to be careful of is you can do a lot of them and you can do them really  fast if you spend a hundred million dollars on a fab you know you what do

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you need a special fab for fabs are for making chips from scratch I mean what  do you need a family needed a center line these are not us these are not

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  these are ship these are chips from scratch these are not anything that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  anyone else is selling they develop well somebody has to make this chip Alex I  mean it's just they don't come in out of the blue they're made it a fab now  what I mean I'll make just 200 ships I can tell you that I understand I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that they are moving towards an assembly line the main thing you want to do is  maintain maintain also quality you know and so so if the story is I'm curious

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the John where do they make them that's a for as far as I know you know they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  pretty they're pretty secret about the whole thing the what I will say everyone  I'm telling you everyone said that they smelled bad and everyone worried about  it and in literally last year they got the best of NAB and they hadn't even

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  they had a balsa wood camera well nobody believed it and was there at NAB in fact  yeah balsa wood come on last week was there Peter Jackson shot with it right  he made he made a film with it what happened was is that what scared

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  everyone last week was the fact that Peter Jackson borrowed two of the  cameras that are now done I think they have six or seven of them completed and  he borrowed it took it out and shot a 12-minute film with it and it looks  gorgeous and he's super happy with it and it's you know so the thing is is  that it is a that's what everyone thought everyone could really talk about  how oh you know this is this is all else but now the cameras are starting to come

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  out I'm gonna accelerate is there is that Peter Jackson footage anyway is  there some way we can see the Peter Jackson film and whether or not Peter

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jackson shot with this thing I mean I remember the days were used to see these  really great computers at these trade shows and then if you actually looked  underneath you'd find a cable running to a big supercomputer in the back  someplace how do we know that the Peter Jackson camera that he was using wasn't  some one-off you know $250,000 unit that was just being said to be this this  camera you're describing is there any did he tear it apart to look at it I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  mean come on you know the thing is is that I think that what you're gonna find  is that there's gonna be a lot of people with them April May I mean well May June  July and we'll get we'll hear a lot more from them I think that it is a it's a it  it really is if you look at the camera if you look at the data that it has to  deal with if you all of this stuff is an order of magnitude larger than then  definitely any other camera under $100,000 you know so what they're doing  is making it affordable and making it you know that high high quality is  something that is very complicated John maybe the fact that the chip is named

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the Mysterium chip will help answer all of these questions you know Alex when I when I hear you  rave like this about that camera I'm all I'm thinking because since you run a  business is which is that you're exhibiting like extreme amounts of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  wishful thinking you know I will say that I you know I'm usually on your side  when when we do twim when we do this week in media  Emory Wells who has who's got an order for one of these things is you know like  talks like me and I have to kind of try to bring him down and say well but the  truth of the matter is after looking at the camera after looking at at what it's  doing it they're looking at frames that are coming out of it after talking to a  lot of people who have had hands-on experience with it because it's not just  Peter Jackson there's other people that have been have gotten a chance to use it  at the ASC which is the American Society of Cinematographers a lot of people are  really impressed well this is interesting we'll know we'll know by

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  June or July right I mean as these start to come out yeah and we'll find out when

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I get back from Africa we'll have another conversation about it and we'll  look at it now the only other thing I think was really notable from NAB was the  release of Silverlight and also the Adobe media player this is Microsoft  really really Silverlight and then Adobe released Adobe media player and these  are adding tons of interactivity in development to to video to video streams  which I think is gonna be a big deal as we go into next year so Silverlight is

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  is the attempt to what take over from QuickTime and Windows media player yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean it's a lot of what they're trying to do it I mean what do you laugh at

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  yeah let's just take over Windows media player no problem now Adobe has some standing in this area I mean flash is dominant what are you what are you using right now for

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ustream it's flash yeah I think that it's gonna be interesting to see how  effective Adobe is at it and it's also gonna be interesting to see how much  Apple reacts the the ironic thing is Apple's had most of the tools that  they're talking about in Silverlight and Adobe media player for maybe the last

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  these interactivity tools you're talking about yeah ability to click on images and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  so forth exactly they just don't have they they haven't had a good tool for  people to actually you know build stuff with it you know it's all sitting

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  inside a QuickTime and so it's a challenging thing but I think what  because flash is so successful I think that people will certainly pay attention

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  if nothing else but all of this stuff it's not so much something that's gonna  be something you're gonna see every day this year but I think as you move into  the middle of 2008 interactivity on the web is gonna interactivity on on net  apps so non web page just standalone apps I think is gonna become a really  big deal and I think this is just the beginning of that that process I just

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  want to mention that Will Harris wins the geek award for being the first member  of the Twitter panel panel to get you stream up and running and people are now  watching you at the same time as they are so that so sitting in my bathroom  this this this dream I want people to see me today this dream is possible

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  this dream can come true we could all be sat in living rooms doing Twitter I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  guess we can embed I guess we can embed all five of the channels to a page yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that's what that's what I'll do I'll do that could you do Alex could you sort it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  out so that you could green screen it so that if we all did the stream you can  make it look like we're all sitting in a table I think that there's some

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  possibility of that and then you should do some tests if you shoot it with a red  camera then it'll be like we're in your room right yeah actually you know what  there's actually some software that we could use that would let you actually  you uploaded then we really would look like we're all in the same room I see

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Callie Lewis in our chat room and she's just she's dying to get a red camera so  I think that you know we'll see by the way let me add one more question about

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the red camera do you have to put a deposit down on this thing you do it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it's a thousand dollars to get on the list yeah and a thousand dollars to get  on the list and they it's a hundred percent refundable if you ever want to  get off the list we'll have to go bankrupt is it refundable then well I  don't know I mean the guy who started the company is worth over a billion  dollars I don't think that I know but it doesn't mean he's maybe he's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  responsible for the money I mean it's like a thing I just have to say that I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  was an A say or a year ago and when I there were lines literally outside the  red booth the in from the from the literally within ten minutes after the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  iPhone for video geeks it really is it is I don't know either so yeah so it's  gonna be okay hey it's fine with me I hope that I hope it's a winner so I'll  get one yeah we'll shoot a twit with it once once we absolutely I think it's it's  you know I'm gonna take your side Alex this thing is a solid I'm sending them a

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  thousand dollars and my investment in XL2 cameras gets worse and worse and I  just want to mention that Blackberry was out on Tuesday and that freaked out a  lot of people Blackberry says oh we were doing a software upgrade and there  was a cast years in our backup server went out and that's all I'm surprised  somebody didn't jump off our roof you know I was in Vancouver and I noticed I  wasn't getting mail but it wasn't like the end of the world it was out in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  evening yes Leo said you never answer your mail right it was just one more

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  thing I didn't have to pay attention to exactly what was really funny was that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Blackberry came under like for not even barely posting an update like on their  website saying oh yeah by the way you know Blackberry and there was an interview with one of the  head honchos at Blackberry it was published on Network World and they're  basically like well we didn't really see much need of point of posting anything  because it was pretty self-evident no we didn't really have any it wasn't and in

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  one quote from Network World a customer says I spent several hours trying to  figure out what the hell was wrong with my actually Blackberry servers the guy  obviously an IT guy only to find out the problem was with rim all along and I have  to say I had the same problem I was saying well what something's not working  I thought it was my Blackberry so yeah no guys push it push an email and also  does anybody find this a little hard to believe that they were doing a critical  update to their software on a Tuesday night doesn't that seem like Sunday

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  night yes Saturday night Sunday night yeah that's usually the more more

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  common time because I agree maybe it needed to happen on Tuesday night it was

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  an emergency yeah that's what it was it was something going on that they weren't  talking about something bad happened right Apple plugs 25 OS 10 25 OS 10

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  flaws this week I hope you ran your system update it's gonna get why do you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the top ten requests were for now they were all for open source things are all  for Linux of one kind or another or something with Firefox or having a  penguin as well as a Windows tattoo on the laptop is that really just mob the  Linux I know I don't think it's the same few people there really is demand for  that here's the question is it's not it's thousands and not millions but it's  still a significant few thousand there's a there's a hole in the marketplace I  think right now below Apple and alongside Windows as a competitor I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  think really is a hole there do you think it's telling that Michael Dell  admitted that on his home computer he's running Ubuntu feisty fall he's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you can see the fractures between Intel and Microsoft over this service pack one  and now fractures between Dell and Microsoft you know the Intel fracture

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  has been really obvious for a long time the Dell fracture has been I think is  this is the first time I've seen it a really clear way it's been coming yeah  and meanwhile that's what they put up idea storm I think they wanted to say to  Microsoft see hey look here's what the market wants yeah oh that's very

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  interesting that's a good idea yeah meanwhile AMD losing six hundred and  eleven million dollars in the first quarter ouch I want to find that I think  I think it's in the sofa but I may be wrong could be some quarters down there I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  don't know that's a lot of money it's crazy I mean that is an absolute ton and  there are a lot of people that saying that AMD cash injection just to get  through this year the financial may just have it as they they have two quarters

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  left to recover or they're gonna be out is the ATI acquisition part of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  problem I mean well wow no no the problem is that Intel is pushing them  really really hard on pricing and the only is it pushing them really hard on  pricing they've actually got better products now so nobody wants to buy AMD  so to get any chip sold at all AMD's just got to absolutely slash them and  that's why they're losing so much well in fact they announced 50% price cuts

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  almost across the board yeah which is time for users to think about building  some extra machines at home yeah everybody just buy an AMD chip just to  keep them alive well you know it to lose that much money I mean they lost six  hundred million dollars on a revenue of 1.2 billion that's that's hard work you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  know Intel is also putting a lot of work into channel development of all kind  getting them all over not just on price but in relationships they've got huge  relationships going on everywhere and I'm not sure that that AMD can scale to

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  compete with that it's not merely pricing and channels though it's also  technology easy point out well you you've been benchmarking penrin the new  45 nanometer ship do you say in an armament an armament meter no we say

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  nanometer okay just checking I haven't actually no I haven't actually  benchmarked it was just the guys the guys in the office had checked it out  and said it was pretty good column it looked pretty swanky really so they

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  think it's running well any well it's it's fast okay they've got some numbers

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and stuff there but um it's you know it's it's what you'd expect it's core  2 duo taken to the next level yeah also the word is that it's sweet the word is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that it's gonna take AMD at least a year to get to point to 45 so they're just

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  way behind now well if they've only got two quarters they're only just moving to 65

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  yeah yeah it's not good yeah and I don't I don't know if the the ATI you know  pickup was really the best thing either because Nvidia is also hitting it on all  cylinders at the moment and from a developer's point of view I can say that  you know it's much easier for us to develop for for a while there was some

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  talk of Intel and Nvidia joining hands anything along those lines here rumors

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that they were close at one point in time to the thing is is that ironically  Nvidia was working very very closely with AMD for a long time if you went to a  graphics conference you would almost always see them sharing some part of a  and you know really really worked a little bit of a you know I think that  they really felt a little slightly backstabbed when they went when AMD  went the other other direction but I think that you know Nvidia I think is  producing superior boards at the moment and it's the way it handles the graphics  is a lot more straightforward from a professional end I don't know about for  games I don't really deal with that area very much YouTube deletes a video of John

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  McCain singing would you like to it's back

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  well documented that we have for quite a long time now knowing where the real  problem is and in fact the president adequately described it as the axis of  evil I guess my question is how many times do we have to prove that these  people are blowing up people never mind if they get a nuclear weapon when do we  send them an airmail message to Tehran and here's John here's John McCain's  response that was a question that old Beach Boys song bomber ran

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  he wasn't singing very much I thought he was gonna sing more they deleted it by  accident oh is that what it was? by accident right? by accident well you know the thing it was it was

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  posted more than once and so anyone like I had it on my blog the original one  that got you know deleted and so I just found like another copy which was all  on YouTube and posted it well that's the point it's like whack-a-mole you

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  can't delete anything totally like whack-a-mole so was it deleted because

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the Beach Boys complained well you probably had to pay ASCAP to sing that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  one line you know the original song let's be the original song is by the  Regents so let's find the Regents to see if they come back is that right is that  right the Regents had the original song and the Beach Boys song was recorded at

Transcript:  the party well no but wasn't that about does that other guy the two guys that  were the surf singers down at what's their names? Jan and Dean didn't they do it first?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  no I don't think so I think the Regents did and then Jan and Dean did it made it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that Jan and Dean was the one that made it a hit it was the Beach Boys

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it was the Beach Boys well the Regents had a hit and I think was like 1960 61  and the Beach Boys I think had had the next hit with it was about 1964 I could  look it up but I have to use my keyboard so yeah one other time I blog it we'll look it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  one suggestion though is that it's politically motivated that it was it  was it was pulled down because it was political. Could be it was pulled down to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  put back up the whole thing could be a scam it's just publicity it's all  that's what a ten ninety percent of the things are just about publicity it's it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  all about incompetence most of the time most of the time yeah I mean in fact all  of these takedowns on YouTube. Never ascribe to malice we can be explained by  incompetence. I like that. We'll call that Doc Searles razor. Searles sixth law.  Searles. My first law my kid said that I said this the other day and he liked it  so much he said it needed to be my first law which is the more you know the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  worse you look. Well I must know a lot. That's a good one. I must be so smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's funny that the you know a lot of us talk about Big Brother and I  think we are having you know we have issues around that but we also have  Little Brother which is us looking back at the government and it's so amazing  how often you're seeing this this come up where someone says something stupid  and you know somebody's in the crowd you know recording it or someone's picking  that stuff up and it ends up on YouTube and that you can't control you know  politicians can't control the you know the communication much anymore. They're  really losing a lot of that that type. Well that's absolutely true I mean. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it's time to stay out of the public eye. Well I think that's getting to be. Just do

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  what I do just stay home. I think Alec Baldwin might agree with you. Oh my gosh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What a bonehead move that was. You probably blog this on devorek.org  slash blog. What happened? What the Dallag Baldwin thing? Yeah. Well you know as it  as it unfoils it appears is that apt to do this. I mean and a lot of people  believe his wife his ex-wife the you know the actress Kim Basinger had I  guess I don't know they must have had some issues.  He's your old daughter. 11 year old. When the time comes for me to make the phone call I stop whatever I'm doing and I go. Oh he's not happy. But you know. How does he make by the way how's he making an ass out of himself by getting a you know an answering machine. It doesn't make any sense. I mean he's obviously at his wit's end it's possible that he's nutty and maybe his wife's trying to protect the girl or she's nutty and she decides to make his life miserable. You don't know we'll never know and it's probably something we you know should even really dwell on but you know it's it's entertaining.  And we kept to say that these people are are public icons and they're subject to scrutiny. Well but the reason I brought it up is more to the point. We're all subject to scrutiny nowadays. We did every turn. Yeah but if you blow up it's like you said that same exact thing and blew up at your little girl. Nobody's going to care. No it's like Leo. We always knew he's kind of nutty. I mean it's not going to happen. Nobody ever heard of me. That's why if I were a lot of people that heard of you but I don't think anybody's you know you're not like a

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  big political you're not out there. Well and ironically the number one viral video this week with seven million views in like two days is Will Ferrell's two year two year old daughter swearing at him. Have you seen that. That's awesome. It is. Yeah but that was that that's that whole thing was that that's it.  It's a that there was scripted and it's very funny. I've seen it. Do you think now there were there was some criticism of Will and it says here. I'll play a little bit of it yourself again. This is Will Ferrell. Did you get that letter from the doctor yet.  Adam McKay said my dad's gay. I knew it. Those blood tests don't lie. Obviously. And Lord. Yeah. And the little girls playing. Oh yeah. That's it's fabulous. I'll play a little bit more of it.

You don't have to raise your voice. You pay. I can give you half.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey. I don't know. Did she really say you pay now bitch or is that you know who cares whether she did or not. I mean it's obviously the whole thing was a game and it was funny and the girl wasn't funny. Damage for God's sake. And it was an amusing scene. I thought you know people take you know they don't know whether you know people are just taking stuff too seriously. But boy seven million. I mean I can't think of any video that's done that many views that fast. It was everywhere. Yeah. Well the guy's pretty  you know I've never been a big Will Ferrell fan personally but I think he's obviously got a lot of so you know he's really knows how to do stuff. He's amazing now. There's no he's making more money than anyone. Well does he make any money on this. No but it's just more PR for him to get more money for his next movie. The guy makes like 10 million dollars a movie. He doesn't really need to make any money does he on the viral video. It's all just one big ad for what he's up to now. You're absolutely right. It was funny. I have to say I enjoyed it. It was funny.  I got a kick out of it. Yeah. Yeah. Any other big stories. Will I know the Walmarts got a two hundred ninety nine dollar HD DVD player coming out. That's good news. Not Blu Ray just HD DVD produced by China's Great Wall Corporation. Wow. That sounds above the board. It's got to be slave labor. Great Wall has been around for a long time. They're around in the I think even far back as the 80s. But you know that stuff got pretty junky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I mean it's pretty interesting that they're putting the might of the might of Walmart behind HD DVD and not Blu Ray. Yeah. Yeah. Terabyte hard drives one terabyte hard drives coming out from Hitachi. It's in the area 51. I mean we talked about this. Yeah.

Well, if you signed up for the recurring yearly donation, it's going to happen again next month  So I put uh instructions on the front page of twit tv on how to turn that off  I don't want to take your money if you don't want to donate it  But if you signed up for a yearly recurring donation every year  It recurs so we'll take another 20 bucks out of your account unless you turn it off  Please do turn it off. I took it off the front page for that reason because it was obviously confusing people  Just a word of warning if you signed up in may or june to support twit  We do appreciate it  And if you sign up for the recurring donation it will be taken off if you don't want to twit tv for information  And if you want to donate you can do that too.
