Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Actually our British fans say we already have football. That's Hand Egg.  They're calling it Hand Egg.  There's no foot. You're carrying it and it doesn't look like a ball. It looks like an egg.  What are you, nuts?  That's Baratunde Thurston, whose brand new book is out and that's why he's touring the world.  Bam.  Teaching the world how to be black.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You were just on MSNBC, on NPR with Terry Gross.  CNN.  CNN.  KGO.  You're just making the... It's great.  Permanent campaign. I'm like a politician.  There's a lot of interest in this book.  Yeah, people want to know about black stuff.  I'm kind of mad at you though. I wore a scarf and you didn't.  Yeah, but I am coordinated. My shoes...

Start time: 223.38
End time: 226.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, at least your shoes and my Arsenal jacket are matching. Go Gunners.

Start time: 227.20
End time: 228.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Speaking of football, look at that. Arsenal. That's awesome.

Start time: 229.42
End time: 251.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I do have to point out that this is an orchestrated plan. This is genius.  Because it was in October you came out to one of my live shows in Manhattan.  That's right.  And you were just like, well, I got a plan. Number one, How to Be Black will come out in February. Black History Month.  And then you set up a street team. You got all these lieutenants who are setting all this stuff up for you.  It is the most brilliantly orchestrated PR campaign. And the book is selling really well.

Start time: 251.00
End time: 257.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, this will be a measure of can you use social media, new media to make a book take off.  You're using old media too. You're pulling all the extras.

Start time: 258.42
End time: 301.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's a good partnership. I mean, Harper is my publisher. They've been really good.  And they've been good.  They get it.  They got me on Fresh Air with Terry Gross, who was one of my heroes.  And that's what they do.  And so that was then. But then we also have a Tumblr campaign.  And we've been working with Tumblr.  What's the Tumblr site?  Howtobeblack.me. We redirected our domain to Tumblr. And we're encouraging people to share their own stories.  So you're partnering with them?  Not officially, but we just talk to them. And they have a new partnership. I guess initiative.  They hired a woman named Rachel Ferschliser, who has a big history in books. And it's her job to kind of reach out to authors.  So we talk to her.  That's smart.  Like how can you use Tumblr without just trying to sell the book? Can you help sell an idea and make a community?

Start time: 301.00
End time: 313.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and I think that's a real testament to Baratunde that he gets social media because you can't astroturf this kind of thing.  You have to have genuine love from the people who are part of your team.  Actually, I hate everybody, just for the record.

Start time: 314.70
End time: 325.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you can't fake it. I think you're right. I think that's what Brian is saying. This has to be a legitimate campaign among people who already have a community.  It could still be orchestrated.

Start time: 325.06
End time: 351.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's orchestrated, but it's built on substance. The house is built on substance.  So we had a great launch timing with Black History Month with a great title. The cover works well. The early coverage was good.  But people who've read it also actually like the book.  That helps.  And then the story, the participation layer, even if you don't read the book, just go to this website and see what people are saying.  It's really heartfelt, funny, cool stuff about identity. And it's like not just black people talking about it either.

Start time: 352.22
End time: 361.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The OUCH has a great idea in our chat room. He says, do an AMA and ask me anything on Reddit.  Oh yeah, have you never done that yet?  I wanted to...  I always wanted to ask black people...

Start time: 362.24
End time: 373.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, and the thing is, on Brian Lehrer on WNYC last week, we did a version of that. It was kind of like a national black press conference.  On Black Ask Me Anything.  Yeah, when people called in on the radio and they said, well, what do I do in this situation? What do I do in that situation? The answer was always black.

Start time: 374.06
End time: 375.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is it mostly white people or did black people call up too?

Start time: 376.66
End time: 382.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it was, I think... I'd have to go back on that show, but it was a very wide distribution.  It certainly wasn't majority white people.

Start time: 383.04
End time: 389.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Would you say this is aimed at a black audience?  I'd say it's aimed at a smart audience.  Oh, listen, this is how good he is.

Start time: 391.02
End time: 392.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's so Baratunde of you.

Start time: 393.04
End time: 398.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not the first person to have asked that, however.  No, it's on the FAQ. We have FAQ on the website.  I've got the whole PR shit right here.

Start time: 399.28
End time: 408.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going to say this for the record. Of all the things Baratunde is doing, my favorite is that he changed the end signature to say,  buy How to Be Black or you're a racist.  If you don't buy this book, you're a racist.

Start time: 409.00
End time: 412.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to raise the stakes.  I want it to be an actual cost.

Start time: 413.02
End time: 417.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So what is it about? I mean, as long as we're plugging the book, let's go ahead and plug the book. What's it about?

Start time: 418.46
End time: 423.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The book is a memoir, mostly.  Of your life?  Of my life, not a random person.

Start time: 424.22
End time: 429.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I heard you're reading on Fresh Air and you started... it's the very beginning of the book. You talk about your childhood.  Yeah, no.

Start time: 430.00
End time: 468.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think the point is I could have tried to do something that was very academic or extremely journalistic in terms of like reporting.  I wanted to do something that was based in the truth that I know and the one I know most is my life.  And it's one of the first lessons I learned in standup.  Tell your truth, stick to what you know.  People can smell inauthenticity.  It's really true.  And that's true in social media. It's also just true in life.  So I was like, let me anchor this in what I know best, which is my life, which represents some of what I think is going on with identity and with race,  which is that we are becoming... we're able to be more of like who we are and to project who we are more loudly than we ever have before.  We used to have other people telling us who we're supposed to be.  Now we can combat that by just being ourselves.

Start time: 469.04
End time: 482.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I hope that... you know, and it's not just race. It's true.  We're in a post-gender era, a post-sexual orientation era.  It's true in a lot of different ways.  The things that normally people were identifying with, I'm gay, I'm black, I'm a man, I'm a woman.  Those lines are getting very much blurred. I'm a woman, actually.

Start time: 484.62
End time: 516.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I wouldn't go so far as to say we are post-gender or post-race because I don't think we're beyond it.  But I think we can be smarter about it.  We can transcend it, though.  I think we can be more nuanced about it. I think we can be more honest about it.  And I think humor is a cool way to play with it.  So this is a funny book, but a philosophy.  It's a funny, philosophical, personal book.  And there are some lessons that are... the how-to is not a feint.  There are a lot of chapters in there based on my life about how-to.  Here's what I learned from you.  I thought that was a joke.  It's like how to be the black friend, which is an important role.

Start time: 517.24
End time: 522.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What is the black friend? I know in movies there's a black friend.  He usually dies in the first act.  The red shirt guy.

Start time: 523.02
End time: 531.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And he's probably not even a friend.  Probably just the black person in the frame who is no longer present.  So that's where some of the over-the-top satire comes from.

Start time: 531.14
End time: 534.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's funny. There's plenty to laugh at, God knows.

Start time: 534.48
End time: 549.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wanted it to be funny because people sometimes come to this topic and they're defensive already.  And they're accusatory, which is basically the opposite of defensive.  They're offensive.  And you can never get to a point of actually exchanging an idea.

Start time: 549.10
End time: 556.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If this works, will you do another book on sex and religion?  These are taboo topics. Race, sex, politics, and religion.

Start time: 557.60
End time: 561.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they can all be served a little better by comedy than by, say, sermonizing and politicizing.

Start time: 562.34
End time: 565.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Lenny Bruce was the first to observe that. He really broke boundaries.

Start time: 566.26
End time: 568.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I wouldn't say he was the first, but I'd say he did really well.

Start time: 568.00
End time: 570.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I'm trying to think of a comic who really took those on earlier than that.

Start time: 571.04
End time: 590.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I was doing research into the history of satire. It goes all the way back.  Really?  Horace wrote about this in Roman times. He who badgers less can convince more.  And he talks about the value of humor in getting through tough topics and being able to talk to people about it.  Interesting.  So go Horace.

Start time: 591.00
End time: 602.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, go Horace. I guess Mark Twain is true.  Yeah, absolutely Mark Twain.  Well, I think that's a good example of tweaking people's racial prejudices through a novel that had some humor in it.  So I guess you're right. I guess this does go back a way.

Start time: 602.26
End time: 609.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It does. It's not necessarily stand-up comedy. Certainly art is always...  So what day did it come out?  February, I'm sorry, January 31st.  Okay, last day of January 1st.

Start time: 610.00
End time: 613.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that was a set-up.  And then, so you've been out just five, six days now.  Yeah.

Start time: 614.29
End time: 621.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's going well?  We did. We hit number 20 on Amazon.  All right.  And like all books. And then Amazon ran out of books.  That's awesome!  Yeah, there it is.

Start time: 622.00
End time: 623.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Great list of problems. That's got to be the best one.

Start time: 624.48
End time: 636.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The publishers reprinting more.  Awesome. So you're already in the second print.  Wow. Fantastic.  Yeah, it's good stuff.  This week in Baratunde.  Yeah, no. You know, every time Baratunde is here, I just want to talk to him.  No, I'm free.  Because he's so interesting and fun.

Start time: 636.00
End time: 640.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We should talk about that.  I saw you at Macworld. You were hustling down the street as I was leaving our macro meetup.

Start time: 641.00
End time: 652.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we just bumped into each other on the street. In fact, it was thanks to a Twitter...  Marcus, what was his name? I wanted to give him an appropriate thank you.  He had been bringing me drinks.  Yeah, trying to get you drunk.  But it was all water.  Yeah, because you had to drive.

Start time: 654.59
End time: 659.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So everybody's asking, and I might as well tell everybody, yes, Baratunde recorded the audible version.

Start time: 659.00
End time: 671.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I did. I do the voiceover myself. Voice is important. I'm using SoundCloud in a daily podcast to talk about it.  Are you?  Yeah, I'm doing a daily like tour cast, I'm calling it.  To just give people the download, like, what's it like behind the scenes?

Start time: 671.02
End time: 674.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Tell you man, this guy, he's got the perfect system.  He's working it.  I am taking notes.

Start time: 676.38
End time: 700.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Dude, I just... Just so people know this isn't a setup. I did go to Brian's.  Like, I've admired your hustle on stage and how you do your shows.  And I went to Brian's show at Manhattan College and I took notes.  Yeah, you did.  I literally took notes. I followed up.  So you have these big banners at your show.  Brian does this great thing at his shows, which is talk about audience engagement, where he's got questions and quizzes and little videos while he's setting up.

Start time: 700.50
End time: 720.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like when you go to a movie theater. The whole reason that came... And we should talk about tech at some point.  We should talk about tech. We use computers to do it, so it's sad.  Yeah, there we go. The whole idea was most of the places I go, nobody has any idea who I am.  And the problem is, whatever people are expecting at a magic show, it's not me.  So I walk out with this ridiculous hairstyle and I would get laughter the moment I walked out.

Start time: 720.77
End time: 722.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what happened when I dressed up as you the other day.

Start time: 723.72
End time: 728.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By the way, I saw that. That was freaking awesome.  Brian, what was it? Brian Gotwood and Foranica?

Start time: 730.91
End time: 733.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, we were testing the mics for tonight and they worked good.

Start time: 735.08
End time: 743.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the idea with the pre-show was to program people, let them know who I was and get them thinking about magic in general.  And I guess you stole that.

Start time: 744.18
End time: 751.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a view source world. So I just viewed source on your show.  So Facebook?  Facebook.  Yeah.

Start time: 752.06
End time: 765.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, wait a minute. I'm not done. Soundcloud.com slash baritone.  Yeah, man.  Actually, we're talking to SoundCloud about using them because I like for our player on our page because you could put comments in the waveform, which I think is really good.

Start time: 765.04
End time: 772.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I ran into Alex, who's one of the founders of the show last week.  And he reminded me, you know, people using SoundCloud like this and like that.

Start time: 773.00
End time: 775.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now on the fly, I was like, you know, I always think of it as a music service, but you can use it for spoken word.

Start time: 776.20
End time: 779.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The apps are light enough. They're on Android and iPhone.  I use it too. Yeah.

Start time: 780.12
End time: 791.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or I'm going to use an audio boo as well. But this is a great solution.  And then the book How to Be Black is on audible.com narrated by Baritone. Six hours and 27 minutes. Were you a little disappointed?  You think it was going to be nine hours?

Start time: 791.00
End time: 812.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I think the length is good because I think you can like finish it in a week and move on with your life.  I didn't want to make some huge epic thing, but it is the most accurate version of the book because I caught some typos.  Oh, really? Oh, my God.  Here, let's listen a little bit just to see if it sounds like it.  It's the only defying season for postage stamps featuring noteworthy black Americans by a factor of four.

Start time: 812.02
End time: 814.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sounds exactly like him.  It's amazing. What a good impression.

Start time: 815.80
End time: 823.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, the guy that they got was really good. He shadowed me for 33 years.  I got every nuance of my voice now.

Start time: 824.18
End time: 826.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I think we've given you a pretty big plug.

Start time: 826.12
End time: 829.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you've given more than I could ever even ask for.

Start time: 830.18
End time: 833.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thank you, everybody. Bye bye.  Have a good discussion.

Start time: 835.01
End time: 838.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did look at the stories and I would love to talk about tech.  Thank you. Thank you.

Start time: 839.22
End time: 900.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, let's talk about you. You brought it up, Brian.  Facebook this week filed for their public offering as expected.  What we didn't know until they filed was how much money they were looking for.  And apparently it's five billion dollars.  With a pinky at the corner of your mouth.  Five billion dollars, but they could have filed for more.  Five billion dollars is five percent of the company because the company's valued at a hundred billion, according to this.  So they're not giving up a huge amount of stock.  Is it worth they had revenue? Is it worth a hundred billion?  They had revenue last year, according to their filing of three point seven billion dollars.  Income, one billion. That's the profit.  One billion a year. Are they worth one hundred times profits?  Yes.  If you put it that way, it's harder than you say.  Then I can ask you the same question. Would you buy Facebook stock?

Start time: 901.43
End time: 904.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I guess that's a good point.

Start time: 905.12
End time: 909.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When you put it, is it worth a hundred ten to a hundred times the value?

Start time: 909.16
End time: 947.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's the problem. Part of it is that you're betting on future value and everything they're doing.  They're getting an unprecedented amount of personal data in order to serve an unprecedented unprecedented unprecedented is a good word.  So I got to tell you, I even though one billion to being valued at a hundred billion, I honestly just don't know how to feel about this because it's so familiar to watching my space.  I remember listening to that's the problem this week in tech.  And I remember John C. Dvorak saying markets are fickle.  And this is a fact. There you go.  These kids are going to go to the next thing.  I'm a big fan of our cut. That's the next big thing.

Start time: 949.34
End time: 950.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You might well have said that. I don't know.

Start time: 951.00
End time: 966.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I can't decide which is stronger, the impulse to think that this is so similar to the my space experience and that they could go somewhere else or the fact that Facebook is so damn sticky.  People will discover stories that are that are weeks old on Facebook, whereas on Twitter, it's all ephemera.

Start time: 966.84
End time: 976.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We all know that because we all cross post to Google Plus, Twitter, Facebook, every other.  And it's always Facebook for me.  And is it true for you that gets the most comments?  So it's a last the longest.

Start time: 977.28
End time: 997.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a recent change for me in Facebook.  So Twitter is my primary social digital home.  Google Plus was going super strong for a while, but has really tapered off in many ways.

Transcript:  My point on Facebook, I'm with you, Brian, in terms of like the unknowable nature of the future.  But it is so much deeper.  What is it?  Almost a billion users.  And the level of media that people are sharing.  Right.  It's so much more than we got in the MySpace era.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And their ability to tune, this is what we don't see.  The algorithms that show your subscribers what ends up in their feed is getting better.  Right.  Is getting smarter.  And they prioritize certain things.  I noticed as a light example, if I share a four-square check-in with Facebook, that is one set of behaviors.  If I share a four-square check-in as a photo attached, order of magnitude more.  Because they now auto-import, and I think this is the way four-square is using the API,  but they pull in the photo and add it to a photo album.  And so people are actually commenting on the media.  And Facebook rewards native posting of media versus linking to things off of Facebook.

Transcript:  So one more thing, and it really is kind of deja vu to four years ago talking about MySpace and Facebook to begin with.  The only reason to not assume that Facebook is worth $100 billion is if you perceive that somebody could steal this away from them.  Because that is what happened with MySpace.  MySpace got the feet cut out from underneath them, and they essentially went to nothing.  And is there, talking about Google+, right?  Regardless of how you feel about the execution of Google+,  I think it's obvious that Google wants to own this space, and I'm convinced that's why they made the entire privacy policy change.  And so essentially they're making all of Google, if you have one account on any of their services, now you're a Google+, subscriber.

Transcript:  Well, this is the problem with Facebook. I'm deleting that right now.  Is it the problem with Facebook or the problem with Leeds?  Six of one, half of the dozen of the other.  The question though, let's get back to the question.  Is it worth...

Start time: 1224.55
End time: 1265.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it worth...  If this company is able to take the level of user engagement, media, sort of immersion, and life layering that they're attempting to do, and add transactions, financial, commercial transactions on top of that, and own a piece of a lot of those.  If they can not let you just share your photos, but share in the transactions that you're being social throughout, the way you find your commercial experiences and transactions, the food you buy, the clothes you shop for,  and take a cut of that by improving those recommendations, or allowing you to sell on that platform, or getting to the virtual goods and games world as they have been, then that opportunity could be much, much greater than the proposed value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're proposing ways for them to monetize, but I think that there are many, many, many, many, many possible ways to monetize.  So really the only question is, they've got 850 million users.  Are they worth $118 per user based on all the various ways, maybe the ones you recommend, but there may be others to monetize?  Yes!  Absolutely.  Yes!  Whether they can execute it, uncertain.  But the potential is bigger than that.  Can they, because really, and I think we said this last week, there's no question that they're getting to the end of the line on how many users they can have, because we're running out of...  Of interview users.  Right.  But it's also the case that they've only scratched the surface of monetization.  Right.  They have, Mark Zuckerberg, I think very wisely, has pulled the reins back on monetization, has said minimal monetization, don't junk it up, and that's a hard thing to do, and he's done it for 8 years, he's held that horse back, and now when they do the IPO, whoosh!

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah!  And not all of these are evil uses when it comes to the advertising.  No, not at all.  Think about it in terms, I love this idea of $118 per user.  I'm going to make this picture of my son in his underwear.  Like, the $118 per user is a perfect idea, because there are, you hear the stories about Google AdWords where people are paying upwards of $50 to $100 per click for certain key terms like cancer or mesothelioma or whatever there's...  So imagine you complain that you just came down with mesothelioma, and then all of a sudden you get an ad from, there's going to be a legal firm out there that's going to pay $100 just for the one display ad of like, hey, do you want to sue?

Transcript:  There is a fun game, I would say sort of a social hacking experiment that a woman named Teresa Valdez-Klein pulled off a while ago where she bought Facebook ads to basically counter the negative messaging that women were getting from Facebook ads.  Why not?  Because some of these ads were like, do you think you're fat? Do you wish you were prettier? Are you lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonesome face?  Belly fat.  And so she would buy ads targeted at women saying, you're beautiful the way you are. Don't worry about this and that.  And Teresa Valdez-Klein, it's worth Googling out.  See if we can dig up the link at some point, maybe during one of the breaks and at least post it to the chat room.  But it was a great way of kind of using their ad system, which actually leans on some of the stereotypes and bad messaging and sort of more obvious ways to lure people.  And she said, let's play it a little smarter and a little more fun.  I wish I'd come up with it myself.  It's brilliant.  What she did. She gave an Ignite talk about it.

My mind's a little slow on the name, but the idea was they're trying to encourage entrepreneurs  to give 1% of their equity.  It's like 1% of nothing.  That's a great idea.  To charities of their choice.  That's a wonderful idea.  And so there's a guy from Boulder whose company did really well and he was able to finance.  They're like, sure, they didn't even know what it meant.  Sure, we'll accept your worthless stock paper.  Oh, that's brilliant.  And then he had an exit from his company and they got 1% of a big number.  That's a really nice story.  And it changed that nonprofit's ability to affect the community.  And so the idea- And he never felt the pinch.  No, 1% of nothing.  Yeah, sure, sure.  Right?  If you don't, then it's great.  If you don't, then it's nothing.  That's awesome.

It makes perfect sense and everyone wants their payday for all the hard work they put  in for the last, what, eight, nine years.  But there are other stories of very successful companies that get on the edge of filing an  IPO and decide it's not worth it.  For example, a friend of mine is an engineer over at SAS in North Carolina.  And they went through all the preparations and figured out once we stop owning everything,  we can't spoil our employees with these treats.  Because when you have to answer to a board, they're like, why are you, why did you give  everyone a $10,000 gift for X, Y, and Z?  So it'll be interesting to see, and of course none of us are on the inside, but it would  be interesting to see how the corporate culture changes inside of Facebook post-IPO.  Yeah, we'll watch it.  Yeah, we'll watch.  We'll watch from the outside.  Me and Baratunde behind the hedge.  Anything different?

Transcript:  I don't know.  So I also think Mark's going to lose some control.  And I think that that might be bad for Facebook.  I think Mark has had so much control up to now.  I worry a little bit about a Facebook that is a little bit more traditional in its structure.  He still has a majority, he has three out of five board seats, he has 60% of voting  shares, so he still has absolute control.  But things change.  Things change.  We'll just have to wait and see.

Transcript:  And this, I expect this to be some story that'll break in the next five years just as a prediction.  Remember this moment, everyone, because I'm reading in the plaques and I'm reading about  the way Google handles stuff without understanding a language.  It knows what words are associated with certain things and is able to predict what you mean  in Norwegian through translation software.  For example, on Facebook, there could be a type of situation where they start to see  the things that are associated with having an affair or something like that, where all  of a sudden you never say anything, but they know.  And then they start serving up ads for Ashley Madison.  Boy, that explains a lot.

Transcript:  She makes a very good point and applies both to Google and Facebook.  It's redlining.  It's social redlining.  Now this is something that happened to people of lower income.  Banks would not lend money to people in certain geographic areas.  They redlined because those people were lower income, actually kind of in the reverse in  the modern era.  Those are the people they targeted with extra low loans and subprime loans.  But in any event, that was how the banks used that kind of information.  By the way, she's the author of a book called I Know Who You Are and I Saw What You Did,  Social Networks and the Death of Privacy.  I've got to get that lady out of my life.  Laurie Anderson.  I know who you are and I say, where are you?  So she calls this weblining, data aggregation as social implications.  When young people in poor neighborhoods are bombarded with advertisements for trade schools,  will they be more likely than others their age to forego college?  When women, and this is what Teresa was talking about, when women are shown articles about  celebrities rather than stock market trends, will they be less likely to develop financial  savvy?  Advertisers, this is actually a very interesting point, has nothing really to do with Facebook  except that by aggregating information that they know about you with the kinds of ads  they want to give you, they might in some way be kind of training you to be a certain  kind of person.  Advertisers are drawing new red lines, limiting people to the roles society expects them to  play.  That's kind of another form of Eli Peresor's filter book.

Transcript:  No, it is.  It's that, it's what Dana Boyd writes and talks about to some degree, and it's the flip  side of the consumer choice argument that so much ad targeting is about, which is, hey,  isn't the world better when you don't see ads that aren't relevant to you?  Wouldn't you rather see an ad for something that coincides with your interests?

Transcript:  Here's what I would argue for.  That's not what we want.  Part of the challenge is the people, we live in an age where all this tech and all this  data is available and we can build more intelligent services on top of that.  The people at the forefront of this are the marketers and the advertisers, who we already  know what their interest in us is.  They just want to make money.  It's not a peer relationship.  They're not trying to make you feel better about yourself or expand your range of human  possibility.  They want to make you buy their stuff.  If we could balance that scale a little bit.  For example, all the data that the AT&T has, that Google has, that the iPhone has, why  can't it be as easy for me to synthesize and analyze that data and make empowering choices  as it is for them to tell me who they think I should be?

Start time: 2407.30
End time: 2439.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Can I play the role of the advertiser here and the marketer and just give you the counter  argument?  My job is not to create a better society.  My job is to serve advertisements that are going to be effective.  So if I have information about you that all my research says will help me target you with  a more effective ad, you're telling me, oh no, salt that effective ad with some ineffective  ads just to give you a choice in your life?  Yes!

Transcript:  I'm not going to expect different behavior from them.  What I'm saying and suggesting is more power for the user.  For example, one tangible example, my usage patterns of my mobile phone and the data plans  and the pricing I have are not optimal.  They do not result yet in me having the optimal package.  They could.  All the information is there.  By the way, we've got new advertisers that are going to help you do that.  Where my phone is, how much I use it, when I turn it on and off.  This is coming later this month.  We've got a new advertiser that does exactly that.  I could save hundreds of bucks a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But not even that.  Let's go further.  Let me take all that data about your corporation, about where you give campaign money to, about  how you treat your employees and let me decide where that dollar is going to go.  It's a very unidirectional power play right now with the people, with the money and the  data are telling you who you're supposed to be.

Transcript:  That's the thing is I don't expect marketers to do anything different.  But the technology that makes it possible for the marketers is also the technology that  makes something like Google News possible.  Google News has been my number one homepage for the last three or four years.  But what I love about it is that it forces me to see articles that I never in a million  years would seek out.

Transcript:  Ultimately.  I would say that when we look at money in politics, for example, we've seen a lot of  reports this past week about these super PACs and who's giving money for all the various  campaigns or not quite campaigns.  The trade off we made in this country is, okay, money speaks, money is speech, sure,  transparency balances it.  We know whose money is in play.  Same thing with journalists.  Right now, all the transparency being offered in this data driven world is of the user  toward the service provider.  They know where we are.  They know what our devices are doing.  They know what buttons we're pressing.  Can we A, know all that about ourselves because it is us generating that value in that data.  It's technically our data.  And can we know more about these organizations and demand more of that transparency?  I don't know.

Start time: 2579.00
End time: 2583.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

I mean, is it the case where you're like, well, go ahead and make money with it or you're  suddenly indignant.  You're like, hey, no, I want that data to just be lost and useless.

Start time: 2603.32
End time: 2625.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it changes the nature of the data when it's no longer just passive activity  and data, but it's insight and analysis and conclusions being drawn about you as a person.  So I think what you're really saying is that level of intelligence and thought added to  the data makes it a little different.  What you're really saying is that you shouldn't do it, but I'm saying it's no longer just  data anymore.

Start time: 2625.60

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Web lining is really just because they're doing it imperfectly.  They're assuming from a few data points that you are a certain kind of person, but given  better information, they're not going to assume just because you live in a certain  neighborhood or just because you buy a certain car or just because they're going to know  more about you and give you ads that are actually in fact tailored to you and service too.

Transcript:  This is maybe where Pariser's work comes in and I haven't read his whole book yet.  I only saw some of the talk, the Ted talk he did, but even in a perfect data world,  which is impossible, but you can get closer to it and they're more accurately tracking  and representing these people, there is some loss in society of only having a targeted  experience.  If the experience of all the media in your life, of all the ads in your life, of all  the commercial messages and social cues is only reinforcing what that world thinks you  are, you're missing the serendipity, you're missing the magic, you're missing the contrast.  Well, thank God we still have the Super Bowl.

Start time: 2687.82
End time: 2702.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, seriously, the ads you're going to watch in the Super Bowl are aimed at 100 million  people.  They're not aimed at you or you or me.  They're aimed at 100 million people.  They're as broad a brush as you can get and people are still willing to spend millions  of dollars on those ads.  They must work.

There's no reason you shouldn't want all your news to be targeted.  But if everybody does it, if everybody defaults on the prisoner's dilemma, society as a whole  totally becomes extra polarized and we all lose as a result.

We're probably going to, we're going to try to do a targeted strike.  See, whereas you get people to buy your book by being engaging and having people love you,  I plan to cheat and we're going to target March 1st is the day I want everybody to buy  it on that exact day and I'm going to price it stupidly low.

Transcript:  See, that's where the idea came from.  I would like to point something out.  We are all selling something, if not a book or a product or a bottle of whiskey, you're  selling yourself.  You're selling it to an employer.  You're selling yourself as an employee.  So I think this distinction between marketers and regular people is a little artificial.  Everybody's selling something and really life itself is about enrolling other people into  you, isn't it?  Oh, sure.  Yeah.  And what we're really looking at here is fascinating new ways.  Both of you guys are great examples of doing this, not necessarily ways that are mean or  degrading or hurtful.

And not the Leo.  I'm going to hire Leo.  And it doesn't necessarily hurt, but you're not hurting anybody.  And so that's really the question that I have to ask, weblining or not, when I look  at the ads that are for me on Facebook, the card for super fans, they know I'm a 49er  fan, a retro iPhone doc, love, who does this hurt that these ads, Mature American Women,  oh wow, are targeted a little bit more because it knows a little bit, who does that hurt?

Now, when the iPad 3 comes out, this is the first place you're going to go.  You're going to take that 32 gigabyte Wi-Fi iPad, sell it for 280 bucks.  You're halfway towards your new iPad.  How do you like that?  And you can now, once you say, OK, by the way, if it's in flawless condition, 320 bucks.  They will take it.  So what's going to happen is you're going to get a box, any box, you're going to pile  all this stuff in there.  I love piles.  I know.  Well, it's in a pile right now in your drawer.  Transfer the pile to the box.  They will give you a mailing label.  They take care of the shipping on anything worth more than a dollar.  You ship it back to them.  Now, here's the nice part.  They have data experts who will, first of all, verify that it's in the condition you  said it was.  But they will also wipe all the personal data out of there.  So they will verify it.  They will then send you a check.  You can go to PayPal.  They'll give you PayPal, Walmart gift card.  They have lots of ways to get paid.  The one I'm going to recommend, Amazon gift card.  If you like to use Amazon, who doesn't?  Five percent more if you do it through Amazon.  Basically rebate the associate fee.  So get paid with an Amazon gift card or cash if you want the cash.  It's just a really fantastic way to take those gadgets.  I'm going to add this to my box right here.  Let's say Amazon gift card.  Thank you very much.  It's in flawless condition.  And get all those gadgets and get cash for them.  Now, if the gadget is worthless, and that sometimes happens.  I've got an old Blackberry curve.  I'm not going to get much money for.

Since I've already got stuff of value in there,  they're going to continue to pay the postage.  I just love this.  It is a great way to raise money for a charity.  You can have a Gazelle charity page, a gadget drive.  So if your baseball team wants to raise money,  you can have a bake sale,  but you could also have a gadget.  Yeah, yeah.  Gazelle.com.  Keep it moving.  That's the whole idea.  I want you to go to gazelle.com.  You don't even have to use it.  Just find out what your stuff's worth and then decide.  But I have a feeling once you see the hundreds of dollars  it's worth, you're going to take advantage of this.  And again, remember the little tip I gave you.  Use the Amazon gift card for 5% more.  Gazelle.com.  Don't sell it.  Gazelle it.  Nice.  Wait, did you just make that up?  Yeah, not just.  Okay.  I was thinking all night.  Turning them into a verb.  I like that.

Transcript:  Why are we getting all these batteries?  Oh, Leo said it was okay.  Let's see.  The cell phone privacy bill.  Representative Markey has released a draft of this.  You probably would like this idea.  Since you're so private.  The idea is called the Mobile Device Privacy Act.  You know what?  We give Congress such a hard time  with the new things like soap and pip.  But let's give them a little bit of praise  when they do something smart.  So tell us more about this.  All right.  It would for instance,  force the cell phone carriers to disclose  if they're using carrier IQ.  That was the software that was monitoring  everything you do.  And what information the software is collecting.  You would have to consent  to any data collection or transmission.  Third parties would have to have policies in place  to secure the data.  So not only do you have to give them permission,  but they are required if you do give them permission  to secure it so somebody can't steal it.

Transcript:  I'm trying to think of a situation  where I would disagree with this Bill.  And it's a little bit tough.  The only thing I'm gonna knock on it is like  having a law saying you need to protect information  is like they don't want information to get out anyway.  And if they, like if you want to make a law,  say what the penalty should be  for if information get lost.  Hold them accountable.  Although even that-

Start time: 3334.34

Start time: 3336.22

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Even that sort of happens automatically.  AT&T doesn't want to lose information.  It's a major PR disaster when somebody steals  a bunch of stuff.  Yeah, maybe.  I don't know.  Maybe they don't really care.  This is a soft spot for me.  I'm okay with anyone who's pro privacy on people.

Transcript:  And there's just, we're moving,  technology always outpaces the law.  This is a case of a law trying to keep pace  in a way that is hopefully intelligent.  And even if it doesn't become a law,  there's power in the signal that they're sending  that we're paying attention, that this is important,  that you don't just have willy nilly ability  to go do these things,  and that we're trying to look out for our constituents,  which it is our job to try to do,  that maybe the market alone can't solve this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When is this gonna take effect?  It already is in effect.  The company said initially that they'd only throttle you  if you were in the top 5% of users.  And that would be 10 to 12 gigs.  But now they've lowered that all the way down to two gigs.

I was two weeks in India  and I didn't want to be using data over there on my phone.  I'll tell you what-  Because the per bit rate is much higher  on the phone than the iPad.  I don't want to say good,

Start time: 3639.26
End time: 3649.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Start time: 3676.24
End time: 3690.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh no, they were total jerks.  And in fact, a friend of mine, Andrew Main,  creates a lot of illusion DVDs.  And the mega upload was pirating,  had them available and he sent them takedowns.  And they were very feet dragging.  Oh, this is good.  They're genuinely lousy about it.

Start time: 3690.48
End time: 3699.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that's relevant because the thing that protects them  is the fact that they have a DMCA takedown procedure,  but they've got to-  You've got to respond to it.  You've got to respond.  Right, there was a lot of lip service about it.

Start time: 3700.36

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think there's a connection  between the throttling and the mega upload story.  And it is about data and it's about what's been promised  and about what's possible.  So the throttling we were joking around  doesn't really affect us, doesn't really affect us.  It does affect Brian.  Yes.  And to adjust a promise after you've signed a contract  Sure.  And committed funds is dastardly.  That's wrong.  That's wrong.  Dastardly.  Yeah, I've never used that word before.  That's a true plan.  And I felt like doing it.  Dastardly.  And now I've done it.  The podcast.  With Baratunde Thursday.  That was dastardly.  Dastardtunde.  So in any sense.  Every time you say dastardly, the crowd goes wild.  Oh, he said it.  I do think there is a signal  that we don't have true competition  because no one can offer it.  Absolutely.  We definitely.  No one really can offer that.  And then same in this mega upload case,  there are people who are gonna lose their files  and you have to have them.  Legitimate files, not pirated files.  Meg, you need a mega backup for the backup.  People have trusted their service.  I'm sure if you read the fine print,  it said if we're raided by people for doing things  we shouldn't do, all your stuff's gone.

For like seven years where we didn't actually pay attention,  where we didn't take backups and redundancy seriously,  where we didn't demand a level of accountability  from our service providers and the enforcement  of the promises they made us as paying customers.  And we'll look back at this and like,  that was a dark time in the web  where we had no certainty about anything  and we didn't care until we lost it all.  Yeah.

We'll do that in just a minute.  But first a word from our friends at Citrix  who make GoToMeeting the ultimate  in online collaboration software.  For years, GoToMeeting has had the fastest, easiest,  most secure screen sharing solution out there.  Now they've got video too, HDFaces.  They've just added it and it is incredible.  It makes such a difference to be able to see  the person you're meeting with, whether it's a new client,  a colleague that you don't get together with very often,  to see their faces, their reactions.  It's actually how we as humans work.  We make connections face to face.  And GoToMeeting with HDFaces really brings that  to the online world.  All it takes is a webcam and a click  and you'll be collaborating in HD video like that.  You'll see your attendees eye to eye  while collaborating on documents in real time.  You'll feel instantly connected.  It's great for training.  We don't do a meeting, a teleconference,  without having GoToMeeting running.  Well, that's one of the nice things about it, by the way.  It gives you a teleconference bridge.  You could use VoIP or phone.  So that's part of the setup so you do hear people.  And if they've got a camera, you see them too.  You could try this.  You don't have to take my word for it.  You could try it absolutely free.  Go to GoToMeeting.com.  Click the orange Try It Free button  and use the offer code TWIT.  If you want to know more while you're at the site,  just run the video on HD Video Conferencing.  This is, I'll vouch for it.  This is how high quality it is.

But if you look at all the groups they deal with  and all the way that rule could have been written,  it only applied to Planned Parenthood.  It's one group out of the many that they deal with.  And so it looked very political.  I don't in this show necessarily wanna get  into the deep, deep politics of it.  No, and that's not tech.

Start time: 4163.00

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What's tech is how they literally four days later  reversed their decision based entirely  on Facebook and Twitter.

Start time: 4170.32
End time: 4217.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they got slammed in their reaction from all spheres.  I think Komen had done a pretty great job brand-wise  of avoiding some of the hot button political turmoil  around women's health in the country in general.  It's tricky.  And had been supported by people  from all sorts of political stripes.  When they made this announcement,  they inserted themselves into a major culture war  and incited another side in so doing,  which is saying, well, if you're committed  to reducing breast cancer among women,  how could you take this funding?  Planned Parenthood also bolstered by social media  was funded heavily in reaction to this.  Mayor Bloomberg wrote them a check for $250,000  and tweeted about how we have to maintain support  for access to these screening processes  among women who don't have access to it.

Start time: 4217.66

Start time: 4225.12
End time: 4264.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And first of all, I think this is a good story  because it was an explosive showdown.  And in the end, they reversed their decision,  but there's something about when the internet  gets its panties in a wad and just they can't let go of it.  It was like-  Well, I'm just waiting for the witch hunt.  It's GoDaddySopa all over again.  Like they're like, go daddy, you support Sopa.  Didn't GoDaddy deserve that?  Well, but then once they fully, fully reversed  their decision and did exactly what everybody  asked them to do, they're like,  yeah, but you're still, I hate your ads so much.  It was the same thing with the Susan G. Coven.  They reversed their decision.  They did what they wanted.  They're like, yeah, but you're still jerks  because you don't like playing parenthood.

Transcript:  And I said, Ryan, that was a really lousy thing to do.  And you said, oh, you're right, I'm sorry I stopped.  I might still hold it against you for a little while.  Yeah, yeah.  Because you had the initial dicky impulse.  Right, but then that would make you a dick.  I'm wearing a dicky, so it's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I love it a lot.  No, no, I don't think, isn't that normal human behavior  to hold it against you for a little bit?

Start time: 4295.06
End time: 4312.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Once you make a correction, once you do what it is.  It doesn't make it all right.  But it changes it to where now you're the,  like if I say to my daughter, you gotta clean your room.  Your room's messy and she cleans it up.  And then I'm like, yeah, your room was messy though.  And that was kind of, you're kind of bad  because you used to have a messy room.  Well, there's degrees.

Start time: 4313.24
End time: 4314.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Transcript:  And then you said you were sorry.  Am I supposed to say, see the Christian thing to do  is to say, oh, he's repented, he's okay.  But some people might not be really great Christians  and might say, you're an asshole.  Right, right.  Well, look, you murdered somebody  and even though you apologized,  I'm not gonna forgive you.  This is, this is, that's just, we've gotten to murder.  Well, no, but that's the point is  it's not necessarily a messy room.  It's somewhere in between murder and a messy room.

Start time: 4341.68

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm just saying that I understand why  after all that backlash,  people don't necessarily immediately forgive.  I haven't forgiven GoDaddy.  I think that that was a cynical retraction on their part.  I think they did support SOPA and then they realized,  oh, it's gonna hurt us.  Oh, let's be cynically retracted.  I'm still not forgiving them.  Susan G. Coman, I haven't really decided.  I have to read more about that.  Actually, the backlash really is now  against their vice president,  who apparently makes a huge amount of money.  Anyway, so there's more to this story.  I think it's human not to forgive immediately.

Start time: 4381.42
End time: 4389.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If it is human, then we're getting back to an argument  you and I had earlier in the show, Brian,  about the way things are versus the way things should be.  And so in this case, now I'm the idea.

Start time: 4390.52

End time: 4435.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Super Bowl's being streamed for the first time.  Big deal now if you're on the mobile platform.  It actually is a big deal.  And there's also a giant crackdown

Start time: 4435.60
End time: 4436.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  on all the illegal streams.

Start time: 4437.74
End time: 4464.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  307 sports-related domains have been seized by the feds.  16 of them allegedly engaged in streaming.  The rest accused of selling fake merchandise.  You see, now I liked what the guy in charge of Rovio,  Angry Birds guy said.  Because I tell you, you walk down the streets  of any major city and you'll see Angry Birds hats.  You know those are not approved.  Like authorized.  Those are not, they didn't go to Rovio.  It's like, I have the license to make this happen.  I'm sure they're making some money.

Start time: 4464.74
End time: 4466.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  May I have a license to advertise your product?

Start time: 4466.12
End time: 4477.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what the guy at Rovio said.  He says, I don't have a problem with that.  That's free publicity.  You know, we license stuff.  We try to do, you know, but I am not gonna go around  and find everybody who's making Angry Birds hats  and try to put them out of business.

Start time: 4477.04
End time: 4518.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me add another twist to it, which is,  sports teams are such a part of the society.  And people feel an ownership over them  well more than Angry Birds,  because they have the city's name on them.  Because they use public funds to subsidize their stadiums  and get all these preferential bonds and financing deals  to lure these teams to towns and make an excuse  to get rights of public way and things like that.  So it's not just some private enterprise.  The league exists as a testament to this idea  of like American civilization and culture  and the Dallas Cowboys and the New York Giants  and the Patriots. But it isn't really.  It is not real anymore.  But I think when you look at the funds,  the public funds that do go to support it,  it's not fully separate welfare.  I believe. Oh my God, it's the worst.

Start time: 4518.92
End time: 4520.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the worst corporate welfare.

Start time: 4520.48
End time: 4528.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're going to demand that the citizens  like fork over cash to build you a stadium,  but you're going to prosecute them for supporting the team  that resides in that stadium.

Start time: 4528.84
End time: 4550.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So here's the difference this year over previous years.  If I had heard this story last year,  I'd be all up in arms and angry about it.  The taking down of all those domains  that are illegally streaming.  Oh, the streaming.  But because this is the first year  that there is a legitimate stream,  then I'm kind of okay with that.  I still think it's douchey on behalf of the NFL.  Like what's the matter?  You guys don't have enough eyeballs  on the freaking Super Bowl.  But we do want to support.

Start time: 4550.60
End time: 4557.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I agree with you.  As soon as iTunes started selling music,  I was much less okay with pirating music.  Yes, exactly.  So I feel the same way.

Start time: 4557.54
End time: 4568.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I'll tell you, there is a lot of emerging spaces  where the needs and wants and desires of the customer  are not being met.  And you can't get angry when piracy occurs  to fill a lack of service.

Start time: 4569.18
End time: 4574.74

Transcript:  In a less screw you kind of piracy,  you have like, to me a real gray area is bootlegs.  Is bootlegs of a concert, of Grateful Dead,  you know, of this particular performance at this date.  There are people who love to collect  every single bit of those,  and they're just not available.  They're just collectors.  They're on hoarders.

Start time: 4596.26
End time: 4599.76

Start time: 4600.31
End time: 4616.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And just to clarify,  I think I'm with you on the streaming.  I was talking particularly about the merchandising  and the cracking down of these unauthorized sales  of paraphernalia,  but the streaming,  especially if their streaming is good,  one, they should just win in the market.  Yes, absolutely.  They should just be naturally better.

Start time: 4616.72
End time: 4622.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, except they're probably stealing the stream  from nfl.com and rebroadcasting, right?  You think so?  Or they've got a camera aimed at a TV set.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll tell you, like, I went through this recently.  I had a bit of a moral conundrum  because I wanted to see the new episodes of Sherlock  on the BBC.  The first season was amazing.  They're not going to be here in America  for three more months.  And so, and meanwhile, there is a player.  There's BitTorrent,  but then there's also the BBC iMovie player  has them all streaming.  But you go there, they're like, oh, sorry, you're in the States.  You live in one of our colonies.  Exactly.  And so, but then, and then I-  That's what you get for going free.  I used a VPN to pretend I'm from London  and all of a sudden it played instantly.  So it's like-  So now you're a British loyalist.  Yes, of course.  Interesting.  Okay.  I'm going to pay my taxes to the Brits.

Start time: 4655.98
End time: 4663.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm going to play devil's advocate  because in Britain, that production,  it's a BBC One production,  was financed by license fees from people in Britain.

Start time: 4664.72
End time: 4669.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Of which you are decidedly not.  The people paying-  I'm mostly from England.  And you want a free ride,

Start time: 4669.52
End time: 4684.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  you want a free ride on all the people in the UK  who pay their TV license fees.  You're a free rider.  But well, I can't deny that.  I've gotten to-  So, I mean, the answer is BBC offer it so we can buy it.  And then we won't be free.  Give us a chance to pay for it.

Start time: 4684.04
End time: 4700.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Weirdly, like I felt dirty.  I got as far as installing the BitTorrent  and starting to download it.  And I felt dirty about that.  But, and so then I switched over to the VPN  and I felt less bad  because they're still getting the view.  They're still showing the advertisements.  That's a good point.  So, the only thing is that my body  is physically not located in London.

Start time: 4700.20
End time: 4715.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And there are two differences.  There's the cost of that stream  is incrementally probably low.  I mailed two pennies to the government.  But if they offered it,  and why can't they offer?  Probably some legal thing  that doesn't acknowledge the network world we live in.

Transcript:  They have started making iPlayer global.  I mean, but I think this is, you're right.  There may be some issues there.  And that's one of the problems  that we don't have a global structure  to make this possible.
