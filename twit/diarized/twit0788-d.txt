You're getting ready for a big event on Tuesday.  I know.  We'll talk about that in just a second.  Also joining us, dear friends from ZDNet days, Ed Bott who is the author of the Ed Bott Report on ZDNet.  Even ZDNet isn't ZDNet anymore but it's good to see you Ed.  We're the same.  Good to see you.  Yeah, great to see you Ed.  And from Tech Republic, now a CBS interactive, CBS keeps changing the name.  I don't know what, Bill Detwiler is here.  Hi Bill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the new name.  Geez Louise.  And it's funny because it's so incestuous.  So Tech Republic is ZDNet, is it still ZDNet?  Oh yeah, so Ed and I are colleagues.

Start time: 238.40

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tech Republic and ZDNet are both part of the B2B group that is also part of CNET,  which is also part of Viacom CBS Digital.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So Viacom was rumored to be selling CNET.  Did they actually go through with that or was that just a rumor?

Start time: 255.42
End time: 260.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well that would be news to me if they had but yeah, that is a rumor that was out there.

Start time: 261.70
End time: 281.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, Viacom CBS to weigh options for CNET as buyers show interest but this was back in February  and then more recently there was a story that maybe there was a buyer but that hasn't happened.  So Viacom has been unloading stuff is what's been happening.  Not the good stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well I don't know anything.  Even if I could.  Even if I knew.  There wouldn't be anything to share.  So I think that's one of the interesting things when you start to work for a large corporation  is a lot of times people on the outside think maybe people on the inside know more than they do.  I'm sure there are people that do but not at my level.  You're right.  So low on the total poll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The latest according to the Hollywood Reporter because Viacom is a Hollywood enterprise,  they bought CNET in 2008 for 1.8 billion.  They have been selling off quote non-core assets after the merger with CBS.  Let's see the latest.  It doesn't say just possible sale but it doesn't say who they're selling to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're talking about age.  He was 100 or something.  He was ancient.  He was pretty far along there.  And there were some rumors that he wasn't fully  accomplishmentist.  Maybe there was a girlfriend involved who was running things and it got a little seamy.  Way above my grade.  Yeah.  It's not our issue either.  Viacom, CBS looking to sell CNET to Red Ventures, a marketing company.  Let's hope that doesn't happen.  For half a billion, that's a little bit of a loss.  Actually, as long as we're in acquisition territory, another rumor that Nvidia might finally,  and this was a speculation, be buying Arm Ventures.  And this is from SoftBank and the deal is rumored to be for $40 billion,  which would be a tidy little profit for SoftBank who bought it for $32 billion.  Four years ago.  $2 billion a year profit?  I'll take it.  I'll take it.  Well, they need the cash.  SoftBank made a big investment in two fine upstanding enterprises.  WeWork, which didn't work, especially in COVID, the work sharing place, a business.  And then what was the other?  Uber?  They had some other big Uber.  It had some big losses.

Start time: 443.32
End time: 457.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uber was their biggest one.  They had several other bad investments also.  But if we want to continue with the theme of Zip Davis, ZD Net,  it was SoftBank that bought Zip Davis.

Transcript:  I remember.  I remember Eric coming up.  Eric Hippo.  Hippo, the CEO, sending a voice message to all of us employees saying,  in effect, you're now owned by SunSun.  Everybody say hi to SunSun.  He's the guy in charge of SoftBank.  I remember that vividly.

Transcript:  It was either a 500-year plan or a 2,000-year plan for the business.  I'm not even joking with that.  Really long-term thinking.

Start time: 494.14
End time: 510.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Long-term thinking is fine unless you invest in WeWork and Uber.  And suddenly it becomes short-term.  So that would be interesting.  Would it be a conflict of interest for Nvidia to own ARM?  They would become a chip powerhouse, wouldn't they?

Start time: 511.80
End time: 565.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's two things that I think there.  Number one, antitrust regulators would have their eyebrows raised really, really high  over that one.  You do have Intel as a major competitor there,  but still concentrating that much power in Nvidia, which is bigger than Intel,  and then giving them ARM.  That would be one thing.  Second thing is I would really love to see Tim Cook's reaction to this because he went  to all the trouble of getting rid of doing their own silicon and everything,  not having anything to do with Nvidia for years and years and years.  And now with Apple silicon being licensed from ARM, then they would be deeply involved.  Wouldn't that be ironic?

Start time: 567.44
End time: 648.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So that's one thing it's speculated that antitrust regulators would insist on,  that none of the existing ARM architecture licenses, including Apple's,  would be modified by the Nvidia acquisition.  I think Apple probably is scrambling.  It's ARM in name only, I think, what Apple will do.  Apple silicon.  You need ARM because you need compatibility, but I think none of the chips Apple's designed  starting in 2007 with a chip for the iPhone have been really not liking the way,  for instance, Qualcomm does ARM, fully ARM chips.  They licensed the architecture.  They're ARM compatible, but I suspect Apple, I don't know, but I suspect Apple's a lot of  custom silicon in there that is not ARM.  Yeah.  Yeah, I believe that.  I believe now.  This is the question, Laurie.  I'm curious what you think.  There is an Apple event.  It's official Tuesday, 10 a.m. Pacific.  We'll be streaming it right after iOS today, right before you and I and Andy and Renee  comment on MacBreak Weekly.  And, you know, it's widely thought that Apple will announce an Apple Watch and a new iPad Air.  Probably not the iPhone.  That's probably going to be saved for next month.  But I think there are rumors that maybe this is what Apple has said.  We're going to ship a computer, a Macintosh this year with our new silicon.  This might be, you think, the event they announced that at?

Start time: 649.76
End time: 673.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I go back and forth with it.  I truly don't think it's going to be this Tuesday.  I think it's going to happen soon.  It might happen at the iPhone event that is expected to come sometime in October.  I don't think this is that event.  I really do think this one's going to be an iPad and an Apple Watch event and not anything else.  I just don't think this is going to be their big one.

Start time: 674.28
End time: 714.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My thought is also my wishful thinking is it is because I can't wait to see Apple Silicon.  And I'm not refusing to buy anything until I see what they do with that Mac or PC.  But I think you're right.  But I also don't think they'll do it in the iPhone announcement because they don't want  to dilute that.  So I think they have three announcements this year.  They have one this month for the watch and the iPad Air.  And by the way, they'll have to announce iOS 14 and probably the new Mac OS at that time.  Certainly iOS and iPad OS 14 and WatchOS 7 will be Tuesday.  They'll announce the new iPad Air and perhaps Apple Tags, the new tile competitor.

Start time: 715.82
End time: 741.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think we'll see Air Tags this time around.  That's an iPhone thing.  OK, yeah, you're right.  Almost positive that's not coming until the iPhone event for sure.  That one specifically.  We might see the new AirPod Studio if that's a thing because that seems more in line with  something that could come out this soon right away.  You know, new iPads and things like that, but not the Air Tags.  I don't think we're going to see that.

Start time: 741.66
End time: 767.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So to put this in terms, everybody will understand the bud will be the watch and the iPad Air.  The seeds and the stems might be a few other things that trickle through the sieve.  And then next month, I think iPhone and that's pretty much going to be a big iPhone announcement.  That's their bread and butter.  Why dilute that?  And I think maybe November have an Apple Silicon announcement that's dedicated to Apple Silicon.  Why not?

Start time: 768.22
End time: 830.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I want it to be later in the year because if it's going to be this upcoming  Tuesday, that means all they did was put an Apple Silicon chip in the 13 inch MacBook Pro.  And I don't want that.  I want a 14 inch MacBook Pro with a new bezel screen and everything.  So I want them to be working on a brand new Mac.  And we haven't heard any rumors from the supply chain of new Macbook related things coming out.  There's none of those kinds of leaks coming out.  So that would mean supplies chain hasn't started working on the product, which means  Apple wouldn't announce something like that this soon.  We'd be waiting to hear.  So maybe we'd hear some rumors from the supply chain in October and then an event in November  so that late November it would be ready.  If they're lucky, Apple I'm sure wants to get it out by the holiday season.  But at the same time, it's Mac.  Not a lot of people buy computers for each other for Christmas.  So they could delay it as late as the very end of the year, late December.  Just get it out at the end of the year.

Transcript:  They need to live up to their promise.  But we've seen this before.  They did this with the...

Start time: 836.44
End time: 853.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they don't need to live up to their promise because they don't live up to their promises  usually.  So really they can hold it off.  They can say, we were supposed to have it at the end of 2020, but we want to make sure  that this is perfect.  So we're not going to release it until first quarter 2021.  I think you're right.

Start time: 854.03
End time: 855.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They could do that.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Start time: 855.85
End time: 862.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  How long did we have to wait for the Mac Pro?  It was like two years after they said they were going to announce it.

Start time: 862.32
End time: 884.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I think most Apple people think better to wait and get it right than to rush something  out.  Speaking of rushing something out, let's take a look at this.  Look at that.  This is the Surface Duo, which is fascinating.  Did you get a sample of this?  I here?  Yeah.  And you put your bumper on too.

Start time: 884.96
End time: 890.90

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I could top you.  I spent a hundred bucks extra for 256 gigs.  No, so did I.  Oh, you did.  We're gamblers.  We had an all-in.  We pushed all the chips in.  We said, I don't care if it's no good.  I'm putting every penny I own into this thing.  How about you, Bill?  This isn't something you would normally review, or is it?

Start time: 914.59
End time: 927.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  I wrote a piece on it, but I did not put down the corporate credit card or my own credit  card for one just yet.  So I was going to take a little more cautious wait and see approach with it.

Transcript:  Let this be the Samsung Galaxy Fold and then see what happens for the second version with  the Fold 2.

Start time: 940.20
End time: 962.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I decided not to get the Fold.  It was really for me, I'm going to get one or the other.  I do think there's something to be said for full screen devices.  This is actually kind of an interesting use case.  There's the football game and I could just sit it like this.  In fact, maybe I will.  While Ed talks about what he thinks of the duo.  Go ahead, Ed.  It's all yours.

Transcript:  I can't say that out loud because then the commissioner Roger Godel would come to my  house and breathe on me.  So I'm not going to do that.  So pick two numbers between 0 and 100.

Start time: 982.46
End time: 1001.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did.  I just posted an article today.  I haven't had enough time to do a review of my own on this.  I have some very preliminary opinions about it.  But I did an article today where I went through, I think, 11 different reviews that other people  have done.

Start time: 1001.68
End time: 1004.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, the meta review.  That's smart.

Start time: 1006.31
End time: 1149.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The meta review.  There are definitely some themes in there.  I think everyone is, as am I, just blown away by the quality of the hardware built.  Beautiful.  I expected nothing less because the Surface team, that's kind of what they do is they build  beautiful hardware.  They've had enough time to do this.  So that's something that everyone noticed.  The specs on it are a bit underwhelming.  It's last year's Snapdragon processor.  It's only six gigabytes of RAM.  It doesn't have 5G, but I don't care.  It doesn't have wireless charging, but neither do a lot of 5G phones.  It's one of those things.  It's sort of last year's technology, but I think they did that so that they could  really focus on tuning this brand new software to the components that are inside of it.  The universal judgment on the camera is that it's not worthy of a $1,400 or $1,500 device.  Maybe they can fix that with software.  A lot of the original reviewers who had it early, who were playing with it before they  got the final update that came to paying customers like us, said, boy, this thing is buggy.  They would be flying around the screen and things would turn upside down and whatever.  I haven't noticed any of that bugginess, but I've noticed a few more minor issues with it.  I think the general consensus that everyone had when I read this is this is really visionary.  There's probably something in here that's going to survive for a long time.  It's going to become the DNA of a new generation of devices, but it's going to have to go through  some iteration before it gets there.  Out of the 11 reviews that I saw, I think there were two who said it's worth buying now.

Start time: 1151.86
End time: 1162.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's so expensive. If it were $800, then I think it would be a different...  We would say, yeah, you should get it because it's cool, but at $1,400, it's hard to justify.  Bill, what were your thoughts on it?

Start time: 1164.70
End time: 1273.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I actually think I did a little tongue in cheek with the title on my piece. I said it's not  the foldable phone you're looking for. Just like Ed, I thought the specs were a little  underwhelming for the price tag and the productivity gains for it. Having not tested it out myself,  I think there's a little bit of... They're unproven as of yet, I think was the way I described it.  But I am a huge fan of foldable devices. I've written about Samsung's and Motorola's devices,  and I do believe, just like Ed said, that there is something in the DNA of the Duo or the new  Z Fold 2 or any of the other foldable devices that will survive and start to become the default.  I mean, for me, I'm looking for either a tablet replacement. I still don't know that I've gotten  to the place where I can replace, say, a laptop and still carrying a phone. That's still where  I'm looking. Can I get to a single device future or is the Duo just going to be my phone and I  still have a laptop or a convertible, a Surface tablet or whatever it is? Or can it be the one  device? And I don't know that we're there yet. So if I'm still stuck at two devices, for right now,  I'm still going to get a laptop to work on and then maybe just a regular phone or maybe a bigger  foldable phone. But I don't know about the Duo yet, just yet. So I am excited. I love the two  screens. I love that it says the build quality is good. I mean, that's really important with the  disaster we saw the first fold. So that's very encouraging. Yeah, I think it's less ambitious

Start time: 1274.34
End time: 1300.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  to do two screens. And by the way, these are really good LGO-led screens. They really,  I mean, the red on the 49ers uniform just pops. But that's a technology that's well known and  well understood and much less risky than a folding screen. It also feels like a real glass screen,  which the fold does not. So in that respect, I don't think they're facing the same kind of

Start time: 1300.38
End time: 1326.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  challenges. Yeah, go ahead, Laura. Leo and Ed, both of you,  the short time you've spent with this, does this feel like a really big, really usable,  versatile phone? Or does it feel like a really small tablet in terms of how it just kind of  feels for you and works for you? What do you think, Ed? For me, it definitely feels like a tablet.

Start time: 1327.76
End time: 1413.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It, with the ability, just the size and the ability to do two things side by side, which  I wouldn't, even though that's technically possible with some of the larger phones,  it's just something that has never worked for me. Whereas it does here, you know, a couple of the  use case scenarios that, you know, that people in the reviews talked about and that I've seen  is, for example, you can, if you're using the Outlook email client on this, you can have your  message list on the left screen and your preview pane on the right screen so that you're just tap,  tap, tap, tap, tap through the list on the left and reading things where, and you can skip over  messages that you're not interested in. You can't do that on a single screen device. You can use  this like a paperback book, because the Kindle app in it actually flows to two screens. So, you know,  read the left hand screen, read the right hand screen, turn the page. And I find it easier to  quickly scan those small screens than the big ones. And again, that's something that you can't do on  a phone, but you can do on a tablet. And then they have, there's a concept that they have of  something called app groups where you create a shortcut that basically opens two apps at

Start time: 1413.86
End time: 1559.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  once side by side. So I'm using that, for instance, on this, I have a chess book on the left hand with  the Kindle and on the right hand, I have a chess program, which allows me to move the pieces.  I admit $1,400 for the perfect wallet chess set is a little pricey, but it's really good. This is the  best system I've ever seen for that. By the way, I also have a picture in picture of the Niners game.  So I'll take that away because that's distracting. But that's, I think the groups are very,  very interesting. I've been using them a lot. You know, there's a challenge with this device  to reviewers. And I think this kind of highlights some of the problems we have with tech reviews  these days is this can't really be reviewed in the same way that you review, say, the iPhone 12 or  the Galaxy Note 20, because it's not like those devices. It's totally different. And so I think  one of the problems reviewers have is they come to it, I certainly did. And I didn't really know  how to use it completely. And so it took me a while to get used to, I think some, you know,  partly there was an update, you know, the minute you open it up, there was a fairly large update  that fixed, I think, a lot of the problems the early reviewers had, the pre-production guys had.  But I also think that some of it is, it takes you a while to kind of start changing how you think  about it. It's not a folding screen. It's a two screen device. So that's a very different idea  from anything that we've had before. That's why I know it's not exactly a phone and it's not exactly  a tablet. It's a two screen device, which is an odd combination. And yet I think as you use it,  you come up with more and more use cases. I'm also at a disadvantage because I'm not all in  on Microsoft. So I can't, I don't use Outlook. And for some reason, Outlook will not let me  use my mail provider, Fastmail. And so I can't really use it as my mail client. And unfortunately,  nobody else has optimized their software for a two screen device. So even some of the Microsoft  apps are not optimized for the two screen device. So that may change as well. I mean,  I think the software will improve. I do agree, Ed, that a better camera software could make this  camera maybe acceptable. I mean, it's not a terrible sensor. And certainly Google has shown  with the right software, you could take in a mediocre sensor and deliver pretty good photos.

Start time: 1560.24
End time: 1698.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a little disappointing. And several of the reviewers pointed out that that sensor, that  camera and software makes a really, really good webcam. It's a great webcam. Yeah. Right.  They should, it's better than the webcam in a MacBook, for example.  Well, that's not hard.  But, you know, but the point is there that I think they, you know, they probably,  Microsoft probably should have positioned it that way, rather than, you know, but it's also,  the thing is just so thin that, you know, that they had to make a lot of,  let's just call them decisions. Even if, even if they're not really compromises,  they're just decisions where you say, if I'm going to put a sensor in here that's greater than 11  megapixels, I'm going to have to make the device thicker. And if I make one side thicker, the other  side has to be the same thickness. So the whole thing is doubled. Whatever, whatever thickness I  add has, it has to double there when you, when the thing is folded and sitting there. And, you know,  so there's all of these engineering decisions that, you know, that went into it, you know, and  it was a comment that Owen Williams made in his review there, which he said, you know, when he  started, started the review process for this, he was thinking of it one way, but, but the whole  act of using two different apps at a time, interacting with each other, made him more  intentional about the way he uses the phone, which I thought was a really good way of putting it.  It isn't, this isn't something that you just sort of pick up and glance at the way that I do with  my iPhone. You know, you pick it up, you glance at it, you put it down. This is something you pick  it up, you, and you know, you can put it into single screen mode. You know, just flip it over  and then you've got one screen to look at and you can sort of use it that way. But the real,  you know, what you're paying for, what you're paying that big price for is to open it up  and do something that is wide and potentially more than just something that you glance at

There we go. There I am. Oh, I am sideways. Wait a  minute. Now I'm upside down. That by the way, is part of the problem with this thing. There we go.  I think it's pretty good. And the nice thing is I could put this on the table like a little smurf  laptop or as I call it a smurfess and it really, I don't know why it's rotated like that. That's  something that Lou M.M. who works for Microsoft said, yeah, the accelerometer is a little wonky.  You have to open it wide up. Let me turn on the audio from Skype. There you go. Open it wide.  And then it rotates better. And then you can tent it. But then it's tented on the table here.  And I think that's great. This is a nice little big Skype call. Hey, how you doing?

Transcript:  I think that's the real sort of new thing with these dual screen devices, devices that have  hinges. Is it a phone? Is it a tablet? Is a laptop replacement? How do the companies market it  to consumers who are maybe saying, what is this new thing? I mean, that was the one thing with  some of the Microsoft's original messaging around this was don't call the phone. It's not a phone.  But to the average consumer, the buyer that looks at it is like, looks like a phone,  makes phone calls, seems like a phone. So I think there is going to be some education there  that companies marketing the devices are going to have to do if they want consumers to see it as a

Start time: 1823.48

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  new way of working or using the device. I have to say, I'm trying to think of an appropriate  analogy. I feel like it's like having a girlfriend that's a little challenging,  but as you spend more time with it, you kind of grow to like it. And now I feel like I'm almost  falling in love with it. There's something about it. First, it's really, and by the way,  the iPad had this problem too. What is this? How does this fit in to my world? Steve Jobs even very  specifically said it's in between a phone and a computer. I don't know what this is in between,  but as you use it, the other thing is it's very hard to type because it's a little book in your  hand and typing on a little book is not easy. You can flip it all the way back though, right?  You can. And then it's just like a strange aspect ratio phone because it's not a normal  aspect ratio. It's a three by two. It's a three to two aspect ratio.

Transcript:  The observation, I think that's a very good observation that you made there, Leo. One of  the things about the original iPad was that most of the apps that were available for it were blown  up iPhone apps when it first came out. And so you'd have this thing and you'd look at it and you'd go,  Whoa, everything's really huge. And it's ugly. And it sort of seemed proportional on iPhones at that  time were pretty small. They just seemed huge. But the iPad made more sense as developers started  building apps specifically for that size of screen. And I think one of the things you see

Start time: 1939.90
End time: 1945.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  is that there's a peril here because no one ever developed Android tablet apps.

Start time: 1946.34
End time: 2030.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the peril is exactly where I was going with this is that this is what this is running is  phone apps in it. And now you need to, you know, what Microsoft has done is to rejigger some of its  apps to get them to behave on a larger screen, to take advantage of the larger screen instead of just  being larger. And so one of the tests of a device like this is whether developers will rise to that  challenge and adapt their apps to a new form factor, or whether they will just say, you know,  what's the minimum flag that I can put in this code to make it, you know, install and work on a  larger two screen device and there you're going to get it sort of unsatisfying experience that way.  And, you know, really one of the measures of success of this thing is going to be whether  third parties say, we're going to jump in and, and build some stuff that takes advantage of this.  And helps people understand why it works. If they do that, then there's, then there's third party  hardware manufacturers that could say, well, I guess maybe we should build one of these also,  since there's, there's apps that will take advantage of this new form factor, these new

Start time: 2030.38
End time: 2108.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  capabilities. Google did build into Android 10 and later the dual screen or folding screen support,  but it's not the same kind of support that you need for this. I think one thing Microsoft did  do that was quite clever is those groups that you mentioned. So I have, you know, I have, for  instance, reading a book and taking notes side by side. And I think that that's kind of an interesting  use case. And that doesn't require specialized applications. That just  kind of requires the user to think of ways to use both screens simultaneously.  I'm very curious. You know, like I said, I've come to like it more and more as I use it. And  I think one of the tricks is going to be to force reviewers and people to throw away their other  phone and spend maybe a month acclimating to a whole different way of thinking. Just even the  idea that you would hold a phone like an open little open book is weird. You know, it's just  weird. And I don't think doing this really gives you a satisfying experience completely. So I  don't know. It's I'm really curious. The fact that we've spent the last half hour talking about  those shows that there is something happening. This is not a complete failure. Yeah.

Transcript:  From my, from an Apple perspective, I'm excited by seeing, to me, the most interesting thing about  this is the way they've manipulated two separate screens to give you a view that's important. So  when you unfolded the phone and there was the football game playing on top and there was it  looked like an app tray on the bottom for some other things that you can select. That is that is  usability right there. And, you know, I'm thinking about what Apple could do in the future. That's  just my what I'm always thinking about. So I'm thinking, can Apple do something like this with  their version of a foldable phone that will, you know, you know, they're working on something.

Transcript:  and I think that I think that they are currently trying to figure out how to do  what Microsoft is doing, but better there. You know, they may not do it, but they're looking  at it and they're figuring stuff out. And I think the part of the problem that we're seeing  with foldable phones is what's the point of a foldable phone? Like where's the usability in  this? And it kind of looks like though it might be a little early in its early phases, this, this,  the Microsoft duo, it is answering that question. It is saying, this is what you do with a foldable

You know, one of the  things it may just mean, my vision is actually pretty good for, for an old fart. But so I don't  have too much trouble reading this, but I would be, I would be more comfortable if this were,  you know, instead of, you know, whatever this is, you know, 5.6 inches or whatever, you know, if it  were maybe an inch bigger diagonally each way, that would be interesting. But, you know, then  you get into the thing about, oh, you know, they're just big phone apps again at that point.

But, but, but, but  I'm Mason from Mobile Tech Review.  Let me turn off Lisa's audio. She does a great job, but you see how small this is. This reminds me  of my Scion 3A, which I was deeply in love with because it had a real keyboard. It was about this

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  size. It was like a, a, a glasses case. So that's why I love the form factor. I mean, I had one of  these and used it for years as a sort of a test machine. The problem with it was it was terrible  hardware. It just, it, it was, it wasn't a complete laptop replacement, but the functionality that  you mentioned, Leo, of having that keyboard. I mean, we're writers and media folks, so we're  working on that keyboard all the time. And that's what was really important. But, you know, you,  you would like to see, that's the one thing that has me at Foldable Phones and has had me with  I've got one of the iPad Pros and I have both of the different cases for the covers for it,  because I need the keyboard and sometimes I want it so it folds all the way over. Sometimes I want  it so it sits up. And if I don't like having a separate, I don't know if I really haven't had  good luck with any of the Bluetooth little pocket size keyboards that I've used with some of the  Samsung's, the Note devices. So, you know, I would like to see them figure out how to combine that  folding phone with a keyboard experience that works really well. Well, that's the Neo, isn't it? This

And that's one of the things that's, you know, there's been, there's been way too much tragedy,  so I'm not going to call it tragic. But it is, it is very, it'd be very sad if I had spent years of  my life as an engineer working on a device like this, and then discovered that the world has  changed around me. And everything that I'm doing, you know, whoops, isn't, isn't, isn't as relevant.

Transcript:  Now that I'm looking at this original video, this is the duo running Windows.  They've changed it, as you pointed out in subsequent designs, but this is the original  conception for the Surface Neo. It is a duo. I don't think Windows is a good fit for this,  to be honest. I think Android's a much better fit. And there's the keyboard folding out,  so you get the keyboard advantage. Yeah, I think it's bigger. Oh, it is definitely bigger. Look at

I was  going to say earlier, you know, Apple, I think that if I'm an engineer at Apple, I am looking  at the Touch Bar and saying, how can I take that thin strip? Right. And how can I make that just  bigger and richer? Because, you know, many, many, many Apple customers understand the Touch Bar.  Many Apple developers understand the Touch Bar. And, and so, you know, that would be a way. Yeah,

Transcript:  I'm a little disappointed that the Neo isn't going to happen. Although I think Android is better  suited, frankly, maybe as it gets bigger, it'll work better with a full, full board operating  system. I just feel like something like this or the iPad or any tablet doesn't want a desktop  operating system. That's just too hard to use. I did like that keyboard though. That's, if there's  one drawback to that, this, the duo is trying to type on it as hard. When you fold it back,  then it's just like a phone, but you kind of feel like you should be typing in this mode

Start time: 2549.32
End time: 2615.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  as a little booklet. And that's weird. But keep in mind that Windows 10 X is not,  I mean, it's a desktop operating system, but it's not a desktop operating system. It is going to  jettison all of that win 32 stuff. It's going to be store apps only. It's going to be very, very  locked down in terms of graphics and such. And so a lot of the things that you object to with  a desktop OS include the things that make a desktop OS unstable. Well, those won't be part  of it. And all of the backward compatibility stuff, the legacy desktop apps, the only way that  they're going to run is if they are emulated into that environment. But the apps that run in it  are basically going to be things that are designed for touchscreen devices. So I don't  think that's really the problem with Neo. It's just that it doesn't have an identity at this point.

Our show today brought to you by Extra Hop. Now this is a nice slice of something good  for your cloud. The new IT reality is remote access on a massive scale, right?  Nobody's coming to work. Rapid cloud and even multi-cloud adoption, a steady increase in  internet of things devices, all on top of a rise in cyber crime. Now that is a stew that could be  toxic. So it's more important than ever. Organizations can see what's going on in their  environment all the way from the cloud to the data center to the customer. In order to protect and  scale your business, you need more though than just unified visibility. You need context.  So that when you're looking at that dashboard and you detect a problem, you can respond  intelligently. You've got a workflow your teams can use to act fast, to collaborate easily. Breaches  are a huge problem right now in business. It is a massive issue and you do not want to be the  next headline. You know, big breach at company X, all the data lost, ransomware shut them down.  ExtraHop eliminates blind spots, detects threats, other tools missed to keep your business secure  and available. It's a SaaS based cloud native network detection and response tool. People love  it too. Wizards of the Coast has been using it to secure and support their Amazon cloud with  ExtraHop. We talked to chief architect and information security officer, Dan McDaniel.  Here's the money quote. He said, quote, there's no other company that aligns to supporting  the DevOps model, the speed and the lack of friction than ExtraHop. Ulta Beauty uses  ExtraHop to secure their Google cloud as well as keep their networking and security teams closely  aligned. That way engineers have more time to focus on innovation. You know, constantly fighting  fires. Senior IT engineer, John Kreese says, quote, before ExtraHop, we had limited visibility into  what was going on in the cloud. Now we can quickly identify vulnerabilities and exploits and understand  how our applications are performing in the cloud. ExtraHop started with performance monitoring,  but they noted once you're monitoring the performance, look at this dashboard too. This  is so cool. Once you're monitoring that, you can also detect threats. And so it's both.  It's both. Take control of your cloud security and performance with ExtraHop.

I really  have high hopes for that. And I don't want Apple just to put new guts in a MacBook 13. I really  want them to come up with something that looks different, feels different. I don't want to see  butterfly keys. Crossing my fingers anyway. We'll see. It's just nice to have something.  The reason I think we spent so much time talking about this duo is something that's different.  That's just not another slab of glass. Innovation is hard in this business.  Let's see. I want to kind of follow up. I guess September 15th, which is Apple's event date,  is also a drop dead date for TikTok. I was watching the football game today and there was an ad  for TikTok. That's an expensive ad. Why in heaven's name would they buy an ad if in two days they could  be gone? The president said he will not extend the deadline. I have to think that both Microsoft,  there's a Microsoft Walmart bid and there's an Oracle bid apparently. Maybe other companies  involved. I have to think these companies are saying maybe we don't want to buy it since China  has announced there will be export restrictions on the AI, on the secret sauce that ByteDance uses to  make TikTok work. Is it less valuable because of that? Is there a chance there will be a Hail Mary  and that Monday afternoon, Monday night, Microsoft or Oracle will announce, yes, we've acquired it?

Transcript:  While you were watching the football game, Dan Primack at Axios posted a story that  Oracle has leapfrogged Microsoft as the most likely buyer of TikTok's US operations,  according to multiple sources. But he says the situation remains very fluid, including the  possibility of no deal at all. And the most likely outcome in any of these circumstances  would be two companies, one that's only in the United States and the other that is all the rest  of the world with the same name and completely different everything else's. Including not just

Start time: 3149.18
End time: 3154.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  content, but including algorithm, right? Because they can't buy the algorithm. Algorithms and

Start time: 3154.96
End time: 3186.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  distribution networks as well. So that makes you wonder what are you actually buying? I mean,  what's the real value? Is it the customers? Is it the platform? Typically, you get the platform,  so you get that algorithm. But if you're not going to get that in the US, then you're just  acquiring all the customers. And then you have to do all the investment in yourself and build the  algorithm yourself. Whoever gets it, it seems like a Herculean challenge. Now, supposedly,

Start time: 3187.14
End time: 3205.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I didn't look too deeply into it. On Wednesday, ByteDance, they had said they were going to do  this, released the TikTok algorithm. Did any of you guys look at this and see if there's anything  in there or if it's just empty words? It's not the secret sauce to Coca-Cola.

Transcript:  Yeah, that's what it sounds like. Matt Cutts, when he was on the show some time ago,  Matt was an early Googler. Of course, now he runs the United States Digital Service. He's  an administrator there. But when he was at Google, he was very much involved in the algorithm for  Google. He said, I don't think the TikTok algorithm is all that complicated. He said, I think we could  duplicate it pretty quickly. You just look at it. It's all about optimizing engagement, right?  So if you just, the whole, the way that TikTok works, like YouTube, by the way, is brilliant.  You get a bunch of people to give you content for nothing. Give us content. And then you watch what  people watch. And when something catches on, you surface it more and more and more and more and more  so that when somebody first signs up the onboarding process at YouTube or Google,  you immediately get stuff that's compelling and you continue to get recommended stuff that's  compelling because it's a self-reinforcing learning circle. And so more content, surface the best.  More content, surface the best. It doesn't seem that hard. I think anybody could do this. Maybe  that's what Oracle, maybe even Larry Ellison. Maybe that's what Oracle, I could do that.

Transcript:  then they could partner with them. Let's say I bought it. We won't call it TikTok. We'll call  it LickLock. Leo's TikTok. And so the first thing I do is I say, well, I'm not getting the algorithm.  Fine. In my opinion, the key to TikTok, the key to the whole operation is getting people to use it,  right? And why did TikTok succeed where Periscope failed? Because creators liked it. They liked  making videos in it. They liked it that they could take somebody else's audio and make a response  video or a lip sync video to it. And I think you do get that. It's obvious. It's on the surface.  There's no, that's not a hidden thing. You get the way TikTok makes it easy for people to create  stuff. That's the job one is to get people to keep using it. That's why you keep the name. You don't  call it LickLock, obviously. You keep the name. Although I like LickLock, I might create LickLock.  I'm on board with it. You don't change the UI. The average person has no idea it's a new owner.  You're going to get the data anyway, right? Because look, how do you get all the information  you'd ever want about a user? You get them to put your app on their phone. End. Job done. End of  story, right? Then you ask for a bunch of permissions real quick so nobody notices. And it's your golden  profit. So all you really need is an app that's popular. The people want to give you a lot of  content. And then the algorithm, like I said, you just surface the stuff people look at. It's what  Facebook does with its newsfeed. You know, time the engagement, the more engagement.  I don't think it's that hard. I think LickLock is going to be a huge hit.

It was about the creators,  which is what you want to, you know, you want to get people to download it and start watching  flicking through like zombies. I don't think in fact, it does beg the question, why couldn't  Instagram and its lip lock? Sorry, tick tock lip locks even better than LickLock. It's even better.  Yep. Why couldn't Instagram's reels do as well? Why was it because everybody was already on tick

There's hundreds of social media  things out there. Some of them catch and some of them don't. And it's just it's like fire. Sometimes  it goes out and sometimes it spreads. And while, you know, there's a lot of algorithms that and  interface and features that make tick tock really great for creators and viewers. Sometimes it's just  a random reason why that started and then reels coming on the heels of tick tocks. You don't think

There's such a thing as being too late,  you know, to the party, you know, Instagram or Pinterest or, you know, look at, you know,  Facebook catching on and GeoCities going to I mean, you can sort of, you know, go back through  the history of tech and find things that sort of caught fire. I'll be interested with tick tock  to see how it affects innovation going forward. Like, like if it is just fire, what incentive does  a does a big company have to pour millions or hundreds of millions of dollars into a platform  that can't succeed or that is just going to be, you know, up, you know, just going to be usurped  or, you know, going to be outshined by, you know, three people in a garage. I mean, that's a story  as old as tech itself, I guess. But it does seem like, you know, one of the other stories  that we were hadn't really talked about, though, were some of the antitrust, some of the issues  around sort of with the social media sites, right, sort of saying that they had to and Google saying  they have too much power, too much market share, things like that. So I think, you know, what,  what do the big companies that want to stay big that do? Do they just keep buying up the  tick tock? Do they wait till something comes along? Do they then buy it up?

I think that's a pretty damn  good domain. Yeah. Somebody's gonna want to buy that up from you at some point. Oh, there's how  you make money. Sell it. Yeah. So I don't know what the deadline is. Apparently, there was another  executive order that extended it to the 20th, but it's either Tuesday or next Sunday. Do you think  and what will they what will it cost? Because because clearly, it's a fire sale, right?  Byte dance has to unload it or it's or the president's just gonna he must have a big  switch in the Oval Office. He just got throw the switch and there's there's no more tick tock.  I don't know how that works. I don't think he does either. But  presumably, there's some way to switch. How do you how would by the way,  come September 20th, what do you do? You freeze the assets, you say no more. I think that's what  you would do. Would you say, okay, US banks, you cannot try no more money transferred to byte dance  that tiptock would still run? Do we do we have a means to I don't think we do.

It was an ad from Huawei  about a doctor working in a rural community in the United States. Talking about how the 5g had  freed him as a veterinarian, it freed him from having to be in his office near a phone, he could  go out anywhere and he could you know, he was about to deliver a calf or something like this.  And then at the end, it was the the Huawei logo and the tagline connect, not divide.  And and I think that I think what you're also going to be seeing what you're seeing with  tic tac there is a little bit of, hey, look how fun we are. Look how nice we are. Why is this guy  picking on us? And oh, by the way, our lawyers are going to be in federal district court  at 1201 a.m. on September 20th, getting a restraining order.

Transcript:  It's really interesting. You know, on my sympathy, I hate to admit this, because it just shows me to  be a fool. My sympathies are with Tic Tac. I think this is such a great platform for so many people.  I understand the Chinese government has influence on it and perhaps could use it to spy on people.  And I understand that there have been case lots of cases of Tic Tac censoring political speech,  you can't post anything about Uyghurs or Hong Kong on it. For a while, they were censoring  unattractive people. Or maybe they weren't maybe the algorithm was doing it for them.  But my sympathies are a little bit in Tic Tac's court. I, but I just don't know. A, I don't know  what the White House could do. B, I don't know what Tic Tac's doing. I don't know what Huawei's doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is I think, um, I it's not that I have sympathies for one side or another on this,  but it's more for me just, what does this mean? What does this look like? And how does this work  when, when a, when a company like Tic Tac or, or, um, is it's so big, it's so ubiquitous in  the United States. And then there's a federal mandate that comes down that just says,  this isn't allowed anymore. And then the rest of the world has to figure out what that means and  how to follow through with that, that kind of ban or demand or whatever. It just, it seems really  confusing because, you know, even if Oracle were to buy Tic Tac and it were to become a US company,  I and the app on my phone that is Tic Tac, will that just magically turn into the app that's owned  by Oracle? There's a, it seems like there's a lot that has to go into that process. And, and, uh,  you know, how, what exactly does this vague mandate really mean? You know, how much of it is  enforceable versus how much of it is, um, you know, just a lot of, uh, you know,  just taught to look good. You know, this is all just so new and so different. And it, it all,  it's all this, you know, government that doesn't understand technology kind of stuff going on, like  there's certainly a reason for us to be leery of, um, this kind of ubiquitousness, ubiquity  from, um, you know, from a, from a country that could potentially have access to a lot of our  personal data. That is something for us to be concerned with, but just kind of throwing out  this, this, you, you just can't be in our country anymore. It doesn't work like that in technology.  There's so much more involved in this that has to be thought about and figured out. And I don't know.  It's, it's, and again, it's not that I'm sympathizing with the, with Tic Tac, with the  company. It's that I, I'm sympathizing with nobody's ability to understand what the heck  we're supposed to do next. What companies are supposed to do next, what this means for them.

Start time: 4089.72

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  is, this is the 2020 problem. We are in a fog of war about everything. Even the president isn't  clear about the deadline. The executive order said 45 days, that would be the September 15th,  but then he's later said September 20th. So again, fog of war. And I don't know if that's  done intentionally or what, but it's, it is, it is an unsettling place to be in, especially for  engineers and, and, you know, computer folk for which everything is either a one or a zero.  We don't like, you know, one half. We don't like being in that gray zone. And if, if all of this

Start time: 4133.48
End time: 4207.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  goes into place, the way the government actually, like the way they hope it to, to go, which is  there's this company that's not allowed in the United States anymore. And a U S company has  to buy it if you want to still exist in this country. And give a cut to the treasury.  Yeah. Which is another fine mess. Yeah. Yeah. If this all goes through, then what this does is  it sets a precedent for the government to go around banning a bunch of companies that do not  exist in the U S or you have to sell to the U S if you want to, if you want this to exist anymore.  So yeah, there's, there's so much, there's so much going on here that, that it really is kind of  this, it's hard to digest all this information. I really do hope that there's going to be a  lawsuit. There's going to be a, you know, restraining order to like stop this from happening  until there's like real clear government guidelines about what is happening here so  that we're not opening up the doors to this kind of thing happening all the time in the future.

Transcript:  Well, and to your point, Laurie, to Ed's point, to your point, Leo too, you know, it, it, this  whole situation is just indicative of how laws are so slow to be adapted to technology. I mean,  you know, you've got an executive order that this is going to happen, but clearly TikTok  has threatened to sue. They probably would sue what law, what's the legal basis for actually  starting to say, to ban certain companies owned by, I mean, you're, you're getting into an area  that we really need Congress in the U S to step up to the plate and create some frameworks, laws  to help decide some of these issues as opposed to just abdicating the responsibility and letting

Start time: 4262.86
End time: 4342.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the executive branch and the courts work it out. But the, I completely agree, Bill, but part of the  problem is that there's no government right now. We don't have a robust government that  understands technology. So what we're talking about is potentially lawmakers making laws  about technology that they don't understand that could stifle creativity and growth in the  technology world. And so we, you know, regulations can be good, but when we have, we don't have  people in a, in authoritative places who know what to do or what this means. So we, I think it would  be really helpful if there could be some kind of third party, unbiased tech people, people who just  understand technology, who can get into the mouths or into the, into the, into the minds of the  lawmakers with real understanding of this information, because otherwise you're going to  have these confused lawmakers who say things like, well, Google maps can't exist anymore because  nobody's allowed to track people anymore. And that's like that you just can't, you know, you  can't do that, but they have to be able to understand what all this technology is so that  they can make really smart decisions about what should and shouldn't be regulated and how it

Start time: 4342.58

Transcript:  By the way, TikTok has filed a lawsuit August 24th in federal court. They did. Okay. Yeah.  And they're basically saying, you know, guys, first amendment. Right. You know, this is the  people who are participating in the American citizens who are participating in this have  first amendment rights and you can't just arbitrarily say that. So that is filed in  federal court for the central district of California, which, you know, so that I have  a feeling this is going to be that that lawsuit will probably come to a head this week. And,  you know, I don't think it's just going to be, you know, I don't think TikTok is just going to  roll over and say, Oh, well, I guess we just got to sell to somebody. So, you know, let's just put a,  put a sign out, you know, put a basket on the outside and see, see who puts, you know, enough  $5 bills in the, in the basket for this. They're, you know, they, they've got money, they've got  lawyers and frankly, they have a pretty good first amendment case. As I remember, I think it was Lucy

This is the  announcement for the iPad. This is going to be a brand new product category. Very exciting.  And I had an invitation, went in with my laptop. I'm looking behind me. There was at no point,  was there a sign or anything that said, you know, no recording or anything. Behind me, there's the  traditional row of cameras from every network in Bloomberg and everybody, you know, there's spin,  there, guys got this hat on, he's spinning the crank and doing the whole thing, taking the pictures.  So I thought, well, you know, we're doing a live feed. Why don't I just take my laptop, turn it  around and, and feed some video out. Now, nobody stopped me. Nobody said anything. I, it may be  just me. I think Steve saw me and gave me the, you know, evil eye, but maybe not. Anyway, you see it  on the video. I'm kind of looking goofy with my laptop turned around. It could have something to  do with that. Could have nothing to do with that, but I never again got another invitation to an  Apple event. So I was real excited. I went, you know, I, there it is in my Twitter, not only invited  to an Apple event, invited to the Apple briefing before the event. You got one of those too, huh?  I did. Cause then I noticed it was very confusing. Yeah. At the point where you're supposed to click  the link for your appointment. The only link available is 10 AM on Tuesday.

And I thought, oh, but then I, then I,  what I did is I emailed Renee and I said, Renee is, is it just me or does somebody, I should email  you too, Lori. So we apparently a lot of people got this. It was a mistake in the mailing thing.  Cause everybody got the same appointment, which is the live stream. Anyway, I'm invited to watch  the live stream with all of you. And that's exactly what we'll do. 10 AM we'll be, I'll be here with  Micah Sargent. We'll, we'll be doing iOS today. We'll immediately switch over to the live event  after iOS today, cover that.

So I wouldn't be able to go anyway.  As long as you go, Renee goes, somebody, you know, people on our team go, I don't care if I get to  go. It's not, I, it's a fun joke. It's a running joke as far as I'm concerned. It doesn't, doesn't  bother me more the other. And as you know, and I know Ed knows this, I don't want to, I don't want,  I don't want to have relationships with any of these companies, especially with PR people.  I just much prefer to be on the outside. Like you, Ed, I bought my duo because, you know,  I don't want them calling up saying, well, where's your review? Did you like it? Why didn't you like  it? Here's what you got wrong in your review. I don't want that either. Our show today brought  to you by IT Pro TV. These guys are the pros when it comes to training. In fact, it's a great story.  Tim Broome, Don Puzzett, who were actually originally trainers in like a classroom situation  for people who wanted to get into IT, wanted to get the certifications. They came to an NAB panel  that I was on. A few other people were on. We were talking about live streaming. They said, wow,  what if we live streamed our classes and IT Pro TV was born. We've had a relationship with them  ever since because they built beautiful studios, kind of like the old tech TV studios, except  instead of a staircase, theirs has an elevator, which I think is really cool. And they do Monday  through Friday, nine to five live streams. They're constantly updating. In fact, now they have more  than 5,800 hours of on-demand IT training videos in every area of IT. So whether you're trying to  get into IT or you're already in it and you want to keep your skills up, IT Pro TV is the place to  go. Their instructors make learning entertaining. They're all experts in the field, but they're also  really good presenters. They also have a lot of nice features that make it easier for you. For  instance, you don't have to have a Windows server in your house. You can use their virtual labs,  try out the skills you've learned on any HTML5 browser on Mac, Linux, iOS, Windows. You can set  up a server, clients, configure networks. And the thing I love about this, and I do this all the  time, if you screw something up, you just close the tab. It's no harm, no foul. But it's a great  way to learn. You also can get ready for your IT certification test with practice exams. And that's  really important. They have practice exams covering Microsoft, CompTIA, EC Council. They do that great  certified ethical hacker cert, PMI, and many more. There are great webinars featuring hot topics in  the tech world. So it's not just the classes to get the cert. It's really being part of a community  that loves IT and is learning all the time. They do events. They have a great podcast. I don't know  if you've listened, but their podcast TechNATO, Don Puzzett does that one, features industry guests,  gives you IT news, and of course, the best training. Get your cert, your A plus cert, your CCNP,  all the CompTIA certs, because they're the official video training partner for CompTIA. They have 12  on-demand courses. Get that premium membership.

This is this to be the biggest case since they went after Microsoft in the late  90s. The Department of Justice under Attorney General William Barr has been pushing for this.  Some DOJ attorneys and some state's attorneys general wanted more time to develop the case.  They were concerned about rushing it because they felt like they'd have a stronger case over time.  The AG apparently, according to Bloomberg, said, nope, we're doing it now. I think the  journal also confirmed this. It's expected perhaps even this week they'll announce it,  along with as many as a dozen other state attorneys general, mostly from the Republican states,  led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. The states are holding off until they see the complaint  before they sign in. Part of the problem is it's not clear what the Justice Department will be  going after. It's an antitrust action, but is it about search? Is it about shopping?  It's hard to know. I would guess this week we will see a complaint filed  certainly before the election. I think that's the deadline. As you know, the White House says  Google is manipulating information to benefit the left, so that's one issue. There's also the issue  of Google just being dominant. What do you guys think? We were just talking about how  government moves too slowly to regulate tech, yet I think you could make a case. Ed, you covered  the 1998 DOJ versus Microsoft case, the one that went on for 10 years. Was that a success?

Transcript:  Well, and make your money elsewhere. But the idea, the idea of Netscape's business model was that we  were all going to be paying $40 to $70 for a browser.  Right. No. No.  Probably not sustainable. But back to the original question, was the- the lawsuit did force  Microsoft to stop doing some extremely anti-competitive things that they were doing.  But many of those had already had been part of an earlier anti-trust action in 1994 that were tied  to what they were doing with PC OEMs. They wouldn't- for example, you couldn't sell a PC-  Microsoft would charge you more for MS-DOS, because Windows didn't exist.  They would charge you more for MS-DOS if you- unless you sold all of your PCs with MS-DOS on them.  Right.  And so that was the anti-competitive behavior.  They were doing- they were doing things like keeping APIs private.  Right.  And using them to advantage their own software and disadvantage their competitors.  That was anti-competitive behavior. So, you know, some of Microsoft's behavior was mitigated  with the lawsuit. But a lot of that was- you know, a lot of the good things that happened out of that  were that Microsoft was so distracted by 10 years of lawsuit that competitors were able to  gather their forces and build new businesses in areas where Microsoft wasn't competing and  then became afraid to compete because they didn't want an extension of their anti-trust trial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, it's tough. You know, hindsight is always 20-20, I guess. You know, it'll be  interesting to see what Google does. You know, Ed, you were- Ed was just talking about, you know,  keeping APIs private to advantage its own services over a competitor's services. And it makes me  wonder if there's a similar- if something similar is going on with Google promoting its own answers  on search as opposed to a competitor's answers, right? You know, Google's argued that, you know,  it just wants to give customers the best answer possible. And it just so happens that, oh, hey,  I own the service that's providing you the answer that I can monetize. But that's okay,  as long as the customer benefits. And, oh, hey, you know, we're not supposed to use words like,  market share anymore in our communication, or, you know, we have lots of competitors in search. But,  you know, that's just not the case in reality. So, you know, I don't know. Again, to what Lori and  I were kind of talking about earlier, I think this is a prime example where you have legislation  that hasn't caught up with technology for exactly some of the reasons Lori mentioned. People making  the legislation don't understand technology. And the systems that we have in place to enact the  legislation are designed by, you know, are by design slower than the pace of innovation. So  we are in this weird catch-22 situation. All you had to do was watch some of the Congressional  hearings with all the various tech leaders and listen to the questions and how they were being  answered to realize that, you know, we are unfortunately sort of woefully behind  in the rules and laws that sort of govern technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are questions to be asked and demand answers of these large corporations that are possibly and  potentially going against rules and regulations in place to protect progress and growth in  companies. There might be anti-competitive behavior here, but somebody needs to be able  to ask the right questions or the companies are going to give the answer they want to hear.  Just like Bill was saying with the Congressional hearings, I think there was one question that was,  is Facebook tracking me? Well, the answer to that can easily be no, but it's because the person  didn't ask the right question to get the right answer because there's a lot going on there that  technology companies are like, they're kind of like keeping their secret sauce, you know, from  anybody knowing what it is. And they'll say, well, we don't want people to know our secrets because  they'll steal them from us. But at the same time, that secret sauce is where we're starting to see  them doing things they shouldn't be doing. So we need people in place, a new version of a  technology oversight committee where the people are not politicians and they have no political  or their political preferences aren't part of why they're on this board. They're just really good at  tech. So that when a lawmaker says, is Facebook tracking me? Then that body can say, you know,  the question you actually want to be asking, we get what you're saying, but there's actually a  deeper question here of how is Facebook able to provide this algorithm for a news story that  it's right up there. There's ways that that wording can be put into place so that  then the lawmakers can say, okay, now we know what these companies are doing more or less  without giving away their secret sauce. So what's okay? And what's not okay? Where are we like  jumping the line into that anti competitive behavior in this particular case? And where  should we say, okay, that's okay, but that's not okay. And it really does come down to Leo, you said  who then? And I think it's just going to be where like, as our lawmakers don't understand  technology, they shouldn't be making decisions. It wouldn't be the lawmakers because the law exists.

Transcript:  The antitrust laws are sufficient. That's what was used to prosecute Microsoft. They are sufficient.  It would be the Department of Justice bringing suit based on existing law. We're not talking

Start time: 5707.48
End time: 5803.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  about new laws having to be made. Let's tease that one out a little bit though. The antitrust laws  that we have now were written to regulate manufacturers of steel and distributors of  oil and gasoline, where the anti competitive behavior typically required huge investment  in actual physical resources from those companies to do that. It doesn't analogize to modern  technology where scaling up can happen with silicon and doesn't require roads and trucks  and bulldozers and stuff like that. The other part of that observation, to go back to the whole  Microsoft thing, imagine if Microsoft, you said it was a success. The reason it was a success was  because Microsoft was tied up in the courts. Let's say that a corrupt Department of Justice  decides to bring an antitrust case against Google and tie them up in the courts for years.  They could affect the same change in Google's behavior. They could affect the same change in  the market, even though there's no underlying behavior that needs to be modified. The reality  is what changed Microsoft's behavior in the late 1990s and early 2000s was the fact of the antitrust

Transcript:  stronger than the execution. Yeah, but if corruption, and remember, you had a federal judge  this week, Judge Gleason in Washington, D.C., who issued, and he was a retired judge who was  hired as a special master in the case involving Michael Flynn, who filed a 30-page brief basically  saying that the Department of Justice is engaging in corrupt activity that is shocking.  And everything that you did to introduce this segment said that the career lawyers in the  antitrust division of the Department of Justice don't want to bring this lawsuit yet. I know  lawyers like this. Some of them say, we might never bring a lawsuit. We might spend two years on this  and decide at the end of it there's nothing there. But if the Attorney General comes in and he says,  I don't care what you career prosecutors think, I want this lawsuit filed and I want it filed well  before November 3rd, that is a problem. Yeah. Okay. You guys are really, basically,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  we should just let tech do whatever it wants. There's no curb that's reasonable.  Or I mean, what are we? That's not acceptable either, is it?  So what do we do?

Start time: 5913.58
End time: 6020.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, we're at this point too, where I think that you're going to get these questions more and  more often than maybe we even had in the past. I mean, look at the Fortnite  and the Epic Games and Apple. Right? So is Apple being anti-competitive by taking the  30% share of a platform they developed? It's their platform. They're the gatekeepers. Is  Google anti-competitive because it's showing Google services? They have a good platform for  search. I mean, so I think that unfortunately, as we were talking about earlier with the business  model in terms of Netscape versus IE, even consumers, because I think the natural tendency  is to say, well, let the consumer be the judge. Let us spend their money. But unfortunately,  I'm sad to say that history, and maybe this makes me not as much of a capitalist as some people  would say, history has kind of proven that consumers sometimes make the wrong decisions,  either because they don't have all the information or they gravitate to a short-term gain or they  make decisions that aren't maybe in their long-term best interests. So I think that there has to be  some consensus around the guardrails that we put on large organizations, multinational companies,  and how we do those guardrails, the only mechanism for that is our government. So unfortunately,  what's the old saying? We get the government we deserve, not the one we want. So it's on us to  vote in people that hopefully understand these issues and that won't allow corrupt behavior

Transcript:  to perpetrate itself. And I want to be clear in this that while it's tempting and certainly  given my political bent and yours to blame Trump on this, that it actually goes much deeper than  that. And it really comes down to the influence of big money in politics in this country. And it  is so pervasive and so pernicious that it's hard to think that a company like Google or Microsoft  or Apple will ever face the music because they really own the coin of the realm. They have the  most valuable companies in the country. If the stock market goes up, it's because they went up.  And that carries a lot of weight. And not to mention all the black bags filled with cash  that they dump off on legislators tables. So here's the story. 15 minutes ago, it broke.  Microsoft says its bid for TikTok was rejected by China. They announced, according to Microsoft  officials and other people involved in negotiations, the Chinese company TikTok rejected Microsoft's  offer. Boom. So Oracle is the last man standing. I should point to a New York Times article from  a few days ago. TikTok bid highlights Oracle's public embrace of Trump. So I think the stars  are lining up for Larry Ellison's Oracle to own TikTok. What they would do with it or whether  they would be good stewards of it is not an issue, obviously, for anybody except maybe the

We have a billion here, a billion there. It starts to add up. I know either way. Yeah.  Real money. Real money. I'll take a break and talk more. There is,  I love it when news breaks during the show, usually a Sunday afternoon evening,  nothing's happening, but we're going to have to follow the wires.  The ticker is hot. It's burning up with all the deets and we'll have them for you as it  happens. Our show today brought to you by World Wide Technology. The last, I'll always have a soft  spot in my heart for WWT because it was the last trip I took. And we flew out to St. Louis, Lisa  and I to meet the folks at World Wide Technology. I am so glad I did. We came back on skates. We had  a meetup at a bar with all the fans. I gave people hugs. I, you know, in hindsight, maybe it was a  mistake, but boy, I'm glad we did because WWT is a sight to behold. They have, well, for instance,  we visited the Advanced Technology Center, the ATC, which they started at more than a decade ago.  It was in one building. It has grown now. I think it's in four or five buildings,  rack after rack of enterprise technology, half a billion dollars in equipment from all the big OEMs  and from the little disruptors too. Key partners like NetApp and Cisco,  the emerging disruptors like Equinix, they're all there. And why? Well, not just because it makes a  really cool rack, in which it does, but because that's where WWT's engineers go to spin up proofs  of concept, to create pilot programs. They use it as a sandbox so they can understand the technology  and show their customers. That's why people who work with WWT stay with WWT. They are a trusted  partner for so many big enterprises, for government, for banks, for hospitals, because  they know they can go to WWT to get the answers they need to make sure their business runs right,  to eliminate the risk that big technology purchases can be. And a lot of it comes down to the  Advanced Technology Center. On-demand and schedulable labs, by the way, you can use it too,  as a customer. It's open 24-7 remotely. It's an incubator for IT innovation. On-demand and  schedulable labs like NetApp's Cloud Volumes on Tap, NetApp's Storage Grid, NetApp Disaster Recovery  as a Service. Hundreds of labs representing the newest advances in every area of enterprise.  Flash storage, multi-cloud, hyper-converged infrastructure, cloud data management, and more.  And these guys, one of the things I love about WWT is they have a kind of a corporate DNA that  they are always studying processes, always looking at ways to make processes better.  They are on top of it. State-of-the-art stuff so that you know you're getting consultants expertise  that isn't resting on their laurels but is constantly questing to find the best new  technologies and to make them work in your business. WWT's engineers are some of the best  It was so fun going there. A lot of them said, Leo, I listened to your shows. They were fans.  I said, you must love this job. They said, yeah, we got this is the best playground ever.  But it's more than just play because they can reduce a concept time to implementation from  months to weeks. They even go so far as, because I was looking at the cameras on all their  distribution centers and I see a guy there. He's building a crane. I said, what's that? He said,  every distribution center has a full-time on-staff carpenter because we don't just ship you the  pieces and say you put it together. They build it. They integrate it. They test it. Everything's  working. Even disparate manufacturers. It's all working. So they have to build custom special  crates with special shock absorbers and so they can ship this as is ready to go.  Plug and play. It's that kind of attention to detail. It blows me away. I want you to check out  the Advanced Technology Center because you can do your own programmatic testing using any of those  half a billion dollars worth of gear from that ecosystem. 24-7. Anywhere in the world. You don't  have to go to St. Louis. It's a great place for you to learn. They launched this last summer and  it's been a huge success. More than just the labs, you get access to articles, case studies, all the  tools you need to keep track of what's going on in today's fast-paced world. I think WWT  is, it was an eye-opener for me. I think it's the best discovery you can make. If you're an enterprise,  you need a tech partner. This is the company.

Amazon says, hey, when we sold toilet paper for 36 bucks, that wasn't price gouging.  Public Citizen did a study. They found the price of face masks, hand sanitizer, even flour  on amazon.com was increased by hundreds of percent, not just by third-party sellers,  but Amazon itself. They published this report on Thursday. They found the price of some products  deemed essential. For instance, a package of 50 disposable face masks were sold for $4 before the  pandemic, for $40 after the pandemic. Eight roll packages of Scott toilet paper, normally $7.  Now $36.39. This is against the law in 36 states, by the way.

Transcript:  I have a friend who owns a comic book shop and he sells on Amazon and he has a bot that  automatically changes the price of his comic books based on the average or maybe it's the lowest  price one. So the prices of things will increase or decrease just on demand. It's not Amazon doing  that. So when Amazon says, we didn't sell toilet paper for $36, I think they're right. It's that  you had to pay $36 to buy a roll of toilet paper on Amazon, but that was the seller that was setting  the price of that, which is something that Amazon should have been in because they eventually started  telling sellers they couldn't do things like that. They started putting restrictions on what they  were doing, but it took a long time for them to put that kind of program in place. And meanwhile,  there was some serious price gouging going on.

A lot of them get sold on Amazon and it is one of the weirdest things in the world  to see a 12 year old computer book, a book that I wrote 12 years earlier, that is nobody in the  world is interested in anymore. This is like 2007, a Windows 95 book and seeing it on Amazon  being sold a used copy for $1,800 because the algorithm, and I've seen that and there were not  so I don't see it so much anymore because I think they've tweaked the algorithms so that that kind  of crap can happen. But I used to see that regularly and I talked to my publisher and talked  to the Amazon rep and said, what the hell is going on here? And it was indeed algorithm. It was two

Why anyone  would buy a book from 2002, 26.83. Oh, wait a minute. Here's some used ones for $2. So  my recommendation, go with the $2 used very good condition. That's a much better one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't that funny? Yeah, I saw that too. It just goes to show exactly what we've been talking about,  the whole show, which is even within Amazon's own platform, the technology has moved so quickly  that they don't have the circuit breakers in place to catch these kind of outliers,  these massive sort of price jumps or to catch market manipulation that could occur. Like you  were talking about, Ed, with two people just sort of trying to chase the price. Now, maybe they were  doing it legitimately. Maybe they were actually trying to inflate the price. So, you see these  circuit breakers in other kind of platforms. We have them in the stock markets. So if the price  falls, things can get shut off to give people to say, oh, is it the algorithm that's caused this  sort of this crash due to flash selling or is it something else? And so I think all of these  platforms are going to have to build that in to their algorithms. The other thing is, to  the point about Amazon not being the seller, if they were a traditional retailer, like if they were  a traditional big box store, they would be purchasing the products and then putting them  on the shelves and they would be the sort of the seller as opposed to for most a lot of these  products. They're just a pass through. They're just the site that you come through. They're  a broker. So it isn't even that they don't have the same incentives. They don't have the same  control mechanisms to say, well, it's not us selling the product. We're just someone that's

You know, Ed, Ed, you mentioned this earlier when you talked about  the pace of innovation and how Silicon allows companies to sort of set these platforms up so  quickly that, you know, you were talking about in relation to sort of the old days of oil and gas  and manufacturing companies, but you can wrap ramp something up so quickly like this with very little  investment. So there's no incentive to like, you don't have the limitations that you used to have,  like, Oh, I need a warehouse and I have to store everything as much. And I have to have these  retail locations and I have to, you know, there, there would prohibit me from putting a price of  $1,800 on something. Even if it's a mistake, right?

Misinformation in social media is  out of control because the algorithms have outstripped the ability of the humans who created  them to control them. Part of that is not understanding the, or not, not planning for the  consequences of what those algorithms could do. Not saying, you know, what if things went wrong  here? What if two, two sellers started chasing each other up the ladder here? Or what if people  started, you know, putting all this misinformation in private groups? But the point is it's easy to  write an algorithm. And apparently it's even easier for an algorithm to go completely out of control

Transcript:  with, with unforeseen consequences. Have any of you, this is a movie that just debuted on Netflix  a couple of days ago and is getting raves. I see it's in their top 10 right now called The Social  Dilemma, which explores, according to the blurb, the dangerous human impact of social networking  with tech experts sounding the alarm on their own creations. I meant to watch it before today.  I guess I'll have to watch it tonight, but people are raving about it, but at the same time, I'm kind  of worried it's another one of those bash big tech things. We're trying folks. Look, here's Mark  Zuckerberg saying he hopes Facebook won't destroy society. This is an Axios HBO interview that will  be published on Wednesday. He says, you know, if someone's pointing, let's see, he says,  he was asked if he was at all concerned that his to remember Facebook as an accelerant of social  destruction. He said, I have a little more confidence in democracy than that. And I hope my  confidence isn't misplaced. What we do, and I think a lot of what the internet does overall,  is give individuals more power. He says he will not remove anti-vaxxer posts even as the pandemic  rages across the world. He says, if someone's pointing out a case where a vaccine caused harm  or that they're worried about it, you know, that's a difficult thing to say from my perspective  that you shouldn't be allowed to express at all. So, you know, I think Mark hopes that things are  going to work out. Can't knock him for that. He seems like a nice young man.  You know, it's really clear, you know, this is a tough one. And we talk about this a lot on our  network because it's something we're grappling with. It's very clear there's benefits to social  media. The Twitter and Facebook have real value in a lot of ways. It's also clear that it's been  weaponized. Would QAnon have the potency it has without Facebook?

Transcript:  Yeah. And I think we're in this new world of what social media is. And it became, it started out as  a way for us to like say hi to our friends on the computer. And it turned away, it turned into a way  for us to share information. And that's where the danger has started to come in of that. We are in  our bubbles, and we believe our certain beliefs, and we have our friends who believe those same  things. That's the way our world works. And then we have these algorithms that are built around us  that show us information that confirms our bias. And then there's articles that are not vetted by  the same kind of journalistic integrity that existed, you know, prior to the computer.  So that information is being shared in my bubble with my friends. We all believe it,  and we all move on solidifying our beliefs, growing those beliefs, creating new groups  around those beliefs. All of that's a natural human tendency. It's just it works better with  social media. Because it allows larger groups of people to befriend each other and reinforce  of their beliefs. Yeah. Yeah. And you know, Leo, you're right. It's good. I learned a lot about  protests that were going on that I would not have known if it weren't for Twitter. So it's good.  But you can't be the arbiter of what's allowed to be good and what's allowed to be bad on a  social platform because then you are the one who is politically making voices heard and not heard.  Then you're Mark Zuckerberg. Yeah. Or not. Yeah. Yeah. I can see why he wants to

Start time: 7337.28
End time: 7453.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think that's, you know, that's the one area that I do slightly disagree with sort of the  blanket abrogation, as you call it, Leo, of responsibility that, you know, social media  platforms and anyone who's run, you know, forums and internet sites, you know, we've talked about  203 issues before. I mean, so but in the past, maybe there were more consequences that people  felt as a result of bad activities. But what we've seen now is a lot of these activities that have  negative outcomes, either unintended or not, the perpetrators face no consequences for those.  So and as Laurie was talking about, those bad views are amplified to many, many, many more people.  And, you know, they're, unfortunately, you know, you have people that just sort of live in these  echo chambers and never get outside their bubble, never hear other information. And it gets,  you know, you were talking about YouTube, being that self fulfilling prophecy, an idea gets popular,  and the popular idea gets promoted. And that's all you see. And it's really hard to break in with a  new idea. So it's not an easy, you know, it's not an easy question to answer. I think we're,  we're still trying to figure that out. But I wouldn't. But I wouldn't sort of, I do think that  there needs to be mechanisms in place to control some of the consequences that happen  when you have I mean, when you have blatant sort of disinformation, I mean,  there are checks on freedom of speech. You know, freedom of speech is not an absolute right, you  can't go into a theater and yell fire, you can't do hate speech. So we've accepted that there are  limitations. And I think it's always sort of up to society at any one time to determine what those

Start time: 7453.40
End time: 7464.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  limitations are. I but there is a burden, is there not a responsibility in the social networks  for Twitter and Facebook to do that? And that's admittedly hard to do, maybe not going to be

Start time: 7465.00
End time: 7515.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  perfect, but to try to do the right thing. And that's where I think, right now, a lot of the  issue comes into play is that Zuckerberg is a perfect example of somebody who says, I just  threw the party, I didn't make people fight each other at my party. So it's not my fault that they  fought each other at my party. And then, but then there's fights at my party every single time. And  I just keep letting it happen. And a couple of people got killed at my party, but I just threw  the party. It's not my fault they killed each other. Then you're like, Okay, well, when are  you going to take responsibility for the things that are happening at your party? You you threw  this party, and it's your responsibility to protect them. So what are you going to do about  it? Yes, it's not you what you didn't spread the misinformation, but you are the arbiter of that

Start time: 7516.06

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So here's the here's the problem. The the way that the business the way that social media services  are set up is they reward engagement, right? The algorithm? Yeah, we're back to the algorithm.  And, and the engagement is what brings them the economic benefit. So if your criteria  for success in battling misinformation is removing it from your platform after it's already there,  you have lost from the beginning because bad speech will always crowd out good speech,  because that's just the way it works. They have more incentive to do that. The fact is,  the systems have to be built in such a way that they don't allow misinformation to spread in the  first place. If you're constantly reacting, then then the lies are going to spread faster. But by  the time you start blocking things, they've already reached critical mass. It's like basically saying,  you know, we've got a nuclear reactor here. And I think we can pull the fuel rods out to about here,  but we're going to stop right there because you know, and and you know, once things get out of

Apple does this all the time. They've  waited up to a whole month after the other operating systems dropped. The public beta of  MacOS came really late in the game and I think they're going to make it wait a little bit longer  and probably till the new Mac silicon comes out unless for some reason the Mac silicon is not going  to be for way a long time. I think personally, I think we're going to see it in mid-October.

Yeah and I thought this is an opportunity to rethink everything I'm doing with my Mac setup.  For instance, I might shift from homebrew to Mac ports, things like that. This is the time that  you would think about that. Do I really need to install those 15 apps that I had never used for  five years? I might even write a blog post on the next build given Big Sur is coming out.  This might be the time to do it. Our show today, in order for that to happen, I need a good night's  sleep. I've just got to tell you, there's no incentive to write a blog post when you're  sleepy. Thank God I have a Casper. Casper is the original online retailer of premium mattresses  at a fraction of the cost because they eliminate the middleman. They use obsessive engineering  to design mattresses that are cleverly mimicking human curves. They give you both, it's kind of  amazing, flex and support. Look, you spend a third of your life on your mattress, maybe more in my  case, you ought to be comfortable. The original Casper combines multiple supportive memory foams  for a quality sleep service with just the right amount of both sink and bounce.  Really important with all the Casper mattresses, breathable design, you want to sleep cool,  Casper regulates your body temperature throughout the night with over 20,000 reviews and an average  of 4.8 stars across Casper, Amazon and Google. Casper is fast becoming the internet's favorite  mattress. Now this is the hybrid that I'm opening up here and falling asleep on. I think the cat will  join me in a minute. The hybrid combines the pressure relief of the award-winning foam,  original Casper mattress with durable yet gentle springs, which is nice because it gives me a firm  edge. I don't fall out of bed anymore. It gives me a little support as I'm hitting the edge.  There's the Wave, which features a patent-pending premium support system to mirror the shape of  your body. And the Essential, which is a streamlined design at a price that won't keep you up at night,  perfect for guest rooms or kids off going off to college. The thing I love about Casper is you not  only save money, but you have a hundred nights to try it. A hundred night risk-free sleep on it trial.  If anytime in the first hundred nights you say it's not for me, they'll come and get it and refund  you every penny. You don't not have to put it back in that box. It does come in a surprisingly  compact box, but I don't know how they do that. So fortunately I don't have to do it. Free shipping,  painless returns in the U.S. and Canada. Get a Casper mattress today. You're going to save  a hundred dollars towards select mattresses. Wow, look at that. Now it's 50,000 reviews.  50,000 five-star reviews. Wow.

Thank you Casper.  Let's, we should do some lighthearted fun stories. It's been such a serious show. Did you see,  actually I thought this was good. Sasha Segan does this every year in PC Magazine. Give them  a lot of credit because this is, this is the thing PC Magazine used to do so well. They would do a  hundred printers, right? They would do the roundup of all the latest laptops. Only a big publication.  And there is no magazine in PC Magazine, but only a big publication could go out and go to 26 cities  during a pandemic and test the mobile networks. But the thing that, you know, fastest mobile  networks 2020, they've done this every year, but the thing that was most interesting to me is,  yeah, 5G, not so much. Not so much.

Start time: 8125.80
End time: 8157.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not so much. There's this big push for companies, for phone makers to make phones with 5G,  but the 5G infrastructure is just not really quite there yet. And it's, it's surprising to me. So the  new iPhone, for example, that's coming out later this, you know, in the next couple of months,  there's going to be a lot of pushback from the public, the tech public, especially if those  phones don't support 5G. But what's the point of supporting 5G right now?

Start time: 8157.96
End time: 8239.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Exactly. That was one of the knocks on the duo is it doesn't have 5G. To me, that's great.  I don't care. I would not benefit from it. So here's the, here's the money paragraph here.  So wait, right, Sasha, 5G isn't as fast as 4G. We admit it. We bought into the 5G hype. Carriers,  phone makers and chip makers alike have all been selling 5G as faster and more powerful than 4G  with lower latency. So I was shocked, shocked, I tells you, to see that our AT&T 5G results,  especially, were slower than 4G on the same network. This is a crisis for marketing,  not for performance, because all three US carriers, yes, there's only three now,  showed significantly higher download speeds and better broadband reliability than they did last  year. It's just that these gains, especially in AT&T, are largely because of improvements in 4G,  not 5G. The good news is with few exceptions, you don't need to rush out and buy a 5G phone.  Now, when you get 5G, especially if you get millimeter wave, the high band 5G,  it can be really fast. They were able to test Verizon, probably in New York City,  Verizon has millimeter wave in certain areas, as fast as two gigabits down,  which is awesome, and 100 megabits up. But that's not what you're going to get most of the time.

Start time: 8240.18
End time: 8249.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you'll have to pay extra if you want the phone that has the millimeter wave.  And you'll have to stand in exactly the right spot.  Yeah, with no trees in your way.

Start time: 8250.34
End time: 8301.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, because at those higher frequencies, it doesn't travel very far and it bounces off anything,  off anything, including a heavy mist. So 4G is going to be around for some time.  5G availability, according to PC Magazine, was 4% of the US customers. Just not really that good.  That's in Verizon. T-Mobile, which is the low band 600 megahertz, half of T-Mobile's customers  can get it, but you won't notice the difference because it's not any faster. And in fact,  38% of AT&T customers can get it but don't want it because it's actually slower.  So it's really a mixed bag. Is it going to get better? Is this what it was like when LTE came out?  Bill, do you think it's going to get better?

Start time: 8302.24
End time: 8343.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it'll get better. I mean, I wish I could because the promise is there of a really  fast wireless connection that can rival what we get out of fiber or a wired connection.  So the benefits far outweigh the initial sort of starts and stops. Especially at Tech Republic,  we look a lot at enterprise and in the B2B space, there's a lot of interest around 5G.  And like you were talking about, high bandwidth, ultra low latency, you really need 5G to do some  of the things. But that's going to be a dedicated receiver and right across the way is the dedicated

Start time: 8350.82
End time: 8446.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  expensive. Well, you definitely need to build out an infrastructure like you were talking about,  especially if you're dealing with a millimeter wave compared to like Sub6. I mean, you've got  considerations for the density of the buildings around you about how you're going to be able to  propagate this out into a rural area because that's one of the areas that it could have a  lot of benefit for. So I don't think the hype around 5G is necessarily wrong, but I think it's  going to take a little longer to play out than people promoting it now may expect, right? So  for most people, they're probably not going to see benefits. I can't get it here. I would love to have  5G so that I could use that as a hotspot compared to the 400 megabit broadband that I can get. I  mean, if I could get two gigabits as opposed to 400 when you're sharing a connection between multiple  people in a house and I'm doing a video conference and trying to watch a Twitch stream and trying to  do, so it has its benefits, but I think it is going to take a little longer. Now I'm interested  to see the manufacturers. Samsung is putting 5G in all their flagship devices. So how long are  people going to keep these devices or what's the premium they're going to have for future proofing?  Are consumers going to want to pony up an extra couple hundred bucks to say, oh, I'm going to  keep this device for three or four years, two or three years. And so yeah, I'll go ahead and get it.  I'm glad it has 5G in it so that when it does get here, I don't have to buy a new $1,400 phone.

And I just got an email a couple of weeks ago  from T-Mobile saying, you know, congratulations, Santa Fe has 5G now. Well, you know, I-  Except for you, Sprint customers.  I've driven, no, they said for us, Sprint customers too. Same network.

Transcript:  They said that I should be able to do it. So I drove all over town holding my phone up. Well,  I was in the car. Yeah, that's okay. Your wife was driving. Yes, of course. Holding the phone up and  never saw that 5G logo. I think the thing is, I mean, I think the real key here is going to be  backwards compatibility because these networks are going to be a mix of 4G and 5G for years.  And so just as the PCMag guys discovered, your phone is going to be set up to connect to whichever  network is best. Right. And for a long, long, long time, that's going to be 4G. What's going  to happen though is what's happened over the last 10 years, which is my broadband, my mobile  speeds have gotten steadily, not, not dramatic, not, not blind. There's no big step leap at any  given time, but each year it's a little bit faster than it was last year. And that's just because of  the, the, the, the infrastructure just slowly being all the old stuff being replaced with new stuff.  And as it, you know, as it just, just rolls out and gets bigger and bigger. But, you know, the idea  that, that one day you're going to get that 5G phone and man, you're going to be walking around  and you're going to say, you know, I want to watch that movie and I want to download it in seven  seconds. You know, that, you know, I think it's going to be a, maybe never before we see that

I will never forget going into the T-Mobile store when they were  still selling the late lamented one plus McLaren 5G phone and asking, I said, Oh, this is great.  Is 5G here in Petaluma? No. Oh, well, could I get 5G in San Francisco? No. I said, well, where can  I get 5G? He said, Ukiah, which as you know, because you live in Northern California,  Lori Gill is the middle of nowhere. It's like the high desert. But I guess I could get 5G there.

Transcript:  in my opinion, 5G is going to come. It's not going to be a 3D TV thing. And it's because the demand,  we demand more download speeds as users and as consumers. Gaming is becoming a streaming thing.  We're downloading more things onto our devices. We're downloading things to our home entertainment  systems. The demand is there. So 5G will come. And just like Ed was saying, we're going to have  this sort of like in between phase where there's going to be your phone is going to connect to  whatever the best spot is for a while. But just like it was with 3G to 4G and 4G to LTE,  at first, you're always going to be on the lower band. And then at some point, it's just going to  flip. The switch is going to be flipped and you won't have even noticed that it flipped. You're  just now using the higher speeds and you maybe won't even notice that you got a slightly faster  download of a movie or something. It's just there. But it's happening. It's just that the hype  makes it seem like it's a really big deal. And frankly, it's really just something they should  have been doing in the background to just tinker with the world to make the internet speeds faster  on mobile. And then we just don't notice it and suddenly have faster phones.

Transcript:  The secret's behind it. I just spent a lot of money to eliminate Wi-Fi in my house  and put ethernet everywhere. I had a guy in the attic in the basement crawling around,  running it up through the walls. And we still have Wi-Fi. But he said, you know,  you can get faster internet. I said, what do you mean? I got the top of the, I got a business  class Comcast. He said, oh, don't get business class. You can get a gigabit on the consumer.  I said, when did that happen? And he was right. In fact, it cost me 50 bucks less.  But I had to sign up for a triple play bundle. Apparently I've had phone service from Comcast  for years. I didn't even know it. Because it's cheaper. As soon as you take off the phone,  what the hell is it? I don't understand this. I don't get it. I don't understand it. Well,  I do understand it because it's for a one or two year term. And then all of a sudden you're not  paying attention. When you turn your back, they double your bill. Suddenly it goes.

Transcript:  Just this is how nuts it is. But I had the same phenomenon. And I went from  the double play, the Comcast double play to the triple play to bring my bill down by 50 bucks.  And then the following year when my contract expired, I went from the triple play to the  double play to bring my bill down by 50 bucks. You just switch back and forth every year.

It's happening. 37% according to Kagan, which is a part of S&P  global market intelligence, 37% of broadband households in the US are now cord cutters.  They get only internet. That's up from 12.5% five years ago. And I guess it's going to get  higher and higher. In fact, I figured, okay, I'll do this one year deal. I'll keep the TV  because I don't want upset in the house. But next year, I swear to God, I'm going to get everything,  but it's just going to be all over the top. Right? That's the future of television is over the  internet, not over the cable or through the air even. I would say 37%.

So the bands will come there and perform and then it'll be part of Fortnite. I've only played  Fortnite, the version where you're killing people, but apparently Fortnite has a virtual stage and  Diplo has performed there, Steve Ioki, Deadmau5. It's popular. The Tenet trailer was aired there.  Epic's 1980 Fortnite commercial was aired there. They even had a discussion about race in America.  Millions of people literally have been in the virtual Fortnite theater.  So they're building a state of the art studio space in LA with a massive LED wall and floor and  Robocams that can be operated remotely.

John, who is a fan of a jam band called Umphreys McGee, I'm sure you all know it,  has been now to two virtual concerts. They had drive-ins and people would come in their car and  you're supposed to dance around in your car and then they're on the stage where the screen would  be. They do it in parking lots and drive-ins and stuff. And then you watched it via stream, right?  So I don't know. Maybe that's the future. I don't know. The future is weird.  We know that.

Thank you, Bill. Thank you, Lori.  Have a great night. We do tweet every Sunday afternoon right after the tech guy show. That's  about two 30 Pacific time, five 30 Eastern 2130 UTC. If you want to watch us do it live,  it's kind of the behind the scenes video, including all the chit chat before and after,  just go to a twit.tv slash live twit.tv slash live. That's a live audio and video streams actually  from a variety of sources there. And I should mention that we do this every year ever since  Apple took us down on YouTube. We do not do our live stream coverage of Apple events on YouTube  live. We do everything we do is on YouTube live except for that because Apple is, you know,  grouchy about that. So the best way if you want to follow our live event coverage, Tuesday, 10 AM  Pacific, 1 PM Eastern is just to go to twit.tv slash live and you'll find all the various streams.  We just put reruns up on YouTube live during that time. If you're not watching live, of course,  that's the easiest thing to do for anything we do. You can, you can catch everything we do on demand.  That's kind of what it is. It's a podcast. Go to the website, twit.tv or go to YouTube. There's a  YouTube channel for this week in tech. You can also ask your Amazon echo or your Google assistant  to play either play twit live. Sometimes you'd have to say like on tune in there's various,  it changes all the time or play. I found that if you say play the latest this week in tech podcast,  that works pretty well. You can listen to the latest episode. If you are an Amazon Echo user,  don't forget we have a flash briefing item. So I don't know if you use your flash briefing on echo.  I use it every morning. I get up and say, what's the news? And it will give me my flash briefing.  You have a variety of news sources. Twit is one of them. So we always make little clips for the  flash briefing for every day of the week. So make sure if you are a flash briefing user, I think  there's about 40,000 people listen to us every week on echoes flash briefing. If you are and  twit, so you'll get a little clip from each of our shows in your flash briefing, no machine reading.  It's a real, it's a real audio clip. You can also, and I think this is a great thing to do.  I like it when you do it, find your favorite podcast application and subscribe. We have links  to the RSS feed, to YouTube, to Apple, to Google, all the places you can subscribe to watch us  on our website, twit.tv slash subscribe. Subscribing is the best thing to do because  then you get it the minute it's available. You don't have to think about it anymore.  That's it for this week. Have a wonderful evening and I will see you next time. Another twit.
