Start time: 279.20
End time: 335.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I realized if you divide it up properly, A, B, U, Abu El-Samid.  Yes.  So I suddenly realized, oh, I can pronounce that.  When people look at it, they go, I can't.  Just break it up into three syllables.  Yeah, syllables.  It's all about the syllables.  Yeah.  So breaking news.  This morning, Donald Trump, this is not political, folks, tweeted,  President Xi of China and I are working together to give massive Chinese phone company ZTE  a way to get back into business fast.  Too many jobs in China lost.  Make China great.  Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done.  If you don't know the backstory on this, the United States Commerce Department was the one  that practically put ZTE out of business saying American companies can no longer buy or sell  ZTE products.  In fact, it looks like ZTE or it looked like ZTE might go out of business.  I like ZTE.  The axon's great.  Apparently they...

Start time: 335.94
End time: 339.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And maybe Google can't supply Android to ZTE.  Exactly.

Start time: 341.14
End time: 356.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, the president Xi probably told them that  unless you back off on ZTE, then you won't get any more iPhones shipped out of China.  Could be.  Can you imagine the uproar if suddenly iPhones stopped arriving from China?  Yeah.

Start time: 357.78

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 387.34
End time: 395.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To be fair, I test a lot of IoT and I need my apps to be stable.  No, that's completely fair.  I think that's completely reasonable.  But I do need to get on the Android P train.

Start time: 395.98
End time: 401.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  We should mention the P train.  This is why they've got to quickly get a dessert associated with this.  I agree.

Start time: 401.70
End time: 403.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You definitely don't want to leave that one hanging out there.

Start time: 403.66
End time: 411.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Definitely need to name it Google.  You got to stop saying Android P.  Let's say Android Pie.  Pie.  Just we'll put that in the ether.  Maybe they'll actually go with it.

Start time: 413.60
End time: 418.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  For the next year, you guys on All About Android  would be able to taste a different kind of pie every week.

End time: 423.04

End time: 425.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_13

Transcript:  Holy cow.  I get sick of it just listening to some of those bizarre flavors.

Start time: 429.26
End time: 439.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Every Wednesday morning I come in and there's a half-eaten bag of like  dog biscuit flavored Oreos or peppermint schnapps Oreos.  I wish.

Start time: 445.45
End time: 454.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  There was the one last week, wasn't it?  Yeah.  There was a chocolate hazelnut that was really good.  Okay.  Nutella-ish like.  There was one we ate that was expired two years past expired.

Start time: 454.70
End time: 458.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Start time: 458.36
End time: 459.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't even remember.

Start time: 459.56
End time: 463.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's it. The cupcakes.

Start time: 467.38
End time: 470.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was a two-year-old one.  Was it? It was two years old.  Yeah, but it was still good.

Start time: 470.96
End time: 474.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_13

Start time: 474.72
End time: 476.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that an Oreo or is it a Blizzard?

Start time: 476.78
End time: 482.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It's an Oreo.  It's a limited edition Oreo which was put out eight years ago.  If you still had it, it'd be stale.

Start time: 482.54
End time: 487.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm sure there's probably still a couple of packages on eBay that Jason.  The Dulce de Leche Oreo was good. I had that.

Start time: 488.52
End time: 502.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  That was great. Birthday cake, candy cane, candy corn.  Those were disgusting.  The candy corn Oreos, those were awful.  Berry, Lemon Twist, Neapolitan.  Good Lord.  Banana Split.  Oh, when are you having the SpongeBob Oreos in?

Start time: 503.62
End time: 505.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, 2014. I don't know if I want to eat those right now.

Start time: 507.38
End time: 522.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  So to get back to the news, the reason ZTE was in trouble is because the commerce department said  ZTE is using its hardware to spy on America.  Also, they violated the sanctions against North Iran and North Korea.

Start time: 522.90
End time: 537.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then I think they were supposed to, the people who actually made those decisions were  supposed to get in trouble or be penalized and ZTE did not penalize them.  This is just so crazy that just, I think he got a phone call from President Xi.

Start time: 541.04
End time: 562.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I think that that's what he did, in fact.  He did, in fact.  And then the president tweets and everything.  He's like a guy sitting in a chess game and just throws the table in the air and then says,  now let's try playing.  It's crazy.  Well, but I like ZTE phones, but I don't know if I should buy a ZTE phone.

Start time: 562.48
End time: 580.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, ZTE is going to be in trouble after this anyway,  because we've got other Chinese brands that are coming up the wayside.  They don't have these problems, aka A1 plus one.  Xiaomi might eventually start selling.  Or yeah, who knows?  Xiaomi, Huawei.  They want to sell smart home stuff here now.  One plus.  So, yeah.  One plus.

Start time: 581.14
End time: 585.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They're already supplying all the scooter companies with scooters.  That's right.

Start time: 585.76
End time: 603.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I thought it was really interesting when Google I.O. this week announced that they were going to  make Android P available as a public beta.  It wasn't just to Pixel phones.  It included, by the way, Oppo phones or one, is that one, is that one plus?  No.  The one plus.  Same, same.  Manufacturing line, yeah.  Oppo is the Chinese.  Phone company.

Start time: 604.78
End time: 609.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  95% of Android phones, except the 5% that were missing were Samsung phones.

Start time: 609.50
End time: 615.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  No Samsung.  Yep.  Very peculiar.  You noticed that, did you?  As did I.  And was that a technical decision?

Start time: 615.74
End time: 634.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Samsung right now, the S9 is not using Treble.  It hasn't been Trebolized.  You think Treble is the issue?  Apparently, the reason why they're able to do what they're able to do is because of  all the phones that are compatible with the P beta have been Trebolized.  So they've separated the low end.  Maybe I should have Flo explain.

Start time: 634.84
End time: 641.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  What Trebol is?  What is Project Trebol?  Or do you want to do it, Sam?  Flo does not want to do it, I can tell.

Start time: 643.12
End time: 644.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you'll have a better time explaining.

Start time: 645.72
End time: 678.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  With Project Trebol, which was part of Android N, they, or oh sorry, was it O or N?  Anyway, they separated the low level kernel stuff, the operating stuff, the high end,  the surface level interface components.  Now you can swap out that low level components without touching the high ends, the surface stuff.  That's why they're able to insert the Android P operating system components  without touching the interface components.

Start time: 678.60
End time: 693.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We actually had this chat with Google earlier this week when we sat down with them for All  About Android and Stephanie said, she mentioned that Project Trebol is the reason that 95% of  the Android phones were able to get Android P like that.  So the 5% that's missing is Samsung, which speaks volumes.

Start time: 694.38
End time: 696.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Because they didn't do that separation when they implemented Android P or Android L.

Start time: 697.94
End time: 702.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it speaks volumes too of what, I mean, I'm thinking it's a reason.

Start time: 703.10
End time: 715.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Also, huge news because Google says now that they think some vast percentage of Android phones,  they're going to be able to require the security updates too.  So from now on, that'll be part of the deal.

Start time: 715.18
End time: 720.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They've updated the licensing agreement to require them to push out the monthly security patches.

Start time: 721.90
End time: 752.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  This is all very, very good news.  Very good.  This has been a real problem.  I mean, one of the advantages iPhone has, one of the reasons security experts  stick with iPhone, I even talked to somebody who said I wouldn't go to  DEF CON without an iPhone.  I would never bring an Android phone to DEF CON because it's too dangerous.  Take a Nokia 3310.  That's safe.  It's because Apple mandates the updates and is very quick to update.  And most Apple users update immediately.  But Android, there's probably three quarters of the Android user base doesn't have updatable phones.

Start time: 753.24
End time: 759.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's amazing a decade into Android that they're still trying to figure out some of the stuff.  Well, even though it is hard.

Start time: 760.65
End time: 764.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It's funny.  It's kind of a double-edged sword.  I think it's because Android was open source.

Start time: 764.24
End time: 766.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep.  I mean, the openness makes it a lot more challenging.

Start time: 766.92
End time: 777.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Which is good, right?  We want it to be open.  But at the same time, that means anybody, any Joe can put an Android device  and they don't have to do updates.

Start time: 777.08
End time: 796.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I'm still not clear on to what degree you can legitimately blame carriers or handset makers.  I think it's all of the above.  It's all of the above.  It's all of the above.  It's a little bit, it comes with the territory, but also it may be due to intransigence,  transigence or slowness on the part of the third party companies.

Start time: 796.48
End time: 802.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  And when you sell a phone for 30 bucks or 50 bucks, you don't want to be updating it.  It's a disposable product.

Start time: 802.98
End time: 805.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Especially if you're not getting recurring revenues from that device.

Start time: 806.28
End time: 810.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  So a lot of those devices were just really disposable that were sold, especially in the...

Start time: 811.00
End time: 813.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do the higher end phones have a better record of getting updates?

Start time: 814.32
End time: 815.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  Not all of them, though.

Start time: 815.90
End time: 824.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But not all of them.  Like Samsung tends to be slow.  They tend to be slow on the operating system updates.  They're pretty good on the monthly security updates.

Start time: 825.66
End time: 833.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Depends on the carrier, right?  It has not been good about pushing those security updates on the Galaxy phones, unfortunately.  Or at least in my experience.

Start time: 833.38

John, could you give me a wired mouse?  Yeah, thank you.  Because I can't do anything on this beautiful computer.  I'm just going to type it in.  That is a beautiful screen.  Well, oh, and the keyboard's died too, so it must have something to do with Bluetooth stuff.  Thank you.  We're going to give a wired mouse in here.  Yeah, now I can't even touch the screen.

Transcript:  He took me for a ride in the new Cadillac CT6.  And the reason we were trying it out, in fact, you'll see this on the new screensavers on  Saturday, is it has kind of similar to the Tesla autopilot, it has level two autonomy.  What is that level two?

Start time: 938.38
End time: 988.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Level two means it's partially automated, so it can do speed control and directional control  combined.  So in this case, in the case of the Super Cruise, it has adaptive cruise control,  so it'll maintain your distance to the vehicle in front of you, maintain your speed,  and it'll also stay in the center of the lane.  So as you're driving down the road, it comes to a curve, it automatically steers for you.  So the Cadillac is the first vehicle, production vehicle, that is actually designed for hands-off.  So the Tesla, you're actually supposed to keep your hands on the wheel.  You can take it off for a few seconds at a time and it'll start alerting you.  The Cadillac is actually designed to be hands-off because it has a driver monitor camera.  It works very much like Face ID on the iPhone X.  So there's infrared emitters and an infrared camera on the steering column,  and it makes sure that you're watching the road.  And if you stop watching the road, tell them what happens, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  And by the way, it was hard to stop watching the road.  I looked over to Sam, but I every once in a while had to get, I'm at the highway speed,  65 miles an hour.  There's other, it's like, I have to look at the road.  Finally, I put my fingers in front of my eyes and I peeked.  But that was enough to trick the camera into thinking I wasn't looking.  And then the bar goes red.  Your seat goes, wake up.  It was quite a thing.  I was very impressed by it.  It did a good job, actually.  And one of the problems I've always had with the Tesla, you told me this, I didn't know this.  All the cars that have these, your hands are on the wheel sensors.  I just assumed it was some sort of capacitive sensor that can tell you're touching it.  It's not.  It's that you have to actually move the wheel a little bit.  It has a torque sensor, Sam told me.  So that's why when I'm driving on the Tesla, it doesn't know my hands on the wheel.  That's like, I kind of jerked the wheel.  Well, a lot of good that is.  So this, I like this Cadillac.

Transcript:  There was another Tesla accident we should probably mention again.  And the question that is I think still unknown is whether the driver was using autopilot,  but the car rammed into a fire truck.  Fire truck.

Start time: 1136.17

Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Start time: 1139.62
End time: 1153.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  The fire truck was stopped.  It was going at 60 miles an hour.  Apparently no braking before impact.  Not known if autopilot was engaged.  The driver was injured, but is alive.

Start time: 1153.96
End time: 1262.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, the thing is, even if cruise, even if just the adaptive cruise control was active  and not the full autopilot.  It should stop.  No, it won't because the radar sensor for the cruise control is designed to,  especially at higher speeds when you're at highway speeds,  is designed to ignore stationary objects.  The great thing about radar is it lets you determine,  it lets you measure the distance to objects and the speed of those objects.  So if the car's not moving, it ignores it that you're going to run into?  Well, it ignores anything that has zero velocity.  So because, well, think about it.  If you're driving down the road, that sign on the side of the road has zero velocity.  You don't want it constantly slamming on the brakes.  So at highway speeds, when you're on the, you know, when you're at that speed,  the presumption is that, that, you know, especially if you're going at that speed,  that everything else around you should also be moving.  Everything of interest should also be moving.  So it starts to ignore the static objects,  like, you know, things that would be on the side of the road  or in this case a fire truck.  So clearly in this case, the person was driving too fast.  They had cruise control on it too high a speed  in a place where, you know, they shouldn't have been.  It doesn't look like they're on the highway.  And, you know, the same thing I've had, you know,  I drive a lot of different cars and I, you know,  I try out all the driver assist systems,  but, you know, as an engineer by training, you know,  I spent a lot of years working on these kinds of systems  and you, you know, I know what to look for.  I know what I'm looking for.  And so whenever I'm trying these things out,  my foot is always hovering over the brake pedal.  I'm always ready because I want to see.  Me too.  So I try these things out to see what they'll do.  And most vehicles will do the same thing if you're using adaptive cruise control.  If you're coming up to an intersection and there's car stop there,  once the rate, once it gets within range of the radar,  if those vehicles aren't moving, it'll ignore them.  And if, you know, if you don't hit the brakes, it'll keep on going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, the thing you have to keep in mind is how many miles we actually drive every year.  Just in the United States alone, the last couple of years, we drive 3.2 trillion miles a year.  And we had six in 2015, we had three point, almost 3.2 trillion miles  and 6.3 million accidents.  So that's one accident every half a million miles of driving.  That's not too bad.  Yeah.  I mean, when you, when you put it in that context,  37,000 people died, but we've got 270 million vehicles on the road driving three million,  three trillion miles.  The chances of actually getting into an accident at all, or worse,  dying in an accident are actually remarkably slim.  Still, we would like to make that number smaller.  And we have, we've made tremendous progress over the last 40 years.  Since 1975, it was the number of people that died for every 100 million miles of driving  was about five and a half, five and a half people for every 100 million miles.  Now it's 1.1 person fatality for every hundred million miles.  So we've cut it by 80% in the last 40 years.  That's great.  And that's-

Transcript:  Isn't that telling.  We're going to take a break.  When we come back, there were two big developer conferences this week.  We mentioned a little bit about Google's, but also Microsoft Build will talk about  the things we found out.  Not so much for Microsoft, a lot from Google, the controversies they raised.  Great panel here.  Sam, it's so nice to have you talking about cars  for a senior analyst of Navigant Research, Sam Abu El-Samid,  from the fabulous All About Android show, Florence Ion.  Don't forget material.  And material.  I don't like to plug material.  I don't know why.  And these are on there too.  I know.  Two of our hosts do a podcast for another network.  It's an underground.  It's an underground podcast.  I'm a generous guy.  It's on relay.fm.  And I love Mike Early and it's fine with me.  I'm just being silly.  Thank you for being here, Florence.  And of course, from Fast Company, the technologizer himself, Harry McCracken.  Our show today brought to you by Ring Video Doorbell.  I love the Ring.  They just put out a new app that takes the neighbor's stuff out of Ring  and puts it in a separate app so that you can keep an eye on neighbors and neighbors' houses.  The Ring Doorbell, we got one a couple of years ago now.  And it's the best thing I ever did.  It was easy to install.  It replaced the doorbell on my house on the front door.  Now when somebody comes to the door, I can see them ringing.  When we were in Japan, somebody drove over our mailbox.  We have a rural mailbox and somebody clobbered it.  But I had video, not only of that, but of the person coming to the door to apologize.  So that was awesome.  And if I needed to, I could have gone to the police as well with that video.  In fact, that happens all the time with the Ring Video Doorbell.  It is a way not only of keeping an eye on your property,  of keeping an eye on packages of speaking and hearing  with people who are at your front door, whether they ring the doorbell or not.  When the UPS guy comes, I say, hey, leave it right there.  I'll be right out.  It's awesome.  But it also becomes a great security device for keeping an eye on people and intruders.  In fact, when they see the Ring Video Doorbell, they often turn tail and go the other way.  Now we can add even more security to the home with Ring's floodlight and spotlight cam.  They let you build a ring of security around your entire property.  The same camera, microphone, speaker, and they've added a siren and lights, motion sensitive lights.  So when somebody is around the side, it lights up.  You can see them.  You get a notification on your phone.  Even if you're in Japan or anywhere in the world and you can speak to them,  and if they don't run away, you can even play a very loud, I guess 110 dB siren and scare them off.  We've got a great deal on the ring of security kits,  which combine a Ring Video Doorbell and one, two, or three of the Ring security cams.  Just go to ring.com slash twit, ring.com slash twit, and you'll get up to $150 off.  Pick your ring of security kit and save right now at ring.com slash twit.  I like to look at the Ring Twitter feed because there's always fun stuff  because they post videos of things happening.  Let me see.  There's one, there was one of a guy about to, about to steal something off the front porch,  and then they see the Ring camera and they literally, they turn around  ring.com slash twit.  Leo Laporte.  We're talking the tech news.  Microsoft's build three hour 45 minute keynote.  Wow.  No bathroom breaks, right?  No, they did.  They had an exercise break.  Yeah, they did.  So long they had somebody come on stage and tell people to stretch.  Here's a tip.  That's crazy.  Here's a tip to CEOs out there.  If your keynote is so long, you need to have an exercise guru give people a break.  You maybe want to cut it a little bit.  Just a little bit.  A little bit of editing.  Did you see anything that you thought was exciting, Harry?

Understands the syntax of every command.  And then you just let it deal with it.  I mean, surely somebody could do that.  Maybe it'll be Microsoft given this new attitude of really, if you think about it,  Google is not going to do it.  Apple is not going to do it.  Amazon is not going to do it.

Transcript:  I actually just exchanged some couple emails with Jason Snell the other day.  I was asking about that because he covers the Apple financial calls, the quarter financial calls.  He does those beautiful graphs.  Yes.  I asked him about that.  If he knew the number that they quote for the services, that's the total revenue that  they bring in.  But it's not their cut of it.  It also includes the 70% that they pay to developers or 85% in some cases,  if it's the subscriptions after the first year, things like that.

Transcript:  I could kick a pick up.  Timeline for iOS and Android.  Timeline is part of the new 18.03, the new spring update for Windows.  I haven't really played with it, but I don't really grok it yet.  I guess the idea is it keeps track of what you've done, what apps you've done.

Start time: 2137.48
End time: 2151.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a history of your activities and it's coming to iPhones and Android phones.  So you'll tell you what apps you've used?  I think that's a theory, although again, on iOS, I am fuzzy about how  Microsoft can do anything even sort of similar to that.

Transcript:  I see right here.  And the Verge article says on iOS, it'll be a tab within the Edge browser.  Oh, great.  So it's your Edge history.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So good news.  Does anybody use Edge on iPhone?  Only when Chrome isn't working.  You have to be nuts.  Well, I don't even use Chrome.  You can't even, everything links to Safari no matter what.  Everything's using the WebKit.  Oh, sorry.  The WebKit engine.  And it is all just different skins on WebKit.  On Android, Timeline will be part of the Microsoft launcher.  So you won't be able to use your nice Pixel launcher.  I'm sorry.  That's all.

Transcript:  I did not go to Build, but I did do a story about Starbucks working with Microsoft.  For the Starbucks app.  Part of that.  Like Starbucks is using 50 different Azure services.  And I did my story because Starbucks had a very high presence at Build.  One of the sessions that they led was one on how Starbucks got rid of its Windows app  and built a progressive web app.  And I was like, this really is another sign of the new Microsoft that had Build.  They're positioning it as a good thing to ditch your Windows native app and do progressive  web apps.

End time: 2315.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I think for our point of view, we spent a lot of money and effort making a website,  but we don't have an app.  We actually spent a lot of money making an app that turned out to be crap and I didn't  want to release it.  I think the next thing for us to consider if we wanted a Twitter app would be make a  progressive web app.  M.twit.com.  Yeah.  You go to the website, it downloads onto your phone, there's service workers on your phone.  They make sure that it works.  It's a podcast app.  So even if you're not online, you can still listen.

End time: 2352.74

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It's actually up to the operating system maker, isn't it?  So Google and Microsoft support it.  Apple is, I think, ambivalent because they still can work on it, get you locked into it.

Transcript:  It's completely flipped.  The worm has turned, as they say.  There's no worm in this apple.  The biggest surprise at Build was that the Kinect is back.  Yes.  The Kinect, which was for one day the hottest selling consumer electronics product in the  history of the world when it first came out and then immediately tanked.  I don't know how you can go from being literally the most successful consumer electronics product  ever to nobody wants it.  I love my Kinect.  I still have my Kinect on my Xbox.

Start time: 2397.44
End time: 2429.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I think part of it was that developers did not really take advantage of it.  Again.  You got to have developers.  And then when the Xbox One came out, there wasn't even a better piece of Kinect hardware.  And it was part of this vision of turning the Xbox One into more of a general purpose device,  which Microsoft quickly gave up on.  They went back to being a meat and potatoes gaming machine.  And then discontinued the Kinect.  Originally, you had to get the Kinect with your Xbox One.  That's right.  They stopped that quickly.  So I think the hardware was always amazing,  but it never quite developed into the ecosystem it needed to matter.

Start time: 2429.80
End time: 2520.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  They're going to do like an Azure Kinect.  Kinect in the cloud.  How's that going to work?  I don't know.  You still need hardware.  Right.  I mean, you still need the depth sensing camera and all that.  Although I gather that maybe these Windows Hello cameras are Kinect-like, right?  So maybe some of the PCs that have Windows Hello capable cameras will be able to do it.  So then developers will be able to send information up to the cloud.  Microsoft processes the information.  It's a cloud service.  It's not even Kinect probably, right?  It's just a cloud service.  All right.  See, that's it.  That's Microsoft.  Oh, one more thing.  Satya Nadella spent a significant amount of time at the beginning of the keynote  talking about ethics.  I thought that was interesting.  I think there's a move afoot.  It's not just because of Facebook.  I think a lot of people understand that  for a while software developers have been weaponizing their software  to become more and more addictive.  And so it's related to the Apple shareholders who went to Apple and said,  you've got to make your iPhone less compelling.  Your problem where you can't put the thing down.  People who play World of Warcraft to the point where they can't stand up anymore.  People who play Candy Crush Saga while their kids are starving in the back seat.  All of this has created a world where people are starting to blame technology.  I think that's what it's a response to from Microsoft.  But I think other companies are also doing this.  And Microsoft was really in front of this because at last year's build,

Start time: 2521.70
End time: 2549.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nadella said a lot of the same things.  Oh, really?  He began last year's keynote by flashing up the covers of 1984  and Brave New World and talking about...  Wow.  We don't want to make that.  ...Historian possibilities.  Yeah.  So I think that's really smart because Facebook acknowledged some of this stuff.  It was too late.  And Microsoft is confronting some of it before they have to.  Yeah.

Start time: 2550.74
End time: 2587.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I think you make an excellent point.  Yeah.  We interviewed Scott Galloway who wrote the book about...  What is it called?  The Big Four, Carson?  I think it was The Four.  Amazon, Facebook, Google, and I'm not sure who the fourth was.  Apple.  Apple maybe.  But about how these companies have to...  Those are the fangs.  These companies have to start to pay attention because at some point,  there's going to be so much heat under the government's going to step in.  And that could be a big problem.  Actually, that may have already happened with GDPR.  We'll talk about GDPR later on.  That's coming this week or next week.

Transcript:  I actually just sent in my next column for automotive engineering,  which was about ethics around autonomous vehicles.  Really?  Same thing, right?  Yeah.  A lot of the conversation around autonomous vehicles in engineering circles in the last  few years has been how you program ethics into the autonomous systems,  dealing with the trolley problem.  But really, that's actually a pretty...  It's such a rare issue anyway that that's not the real ethics problem around these things.  It's actually the people.  It's marketing.  It's telling...

We started that conversation because of the cat, like you mentioned,  that they only allow you to use the supercruise on roads, highways that they've already mapped.  Right.  It's geofancy.  Even though it would probably work on other roads, they won't...  Mercedes, in fact, lets you use it on other roads.  I think that these car companies have learned a lesson,  and they're being very judicious about rolling these features out.  They have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The fact that they promote it as much as they do is marketing and PR spend.  I think that he really does believe that stuff.  I think so too.  The corporate culture of Apple is generally more in that direction.  I'm sure there's lots of people within Apple that would be more than happy to do the kinds  of things that Facebook or Google or other companies do, but I think overall the corporate  culture is probably more along the lines of what you hear from Tim and other executives at Apple.

Transcript:  Well, it's interesting. Obviously, Google watched what Apple did with our ARKit.  Google had attempted a much more high-end product called Project Tango that required hardware.  Nobody was willing to make a Project Tango phone except for Lenovo.

Start time: 2908.40

Start time: 2909.84
End time: 2946.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  No. And it was big and clunky and expensive because it had all these extra sensors.  Meanwhile, Apple makes the iPhone X and puts all the AR stuff pointed at you, so it's useless,  and puts out ARKit, which does adequately, simply what AR needs to do for the end,  simple consumer, and gets all the attention.  So Google said, well, we could do ARKit, basically, which is ARCore, which uses none of Tango.  It's all in software. It's not as good. Stuff isn't quite on the surface.  There's glitches. And then they use their regular camera and do it.  And everybody's happy.

But it's on Android to let you check out the new Mission E  electric car. And so you can place the car in your room or on your driveway,  and then you can actually drive it around and you can walk around it.  And you've got control from the screen.  You virtually get in, open the door, and sit down.  Well, no. You can drive it remotely. So you can have it drive across in front of you,  and you can walk around it. It's pretty interesting.

I think this, I just read that this is, some people are getting this already on their phones.  I don't know if this is true. But the idea is, it uses the camera of the phone.  When you're getting walking directions to pop up the street view.  Go back to the previous slide, Karsten. Pops up the street view.  Superimposes on the picture of the street where you ought to go.  So there's never any ambiguity. Oh, you turn right here. I get it.  And the map is still at the bottom of the screen. I think this is.

Transcript:  And then Google goes on showing you how they're going to know everything about you,  how they'll incorporate into every product. I mean, there was in the,  they never used the word privacy as far as I could remember. There was never any  hat tip to the idea that you might not want Google to know everything about you.  And frankly, I don't because if I could have all of these, okay, this cool stuff,  maybe I'll put up with it. He showed some new voices.  They're already available on the, six different voices, including John Legend's, which I'm still,  I can't get John Legend. No, it's not.

Transcript:  So we've talked about this before. This is Google has a technique where they,  Sundar pointed out, and I think this is true of Siri. I think it's true of all the voice  assistants that they use real humans. They record a bunch of stuff. Sometimes they can  use that recording, but most of the time the generated voices are just patterned on the human  voice, but they've gotten better at that. That's called prosody.  And it is taking a human voice and overlaying the phrasing, the style, the structure on top  of the animated voice, automated voice to give it a more human sounding tech technology, you know,  tech texture. And that's what they did with John Legend. They had him in the studio and then  Pachai said, tell me what my calendar is. So obviously that's generated. I guess. I mean,  they could fake the demo, but the presumption is generated. And it was in John Legend's voice.  It sounded just like John Legend telling you what your appointments are.

Start time: 3247.42
End time: 3260.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they can do this a lot faster now, thanks to machine learning. So they can whip these things  out in weeks versus it used to take months to do this. So now they can do it in weeks,  which means there could be new voices further on in the future. Just maybe a dozen different

Start time: 3260.46
End time: 3263.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_13

Transcript:  They did have put out at least in P, I don't know if it's available in Oreo yet, but they have the  they said six new voices. They have them on here. I'm trying. It's buried so deep. I can  never remember. I found it somewhere this morning and I changed my well, I can do it. I could my  assistant voices. Is it Florence Ion's birthday today? Oh, she's got to turn her up.

Transcript:  The title is this week in tech show. That's that's a new voice. It still sounds like a robot.  It does. They have new male and female. You need the ums and ahs.  That's the duplex. That's duplex. Now, do we know if duplex is how close is this to being the real?

Start time: 3317.50
End time: 3348.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  From what I understand, it's going to roll out eventually. So I'm assuming sometime this year,  but what I do know is that this is going to be the limitations of it. So this is where it's  starting or rather the limitation. I shouldn't say limitations, but this is where it's starting out  of the gate. It's going to start very simply with making reservations for you at a restaurant  or booking an appointment for you wherever there isn't an online. If there's no online API  that's available for the assistant to tap in, then that's when it does the phone call.

Start time: 3349.34
End time: 3356.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They were vague on stage about timing, but someone from Google told me they talked in terms of weeks.

Start time: 3356.70
End time: 3378.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  What? Oh, they said weeks. Now they said they have thousands of the up place a little bit of this  so you can hear it. They have thousands of conversations. They've been using it primarily  to get business hours because apparently that's a database. It's not very good. They need to update  that. I'll play you what a business they're scraping data with the robotic and the business  hours that they get. Listen, how complex some of the stuff is that they're interpreting. Oh,

Start time: 3378.98
End time: 3392.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't play sound. So Tuesday through Thursday, we're open 11 to two and then reopen. That's a  human. And then Friday, Saturday, Sunday, we are Friday, Saturday. We're open 11 to nine and then

Start time: 3392.96
End time: 3397.10

Start time: 3398.12
End time: 3408.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  time and figure that out and then record that and parse it. And then they can put that into  their database. So when you look places up in Google search, then you see the hours and everything

Start time: 3408.94
End time: 3417.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  in there. So let me play. So Pachai says you can make a haircut appointment. Let me play this. This

Start time: 3417.70
End time: 3431.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is the actual call. That's a human. I'm calling to book a woman's haircut for a client. I'm looking  for something on May 3rd. Pause that for a second. Give me one. That's that with the up talking and

Start time: 3431.74
End time: 3437.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  everything and the gravelly voice and the perfectly perfectly timed. That's the assistant. Yes,

Start time: 3438.02
End time: 3442.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  like a little bit of vocal fry. Yeah, a little vocal fry. Yeah, the vocal fry thing was also like,

Start time: 3442.32
End time: 3491.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  man, they really Stacey Higginbotham said they have up talking. Yes, which is they talk like me.  Kind of something you want to chew, right? I'd like to know what time it is, but it is a very  common human trait. Almost said female, but I don't want you to hit me. It's a very common human trait.  I do it too. And so it felt like, and this is where they got some heat. They were actively  trying to simulate to trick in effect the receptionists. Now the ums and ahs are,  they said in their blog post to hide disfluencies. So when the computer is thinking instead of  just nothing or working like humans, just like humans, when we think we go, um, right. Which by

Start time: 3491.94
End time: 3495.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the way, those of us to do that apparently are smarter than the average bear. Oh, is that true?

Start time: 3495.34
End time: 3499.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yes, something like that. Cause I've trained myself over the years to not do it. Apparently it means

Start time: 3500.00
End time: 3509.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  very highly intellectual, which is always thinking. Well, I mean the fact that you're not just spewing  a string of words, you know, with you're actually taking the time to know I'm a radio broadcaster.

Start time: 3509.94
End time: 3546.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I just string a spew a string of words and I don't ever stop because I don't have to say anything  that's important because I'm talking all the time. So if I had to say, um, it would just slow me down.  So I trained myself not to say, um, which is why you think I'm stupid.  No, no, no, no. She said it. I didn't. Anyway, I read an article on the internet.  According to an article on the internet, Leo's stupid. Oh yeah. I read that article too. So  continue on. This is the, again, this is a Google assistant making an appointment for a haircut  and, and it's remarkable. Yeah. That was the assistant.

Start time: 3547.08
End time: 3563.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What time are you looking for around? At 12 PM. We do not have a 12 PM available.  The closest we have to that is a one 15. Do you have anything between 10 AM and a 12 PM?  Okay, stop. Depending on what service.

Start time: 3567.02
End time: 3590.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  There was that one inflection was wrong on the second time that would give it. If you knew what  you were looking for, but I bet you the person at the salon, she's not thinking about that.  I mean, if somebody told you, okay, you're going to get three calls, one of them is a robot.  That would be a giveaway. Right. Now Google has responded to the heat by saying, well,  we're going to announce that it's somehow we're going to indicate that it's Google assistant.

Start time: 3590.54
End time: 3614.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's still a little bit wishy washy about exactly how they will do it. And I asked them  what they were going to do. And they said, transparency is important. And I asked them,  does that mean that it will say it's computer? Well, transparency is important.  After that, they were a little bit more specific and said that yes, there will be disclosure and  they have to figure out what the phrase is. Well, and because for one thing, if you said,

Start time: 3615.22
End time: 3625.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I'm a computer calling on behalf of Florence Ion, most people would just click because it's like a  robot call. Right. Or they'd abuse you. They go over the head with the head. Well, and I'm sure

Start time: 3625.60
End time: 3629.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  that's probably why they were reluctant to go down that path in the first place. But there's ways you

Start time: 3629.92
End time: 3647.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  could do it. And this is what I predict they'll do something like, hi, this is Google assistant  calling on behalf of Florence Ion. You wouldn't assume immediately that's a computer that could  be her assistant, her special Google assistant. Right. Yeah. Yeah. And if it said it in kind of  a fluent natural way, you probably would just figure out it's a human. Yeah. So I suspect that's

Start time: 3647.86
End time: 3660.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  what they have to other because now we have so many robo calls that we're getting so many spam  calls, which by the way, have like gone up in number. I would hang up if it said this is high.  This is I would also hang up if I heard a beep because I hear a lot of beeps. Yeah. You get those

Start time: 3660.98
End time: 3665.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Start time: 3674.70
End time: 3685.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  recognize the number. Never. Yeah. It's a completely out of control. Yeah. Robo calling. And  did you ask them if they're going to somehow keep this technology to themselves?

Start time: 3685.92
End time: 3690.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not sure if they've talked about that yet. Because obviously they do want to keep it to

Start time: 3690.40
End time: 3706.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  themselves, right? But how long before? Because you know, if you license that out to somebody,  it's going to get abused. Yeah. Google, can you call 15 people in the town of Petaluma and offer  them cruises and let it do it? I mean, that would be bad, right? I don't think Google would allow

Start time: 3706.96
End time: 3723.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that. I'm just thinking about the military. What? How this could be used. By the military? Yeah.  Like what? Share your dystopian vision. I know. I kind of took it there. I did. And I don't have  anything to back it up other than I just went there. Used by the military. Here is Duplex

Start time: 3724.60

Transcript:  calling a restaurant. No, you're right though. I mean, you know, there will be, you know, all  kinds of abuses of it, whether it's, you know, by, you know, intelligence services or police or,

Start time: 3736.34
End time: 3741.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 3742.58
End time: 3751.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  data in that sense. What happens when the cruise scam guy can use this technology?  So you don't know. It's a scam. That's why Google has to keep it to themselves, right? They can't.

Start time: 3752.68
End time: 3761.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But, but can you really do that? Well, yeah, that's what I mean. Let me, yes. Here's the,  if Google can invent it, you know, well, but here's, okay, you're right. But nobody can do

Start time: 3762.62
End time: 3787.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  it as well as Google. I think, I think this is probably not, but here's the example. Google has  face recognition, which could be used and they don't allow it could be used to creep on girls,  right? And they don't let that, you can't do it. Even though you know, Google has that ability.  Now others have developed that same in China, they've got the same recognition,  but, but Google is not letting that out of the, that cat out of the bag. It never has.

Start time: 3790.80
End time: 3804.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I think that's the key on this is that Google has a huge lead over everybody else. The other  thing I think is important. And I'm going to play this. Let's take, I'm going to take a break. When  we play the next one, I think Google just passed the Turing test is what I think.

Start time: 3805.31
End time: 3806.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was just thinking that at Google I O.

Start time: 3807.38
End time: 4111.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Some other people have said that. Well, you and you and I were here during the keynote talking  about it. But I, and I, others have noted this, the Turing test, which is by the way, but most  artificial intelligence researchers rejected as a reasonable way to test for a successful AI. But  I think it's a kind of, you know, general man on the street way of doing it, which the idea is  if I sat you down Harry and I played, and I drew a curtain and had you have a conversation  with a human and a computer, could you tell which one was a human, which was the computer?  If that's the, if that's a test, and I think it's a fairly reasonable test,  I think this next call, which I'm going to play in a second, is the closest thing I've ever heard  to passing the Turing test. And we know that the humans that the Google assistant called  did not at any point say, are you a computer? No, they thought they were talking to a human.  Well, you hear this next one, but first a word from Blue Apron. We're going to, we're going to  have a lovely dinner tonight for Mother's Day. I'm going to cook it. But the beauty part is  I don't have to shop. I don't have to find a recipe. I don't have to do any meal planning.  I've got my Blue Apron box. That means I've got every ingredient. I've got the recipe in front of  me. It's under 40 minutes and I'm going to cook a meal. And the thing is the house is going to  smell great. I'll light the candles. I'll put the tablecloths out, the silver, the good china,  the good silverware, and it's going to be the best Mother's Day ever. Blue Apron is the number one  fresh ingredient recipe delivery service in the country. It is a great way for you to, if even if  you love, I mean, even if you're a great cook and you love to cook, to find new recipes and  new ingredients. If you don't cook, this would be a great gift for a kid just out of college  who needs to learn how to cook, but maybe doesn't and is spending a lot of time at the ramen shop or  eating cup of noodles. Get them a Blue Apron subscription. They're going to get everything  they need and they're going to, they're going to, it's easy. They walk you every step of the way  through the recipe and they're going to be great cooks. And I'll tell you what, date night, you use  a Blue Apron, you cook up something amazing. That is the best way to your date's heart. Blue Apron is  fantastic. If you've been eating burgers a lot, if you've been making spaghetti a lot, this is so much  better. You're making things like short ribs with a hoppy cheddar sauce on a pretzel bun. Oh, I hate  this part of the ad because my mouth gets, I get so hungry. You're making seared steaks and time pan  sauce with mashed potatoes, green beans and crispy shallots. What do we have here? Oh, I love the,  there's Shanghai Kung Pao chicken. We always want to know how to make that. Actually,  Mike, Michael, our 15 year old loves Kung Pao chicken, but we always just get the frozen stuff.  This way he can learn how to make it from scratch. And look what you get. You get fabulous meats. You  get all the chicken, every ingredient, the pea pods, the shallots, the peppers, and you don't  get a hundred peppers. You get the one pepper you need. So there's no waste, one clove of garlic.  I just, and of course all the sauces, but not a big bottle that's going to sit in the fridge  for the next three years, but just exactly the right amount of hoisin sauce and soy sauce,  all the things you need. And you're going to make a meal that's better than any restaurant.  Blue Apron changes every week based on what's in season. Now through May 21st,  they're teaming up with Airbnb to bring you the best home cooking from around the world. Each week,  I love this. This is why I love Blue Apron. They do stuff like this all the time. Each week through  May 21st, the menu is going to feature a recipe developed in collaboration with an Airbnb  experiences host. So you're going to get some amazing food from around the world. How about  chicken tinga tostadas with avocado and refried beans? That's from Mexico City. From Florence,  Italy. Roast pork and salsa verde with sauteed vegetables. From Buenos Aires, beef empanadas  with roasted sweet potatoes and creamy zucchini. Why do they do this to me? From Tokyo, beef and  rice bowl with soft boiled eggs and broccoli. I'm telling you, I love my Blue Apron. The other day  we did a roast chicken and with ingredients I've never, like Farro, you've probably used Farro.  I love it. I never tried it. I'm going to get Farro from now. That's the other thing is you  learn about new ingredients. Fairy eggplants. You ever have a fairy eggplant? No. They're really good.  Blue Apron. Check out this week's menu. Get your first three meals free and free shipping.  Blueapron.com slash twit. That's Blueapron.com slash twit. First three meals free and free shipping.  You got to try this. It's too late for Mother's Day, but hey, Father's Day is just around the  corner. Cook for Dad. All right. Let me play you. This is Duplex calling a Chinese restaurant.  Okay. First of all, when Sundar Pichai did this on stage, they put subtitles up because no,  you wouldn't be able to. That's the human. It's hard to understand. The computer apparently

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Okay. So the human's misunderstood already. He said, I want dinner for May 7th. She said,  for seven people. Now, normally I think most artificial intelligences would get lost here.  If it were Eliza, go home. Go home. But he doesn't. It's for four people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Okay. So now let me translate. Again, the AI had no trouble with that, but what she was saying was,  we only need reservations for upward of five people. For four people, you just come.  Google, the assistant didn't have any trouble. How long is the wait usually to?  In fact, made an amazing logical leap. Not only did it, it didn't in a second. It said, oh,  well, then I need to know how long I'd have to wait. I don't know if I would have got that one.

Transcript:  For next Wednesday, the 7th. Okay. That was a little robotic.  Yeah. It quickly jumped to a. Right. And if it were Harry sitting with a curtain,  you would have known that that was a computer. So maybe it doesn't pass the Turing test.

Start time: 4202.22
End time: 4213.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If I knew from the get go, it might be a computer. Yeah.  It would be able to figure out it was a computer. If you knew to expect it.  I think the classic Turing test, you're aware that there might be a computer on the other side,

Start time: 4214.00
End time: 4217.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_13

Transcript:  In a situation like this where the person on the other end of the line,  probably has no idea that it's a computer calling them.  It was close enough. Just a really clueless person.

Start time: 4236.92
End time: 4238.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or something. Yeah. Just an average person.

Start time: 4239.46
End time: 4276.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You pick up the phone, you answer the phone. And if you're not expecting a robot to be speaking  that way, you probably wouldn't even think about it. I mean, it's close enough that there's nothing  really obvious there that would jump out at you. Especially in a case like this, depending on what  the accent was and what your accent is, what you're used to listening to, if it's something  that's in a way that might be a little unfamiliar to you, I think that would make it even easier to  not recognize it. Or more likely that you would not recognize it as an AI.

End time: 4300.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, interesting. Okay, what's your phone number?  The phone number is 607. Wait, can you start over?  The number is 607. That's a robot. That's a robot. However, it handled the interaction.

Start time: 4301.84
End time: 4304.08

Start time: 4305.12
End time: 4349.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know what I actually find the most interesting part of this? It's not so much having a robot that  can do these tasks for me. But the fact that this robot is able to recognize natural language  speech so well. Because, again, going back to the car thing, one of the issues with distraction in  cars, they've tried to give us voice recognition systems. And even at home, with the voice  assistance at home, the vocabulary that these devices have to use tends to be very limited.  Having more natural language voice interactions with a machine would make it much easier,  much more likely that you would actually use them.

Start time: 4350.36
End time: 4353.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

But what if you're in Tokyo, happened to me recently, and you want a restaurant,  you want to make a reservation, you don't speak Japanese? Yes. I heard this example.  Yeah.

One of the interesting scenarios they came up with  is, for us to use it in a lot of situations, it would just be us being lazy. But there are also  a lot of scenarios where there's a real value to something like this if you have a speech impediment  or accessibility of any sort, whether you're unable to speak or anxious or whatever it might  be. If you could sit there and type in these commands and have it communicate like this  for you, that would be a huge boon to people. Yeah.

For years I told people to get ethernet in the walls and then Wi-Fi came along.  Just put conduit in so you can run whatever you want in there.  Building in Alexa or anything else like that would probably be a terrible idea.  Well, they're going to do it. They're the biggest dome builder in America.  Building in mics all around the house and speakers.  Now if you just put the basic hardware in there and have something where you can plug in a  processing system and be able to use whatever voice assistant you want to or whatever is current.

When I walk into my office, the lights come on.  The only thing that drives me crazy, my wife keeps coming in and turning off the lights.  And then you can't use them anymore.  Honey, they'll turn themselves off. Honest. Just be patient.  Yeah. When she turns it off, I come in the room. It's still dark.  And I go, oh.  I had to teach my husband that too.

It's gotten cheap  enough that you can put it in everything. There's computers moving out to the edge.  It's everywhere. That's IoT, but it's in your cars.

Start time: 4817.52
End time: 4891.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes. And Duplex talked and things like this. And I wrote a column at the time.  You just don't want a messenger bot.  Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Messenger bot is pointless. But I think that in the long run, as we start  to get into autonomous mobility services as an example.  What's that? What's autonomous mobility services?  Autonomous vehicle ride hailing services. So instead of you pulling out your phone and opening  up Lyft or Uber or DD if you're in China or whatever, whichever service, you're going to  have accounts on all these services. Your phone has your calendar on it, knows where you are,  knows where you need to be an hour from now. And what'll happen is there will just be these bots  that are working in the background. Your assistant bot will look at your calendar and say,  okay, you have an appointment across town in an hour. I'm going to go and talk to the traffic bot,  find out what the traffic and find out what the weather is, see which services you're subscribed  to. Exactly. And all that stuff is going to be complete. The bots will take the friction out of  it and make it completely seamless. So you don't, it takes away the interface to all of these  different services. And that's what you need is you move things out to the edge. You need to somehow

Start time: 4891.86
End time: 4903.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  solve the interface issue. I mean, look at how much Apple struggled with the Apple watch. You've got  this clever device, but the UI is unusable because you've got all these buttons and knobs. And so

Start time: 4904.24
End time: 4922.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  you've got to solve that. Voices are really good. And in a lot of cases, a lot for a lot of the  stuff, you don't even need an interface. It'll just, it'll happen. You'll step out the door  and the car will be sitting there waiting for you. You get in, it takes you, drops you off at your  destination. It goes off and picks up somebody else that their bot is requesting. You know,

Transcript:  what's funny is how people react to this is that's creepy. Right? I mean, it is what we kind of want,  but they also, I think they react that way to Google. That's creepy. That Google duplex,

Start time: 4933.36
End time: 4979.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  that's creepy. Well, that is the downside of all this is that, you know, and even just with  autonomous cars, you know, today you can get in your car and drive off somewhere and nobody knows  where you are. Or at least I can in my car because it's completely disconnected. But in your car,  you know, Elon always knows where you are. But, you know, in the future, if we're using autonomous  cars, they will always be connected. They have to be in order to be able to summon them in order to  to dispatch them and everything. And there will be monitors inside the car so that the car knows  and the service, whatever service runs that car will know who's in that vehicle, what they're  doing. So you will, you know, the, there, that's, this is one of the potential downsides of all of  this stuff. If we go down this path, whatever little bit of privacy we might still have,

Transcript:  Well, they're, they're leveraging a lot of the technology that Google's been developing to AI  stuff. You know, I'm convinced that like the photo, the Google photo stuff, you know, all, all the  data they're gathering from photos. It's just like back, you know, 10 years ago when they did  Google voice or the Google 411, you know, and they were training their voice models using that. And  I'm sure that a part of the reason why they did Google photos is to train these image recognition  neural networks. And, you know, they can use that. Google's really thinking monitors.

It's not dystopian at all.  Wait till the military. She's just a really good friend.  Our show is brought to you by LegalZoom. Oh, I love LegalZoom. When we started Twitter,  gosh, it's been a long time ago. Almost, let's see, 2005, 13 years ago, I asked Kevin Rose,  I said, what should you do when you start a business? He started many. He said,  you should call LegalZoom and get an LLC. I did. I did. Trademarked it, the Twitter name and the  logo and all that stuff. Look, attorneys are expensive. It says in their ad copy, $300 an  hour. Obviously, LegalZoom is not in the Bay Area. It's a lot. Let's just put it that way.  That's why. $300 an hour. Are you kidding? That's their paralegal. Two million Americans have used  LegalZoom just like I did to start their businesses with LLCs and corporations. I couldn't afford a  $500 an hour white shoe lawyer to do it, but I could do LegalZoom. And then even after your  business is set up, LegalZoom is there to help you out with things like lease agreements, changing  tax laws, even contract reviews. That is the worst thing we have to do is look at contracts and find  all the things we want to change. But that's exactly what LegalZoom is there for you. They  created their business legal plan. With it, you can get legal advice, not just the forms you need,  but actual advice from vetted independent attorneys and tax professionals in every state.  You also receive access to NDAs and more. Best part is you won't get charged by the hour. LegalZoom  is not a law firm. Instead, you pay one low upfront price. I think this is the way to go  if you're starting a business or a family or if you need legal help or advice of any kind,  check out LegalZoom's business legal plan. It's at LegalZoom.com. You'll get a special savings when  you enter the promo code TWIT in the referral box at checkout. LegalZoom, where life meets legal.  LegalZoom.com. Don't forget the promo code is TWIT for 10 bucks off.  I loved all this Google stuff. I have to say it's a lot of fun. Now after this,  EvBlast, EvLeaks, Leaks Out, Pixel 3 phone, and a new Pixel Wear watch. There's not been anything.  They didn't even mention the Wear OS at the Google I.O. Although they all were wearing giant big

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  and I like it a lot. I have the Gear S3 Forester, Frontier, something like that. Is that the green  one? The camouflage one? No, it sounds like a Chevy but it's not. I really like it but part of the  problem with this is that Qualcomm hasn't updated the chip that the original Android Wear came from.  They announced right at the same time as Google I.O. that they're going to do that. They have a new  chip coming sometime later this year. Better battery life, faster, more powerful. That coincides  with roughly around the time frame Google will announce a new Pixel right October.  I wouldn't be surprised to see a new Android Wear watch. There's the EvBlast Tweet from EvLeaks.

Start time: 5704.62

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I read the headline. So here's the problem. Everybody wants to do this. How many diabetics  are there in America? It's a huge number. Millions. Especially type 2 diabetics because  well that's what happens when you eat a lot of sugar. There is a massive market for non-invasive  blood glucose monitoring. Nobody's got it. In fact, I have a friend whose daughter, they just  discovered she's a seven-year-old, just has type 1 diabetes and she's talking about, oh my god,  they have a constant glucose monitoring but it's a pain. They have to replace the sensor. She says  it's supposed to be a week. It seems like it's every three days. Blood pricks for a kid. It's  painful to put the sensor in. It just goes on and on and on. You just got to do injections.  This would be a huge market. So Apple, in fact, remember Tim Cook saying I've been wearing this  glucose monitor for some time? But it turns out in every case it's intrusive. You have to stick

Start time: 5783.04
End time: 5796.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tiny exploding needles? The idea is to make it less invasive and annoying to collect blood,  especially for those who need to be frequently monitored. But the project is still years away  from hitting the market. So we're hearing a lot about this. Look it, here's an article from April

Start time: 5798.33
End time: 5806.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  2017, November 2017. This patent was filed in 2015 apparently. It was started by my former  colleague Christina Farr who knows what she's talking about when it comes to this stuff.

Start time: 5806.64

End time: 5816.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Google contact lenses? That was years ago. That was also from Friday early. 2013, 2014.

Start time: 5818.64
End time: 5973.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah, that was the contact lens that would be able to see your blood sugar because your tears,  it turns out, can also tell you what your blood sugar is. But that's what I told my friend because  she was saying this is a lot of work, this is really hard, I feel bad for my kid, I feel bad for me.  I said the good news is it's a good time to get diabetes, especially as a type 1 diabetes.  Relatively speaking.  If you're going to get it. Because I think technology is really changing. And I think  things like those contact lenses, I even told her, I said specifically, I think things like  those contact lenses within the next 5 to 10 years, right? Kids 7. But for the kids and adult,  there'll be plenty of good solutions out there. Including, you know, there's glucose insulin pumps  which she wears. If you get constant monitoring plus an insulin pump, it makes life a lot easier.  So I wouldn't be surprised to see that. And that's important. And I said all that,  there's a lot of money in it. And that's why Google and everybody else are very interested.  Facebook. We haven't talked about Facebook in so long. Cambridge Analytica, the company that  bought and got all that data from Facebook and then used it to sell it to campaigns and  lots of people. Is that a business, right? No. Rebranding. Yeah, they rebranded.  So there was a story, we did it. The Cambridge Analytica declared bankruptcy and retired the  registers got the story. They just changed their name. That's all to Emerdata. So even though they  were shut down and liquidated, the people and I presume the data have moved on to a new company.  Just change your name. The services are probably still out there.  You're harder to Google. Oh, you want to get angry?  Oh, you want to get really angry. Let's talk about Equifax. My favorite evil company. Equifax  again from the register. Equifax reveals the full horror of its cyber heist. 146 million. That  number seems to keep going up. Oh no, I guess that's the same number. But they just have more  information. It turns out 99 million addresses, 209,000 credit cards, 38,000 drivers licenses,  and oh get this, 3,200 passports. Passports. And has Equifax been punished in any way?  Nope. No, in fact they're making money off of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, and by the way, the way that people got into the Equifax servers, the bad guys got in,  they were using Apache, the web server, and we're using Apache Struts, which is a plugin for Apache  and it had a known flaw. Equifax wasn't paying attention. And even though the flaw had been  discovered months before it was taken advantage of, at RSA, Derek Weeks said that thousands of  companies continue to download the old version of Apache Struts. So I'm sure more breaches are coming.

Start time: 6461.62
End time: 6470.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  All the cell killers are doing this. I don't know why they don't just block them outright,  maybe because they can't be sure it's a scam. I've had a couple of times where it said it was a

Well, and now it'll after it sees a number for the first time,  if I didn't pick it up, it'll ask me if I want to add it to contact or block it.  Promise, they never reuse that number.  Yeah.  Well, no, but if it is a case where it's a legit number, then I can add it, one tap and I can add  it to contacts. And then subsequently it'll just come through.  Yeah.

New York Times article about a company appropriately called Secure Us.  Their big business is providing phones for prisoners. They offer a service. This is  according to New York Times that let law enforcement monitor inmates' calls. That's  legal because you're an inmate. You don't have the right to privacy, I gather. But they also,  as a kind of a sideline, they also offer location tracking services. They have a location finding  service that's available to any law enforcement or corrections official that can pinpoint where  nearly every cell phone in the country is at any given time, within seconds.  Here's the irony. It does this by going through a system used by marketers and other companies  to get location data from major cell phone carriers. AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, Verizon,  they all cooperate. And it came to light because of this guy. He's a former Missouri  sheriff. He lost his job recently for another matter. But he's been charged with using the  Secure Us service to track judges, members of the state highway patrol, not perps.  Not perps. But I guess now that we know this could be used by anybody in law enforcement,  a Secure Us spokesman said, Secure Us is neither a judge nor a district attorney,  and the responsibility of ensuring the legal adequacy of supporting documentation  lies with our customers and their counsel. In other words, we don't vet.  If you ask for the location, we'll give it to you. So you're carrying, you know, remember the movies,  you know, you'd have the cop or this private eye creep under the car bumper and stick the magnetic  tracker on. You don't need to do that anymore. We all carry our own trackers. We all have our

Start time: 6681.00
End time: 6691.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Supreme Court that said that law enforcement couldn't do the magnetic tracker? Now they don't  need a warrant. They don't need a warrant. It's a pen register. It's legal. It sounds, though,

Start time: 6692.70
End time: 6708.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  like at least T-Mobile said that they will shut this down. Good. And maybe the other carriers  as well. Good. I'm sure Verizon won't. Because basically this company is violating the spirit  of how that technology is used. As far as I can tell. It's the spirit. Yes. You're supposed

Start time: 6727.50
End time: 6741.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

We were talking before the show about subscribing to newspapers to support them and so  forth. There is great journalism being done. Long form journalism in magazines in this country.  Great stuff. I love, I read, and the problem is if you were to subscribe to all these magazines,  it would cost you thousands of dollars and your coffee table would buckle under the weight of all  of this paper.

Texture's, when we went to Japan, Lisa and I both do this. We loaded up our iPads with great reading  from Texture. By the way, if you love photography, they have a bunch of photography stuff like  National Geographic and Shutterbug. And pictures are so much better on the iPad than they are in  print. They don't have to screen them. There's no dots. They just look great. Unlimited access to  over 200 top magazines, back issues, all in one app. This is the next stage in the evolution of  magazines.

This was the company  Google bought briefly until they realized that Boston Dynamics was doing robots for the military.  Scary robots like this running robot. I think this is the same robot, Atlas, that they showed earlier  one of the Boston Dynamics employees kicking, knocking over with a stick. And the robot was so  nice and just got up and kept doing things. But I have to think it's kind of making a list, right?

I'd rather pick up the  dog poop instead of having one of these. Well, Kevin Rose suggested they cover it with fur. I  think that's probably... I don't know. I don't know if it'll look like this when they sell it.  I don't know how expensive it'll be. They didn't cover the little Sony dog with fur.

End time: 7242.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Elon is a very hard person to work for. I've been covering Tesla for over a decade.  I did my first drive in the roadster back in January of 2008. I interviewed Elon a couple  of times back in the day and have known a bunch of people that have worked for him over the years.  He's a very hard person to work for. When things go wrong, when he pushes you to do things in a  certain way and you do it, you tend to get thrown under the bus. Doug Field, who is the VP of  engineering who had previously been at Apple, he's taken a lot of flack of late for the Model 3  production issues. He has taken a leave. He hasn't officially left the company, but he's on leave for  now. I'm probably tired. I don't know what that sounds like.  Another executive. His name escapes me at the moment, but he's the chief regulatory interface  executive. He deals with NTSB and NHTSA on safety issues. He left this week.

Start time: 7253.12
End time: 7322.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  One of the issues there is that Elon owns about 22% of the shares in Tesla and about the same  percentage of SpaceX. The way the share structure is set up, he has a lot of voting control.  He doesn't want to dilute his share. Every time that they have gone back to the markets,  back in 2011, he said that, okay, we're good now. We're never going to have to go back to  the capital markets. Since then, they've done seven or eight capital raises for over $11 billion.  Every time that they've gone back to the markets, he's had to buy up a big chunk of that himself  in order to maintain his shareholding level. He has had to personally borrow  somewhere around $800 million in order to buy shares because most of his wealth is tied up in  the shares. He doesn't have that kind of cash laying around. He's had to borrow money from the  investment banks and pledge his shares as collateral. Should people stay away from buying

Start time: 7415.76

Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Transcript:  But, I also think that he's a terrible manager and he should not be the CEO of the company.  Maybe that's the case. I think he should be the chief visionary officer or something like that,  but he needs a Tim Cook to run the company. A nice guy with a subtle accent. And better labor  practices.

Do any of you have a  mailing list? You'd have to be, you know, you have to read up on GDPR and now make it compliant.  I mean, stuff you probably already do, like letting EU customers delete their information. But  still, there's some debate and according to GDPR, there's some debate over IP addresses,  whether that's personal information. GDPR says it is, which means every website, practically in  the world, which keeps logs is going to have to now update its technology. Google Analytics is  going to have to chat. I mean, this is going to be really interesting. We'll cover it a little  bit more next week, because we're out of time here. I don't want to keep you. Thank you very much.  Harry McCracken.
