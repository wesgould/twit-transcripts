Transcript:  From people you trust.  Except that Kevin Rose, hey, Sarah Lane was my sister.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

This Week in Tech is brought to you by Audible.  Listen to this week's book pick free at audible.com slash twint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Our 100th episode of This Week in Tech and we've gathered together the original, as  many as we could anyway, This Week in Techers starting with of course John C. Dvorak's  dot org slash blog.  Hey John.  Hey.  Welcome back.  You started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Remind me to talk about the fact that we got it really hit hard by dig this last week  on the blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh good, all right, we'll talk about it.  John, of course, isn't an original Twitter, he started with episode eight, but I think  by now you count, 92 episodes later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Reverse grandfathering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kevin Rose is here.  I'm so glad to talk to Kevin.  Hey Kev.  Hello.  Welcome back.  How's it going?  Thank you.  The original guy, it was you and Patrick and me and then Prager and Chang.  That's right.  Who were with us.  I'm sorry to say Roger can't be with us.  His dad was in the hospital.  He went home to Fresno or wherever it is and is with his dad right now.  I think his dad's going to be okay.  David.  I have my blogs up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Your blog is up?  Yes.  David's going to plug his.  Finally, I have kevinrose.com's back up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow, I'm typing it in right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's not a blog, it's a Tumblr.  Oh, is that great.  Are you using Tumblr?  It's awesome.  Is Tumblr great?  It's so easy.  I love Tumblr.  Yes, because you don't have to blog.  All you do is you bookmark stuff, you dig stuff and it automatically populates a blog  for you.  I have a Tumblr too.  What's the point?  Kevin.  Well, you can blog if you want to.  If you want to put in a picture or video or you want to put in some copy that you write  up, you can do whatever you want.  The point is that it just follows what you do throughout the day and then it's pretty

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  paid.  Mine is Tumblleo.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you remember that thing?  You join everything.  I'll add you as a friend.  Leo, do you have a live journal account too?  I do not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, my mood icon is joyful for our 100th episode.  That was always the thing that turned me off on Live Journal was that mood.  What my mood is, I'm depressed.  I'm emo right now.  So I never did that.  But I love Tumblr.  This is David Karp.  He's a fan of ours and a great guy.  Is this the David Karp?  The old timer?  Karp, K-A-R-P, like a fish with a K.  Tumblr.com, it's great.  That is cool.  A lot of us have Tumblr logs.  Merlin has one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's a Web 2.0 thing because they leave out the vowel and put in the R.  Final vowel is missing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And there's an R.  And there's an R. That's why Twitter really missed the boat.  It should be a T-W-T-T-R.  Right, you're absolutely correct.  Actually, I think it was originally and they changed it later.  They added an E.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The problem, honestly, is all the domains are taken.  That's the problem.  Nobody wants a half messed up domain.  They want a good domain, but they're 50k.  So you just get the misspellings and the misspelling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that why your D-I-G-G was the original ID D-I-G?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  D-I-G was Disney Interactive something and Disney is not going to sell me their domain  name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You would have liked to have been D-I-G with 1G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, sure.  I mean, I think games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's something about D-I-G with 2G's that's got a great branding.  It's better.  It is better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, looking back on it now, definitely, because we were able to secure the trademark  easily and yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not just websites, it's trademarks.  Although, you know, there was an article in the Times a short while ago saying that parents  are choosing their children's names based on the availability of the Web domain.  It's disgusting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I read that article.  We blogged it.  It's terrible.  Why?  And they also buy how Googleable it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because you don't want to be John Smith because nobody will find you.  I mean, John Dvorak is great.  You're the only John Dvorak.  Kevin Rose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, there's actually four, maybe five by now, I think, four, I know for a fact,  there's four professional writers named John Dvorak.  Wow, that's not serious.  There's a guy who works at the Kansas City Star.  There's a metallurgist and there's the John Dvorak who works for High Times and is a big  Seriously, he's like one of the biggest advocates of legalizing dope.  Oh, sweetest bud, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, I see Slamdance industry is finally joining us here.  Let me let me get Patrick Norton.  We've been waiting for Patrick to join us.  Hold on a sec. We'll add him to the conference.  And then, by the way, since it's our 100th episode, we are going to get we have some  greetings from some famous people.  Hello, Patrick.  Yeah, as usual, his his microphone's not working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's good. At least it keeps it in the in the form.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He joins us late. You even predicted it.  You called it. You'll say he joins us late.  It won't work so well.  And then he'll drop off about halfway through.  Let's but we'll get Patrick working.  But before we do, we have some greetings from some people who want to help us celebrate  our 100th anniversary, including this one from someone I think you all know.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Leo, this is God.  Yahweh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  El.  I love that one.  That one never gets old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway, twit the show.  It is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  It keeps me informed.  Not that I really need to be informed being a good person.  I'm just a good person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not that I really need to be informed being omnipotent and all.  It just, you know, I were.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Raddhole!

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Keep up the good work.  You and your friends.  Very entertaining.  Jesus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Get over here and say hello to the gang. Come on.  Hey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Anyway, I am impressed.  And there will be no spoilers about the Apple iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just going to have to sit tight on that one.  It's just going to get real crazy and it's going to be a lot of revisions.  And I just don't even want to get into it.  Anyway, twit 100 shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Very good.  God's signing off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's that's pretty big.  You can't start any bigger than that.  It's all downhill from there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that was who?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I don't.  Should I say his real name?  Yeah, why not? He should get a plug.  Yeah, because it's pretty good.  I think it's Mel Brooks, but I may be wrong.  No, let me check. I have to.  I actually don't have the names attached to him.  I'll find out. I'll find out.  Do you have any Apple iPhone insight there, Mr.  Kevin Rose, you were you were pretty right on when you talked about it last.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I got a few things wrong.  I don't have any insight this time.  Nothing really.  I'm going to be waiting in line just like everybody else camping out.  We got the date. You've seen the ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  June 29th.  What do you think of those ads?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, the ads are awesome.  Whether or not it works out well is, you know, they make you want one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Whether you exactly is that actually going to be like it's very fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I love how they cut out like all the time and we have to establish  a connection with the edge and then go and download and mention that part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you're watching the Pirates of the Caribbean and you get an idea.  You want some calamari.  So you go to a Google Maps and you find the nearest calamari.  And all of this happens in 30 seconds.  Right. Yeah, I don't know.  But it's true. You could do all of those things.  So I guess that's the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All of it happens. Yeah, 30 seconds, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway, I think that they're good ads.  I think they're attracting attention.  I'm talking to mainstream people who aren't, you know, following this closely  as insiders who are now excited about the iPhone again.  One industry analyst is now predicting a one hundred forty dollar stock price for Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, jeez. It's a one point four today. It's insane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's going up like crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm you know, I just wrote this call in Market Watch  titled, of course, is a time this short Apple, which became like the number one  and two, you know, most read items on the Market Watch site, which is pretty funny  because everyone's reading, you know, all jacked up about this thing.  I said not it's not the right time.  I think there will be a time shortly, but not now.  I think it's going to go to 170.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's here's the scenario I kind of see.  Obviously, it's going to take a big bump when the iPhone come, you know, people  start buying that day.  You're going to go up a lot.  Then you're going to start to see and I think you're going to see a lot of this.  There's going to be a lot of backlash.  Apple's really overhyped this thing.  It's impossible for it to live up to the hype, don't you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I agree. I think it's like saying here, I got the funniest joke in the world.  Let me tell you the joke.  Dumb, you know, it's not going to work.  Dumb. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If if if if you get it in hand, you start playing with it and it does,  you know, operate smooth and cleanly and that the keyboard actually works.  That's going to be the big thing.  Does the keyboard, the input actually work?  I think they're going to sell like crazy and continue to sell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're planning on you three million in stock each singular.  I'm sorry. AT&T store will have 200.  And then we don't know how many Apple will have.  They'll sell them at the stores.  In fact, somebody's reporting now there's a big curtain in his Apple store  behind which we presume lurks something.  iPhone related.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, here's another problem I have.  Oh, you know, everyone bashes me for being this anti Apple person  when I in fact think the company is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The oh, was that that was me hanging up on Patrick where he's still trying.  All right, we're going to hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Anyway, you know, that when they turn this bigot on, I mean,  I think Foxconn is making the first batch, you know, which is Chinese.  And I know that Apple's supposedly doing a deal with quanta  for the next generation of these things.  And, you know, these are these big giant manufacturing companies on the mainland.  When they turn this bigot on, if there is one batch of bad membranes  or some weird thing, they're going to be into a million of them  before anyone finds out about it.  I'm just skeptical that the that this thing can be mass produced  by the Chinese and with any form of quality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was pretty good, though, about this, aren't they?  I mean, initially they'll have bumps.  I remember the MacBook, the first MacBooks were really awful and they settled down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What about the iPods? How were they initially?  Do you guys remember?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They went through the initial ones, I think, were pretty reliable.  Then they did go through a bad period, I remember.  But they're they're pretty good now.  I mean, when you sell 25 million in in six months,  you're going to have some bad ones.  The fact that people are screaming bloody murder means that they've got a pretty good  success rate, don't you think?  I don't see a lot of people complaining about their iPods.  I think it's nearly as complicated as this phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's true. The phone's got touch screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why are why does it not have HSDPA?  Why is it edge?  Because it's singular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, singular has a high speed 3G network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we have cities right now, though.  Yeah, but even if it's only in 10 cities, you should put it in.  I think the radio must cost too much.  I think it's a hard work to actually.  Hey, Patrick Norton, ladies and gentlemen.  Yeah, no, I think a lot of it's they're working out probably battery issues

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  and I just don't see them.  You know what I mean? It's a first generation product.  They can hit 90 percent of the audience without having the high speed.  Can you turn Patrick up for me?  Patrick needs to turn himself up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hold on one sec.  While Patrick's turning himself up.  Let's say he does that all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I'm talking about the volume of his voice.  Let's get another greeting.  This is from the creator of Drupal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, Leo. My name is Dries Bertaerts and I'm the founder and project lead of Drupal,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  the open source content management system that powers the TweetTV website.  I just wanted to congratulate you with episode 100.  Bye.  Great to hear from Dries.  I need to talk to that guy.  Drupal is amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've been playing with Drupal.  It's a good product.  I mean, I'm still a WordPress user and I use Joomla.  And I'm better at both of those than I am with Drupal.  I think Drupal is hard.  It is, but you get what you don't pay for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All of those are free, I should say.  But WordPress is fantastic.  Drupal is just very, very flexible.  And you know, we've been Doug a number of times.  In fact, the first, when the Tweet site launched with its new Drupal implementation, I didn't  do any testing or anything.  I just rolled it out and it was Doug immediately.  And I don't know, we got hundreds of thousands of visitors in the first 24 hours and I didn't  even know it was, there was no slowdown at all.  It cashed in.  There was no slowdown at all.  It caches brilliantly.  So I'm very happy with how it scales.  I think it's a really good product.  Hey, can you guys hear me now?  Yes, and we hear you beautifully.  Oh, good.  It's anyway, welcome, Patrick.  And now we've got the, you know, I think the kind of the core group here, David Prager  and Roger Chang couldn't make it, but these are the four folks who really are Tweet.  And for our 100th episode, I thought it'd be fun to have them back again.  So it's good to have you all on.  We've been talking about the iPhone, Patrick.  You think it's a, well, first of all, let's talk about battery.  That's going to, I, you know, I have a Nokia N95, which I love the thing four hours and  I'm, I'm, I'm searching for power, but at least I could buy a second battery and put  it in.  Can't do that with the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it'll be, I mean, I think it's probably the first accessories are going to ship for  it.  It'll be like snap on, you know, extra battery adapters and I just, I just, yeah.  Although you know, you still can't buy a proper car adapter for the Mac book.  So if it's got a magnetic charger, who knows how long it could be before a car adapter  comes out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You think they put the MagSafe on there?  If that's what I hate about the MagSafe, it's patented and only Apple can make a MagSafe  or an Apple licensee.  And I don't think they've licensed it to anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They have not.  I was trying to find a car charger for it for a while.  It's yeah, it's disappointing.  So it's the M4V, you know, video extension, you know, I want to see that go to straight,  you know, move or H. just a regular move file would be really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well you're talking about how all the problems you have with DLTV get on the different file  formats you mean or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, no, because basically there's, instead of just using a regular, a regular move file  or, or, or they have the H4, the M4, I can't even think of the name.  H.264.  Yeah.  Well it's H.264, but they have a special three letter extension that basically means it only  plays on iPods and in iTunes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can't you just put name in MOV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a long story and I don't want to get into it.  Okay.  And a whole show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A whole show on that.  Way too inside baseball.  A whole show on that.  So how many of you will be waiting in line?  Kevin, you said you're going to wait in line for the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're going to be there?  I think I'm going to camp out and actually Alex and I are going to do a Dignation like  me out in Palo Alto.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Awesome.  At the Apple store or the AT&T store?  At the Apple store.  I think they'll have more of them.  Now we know John C. Dvorak will not be waiting in line because he wouldn't wait in line for  anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If I wanted I'd hire somebody to wait in line for me.  I think it's silly to wait in line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Won't Apple send you one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what?  I haven't asked them.  I doubt it.  I mean they might.  You know, I just haven't pursued it.  You know, I probably should.  What I'll do is I'll just, you know, one of you guys will have three of them and I'll  borrow one for a couple days and you know, I'll give it back to you and that'll be the  end of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've got my AT&T SIM card just here in my hot little hand waiting.  Just waiting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can you put SIM cards into this thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a GSM phone.  But where do they go?  Is there a little slot?  Well, there's got to be otherwise it wouldn't work.  Ask us on the 29th.  There's got to be.  That's a good question.  I mean I don't see an obvious slot but it's got to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know.  It could require an entirely new, you know, sort of some sort of strange internal SIM card  that requires a special registration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It does require a two-year AT&T contract but for the five or six hundred dollars you also  have to have the contract and nobody knows yet how much the data plan is going to cost.  AT&T is a thing.  A fortune, I guarantee it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  At least 40 bucks a month.  Their existing data plan, unlimited data plan for PDAs is 40 bucks a month.  It's expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I pay 50 for my Blackberry.  And that's without phone.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's how it ranges.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You guys have got money to burn.  That's the way I see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's too much.  Too much.  Too much.  Anything else to say about the iPhone before we move on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I hear they're going to announce it.  Well, there's a rumor that they're going to announce an SDK on Monday at the WWDC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that people can develop third-party apps.  Right, exactly.  That's a shocker because Steve said no third-party apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right, but then he came back and said maybe at the D-conference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I've actually seen some of the presentations that are supposed to go up.  It's kind of less of an SDK than something to translate existing OS X apps.  Because it is OS X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He did say it's OS X for sure.  Yes.  I mean, putting third-party apps is very important although I understand why Jobs would be reluctant  to because, and he says this, I want to make sure that the experience is flawless out of  the box.  And that's really where you can screw a phone up quick is putting on that hearts implementation  that crashes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What kind of third-party apps?  This is a phone for God's sake.  Oh man, I got mine a little bit.  Are we talking about Breakout?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jaiku.  You've got to put on Shouzu.  Yeah, the battery life is going to really have a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Has Wi-Fi built in so you definitely have to Skype for the free phone calls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Skype or Fring.  I use Fring on my Nokia which is a Skype.  It uses Skype, G-talk.  Fring.  I love Fring.  That's a great name actually.  And then you can use any SIP, Gizmo, Skype or Google Talk on your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sure AT&T appreciates all this.  Oh, it does a great job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the first thing they're not going to allow on there.  Skype.  So it's got Wi-Fi.  I didn't know it had Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what chews up the battery.  Apparently you turn that thing on and you're done in three hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I don't mind so much if it doesn't have a 3G data as long as it has Wi-Fi, right?  Especially because it's got Safari so I can even open a browser and type in a password  or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, brother.  So let's go to some news stories here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Steve Jobs and Bill Gates at the D Conference making nice, nice with each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, they look like two old men in rocking chairs on a porch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Bill has a man crush on Steve.  Boy, that killed the...  Maybe I should say...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, he did say he's always admired Steve's sense of style.  Style.  The products he brings, the elegance to the products he brings to market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then that was when they said, what do you admire about the other guy?  What did Jobs say about Gates?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, you know what Jobs said about Gates?  He says he invented the software business.  It's unbelievable.  He says he had the first software firm.  He says, well, what I liked about Bill, he did the first software company.  And I'm thinking, what about digital research where he put his software so it could even  run in the first place?  And what about these guys that will go back 20 or 30 years?  How does he the first...  Meanwhile, Gates refuses to deny...  He doesn't say anything.  He just takes it like a great compliment.  Oh, gosh.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, he's the Henry Ford, I think, of software.  Yeah, you'd have to give him that, software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The first company based on software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's like saying that Henry Ford invented the internal combustion engine as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, let me present a better analogy than inventing software.  I agree.  He certainly invented the modern software company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He didn't say that.  He said he was the first software company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the worst software company name in history.  I mean, really.  Now, we're all used to Microsoft, but please, is that a good name?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think the quid pro quo here is that some during the next in the D or the F conference  or whatever one they're going to do next.  I think these are the grades, right?  They got a D. Anyway, the next conference, whatever grade they give that one, Bill has  to say that Steve invented, not the personal computer, but Steve invented the computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's right.  That's only fair.  Yeah, that's only fair.  Anyway, I mean, think Steve was the kind of the Henry Ford of the personal computer industry.  I mean, that's fair.  They both look they're both pioneers in the industry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's why they like they need the attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't want to be you don't want to be a Microsoft most valuable professional making  software to improve Visual Studio because Microsoft might get upset and even threaten  you.  Did you read this?  And this is in the register.  Dotnet hobbyist, Jamie Cansdale improved Visual Studio.  Microsoft writes to him saying you violated the license agreements and and you're in trouble.  We're going to sue you.  Even though he's an MVP and everybody loves him because he did such a nice thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's got a he's got a well, you know, the problem here is obvious that this is like  the fact that he did this in the first place.  Smacks of open source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, heaven for Fenn.  Hey, what happened to the open source threats that Microsoft was making those lawsuits?  Nothing, right?  Never.  They never mentioned what the patents were and then and then just kind of went away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I guess they were designed to scare one person that scared me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Patent offices have proved a new Amazon patent.  Did you see this?  Amazon is extending its one click patent to extend to not just buying stuff, but to giving  gifts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, please.  These guys in these pants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Who uses the one click?  That's what I want to know.  I do.  I do.  I had no idea.  It's so easy to buy stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So you just click and it just shows up.  It's one click.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've spent more money that way.  And then if you get Amazon Prime, it shows up in two days.  Wow.  You guys know about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I haven't bought anything from Amazon.  The last thing I used to Amazon was like S3, which is their storage thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's a cool solution.  Are you using that for dig or just personally?  Just trying some stuff out on it.  S3.  Oh, this is the new business that you're doing?  No, no.  Don't get me in trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Kevin Rose, starting a CDN.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Serial entrepreneur Kevin Rose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, Kevin knows something about this music site deal that CBS bought last FM.  Because when that story showed up, we were talking about this just before we started  the show.  Kevin, tell us about these guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like last FM.  This is a radio, internet radio, right?  This is the new...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, last is great.  There's a few different uses for it.  I have the application installed on OS X.  And basically what it does is it watches what I'm listening to inside of iTunes.  And it monitors that and reports it back to their website.  So it's constantly watching what you're listening to.  You go to your profile at last FM, it'll show you what you've listened to throughout the  last week or the month.  And then it starts making recommendations of other music I might like based on what  I've heard in the past.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, are those recommendations based on what other people like you are listening to?  Right, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And what I've listened to myself.  So I can go and launch the application and hit play and it'll start playing almost CD  quality music without any commercials.  And I sit there and I can click on the little heart if I love it.  I can click on the band if I hate it.  It starts to customize and it gets better and better with time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  280 million dollars CBS bought it for.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You think they're going to kill it?  No, I don't think they're going to kill it.  See what they're see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was at a radio business.  The largest radio group in the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know, but there's a bunch of CBS radio stations in San Francisco that are kind of painful.  I'm just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, but there's something really interesting that's going on behind the scenes that they  don't really come out and talk about that often.  I was at a conference here just a couple of months ago where I was listening to one of  the tech guys speak about what they're doing behind the scenes to kind of monetize the  platform.  And what they're doing is they're watching what you listen to and they report that back  to the servers, not only what you're listening to, but how far you listen into a track.  And so they can tell at what point you said, I hate this track and you decide to skip it.  And they can sell that information back to the record labels.  They can introduce new tracks from the record labels and inject them into a stream based  on what you've been listening to and see kind of what the uptake is based on your demographic.  There's a lot of really cool stuff that they can do and they can sell to make this thing  profitable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are you using the word cool as in sinister?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I mean, if it's all anonymous, I personally don't care.  But even if it was, they were reporting that it was me.  Like what are they going to do?  Who can I get frustrated sometimes when everyone wants to stay so anonymous?  You know what you listen to, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to try to see your record.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You guys watch the movie V for Vendetta?  Yeah.  No?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  So at what point do they listen to your music?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, when they clubbed that guy for doing the parody, I think that's going to happen.  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway, so you think this is a good buy?  CBS is focusing on the community, by the way, not so much on the music.  They say this is a fast growing community.  We think that's worth money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And there's a lot of stuff going on.  I mean, when you go to the website, when it knows what you've listened to, it starts saying,  There's an upcoming concert in the area based on, you know, you've been listening to a lot  of the Knife tracks lately.  We want to let you know they're playing in two weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Seems like this would synergize well with radio properties, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, if you listen to the radio and streaming music on the radio, you know, let's say you  listen to what is the CBS station in San Francisco, Alice, right?  So you listen to Alice and you listen to the streaming version of Alice, you could have  some of those last FM capabilities built into that.  I think that's pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Could this also help them get around the expense of streaming audio in the United States from  their individual radio stations?  If the if the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's the that's the interesting thing.  This is a British company and they're not susceptible to these new royalties.  Although I talked to Tim Westergren of Pandora, which is a similar system that is in the US.  And he said, you know, don't think that last FM is protected because they're in Britain.  These new these new royalty rules will ultimately affect everybody who does business in the  US.  So they're not off the hook for that.  You know, that that's been put off now to July 15th.  I wonder if that's going to actually happen.  We're talking about those new royalty arrangements.  John, you said they made a mistake.  They didn't expect the Copyright Office to agree to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I think this is going to be interesting.  I mean, I know they'd like to do stuff like this more often, you know, to gouge the  customer and ruin their own business because there's I think they're I guess they're masochist.  I'm not absolutely sure what they're thinking.  What are they up to?  But you know, I don't think it's a reverse psychology of how to do business.  Let's gouge our customers, make it clear that we hate them and then do what we can to destroy  our own industry.  It's a really weird kind of business practice.  Maybe there's an end game I'm not aware of.  Not sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have an interesting column in the CBS and your Market Watch.  Is that CBS still or no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it's Dow Jones.  All right.  So they took it.  They wanted to sell it to CBS and then the deal, you know, they just Dow Jones came up  with more money and then they I mean the whole plan as far as I can tell, I don't know for  sure but Larry Kramer's idea because he's they were tight with CBS all those years and  they were a part owner and they were going to give the whole thing to CBS.  But since it's a public company, these other guys came in with a bigger bid and CBS couldn't  get up to the same numbers and so they ended up selling it to Dow Jones, which, you know,  is fine but not for the guys who, you know, had the scheme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  CBS is interesting.  So they acquire Last FM.  They're acquiring, they bought Wall Strip, which is a kind of a small but good, I think,  video podcast about Wall Street for five million.  Are they, I mean, this is-  You can sell Twitter.  Let's see.  Well, that's only one podcast.  I think it should be worth 60, don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At least.  I'm not for sale.  I don't want to sell.  I like what I'm doing.  I don't want to work for nobody.  That's what I'm, I'm just here to have a good time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So what are the, now here's a story that came up.  Universities respond to decline in computer science students.  This is a, I mean, is anybody shocked that there's a decline in computer science students  after they, you know, basically gave the business to the Indians and the outsourcers and the  H1Bs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People are still pissed off about the H1B situation.  Donna Dubinsky was talking about that when I was back at my reunion.  What she wants more?  They want more, yeah, they're not enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's what's killed this computer science student to begin with.  It's like a vicious circle in the wrong direction.  So explain what the H1Bs are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was declining enrollment followed by the, you know, the whole dot bomb that kind of  killed off people enrolling in computer science.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's back.  Wouldn't you want to be in computer science now?  This is like, I mean, it couldn't be better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but the people who are graduating now-  That was four years ago.  Yeah.  2000 and one and looking at all their, you know, brothers and sisters and cousins who-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was just at my son's sixth grade promotion ceremony and everybody wanted to be a veterinarian.  So I think that that's the next big thing.  And marine biologists, and you know, actually I was a little disheartened that nobody in  his class of 60 kids said, you know, scientist, computer scientist, technology, nothing.  Why not?  There are more geeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.  There's no, I think it has a lot to do with the, you know, with the leadership of the  country.  You know, it's just the country is run by lawyers and professionals and you know, there's  no science emphasis on science.  It's you know, it's, I don't know, it's just terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, but do you think you really want to know, you know, you want to be geek by sixth  grade?  I think that comes like, you know, you like video games at that point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like being gay.  You don't really realize until you're 13 or 14.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Why not know until you're a little bit older?  It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sure.  But yeah, I guess if you want to be a fireman when you're that young, you know, or, you  know, or something like that, but astronaut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think we need to work harder to make it be like an astronaut or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think they did, but why does scientist, orientation towards science have to be quote  unquote geek?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, where does that come from?  No, and science is it.  Science is what it's all about.  I mean, I really thought-  Don't cut up nonsense.  I'd like to see more kids be into science.  And I mean, look at technology is just science applied.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, if you start searching around on Google on this, what's kind of funny is you  see like 2005 Gates worried about declining U.S. computer scientists, you know, DBA administrators  did an article on this, I think in 2002.  It's been going on for a while.  Yeah, but I mean, this is also kind of like, this is the worst generation of young people  in America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what I mean?  It just, it's-  Maybe it's just more, they want, it's just a way to pitch more H1B visas.  Yeah, and it's been-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's a scam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it's been falling since like 2000, you know, probably before that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, let's take the funding away.  Let's deemphasize it.  Let's let everybody come in and then work cheap and then make sure that everyone who's  been in that business gets fired or has to train somebody that works for half amount,  half amount of money.  And then let's offshore everything we can and let's decimate the industry and then go,  oh, it's just funny.  Nobody wants to go into this anymore.  I guess we need some more H1Bs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's bring in more Indian computer scientists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, I got to be honest with you.  I think this is mostly a reaction around 2000 to the dot-bomb and people started, you know,  people started being told, you know, this computer science thing isn't the way to go.  I realize there's an irrational relationship between companies-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but Patrick, if you're going to use that logic, why didn't the same thing happen  to the guys who were really burned in the 2000 dot-bomb situation with the MBAs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I'm looking at the-  Yeah, well, because, don't even get me started on MBAs.  There's always a market for venture capitalists.  Well, there's always a market for Harvard MBAs.  It's, you know, and there's some other top tier schools and everybody else is slogging  it out in the pits to prove they've got their chops.  But I mean, look, here's another one between the fall of 2000 and the fall of 2004,  the percentage of computer science majors dropped by 60 percent and now is 70 percent  lower than its peak in the early 1980s.  You know what I mean?  They got to change the languages they're teaching from search CIO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Kevin just nailed, that's another thing.  Kevin's right.  In fact, there was a list, ACM just put out a list, which is on the dvorak.org slash blog.  If you put in ACM, you'll find it.  Anyway, there's a list of the worst jobs not to take, including coding in C is considered a dead end.  And the languages do need to change.  And if you talk to a lot of people in some of these schools and you find out what they've  been taught, because I get a lot of letters and people say, you know what they're trying to teach us?  Cobalt.  Yeah, well, cobalt is number one on the list, by the way.  But you know, Pascal and some of these dead languages that, you know, they don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I think that varies a lot with the school because all the guys I know that came out of  the University of Arizona in the last five years, I know a bunch of guys who went to school there,  they're in UCLA.  They're basically all program in Java.  You know, that was like the language that they were all brought up on.  That's how they're all making a living and they're all making a pretty good living at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know if that's the language of the future, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, yeah, but you know, how many languages of the future have there been in the last decade?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, true.  So I need somebody to help me with some PHP code.  Oh, I just did I say that?  I'm sorry.  And also some and some Pearl.  I don't need Pearl.  Some CSS.  He's doing Drupal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, doing Drupal.  Coming up, we're going to do some of the speeches from the Webby Awards.  You know, you only get five words and some of them are pretty good.  But first, another greeting for our 100th episode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somewhere in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  This is David Capito from Wisconsin.  Stevens Point 90 FM, the only alternative home of the world's largest trivia contest.  Happy anniversary to all you Twitters out there and especially to the tech news masters  known as the Twit Gang.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Twit.tv.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  For 100 entertaining episodes.  And now we will spend 10 seconds summing up the last 50 episodes.  Nivorak.org slash blog.  The Zune is cool.  Oh, wait, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  09F911029074.  What does it mean?  It's a cookbook.  Yes.  Twit is great and we hope you stick around for another 100 episodes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got a little Nivorak going with that kid there.  I don't know what the deal is with that.  How old is that kid?  I don't know.  I don't know.  The Paunch podcast.  I'm gonna have to listen to it now.  Webby Awards.  Did you read some?  I love I think this is the one the Webby's are outside of control.  They have like 800 award winners, but they still have five words for the thank you speech.  And I think that really is great.  It just gets people creative.  Meg Whitman winning for lifetime achievement.  She's the CEO of eBay.  Her thank you bidding starts at 99 cents.  That's awesome.  Beastie Boys.  Can anyone fix my computer?  David Bowie didn't work.  He was unable to do.  He says I only get five words.  Shoot, that was five.  Four more there.  Oh, that's three.  Oh, two.  And then they pulled him off.  Facebook.  I'm just here for Bowie.  There's one actually a serious one from CNET.  They won People's Voice for guides, ratings, reviews, and I like their thank you.  This one's for James Kim, of course, worked for CNET and is a good friend of all of ours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's nice.  I got in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  The Reggie Bush project is one for sports.  Finally a Bush everyone loves.  Manchester United official website.  He gave you David Beckham.  Sony.com.  The focus groups were right.  I think this is a great idea.  We'd have to.  Some of them are.  You got me cracking up.  Oh, you're laughing.  I hear it.  You're laughing silently inside deep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I like the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino, which one for corporate communications.  Undiscover your inner Vegas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Current TV, Al Gore's TV channel, which by the way, I'm told is very  successful much more so than we were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you know that?  You know, is any way I've never seen it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's in 50 million homes, five zero more than we ever were.  It was the fastest growth to 50 in the history of cable television.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but who's what's our audience?  So I mean, the number of homes is a bogus number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I agree.  I don't think they're going to think about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's Al Gore.  He's going to, you know, he's got, he's hooked up with deeply in the political system  and he goes around as the kind of the pitch man for this thing.  And what cable companies are going to say no to him because any one of them could have  some horrible thing happen to him based on some government edict.  So they all sign up.  So they got 50 million homes.  Okay, well, that worked.  That was a pretty good deal.  And but who's listening?  I mean, who's watching?  I don't know.  Have you Kevin, have you watched this thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I've seen a little bit of it and I haven't watched it since.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's cheap because all of the content is created by viewers, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, but the problem is that what they're trying to do is that basically they say,  okay, if you have good content, if you're a filmmaker or you have a camera and you're  shooting something interesting, come to our website website, upload the video.  The community will then get around that video, vote on the best and they'll display the top videos  on their television network.  Now, the problem, though, is that the users, the people that are shooting this content,  they don't need a current.  They can just go to YouTube, upload it and get 10 times the amount of viewers.  Exactly.  But can they get paid?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, so eventually, yeah, they go to rever then and you'll make money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, rever pays you.  There's a bunch of them that I think that's the next model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I didn't realize until I read an article in the I think it was the Times that  we all saw the Will Ferrell short, the landlord where his little kid is berating him.  It's pretty funny.  That was funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Give me my vet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it was on a site, Funny or Die.  And, you know, I remember, you know, I linked it on my tumble log and so forth.  And I remember it had a little bug, funny or die.  I didn't realize this, but he was given a ton of money from venture capital  to create this site as another YouTube, except that comics would go there and use it.  Are they wasting their money?  Is it throwing away their money?  Maybe they just wanted to meet him.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Who?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I can't remember the name of the investor.  You know, one of these Sandhildro types.  But they gave him a lot of money.  How much is a lot?  Twenty, thirty, forty million.  I mean, here, I'll try to find the article.  But I was kind of surprised.  I mean, I didn't even know that.  I mean, I remember I watched the thing, but I don't remember that, you know,  spending a lot of time on the site or it wasn't even clear that this is Will Ferrell's new comedy site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think he gets that per movie nowadays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sequoia was Sequoia that gave him the money.  Mark Fahmy, who actually was part of the early tech TV way back when.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We all know Mark.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What a character.  With Adam McKay, who is Will Ferrell's partner.  Let me see if I can find.  Was it twenty million?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let me just see if I can find how much.  Seems like a waste of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It doesn't seem like a sensible investment, to be honest with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know.  I'm still on the current TV website checking out puppy scams.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're looking for another.  I mean, they made half a billion on YouTube.  They're looking for another.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  There's so many of these video sites now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, Juiced got forty five million from Sequoia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sequoia is funny or die.  I'm trying to find.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Got a track record that guy.  Which guy?  Juiced.  Yeah.  Juiced.  The great record.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I give them money.  Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't watch for Juiced, but you know, I admire them.  The guys.  Juiced is cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They've got to sign the right deals and they also,  they're talking about integration to the Apple TV and a bunch of other set-top box devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, now that would be good.  I'm what is the Apple TV a flop?  I even saw rumors.  It's a hobby.  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a hobby.  That's it.  It's a job.  An expensive hobby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's a, you know, it's one of the products that I think is the right idea  at the wrong time.  And I think that they've got, as long as they don't pull the plug on it and they keep their  foot in the door, when IPTV comes along, I think this thing could be important.  I like the Apple TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love it.  I'm using mine all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think it's the right idea at the wrong price point.  Well, that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, of course, I don't use it.  What's the right $9?  Here's my issue.  What's the right $9?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's 250.  That's insane.  That's like an X30.  It's 299 actually.  That's 300.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, 99 bucks, you know.  The biggest problem is you can't buy high-def content on iTunes.  So, I mean, if you're really going to use it, the way you use it is by stealing stuff.  And that's basically the, you know, I almost said that's what I do, but I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can hack it.  We just released a system on revision three on how to hack the...  Right.  It's very hackable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you don't need to hack it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It takes a fair amount of effort to hack it.  And there are some actually good reasons to hack it, like the ability to set it up.  So RSS feeds will show up on your monitor.  I was actually in that episode.  Oh, that's right.  You're the one that did it.  Expanding the hard drive capacity for storage.  You forgot.  But I mean, it's funny, but there's also...  This is...  It's a very clean design, but it's like, you know, seven other devices that have been out  as media center extenders for a while.  You know, it's the right idea.  Question is how long before the sort of a standardized, easy to access IPTV format?  You know, it's what John was saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a movement in that direction with the MythTV folks  trying to create a standardized platform, a reference platform for...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, there's like MythTV and democracy and, you know, and then...  Democracy is cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Everybody wants to do something like that.  Hey, I want to thank the folks at Audible.  They're back, by the way, on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, after you complained bitterly last week, you think that had anything to do with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It had nothing to do with it.  You know what it had to do with is it was a very successful campaign.  We did one commercial and they got quite a few.  They had something like 6,000 people hit the website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're telling me that the complaining didn't help?  Did I complain about Audible?  Do you remember last week I was talking about the confessions of an economic hitman  and it was on the tape that you could get from it.  You just said not to mention them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I was just because they didn't pay for that particularly.  But they're back.  So they're paying for this one.  Actually, what we're going to do and I think this is going to be fun and we're  doing on a number of the other twit podcasts as well is pick a book each show that's available  on audible.com like Confessions of an Economic Hitman, which by the way,  I got a lot of email from people saying they downloaded it and we're listening and loved it.  And that book is free.  Actually, any book is free.  No strings attached.  If you want to sample Audible, this is a great way to do it.  Yeah.  So going forward, if you guys have an Audible book that you'd like  or a book that you like that is on audible.com that you think people should listen to,  just let me know.  The one I'm picking this week is one I'm listening to right now, which I'm loving  is Jeff Hawkins' new book on intelligence.  You guys know Jeff.  He's the guy I founded Palm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, he won't take our calls anymore.  Oh, I'm doing an interview with him.  Tell him I said hi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you know how I did it because Donna Dubinsky, who is his partner at Palm  and also at Handspring is my classmate and I was at the reunion.  She was my classmate at Yale and so she was at the reunion.  So I said, Donna, I'd like to get him on Twitter.  And she said, no problem.  So I'll set him up with you.  Anyway, he's written a really interesting book.  I didn't know this, but all along while he was doing the Palm and his new thing,  the Folio and the Trio.  The Folio is really interesting, by the way.  I think the Folio is going to be a hit.  I'm really liking it.  500 bucks.  It runs Linux.  When I thought at first, I thought, oh, it's Palm, who cares?  But it runs Linux, which I think is interesting.  Anyway, we'll talk about the Folio.  The price is tough.  500 is a little high, but you know, it's I mean.  How much is the Apple iPhone?  Six, five or six hundred.  There you go.  Oh, but that's okay.  Hey, I didn't say that.  Who said that?  Did anybody say that's okay?  Nothing.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm just, I'm just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just because Kevin's going to buy one doesn't mean he likes the price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff has studied from day one neuroscience in the brain and actually  has a very interesting model of how the brain works.  And the reason I'm going to interview him,  he started a company called Numenta that is designed around putting this to work.  I mean, he's putting his money where his mouth is saying, look, I think we can.  This is a new form of.  Computer intelligence.  Anyway, the book is fascinating.  It's called On Intelligence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's I know that for a fact that he's been like this character.  It's his whole life.  Well, it's for yeah, forever.  And I just, it's nice that you did a book.  I'll get that one.  So that's free.  Now, what would you do?  You go to audible.com slash twit.  Yes, you would, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And actually you don't have to get this one.  You can get any book, but this is our book for the week that I'm recommending.  And John recommended Confessions of an Economic Hitman.  That might be your choice, but any book is free.  No strings attached.  How do they make money?  That makes no sense.  They're hoping you'll like it and you'll and you'll become an audible listener.  I am.  I think it's great audible.com slash twit.  Take a look at On Intelligence this week.  We'll have a new book every week.  If you guys have one you'd like to recommend, feel free to chime in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's two guys.  They will read comic books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's the matter with reading comic books?  If you'd read the comic book for me for Vendetta, you probably would have enjoyed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I get a text message from Patrick a couple weeks ago.  He's like, I'm going to the comic book store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Isn't that cute?  Man, I nailed that one.  You did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  Well, trim your neckbeards, guys.  We're going to move on now with more fascinating stories.  You were talking about Stumble Upon, Kevin, also friend of yours.  eBay acquired them for $75 million.  I love Stumble Upon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, Stumble Upon's great.  They have a pretty cool, interesting take on new site discovery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you install a toolbar and it works in Firefox, I presume, Explorer or any other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's a little Firefox plug-in.  You hit a button and it's epic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It gives you a cool new site and then you thumbs up or thumbs down it.  It's kind of like dig.  Thumbs up or thumbs down it.  But there's a community around it.  That's the new thing.  You got to have a community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Community is everything.  I get a lot of hits on the dvorak.org slash blog site from Stumbled Upon.  Do you really?  Yeah, like a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Referral from Stumble Upon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's one or two fans in there, I think, and they keep banging me.  That's neat.  Is it pleasant for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not complaining.  Why does eBay want Stumble Upon?  What does it do for eBay?  I mean, why do they want Skype?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't get it either.  They got some cash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, they talked about...  Sorry, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was going to say they talked about integrating Skype into the eBay interface.  That makes sense.  To facilitate communications and also it could be a way for them to track communications between  buyers and sellers because that's something eBay doesn't want to handle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So are they just buying with Stumble Upon?  Are they just buying users?  They said 2.3 million users, 5 million recommendations daily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or maybe they wanted to integrate it into eBay, find a simpler object.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What did they pay for these guys?  75 million.  And they got 2.3 million.  So they're paying what?  30 bucks a head.  Is that right?  $30 a person, a user.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the going rate?  Is there a going rate?  So if you have a million uniques, you're worth 20 million?  Yeah, pretty much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If they're regulars.  I didn't know that.  You would have.  You don't get just 20 million uniques one day and then nothing.  Right.  So you probably have...  Yeah, it'd be worth 20 million.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow, that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I personally think 10 is about where it should end because that's the old numbers  that used to be used for mailing lists.  I used to be in the mailing list business for a short part of my life.  And that was what they were worth, $10.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  John C. Dvorak, I'm a spammer.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm a no, no, no.  It was kind of a tire business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you friends with Garrett?  Or who do you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, with Garrett Kam.  He's one of the founders.  Chief architect.  Yeah, he's one of the founders.  He's happy about it?  Yeah, he's really happy about it.  I mean, they're basically staying where they're at in San Francisco.  And he's pretty stoked.  They're adding some more resources and going to continue developing their product.  And it's a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yay.  Good guys one more time.  Good guys win.  So who's going to run out?  Maybe they can afford it and buy a Microsoft Surface.  That's not going to be available to the public for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's got Kevin's name on it.  Oh boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is one of these things where you have to wait a while for the technology to catch  up all around because you can't just set your cell phone or your camera on the surface and  automatically recognize it today.  I mean, this is very early on.  It's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Las Vegas, there's casinos I've already put in an order.  Hotels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What Microsoft did is they went with a bunch of corporate partners,  including a hotel chain, T-Mobile.  And essentially, they're going to roll it out.  It's classic.  They're going to roll it out in Vegas, in T-Mobile stores, and in high traffic malls.  So they want to sort of get the public used to the idea, I think,  before they try to bring it into your living room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go ahead.  This is Jeff Hahn's baby, right?  And he's the guy who demoed this at TED.  Remember that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The D?  Was it the D?  I don't think it was TED.  It was TED.  It was an amazing...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they showed it at D.  They showed the Surface.  You remember this great video from TED of this guy showing the squeeze,  the pinch, the move around, all this cool stuff.  He was with the NYU Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, and then did this demo.  I guess he's been working with Microsoft because this is basically that product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jeff Hahn is a separate company in New York.  Oh, so they licensed it then.  It's a separate product.  No, actually, I think they were developed.  Microsoft says they've been working on this for five years separately,  and it's a very similar interface, a very similar experience.  My understanding is Jeff Hahn uses a different technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So he has nothing to do with Surface?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That is my understanding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I'd be mad.  That's weird that Microsoft would copy something somebody else did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You think it's telling that they released this announcement  right before the iPhone comes out, which also has similar touch features?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I don't think there was...  They do it after.  This is a minor publicity thing.  I don't think...  The iPhone is a juggernaut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think if they did it after, everybody would say,  oh, look, Microsoft's copying the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it's nothing like the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wouldn't mind having one.  It'd be great for playing Pac-Man.  Yeah.  So the idea is it's got...  There's no mouse.  You use your hands to move stuff around.  Use your hands.  You can use a brush.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They must put it all over the thing.  Tag the devices.  Well, what's interesting, it's a hard surface.  It's not a touch screen.  They basically use an array of five cameras underneath it,  basically facing the surface they project the screen onto.  And it registers the physical touch.  So that's why they can do multiple people touching and maneuvering stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Isn't there a company that already has this out commercially  that projects it onto the floor?  There's one over at the Metria.  Yeah, I saw that.  Isn't it the same thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but I've used this one, and unlike the one in the Metria,  which I've also used, this actually works  and has a fast enough feedback loop where you can do really cool stuff with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  When you're talking about you jump on bubbles and the fish move around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's like the webcam games.  You strap the webcam on the top of your PC and you play volleyball.  The one in the Metria is a lot like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, I just want to mention that for those of you who were concerned,  I've purchased a new exercise ball and I'm now sitting on it.  And it is it is anti-burst technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you got to have you have your webcam on?  No, because I don't believe you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't believe I'm sitting on a ball right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it doesn't make sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Actually, my exercise ball is in the next cube.  I can grab it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you sit on one at your desk?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The one I have is not tall enough for my current desk.  So I'm currently between the between.  Yeah, well, it's good for you.  It's basically good for your abs and should help with your lower back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess you weren't on the show when mine popped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, I wasn't.  A couple of episodes ago, I was sitting on it and it exploded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know if you guys should be talking about sitting on your balls.  No, just one ball.  Exercise.  I only have one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it popped.  You guys been following all the stuff going on at Computex?  No, what's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Computex?  It's a big show in Taiwan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Taipei.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So what's going on at Computex?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, they've got VIA unveiled their NanoBook, which is an extremely small modular PC.  Intel and Asus are doing a $199 EPC.  The Extreme and Bear Lake chipsets from Intel.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a lot of action.  This is the action packed show.  I was actually invited to go.  I was going to go and then I said, you know, it's just the agonizing trip to China.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what about these Intel chipsets?  They just announced Santa Rosa.  So what are the Extreme and what is the other one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The Extreme and Bear Lake.  So these are the three series chipsets.  So Bear Lake, which are now known as the three series, the G33 and the P35.  I guess they've actually been shipping since April.  Then there's the G35 and the X38.  And I believe it like a memory bus increase.  Where is it?  There's some I can't remember the specs because they're painful.  I can't remember 45 nanometer anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I'm seeing that they were going to announce a graphics chip, but that didn't happen.  A new graphics chip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, but there's going to be a cheap G-Force card.  What is it?  The sub $100 G-Force 8400 June 19th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think the interesting thing that came out of all that Intel stuff was the announcement  or the joint venture with that Asus for that $200 laptop because it caused all kinds of  consternation.  Negropony accused them of trying to ruin the world.  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because Nick has his $100 laptop?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, and he doesn't want to have anybody's upstage in my guess.  That's mine.  Then I got a whole bunch of press material from AMD like a couple days ago going on and  on about how this is somehow bad because of course AMD is in the Negropony machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the idea, Nick Negropony's idea was to help kids in underdeveloped nations with these.  It was, it's not a hundred bucks.  It ends up being more like 200 bucks.  The same price basically.  Yeah. Is this, is the Asus comparable?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Doesn't have the hand crank.  I mean, I think the whole key to that or the most interesting thing about the Negropony  machine is that it has one of those, you know, little white, I know they make it in Russia.  The little crank, you know, you get a bunch of juice out of it.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Any other, what other Computex announcements, Patrick, were hot, hot, hot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's pretty much all of it.  You know, there's some debate on whether or not graphics cards are going to get their  own power supply, like a separate power supply inside the, inside the case.  They're just getting bigger and bigger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pretty soon the motherboard will be dwarfed by the graphics card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  DDR3 is pricing is still missing in action.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do people still care about this stuff?  I know this is, this has always been your bread and butter, Patrick, but are computer  users still concerned about speeds and feeds or is it, are we kind of, kind of gotten beyond all that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I think there's always been a small percentage of folks that are extremely,  you know, it's like hot rotting.  You know, there's a whole lot of people that, you know, there's a whole lot of people that  own cars.  There's a relatively tiny subset that, that do, you know, performance modifications to  their vehicles.  Same thing with, with, with PCs, you know, but I think it's also for people that are  looking for the fastest machine out there, gamers, people that are working in video or  audio editing and stuff.  I'm just kind of like the whole idea of like DDR 1066, the DDR3 stuff.  It's just going to be interesting to see how that impacts performance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, I'm talking about interesting new products.  Kevin, you know, those guys who make that heart, the, the enclosure for the, what's  it called door, door, hey, I got a throw bow.  I, I had lunch with those guys today.  Oh yeah.  What'd you think?  I haven't hooked up the thing yet, but I know what they're doing.  And I mean, it's a really cool idea.  I think the price is a little high because for example, for the enclosure only, you don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  even get 499 or 499.  So just so people understand, this is a USB.  It's like it's raid like, but it's not right.  Enclosure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it's some, it's actually, you know, they, they have a really good pitch about this  because it looks like great fashion and funky and who cares.  But you know, the thing is they got to get the thing down to 99 and they got to go with  ethernet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, they are, I mean, they, they're going to, they're going to release ethernet and  eSATA later on this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But if you've got any assortment of SATA drives, it doesn't, it doesn't have that problem  where the smallest drive is kind of the default.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it basically creates a large virtual drive.  It's bomb proof.  I've yanked three separate drives out of it.  Yeah.  Well, it.  While it's running.  Yeah.  I mean, basically it, it does what it says it'll do.  The reason they went for the price point is because they're basically going for, you know,  professional photographers, people looking for large amounts of storage who are frustrated  with maintaining raid boxes.  I've been using it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's pretty cool.  I mean, it does work.  It gets the job done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think they have the right technology.  I think they just need to augment their pricing structure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You need to start with at least two drives.  You can put up to four drives in it.  You can mix and match any old SATA drives you've got lying around.  I think I have kind of a weird variety of them in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I think I've got a hammer from, you know, one of these new, and it's, it's network  attached, attached storage with a gigabit connection.  And I think it's only four 95 and it includes like a half a terabyte free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got a terabyte in front.  It was eight 99 or 800 from, from new egg.  And I, and that's a bit, and I use that all the time.  It's ready.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But if the drive fails, you have to swap it out with the exact same drive type.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's right five.  Yeah.  You would.  That's one thing's missing.  Yeah.  See, that's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The biggest thing I like about the Drobo is that fries has all these deals for like a 500 gigabyte  drive, 89 bucks or whatever it is.  All you have to do is every six months, just pull out the smallest drive, get the best one  from fries and you have this constant evolving, like beautiful little rate array in your room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And if you pull, if you pull out one drive, if you pull out a 500 and you put in some other one,  all the data stays there.  There's enough redundancy so you could pull any drive and don't lose anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's going to take some time to, to respan everything and rebuild the data.  I mean, the biggest thing about it is there's no rate administration.  Right.  It's, it's, you know, it's, you don't have to deal with rate administration, which is awesome.  Because it's pretty impressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I just plugged the drives in, turn it on, took about 20 minutes to go down.  All the lights go green and say, I'm ready.  Yeah.  I was, I was very impressed by it.  It looks cool too.  Yeah, it's cute.  It's a little now it's not a robot.  There's no robotics involved here, which is a little weird.  I mean, it's, it's not a data robot.  Yeah.  Anyway, they're good guys too.  I like them.  Are they?  You like them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  All right.  Well, they're fans.  I want to see how long it's going to hold up.  I've got one that's running and just going to keep it running until it pukes.  And so far it's been super stable, except when I yank a hard drive out of it on DLTV.  What happened then?  I put the hard drive back in and, you know, 23 hours later, it rebuilt everything.  We had it, we had it almost up to capacity.  It was pretty packed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm impressed with it.  I have to say it's cool.  It's expensive.  If they get the price down, you're right.  It's going to be, it's cool.  And if you have a lot of drives lying around, it's probably well worth it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, what price safe data?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, see, I, see, I use an SA, I use a NAS and I, and it has automatic backup  and it's always running and I think that's fine.  I mean, if one drive dies, I'd just put another, you know, it's got four or 500  or four two fifties in it and I just put another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You've had fewer problems with your ready NAS than I have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it's just sitting there.  You have an in front too?  Yeah.  Oh, it's been great.  It's just sitting there always working in the background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We've melted down three drives.  You've had to rebuild it once.  You have such bad luck with stuff.  This one, we just, we basically like, we've filled it to capacity twice  and had to cut back on it.  It's been, the hard drive has been a little, I think there may be a little,  our building's power supply is supposed to be pretty well massaged,  but I'm wondering if it was either one got heat got to it.  That was the, that was the bad one.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, another congratulations for our hundredth anniversary  from somebody you might know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  One million dollars.  What?  Where's my music?  How cheap is this thing?  This is Dr. Evil wishing Leo Laporte a happy, what?  Laporte.  Isn't that what I said?  Look, oh, very well.  This is Dr. Evil wishing Leo Laporte a happy 100th twit.  The following pseudo celebrity voice was impersonated.  Any likeness to the actual character portrayed by Mike Myers is completely intentional.  The voice actor as the set owner does not sue  and will offer a path of his cheese sandwich as compensation.  This is not Johnny Olson speaking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm glad they added the disclaimer automatically.  I wouldn't have to worry about it.  That's very nice of them.  We actually have a number of, a number of imitations.  I don't know.  We must have a lot of voice impersonators in the audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I thought I taught Twit's 100th episode.  I did.  I did see Twit's 100th episode.  Congratulations, Leo and the entire Twit gang.  Even that bad old cranky John DeVolek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was you, Leo.  None of these are me.  I promise you.  That's good, isn't it?  That was just scary.  I'm not going to lie to you.  No, you want scary?  This is even scary.  I'll do one more and we'll get back to the news.  Here's one more.  Hello, Dennis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Hello, everyone.  Welcome to the Twitiverse.  We wish to help you celebrate your independence from the oppression of the picture box.  Please feast upon fishes from foreign exotic lands on this your 100th episode.  We, the people of Milikarvin 9, come in peace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know what the hell that is.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to party with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just so bizarre.  We've got a little Drobo plug in there because they are nice guys.  They seem like very cool people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're probably a useful product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're smart in the way they've marketed this.  The first thing they did was put a YouTube video up.  They got a hold of Kevin somehow.  They got a hold of Kevin.  It's kind of a guerrilla marketing campaign.  Have you guys been getting...  I'm getting some sort of weird llama mail.  Have you guys been getting this?  The end is the beginning dot org.  I don't get any spam.  No, no.  This is snail mail.  It's some sort of campaign.  I don't know what it is.  It's involving two-headed llamas.  It comes to the Twit mailbox.  It looks like a card, but it just says one thing.  The end is the beginning dot org, and that's it.  If you go to the end is the beginning dot org, it's not clear what's going on.  The thing says, you are being manipulated.  Here, I'll play it for you.  You are being manipulated.  It says as the name of the page, the end is the beginning.  Oh, you know what?  Then it says 747.  This is a movie thing.  Land of the free and the home of the slave.  They hooked Leo.  Then the countdown, 25 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, 56 seconds.  What is that?  Then I got another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it's not an app buying themselves back from AOL?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  Maybe it is.  It's a kind of origami that you fold into the shape of a llama.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think they figured out that you'd give them a bunch of publicity, Leo, and that's why they sent you the stuff.  Sounds like a Zune ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You guys haven't gotten any of this.  I know, I know.  I'm a sucker for this stuff.  What about, now this I want to see on Dignation.  Powdered vodka.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Don't you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Some Dutch students have developed powdered alcohol, which they say can be sold legally to minors.  Oh, that's good.  Yeah, you two guys can spoon it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's called Booze to Go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can get it in 20 gram packets.  Costs about a buck to two bucks.  You add water.  You get a bubbly lime colored flavored drink with 3% alcohol.  So you'd have to drink a little bit extra.  I want you to try this on Dignation.  Give me some packets.  I'll give it a shot.  They're done, those guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They'll do it in a minute.  That sounds like hangovers.  Mix it with your beer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Who's going to actually, people are going to juice it like Pop Rocks.  They're not even going to bother to mix it with water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why add water? Just eat it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That would be the way to go with the next generation is to make them like Pop Rocks so they explode in your mouth.  Carbonate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This was actually a final year project at the Helicon Vocational Institute.  In what country are we talking about, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Amsterdam, baby. Holland.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Holland, yeah.  And do anything in Holland, it's all legal.  It's unbelievable.  Actually it's funny because I think really the Dutch are very conservative, staid people.  But they know, they don't smoke a lot of pot, but they know that if they have legalized marijuana, that they'll get a lot of tourists.  It's a profit thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually they have a big conference of drug tourist industry.  Conference like anything else.  Some of these other countries are starting to think about having free drug areas like even Germany.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In Germany they've got Alcopops, sweet drinks containing alcohol and in powder form.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know, I think slot machines are a much more evil force against humanity.  I think you're probably right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dignation's going strong and it's a great show, great watch.  You're going to do your next one live from an Apple store or a singular store?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so. We're going to figure it out.  Probably the Apple store down in Palo Alto.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can everybody come and hang out with you on June 29th?  Yeah, why not?  Apple store in Palo Alto, we've got a date with Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Go to that Apple store so we can go to all the other Apple stores in the Bay Area.  Come out and hang out.  I'll come out, but we need to bribe it. We need to pay an intern.  We need to pay an intern to sit out there and save us a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We actually have a barbecue coming. We're going to get some massage tables out there.  Oh no, I'm going to be at my cousin's wedding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm going to be in Vail, Colorado.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a twit day so maybe I can just get you on the phone for that twit.  That'll be episode 104.  You should come out, Leo. Why not?  Maybe I'll come down for it.  I've always wanted to do a joint twit nation.  That'd be cool.  Bring your sleeping bag.  DIT nation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, what's up? This is Brandon.  And this is Jared.  From KidKast.tv  And we would like to extend a congratulations to This Week in Tech on their first 100 episodes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's another celebrity voice in person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Hello, this is a reasonable facsimile of Robin Lee.  No, it's not. Go away.  Go away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ouch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Why am I shouting?  Why am I shouting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Alright, let's be nice.  No, it's very nice to be able to do this.  We're doing this to congratulate us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're very grateful.  As long as we're thanking people, of course, we should really thank all of the people who listen to this show for the last 100 episodes.  And there are sometimes some of the episodes that I think they really deserve thanks for listening to.  Anyway, we're very glad. We couldn't do it without you.  Especially those of you who've donated, whether it's $2 a month or $20 a year or $100 or $1000.  You've been very generous.  It's your donations that have kept the show alive for 100 episodes.  And I hope 100 more. Thank you so much.  By the way, I want to mention and thank a guy named Bill Panagoulis.  He's the founder and CEO of a company called Discreet FX.  And he's very kindly offered to do a matching fund for donations for this week.  So he's offered $500 in matching funds for anybody who has not been a subscriber up to now.  And if you've been tempted to subscribe, you know the podcast is free.  But if you want to support Twit, go to twit.tv.  You could do $2 a month, $5 a month, or $10 a month or any arbitrary amount.  But I'll tell you what we'll do. Bill is offered to match any subscription.  So if you subscribe for any amount, monthly amount, he will match it up to $500.  So it's very kind of him.  And a good incentive for you to contribute to supporting Twit on this 100th anniversary.  Bill has produced a movie and it actually looks very cool called Oil Change.  There's a killer in your food. You can find out more about it at oilchangemovie.com.  I guess it's about trans fats.  And they do, they're actually a neat company.  They use the Final Cut Studio, but new tech stuff like TriCaster and Video Toaster and Speeded too.  So that's very cool. Thank you Bill for your support.  Thanks to all of you for your support. We couldn't do Twit without you.  Oh, by the way, one more reminder.  One more reminder, if you want to read a book, listen to a book being read to you.  It's just like your mother holding you in her lap, nodding you to sleep.  You can get your free book right now at audible.com slash Twit.  And our pick of the week is On Intelligence. Really interesting read from Jeff Hawkins.  And the guy who reads it, Stefan Rudnicki, sounds just like Spock. So that's kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you get a 14 day free trial and is that what it is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you get a free book. I think you get one free book.  But you don't have to sign up for anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It says one audio download.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's pretty cool.  It's been a great 100 episodes. I can't believe it's been 100 episodes.  Here's to 100 more. John C. Dvorak dot org slash blog.  That's going strong. Anything else you want to plug, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, that's all I need to plug.  Confessions of an economic hitman.  I want to congratulate you for doing this for 100 episodes.  I feel like I'm 100 years old.  Hopefully it will continue.  I was hoping to be a livelier show with a gimmick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a gimmick? What do you mean? I had Robin Leach on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a gimmick. Listen. This is big stuff. I've got big names.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey Leo and the gang. Doing a great job. I've been with you since Znet.  I've learned to do a lot of dangerous things on the computer.  And so have my kids. Hope you're around for another 100 episodes.  Congratulations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I particularly love this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who's that lady in the background?  It's kind of disappointing that we don't have any actual real celebrities that called in.  We had Dries, the creator of Drupal.  Well, yeah, I guess he's kind of... Well, he's one.  I need to get a hold of him.  But I'm talking about celebrity celebrities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was hoping that Sandra Bullock would call her somebody, but I guess she doesn't listen to Twitter.  What can I say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Real celebrities are out doing real celebrity stuff.  How about the women? Not one woman called in to congratulate.  What kind of audience do we have out there?  Obviously just a bunch of guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. As a matter of fact, the last survey we did, it's 96% male.  Really? My blog's 95.  Is it really?  Yeah.  I wonder we're not getting laid.  I have to edit that out.  What was that?  I don't think that's Dries.  I'm sorry. I've got to edit that out right there.  I don't think that's Dries.  What else? No. I know. I was going to ask you about Pod Show.  Anything new on that Pod Show front?  No, I'm still working away at it.  Good. Keep us up to date.  And I'll keep you apprised.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Keep us apprised.  Actually, there'll be something on my blog this weekend. I'm putting out some plea.  Plea.  If you go to the dvorak.org slash blog website, you'll find more information.  All you need to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kevin Rose, System is back at revision3.org. I love it that Patrick was on one. That's fantastic.  Thanks to Patrick Norton, yes.  And everything else going good and dig.com and all that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good. Thank you very much for being here.  Patrick Norton is on TV every twice a week on dl.tv.  And I'm so excited. You're coming up next week to Vancouver to be on The Lab.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Coming up Thursday, taping on Friday.  They didn't want me to do the painting the Macbook thing that I did on dl.tv, but we've got some other good stuff coming up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I can't wait. Either Steve or I think Dicty Bartolo maybe.  But some old timers from the screensavers will be there.  I miss Dick. I haven't talked to that guy in a long time.  He's great. Well, you know, we do a podcast every day.  That's awesome. Tell him I set a foot up.  I will. Yeah, he's so much fun. And I can't believe it.  I mean, he comes up with five gadgets a week and they're wacky.  They're just really great stuff.  Thank you, everybody. Our hundredth twit is in the can.
