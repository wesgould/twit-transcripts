Failed to align segment (" So Amazon got in a big fight with the state of California last year because of course Amazon doesn't collect sales tax. Now I should point this out. Some people say doesn't charge sales tax. They don't collect it. You still owe sales tax on all purchases in California and most states. Yes. You owe what's called a use tax. You're supposed to April 15th tell California how much you spent. Right. And apparently nobody's everyone's always spent nothing. That's amazing. And I don't know.

Transcript:  it I tried out Windows 8 on another one of my Windows laptops and I didn't love  it and I don't think that it's going to go over too very well in the enterprise  it's a little bit fluffy and a little bit distracting and I think that's where  Microsoft really they need to get people on board and I think the enterprise is  gonna wait for Windows 9 and maybe that'll be a little bit more pared down  a little less ooh look at our flashy tiles and all this great design and maybe a  little more business-friendly what is stimulating this move though towards

End time: 504.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  get excited I didn't I never get excited about anything you should know better  no and I don't I don't really care about the surface I think it's going to do  fine but they're not planning on selling very many just a couple million a few

Start time: 504.76
End time: 514.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  million really this is not a big part of their business going forward so what is  it a reference design to inspire the OEMs why are they doing it why would you

Start time: 514.46
End time: 572.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  something I'm going to explain why they're doing to me Microsoft has a  long-term strategy based on the Apple stores they've got 26 stores now they're  gonna eventually roll out the apples got over 300 they're gonna eventually roll  out store after store after store people have to realize that the Apple store  makes more money per square foot than any retailer including Tiffany's in  history 473 and Microsoft has noticed this and they're basically copying the  stores per se they're gonna roll out a tablet they're gonna roll out a branded  computer they're gonna roll out Microsoft this and Microsoft that and it has to be  high design that's the reason the surface is over designed and they're  gonna move stuff through the store because they had and they got the Xbox  the next Xbox they've got a bunch of things they can sell in those stores and  they're gonna and they're going retail big and that's what the real back  backroom strategy is and you'll see it probably roll out in the next four or  five years completely and people finally realize what happened and the reason that  the surface came out and why it is designed the way it is because it's  designed to be shown to somebody in fact they have said we will not sell this

Start time: 572.78
End time: 584.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  and I thought it was to protect OEMs like Lenovo and Dell and Samsung and HP  they've said we will not sell this in retail we'll only sell it at Microsoft  stores at our own retail yeah this is to drive people to the beginning of the

Start time: 588.14
End time: 590.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Microsoft they look just like Apple stores no they look much more beautiful

Start time: 590.88
End time: 598.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and colorful I think and I think if you look at the Microsoft retail stores you  can see what their vision is for retail and it's absolutely gorgeous but I

Start time: 637.60
End time: 651.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  insightful and have a long view and sometimes you're right sometimes. Twice.  Yeah but here's the thing like I've just been thinking about this this week  Microsoft is a software company like let's not forget that is isn't that

Start time: 651.48
End time: 659.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  always. Oh no that's a long one. You know why? The Xbox 360 is not a software. True that's true that's the one exception. I'm gonna tell you exactly why. Now we have surface.

Start time: 659.68
End time: 696.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The lines have crossed so there was a there there's a good graph and I think  it was on the Asimco blog where they show profits from hardware and software  John said this all the time whose wallet would you rather have Bill Gates or  Steve Jobs and for a long time Bill Gates and software were making lots more  money than hardware that line crossed last year Apple is now more profitable  than Microsoft. Hardware no you know so hard that the Asimco blog asserts and I  think this is a good way of putting it that the days of expensive software on  cheap hardware are over that the future is cheap software on expensive hardware.

Start time: 696.18
End time: 730.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Totally agree with you. Totally agree with you and the thing is though and sorry  Julie I'm just keep thinking about this and tell me if I'm wrong is okay  Amazon's making hardware so they can sell you stuff or books or media. And Google.  No Google is trying to sell you advertising.  Microsoft is not sure what it's trying to sell you and Apple is trying to sell  you hardware and so fundamentally I think Microsoft is confused but Amazon is  Amazon is well poised to sell you stuff. You're seeing Microsoft instead of being active they're

Start time: 730.56
End time: 750.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  being reactive instead of being proactive. And this is new? And what they've always done this and  what they're is this Apple jealousy they're saying Apple's doing so well  with the stores we got to have stores. Apple's doing so with hardware we got to have hardware.  That's not focus. You know I have to say and don't tell Paul throughout I said this but I think this is the  and please don't tell Jolie O'Dell I said this but I think this is the worst run company since RIM.

Start time: 752.75
End time: 767.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That isn't true at all. If they're running it so badly then how come they're still making so much  money how come normal people outside of Silicon Valley are running windows on their PCs they're  not running around with you know expensive Macs and 27 inch monitors.

Start time: 767.52
End time: 771.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's pure inertia and then the trend is not their friend and this is why Microsoft's panicking.

Start time: 771.68
End time: 794.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well that's why they are getting ahead and their panic if there is panic it's a good thing because  it's making them better designers and it's making them more innovative in the software and hardware  and I think that those two things are just getting fused back in the day when I started with computers  you could put any software you wanted to on your hardware and today I don't think the average  consumer sees those two things as things that you can split apart it's like your soul and your

Start time: 794.76
End time: 798.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  body they go together. Alan Kay always said you want to make great software you got to make the

Start time: 798.48
End time: 817.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  hardware. Well now and then Google was a software company once upon a time and then they are getting  so far in bed with hardware that they now make this Nexus Q device that's their first branded  hardware and oh my lord have you seen it? It's not their first. It's pretty bad. Well yeah it's weird. I have one at my house and I can't figure out what the heck to do with it.  There's no point. I've got one sitting around. We could play cricket. We could play cricket with it.

Start time: 818.56
End time: 828.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or make a dog toy. Or a croquet ball. Can I just circle back from what Julie was saying and what you were saying?  So you're saying they want to go into retail but do you think that's good bad long-term cohesive or do you think it's a fan of that?

Start time: 828.48
End time: 863.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I have been a huge fan of the retail concept that was essentially developed and perfected by the car manufacturers since the days that they had a dealership.  Aren't those all franchises though? They're not owned. No it's a combination. It's like McDonald's used to be.  But yeah even so. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. The point is that you control the sales pitch and the problem with CompUSA and computer  the problem was that when computer land got so big it screwed things up. Started with the bite shop. Went to computer land. Then we went to...  Look at Best Buy. What's happening to Best Buy? They're dying. They're dying. Because they don't... there's just a mess in there.

Start time: 864.04
End time: 867.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But when you went to CompUSA... No because everybody's buying on Amazon and I'm going to tell you story number two why.

Start time: 868.24
End time: 875.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Okay well they might be buying on Amazon but you can't deny that the Apple store they're buying there a lot. Oh huge. So they're going to...

Start time: 875.32
End time: 883.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it's the exception that proves the rule isn't it? Well quick sidebar have you seen the new Samsung stores? Definitely with that one.

Start time: 883.86
End time: 910.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well isn't it? I mean seriously I mean yes Apple's doing well everybody else is doing poorly. Does that mean retail is on the upswing or the downswing?  Here's the... let me get back to the point. And the reason Apple did this is because you had to be able to see Apple hardware because nobody was showing it.  You go to Best Buy and it'd be a dusty thing. So they have a little Apple segment. They do and it's crap.  Okay. And so Apple said and I know this is what happened Steve Jobs said no the only way we're ever going to sell is by having our own retail where we can highlight our products in an appropriate way.

Start time: 910.74
End time: 917.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the right motivation. Microsoft's motivation is the wrong motivation. Best Buy feels like Ross Dress for Less compared to the Apple store.

Start time: 917.44
End time: 936.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  The reason you want these stores is so you can control the sales pitch. That's the only reason. I agree.  You guy comes in you got everybody trained to sell one thing. Your products. You go to CompUSA. Whoever's buying who's abribing you the most.  The spiff you get from this guy. Ah buy this. Everyone says it's junk. No no no it's great. I agree.

Start time: 937.26
End time: 951.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I also think you're right and I think people don't trust the employees as much for their knowledge in those bigger super stores electronic super stores as they do in an Apple store.  They feel like Apple's attention to detail on product is transferring to the employees who are going to help you.

Start time: 951.46
End time: 956.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  When's the last time you've been you guys all must agree with this you go in an Apple store it's chaotic because it's so popular.

Start time: 956.92
End time: 981.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah I see a lot of guys standing around doing nothing too. I can't remember the last time I went in one because you know I don't I don't use their products.  You should just go to Sloan. No I went when Mr. Jobs passed I went to an Apple store to be a reporter and you know man on the street type interviews.  It's not going to be as chaotic. Oh it was absolutely mobbed. It was mobbed but then it always is every time you walk by and you know downtown or Palo Alto.  It's all these people with their sticky fingers touching things and I just hate it.

Start time: 982.64
End time: 998.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So that way let's take a look at that this media poorly run company that you just brought up seventy three billion dollars in revenue last year.  You're talking Microsoft. Gross profit fifty four billion from seventy three in sales inertia total cash fifty eight billion.

Start time: 998.76
End time: 1006.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah but it's going down and I got to tell you it's not going down. I can give you data point after data point of you are just part of the propaganda machine that is trying.

Start time: 1006.72
End time: 1020.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's true and you know what it does not matter what any PR machine says about anything the money will talk and the money will continue to talk.  And I do not think it's correct to say that their profits are going down. In fact as I recall they had a record quarter last time I covered their earnings.

Start time: 1020.42
End time: 1024.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They did. Now that's they're going down relative to Apple is what I'm saying. Apple just happens to be blooming.

Start time: 1025.26
End time: 1038.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Now let's take a look at the hit piece done in Vanity Fair just came out on Bomer. Six point five billion dollars right down for quantitative total.  Yeah that was a blunder was a complete idiotic move. That's a six point five billion dollars blunder.

Start time: 1038.96
End time: 1063.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The fact that it's just. I'll give you more. No I got data points galore. You announce a Windows Phone 8 while you're still trying to sell Windows Phone 7.  Idiot. And you tell people no upgrade for you. That's because they're making money hand over fist. They can afford to make all these blunders.  Well at this. OK. At some point. That's what I'm saying. They are making money hand over fist. It's inertia.  At some point mismanagement is going to kill this company. Maybe they'll survive just like IBM out of inertia.

Start time: 1063.40
End time: 1072.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they are poorly managed right now. That's the only point I'm making. It does seem. What about the fact that they continue and they're making more and more beautifully designed products that consumers are getting excited about.

Start time: 1072.08
End time: 1100.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What's the screen resolution on the surface. We don't know. When's the surface available. Wait a minute. Somebody cares. When's the surface available. When's the surface available. We don't know.  What's the price of the surface. We don't know. Has anybody held a surface. No. This is a made up product that has no real existence and you're going crazy over it.  I'm not saying the surface. I'm saying Windows 8 and Windows Phone. Windows 8 will be vastly rejected by the marketplace. Watch mark my words. You've said it yourself. I have said this from the get go.

Start time: 1101.18
End time: 1226.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So what is what is Microsoft doing so right. Apparently making lots of money. I think they have inertia inertia. There's a lot of it's tick tock. So they keep coming back.  We'll see when they have one really bad quarter than I'm. Well you can't really short him because the stock has been dead money for a decade. I think the stock market knows that they're really that this is not.  They're like you. They all they all see it the way you see it which is like these guys are idiots. But meanwhile they keep making more and more money. They get no credit for it. They got no charisma.  Balmer's getting hit. I'm telling you. You got to look at this vanity fair piece. They brought out stack ranking which is one of the worst possible management. Microsoft's defense on this is we're not the only company doing it.  You know what you say. What is that right. Stack ranking and it's done by is done. In fact I put a call out for people who and I'm going to put it out again right here on the show. Anyone whose company does stack or forced ranking which is a technique used by HR departments.  Please get a hold of me. The easiest way to describe this is survivor. Only yeah you get voted off the island. You get voted no matter how good you are. If you're the lowest ranking performance employee that's it. I'm under the impression and somebody's going to have to correct this that he bold when he came in as the CEO at Microsoft in the late 90s brought it over from Procter and Gamble and Balmer was very amenable to it because he's the next Procter and Gamble guy. Apparently they did it there. They've done it at General Electric. It was popularized by  Jack Welch who brought it up at General Electric and took credit. They gave credit to forced ranking which also said I want to fire 10 percent of the entire company every year which he did for a decade meaning he turned over the entire company probably getting rid of a lot of good people in the process. It was dropped immediately after Welch got kicked out and Welch by the way gives stacked ranking credit for GE's big growth spurt during the Reagan administration when the economy had turned around and it was and he was a defense contractor.  Anybody would have made money. So I mean the whole thing is a huge scam and it's ruining American business and the reason we're in a depression is because of it.

Transcript:  So you just keep proving my point John. You keep coming up with things Microsoft's not doing very well. Now by the way one of the complaints about the way Microsoft's doing stack ranking is that it doesn't seem to be metrics based. It seems to be politically based.

Transcript:  Stack ranking has made all the real talented people in Microsoft. They all either left they quit. And the way it works is that you get these low ratings and you're given a choice. We think you're going to have to improve. If you don't improve we're going to fire you.  But we'll give you an easy out. We'll give you some money if you quit.

Transcript:  I can take both sides of the same argument. I can't even tell which argument you guys are on. You said this for years. But Microsoft really needs to be divided up. They are multiple companies. Four companies. And that's the real problem. They can never succeed as long as they're warring within each other.  They need to have an Xbox entertainment media company. They need to have a desktop operating systems company. Enterprise company. Enterprise middleware company. I mean they have good products in all these categories.  By the way an interesting thing. We had a great interview which if you haven't seen it on triangulation on Wednesday with Nolan Bushnell founder of Atari. A guy who pays close attention to the gaming business as you might imagine.  Who he says you know the consoles are tapped out. You're not going to see even though Microsoft has announced it's doing an Xbox whatever 720 next year. He said you got as far as you can go with consoles.  Yeah I think a lot of people a lot of interesting point of view. And if that's true that's bad news for Microsoft as well. That's a big part of their revenue.

It may not serve the type of people who always want to write about tech and be on the cutting edge but the numbers are there. It's a fire hose. I love it. And change your password. Yeah. How many passwords 450000 a million on Fandroid. Where else did we see a big breach this week. Bunch. There were a bunch.

Transcript:  450000 passwords. It just goes on and on. Back to Sony a year ago. I know. To change your password as soon as you hear of a breach. On every. Should be using something like one password to manage your passwords like an adult. And do not. Only adults use one pass.  Never. And probably the kids do better. And then don't use the same password on a bunch of sites because if one site gets hacked. That's. Unless you don't care. Well I have tears. I have high security mid security low security password. Brother. I have a system John. And then I use. You know. Password stacking which is Steve's password stacking the. The symbol stack. Oh yeah that's good. Yeah. Yeah. Hey stacks. Yeah. He's password. Hey stacks. So actually this is a good technique. So you have a password for a site whatever it is. And then you pass.  And then you pad it because it turns out length is very critical in the ability to brute force password. And your pad could be standardized. You could it could be a zip code interspersed with commas or all those symbols are best symbols are very good. Yeah. Yeah. Numbers not as good because the variables are less. They're fewer. Yeah. So the best is like a like percent sign dollar sign a b 3 right. Right. Bracket. So. And that's a good example of Yahoo. So I took Steve's research on hey hey.

Transcript:  So Farhad Manju writing his slate. I know I love it. On Wednesday talks about the Amazon's new strategy which I think I think that he's got it right on John. Let me see if this is what you think. So yeah same. This is what's going to happen.  I think I do too. Yeah. I do. Yeah. Yeah. Because I'm an honest person. You are. But most people apparently California's loses billions they think they think they don't know. So last year they passed a bill Jerry Brown signed into law saying oh guess what Yahoo you'll pay you'll collect. See I did it. It's not that Yahoo's or Amazon's paying taxes. They're merely collecting our tax from us. But the brick and mortar retailers have long felt this is an unfair. And they're the ones behind this. They're the ones who harassed us.  The state you guys it's unfair to us. So guess what. Big mistake unintended consequence here. So Amazon made a deal with the state of California. All right. We're going to not collect sales tax for another year. But in a year we will. And meanwhile there's they're making they're making lemon out of this lemonade or is it lemonade out of this lemon. Yeah the latter. They're making slutty brownies out of this lemon because they are.  And they're saying well if we're going to be doing business in a state and have to collect sales tax we might as well do business in the state and they are building distribution centers and all the major metros. And guess what. Amazon's going to start next day and sometimes same day delivery for Amazon customers. Right.

Transcript:  And which I mean if you I'm sure the prime people you'll be getting some amazing. Yeah. So now instead of having to go to Wal-Mart. This is the point I did it this weekend. Birthday party. I got to have a birthday present destroy Wal-Mart. That's your target. They're the big jerks that made this happen. Okay by me. Okay by me.

Start time: 1937.58
End time: 2004.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What apparently has the realization that Amazon has made is that no maybe it's not the fact that we don't charge sales tax that people cause people to use us. It's the fact that we're convenient. And if we could only get in is better selections better the prices are good and we're convenient. If you could get to deliver.  What is the advantage brick and mortar has. I get it now. I go there I pick it up but I have to get my car. I have to drive to Wal-Mart. I have to shop. What if I could get it.  You know soon sans pants sans pants. And so by putting these distribution centers in urban metros they're already doing this by the way. I don't know if Farhad pointed this out and it's happened to me maybe it's happened to you. I'm a prime guy. I'm getting stuff next day just just because it just shows up.  Half the time. Yeah. All of a sudden it's starting to arrive right away. Is there a distribution center around here. Yeah. There's one in Hayward and then the big one in Nevada. It's a no tax state. So again what they do is they want to be in brick and mortar. They want to have a physical presence in states that don't charge sales tax. Actually Nevada does charge sales tax. I'm not sure what the deal is. No it's they don't. There's an inventory tax and all this other kind of stuff. So there's some big ones are in Arizona. That's the big big one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All these big ones are there. I've been to those they have six in Phoenix. Probably because it's near a hub for FedEx or UPS. Yeah I mean they are 50 football fields. Huge. And can I ask one question about this. What concessions are they trying to get from the states. No they've given up. They've given up. They've given up. They've said all right maybe it isn't that we are nine percent cheaper in California because that's our sales tax rate. Eight point seven five percent. Maybe it's convenience. If we could make it more convenient.

Start time: 2037.50
End time: 2067.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  If we could offer better selection but make it more convenient would we compete favorably against brick and mortar. And I think the answer is absolutely. An inventory. It's total inventory and certainty of it being there without having to call. So Farhat says what if I could say in the morning order a laptop in my office. In the morning. Pay five bucks and have it when I get home at my house. Isn't that better than going getting in the car driving down to a retailer and buying it. Yeah especially if you ever take a look at that web page about the horrible nightmarish people that shopped

That was the natural result of and how was Leo would walk walk and then yank him up. Yeah. It's kind of like a 70 year old with her prom dress. So now my entire staff. Yeah. Says that by the way this is the conversation I had with Ross Levinson.  First time I met him. Who. Ross Levinson from Yahoo. I'm talking about something. Levinson has this problem.

Transcript:  I do not think this Amazon strategy was a short term or just a realization and that goes back to the acquisition of systems. Kiva. You're right. Because you're on top of that. You're absolutely. What is Kiva. So Kiva is a robotics picking program or system whereby they can increase the speed of the pick. So the way these warehouses work is that you've got bins on high high shelves and all these bins are RFID or they're barcoded and people go through with big.  Sleds and they pick based on orders that come in. So what Kiva systems does is they input orders and it's almost like the traveling salesman algorithm. You remember this where you would try and figure out what the fastest route was as you went and made all your calls. These little robots are.

Start time: 2232.42

We're watching these systems at work. My gut instinct is. They're like little Roombas underneath giant pallets. Christ that's creepy looking isn't it. So this is how an Amazon warehouse works. Not the ones that I've seen because they aren't like this and I bet they don't have robotics and people working side by side. These new ones are supposed to be loaded with this stuff. Right. And so this is it's called picking. Picking.

Start time: 2262.16
End time: 2292.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Picking is what takes so much time because the people have to go pick the bins. Pick from the bins. Right. And so it also costs money because humans are expensive. This is a zap. Right. And it has a lot of margin of error. Yeah. Because you think you're picking the blue smalls but actually you pick the turquoise mediums. So these robots never make a mistake. Oh that's not necessarily true but I think it loads of batch wrong. Yeah. Same thing. But you're right. Get humans out of the loop. You're probably going to.

My wife is the same way. She refuses to even step foot into a Walmart. I have mixed feelings. She says I refuse to step foot into this Walmart.

Everybody if you're a you're a freelancer sometimes.  And so the real thing was a pain for me. I don't do it anymore because I have a company and I have people but they pain for me for years right after tech TV for about five years when I was basically freelancing was I always had an invoice in each month and it was just like I don't want to do this.  I would put it off. It was painful. Then Amber in 2004 Amber MacArthur told me about fresh books dot com changed my world and I'm not alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You should be spending your time innovating your company. Yeah. So if you go to fresh books dot com you can find out about this. The whole idea is you you use online invoicing makes it very simple.  If you do time and hours it's great because they have an iPhone app or a web app that will keep track of the time and hours and then put it right in the invoice. But the most important thing fresh books does it makes it easy to get paid.  And you know I think a lot of times your clients it's not that they don't want to pay you. It's just it should be if they don't pay the pay part is the same as you. It's the same P.I.T.A. as invoicing.  So collection is much faster much easier. You don't have to worry about manual payment entry. The whole thing happens automatically. You get paid fast with online payments at fresh books dot com.  The invoice follow up if you don't get paid is great. They can automatically every 30 60 90 days whatever set it up so that automatically tickles them or whatever cattle prods them.  The invoicing is very very nice looking very professional. You can set up and I like this recurring invoicing plus recurring payments. So if your client is up for it this could be completely friction free.  And this is why I used it because I was invoicing in the U.S. and Canada and they actually do current almost every country in on the world they do their currency.  So it makes it so much easier to invoice in currency international currencies you build across borders as easy as can be.  And there are a few clients fewer and fewer but there are a few clients who still want those printed invoices for a fee small fee a dollar thirty nine invoice fresh books will print mail them to your clients complete with a return envelope.  So again payment is easy. I want you to try it just visit fresh books dot com. They've got a really nice trial offer 30 days of unlimited use everything that works as many clients as you can.  As many as you want as many pays as you want. If you're a small business owner owner this is absolutely fantastic.  And by the way your accountant will love you at the end of the year because taxes are so much easier with fresh books fresh books dot com billing made painless.

Start time: 3104.53
End time: 3125.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah.  I would recommend people read,  even though Wikipedia's got mixed reviews,  the Wikipedia article on DIG  showing all the little mistakes they made  and everything they did.  It was a classic example of a company  having a vision and then deciding to listen  to whatever the users told them to do  and then doing it.  Oh, it was the users' fault.  I believe it was the users' fault.

Start time: 3126.60
End time: 3131.88

Start time: 3133.10
End time: 3159.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The users, the power users,  the ones who manipulated DIG for their own advantage.  Those were the wrong users.  Well, those users were the only thing  that made DIG worthwhile.  The only reason DIG was worth anything  is because it channeled this huge fire hose  of viewers and eyeballs to the websites  that displayed advertising and that made money.  So it was a very effed up model  for doing business in the first place.  I don't think DIG ever turned a profit on its own.  How is that different from Twitter,

Start time: 3160.63
End time: 3163.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  which in theory will make money on our work?  It's not different.

Start time: 3163.70
End time: 3179.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Same thing's going to happen.  It's not different.  Or Facebook, which in theory makes money on our work.  No, it's quite different from Facebook  because Facebook keeps you on the site  and keeps you looking at their advertising.  The purpose of DIG was never to do that.  So it was flawed as a business idea  from the beginning.  Now, those power users,  Now, in defense of Kevin Rose,

Transcript:  So, no.  The, in perfect defense of Kevin,  his original idea I think was fine.  He did, execution was excellent.  I'm not sure what went wrong with DIG.  I think I could take some blame  because I was the one who told him  that he should do DIG 4  and I have a shirt to prove it.  Shame on you.  But I think that in every step of the way  they actually tried to do the right thing.  Now here's the interesting  and the kind of sad point.  There was,  and I've heard this from a number of inside sources,  at one point Google was going to buy it  for $200 million.

It was during a twit,  maybe one of the first few dozen,  Kevin said,  because he'd already started DIG,  he said,  Calacanis has offered me a million bucks for it.  And he was agonizing  over whether he should take it.  And it turned out it wasn't a very good offer.  It was mostly stock.  And so he decided not to take it.  Probably right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  let me give you the story.  Yeah.  If the yardstick of success  is making money for the founders,  employees, and the investors,  then DIG will go down in the annals  of web history as a colossal failure.  Absolutely, big loss for everybody,  including those people who lost their jobs.  However, if your yardstick of success  is defined by a company or a product  being a change agent  and an instigator,  DIG was a smashing success.  That's all I'm trying to say.  Reddit has been a smashing success.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  When you go to Reddit,  there's a definite sense  of a real community there.  Yeah?  The Digg community,  well, I guess there was a community there.  There was a very strong community there.  But it seemed like they were all about gaming it.  Yes.  Now, maybe Chad should answer this.  How come Reddit doesn't have  the gaming problem that Digg did?  That was clearly a big problem.  They must have some really

Start time: 3618.49

Start time: 3635.58
End time: 3653.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  But also the sense of community  in person seems to exist  bigger on Reddit,  where a comment that's  posted on a story  can be sometimes better  than the actual story.  Right.  The comments are what's great.  Right, exactly.  And I never saw that on Digg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  he created an audience.  I mean, Digg really was a Kevin Rose joint.  Yeah.  And...  Cult of personality.  And the cult of personality,  because he went to G4,  became that audience.  Which is not the audience you want.  And one of the reasons  we kind of downplayed a little bit,  I never did anything with Digg,  we went to G4,  we kind of did...  most of the G4 people...  I did not want that community to find us.

Transcript:  about this article.  So it's a Wikipedia issue, actually.  So if you go to Wikipedia,  in theory it's an encyclopedia  of all information,  but as you probably know,  editors get to vote  on what's an appropriate article.  At Wikimania this year,  Jimmy Wales is talking,  and he says...  Going on right now?  Pardon me?  Going on right now?  Yeah, going on right now.  He says that there is a problem.  The community basically is male-dominated,  geek-colored glasses.  And so he gave us an example.  We have over 100 articles  on every Linux distribution,  many of them very obscure,  and they're all there.  But the day of the royal wedding,  a Wikipedia article about  Kate Middleton's dress,  which I would argue  is probably something  that should be in an encyclopedia like this.  Oh, I don't know.  Well, this like this.  There's everything in this thing,

Start time: 4314.08

There are a ton of articles  on Wikipedia about corsetry.  Yeah, because you know why.  Bunch of guys.  I know, right?  So anyways, but the point is...  That's why.  No, the point is...  No, I don't think that's why.  I think it's sexist.  I don't think that's why.

Transcript:  Okay, so because people don't care  about one person's wedding dress,  it's sexist,  because women are supposed to care  about Kate Middleton's wedding dress.  Now that's sexist, sir.

Transcript:  One of the guys who said  it should be deleted made this point.  I really see this idea  that keeping this article  does something to remedy  the gender imbalance here  to be facile at best  and insulting at worst.  That's what you should be saying.

Start time: 4365.88
End time: 4378.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because not all women are girly  and not all women care  about girly things.  And I think when you have  a 50-50 gender split,  you could still argue  a lot that Kate Middleton's  wedding dress in itself  doesn't deserve its own Wikipedia article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think the geek world  has just historically  been hostile to women  because women have often  been hostile to geeks,  and that's a huge generalization.  But if you want to go back  to the 1950s in the lab,  and MIT, why weren't women there?

And the concept of  stereotype threat is that,  and basically this research  shows that women are not taking  to science careers,  not taking to traditionally  technology-based either  social environments or careers  or studying, not so much  because of the old problem,  which was, well,

She's probably good at  balancing books.  So the whole concept  of stereotype threat is that  we think we're moving  to the next gen,  which is you don't have  to be a sexist,  which is you don't...  You guys right here  are two of the most fabulous men  that I have been around  because I don't...  It's a setup or something.  No, I'm...  I'm so rarely this earnest,  but you guys are amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And, John, same for you,  but the point is I felt it  and that's what  stereotype threat means,  is that women sometimes  are so nervous about  fitting the stereotype  of not being geeky,  not being sciency,  not being technical.  Oh, women do crazy things.

Start time: 4571.66
End time: 4603.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They overcompensate for that  and they will go crazy  in the opposite direction  and be as fugly as possible,  so you don't think  they're too pretty to be smart.  And I have talked to  so many female engineers  who have said things like,  you know, well,  they didn't feel  that they were discriminated  against in that male environment,  but they do put a lot of  pressure on themselves  and I think that,  you know, if there is  a stereotype bias that comes  from women,  that the women of merit  have to work very hard  to overcome their own  expectations of themselves,  negative expectations of themselves.  You know what I do like

Great name.  She dresses fantastically.  She is the exact antithesis  of what you would think of  as an engineer.  And when I met her,  I'm Petra Cross.  Petra Cross.  I'm just kind of  a little blind because  you know me.  I can't resist it.  It was not.  And then she says,  oh yeah,  my day job is I do Gmail.  What do you mean you do,  I write the code  that runs Gmail?  Oh,  and I just think  this is great.  And then there's people  like Colleen Kelly,  who was our chief engineer  here for many years,  who wears Army boots  and will beat the crap out of you.  And I just think it's good.  I think in a really,  truly meritocratic  environment where people  really care about what you think,  not what you look like,  you can be anything.  If you step up to the plate  and you do it.

Transcript:  So Apple,  which makes,  in fact, was one of the creators,  along with others in the consumer  electronics industry and the EPA,  created a certification called  the E-Pete certification  for recyclable and green stuff.  Apple has in the past  submitted most of its products.  Not all.  And we're not submitted  for E-Pete certification.  Last week, Apple said,  we are going to pull 39,  all remaining 39 products  of our product line from E-Pete.  We are not going to participate.  Maybe they didn't look.  I don't know.  But perhaps if they had looked,  they would have noticed  that the federal government  requires that 95% of all products  it buys are E-Pete certified.  So does Ford.  So does a lot of companies.  And so does, in fact,  the city of San Francisco,  which said we-

No, I agree.  And what she was saying was  Apple can afford not to care  because it's not a big market.  Well, maybe they do care.

I thought, like the iPhone and iPad,  it's unrecyclable.  It couldn't get EP-Certified.  And when you also have to be  repairable, too.

End time: 5087.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's not the iPhone and iPad,  but everything else.  That's a PR mistake.  Including the Retina display.  But I have to think,  I'm with John.  I don't think this is recyclable.  And I've talked to people  that Kyle Weems and I fix it,  who says,  you know,  when you glue this stuff together,  it might be technically recyclable.  It might be that,  yeah, if you had  the right heat gun,  you could get the glass  off the lithium wire  and you could separate.  He said,  but no recycler has the time  or the energy.  It's not practically recyclable.

He's like,  well, Apple recycles all  their own products  and we have a very aggressive  70% recycling goal  and we've been working  on environmental things  that EP doesn't even care about yet.  It's very passive aggressive  and they just really  don't give a crap about the EP.  That's what I think.

Transcript:  all of this.  Yeah.  Right?  Even if you're not trying  to monetize it,  it's really just nice to know.  By the way,  and you mentioned the pricing,  this is their new pricing.  It's very simple.  Basically, $8 or $16 a month.  It's a yearly plan.  You can go month to month  if you want.  It's a little bit more expensive  if you do that.  $8 gives you the basic,  but I think the best deal  is $16 for unlimited pages,  unlimited bandwidth,  unlimited storage.  For any annual plan,  they will hook you up  with your own custom domain,  beckywarley.com,  and do all the hookups.  That was surprisingly easy.  That saves you money.  That was what I thought  was going to be a cluster.  It was good.  That was good.  You had an existing site.  You had a different situation  where you were taking  an existing site, right?  No.

If you do decide to buy,  10% off your first purchase,  so if it's an annual plan  and it's a significant savings,  use the offer code TWIT7,  T-W-I-T-7,  when you buy.  And the next month  will be TWIT8.  Last month it was TWIT6.  The reason I mention that,  sometimes people listen  to the July show in August.  So if you do that,  use TWIT8.

It's such a one-trick pony right now.  Three hundred bucks.  I know.  And you know what, though, eventually it will be, I think, a Sonos  combined with a Roku.

Transcript:  You know, this is going to be our last story, story six.  And I think is the response to OK, so the FTC finds Google for this  privacy invasion.  This is minor compared to the fact  that the cell phone companies are selling your personal information to law  enforcement, right?  Selling it.  They are selling it.  Wait a minute, Jolie O'Dell.  I beg to differ.  AT&T has 100 full time employees.  They charge several dollars for each of these pen warrants.  Yes, they make a lot of money.  This is big business.

Start time: 6560.44
End time: 6567.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, we skip the lead.  So please, law enforcement agencies are  requesting at record rates cell phone data from the carriers.

Start time: 6568.20
End time: 6575.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One point three million more cell phone data than ever before.  And this is this is information that they're not requesting from other sources.

Start time: 6575.46
End time: 6591.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But but understand the backstory of this is these are warrantless searches.  So there are some things that if it's content, federal law requires a warrant.  But it's not your location.  The information about who you're sending email to, things like that,  are not deemed content.

Start time: 6591.74
End time: 6608.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the law enforcement state by state, because I know  the federal judge decided that cops without a warrant, all they were allowed  to take is your own phone number from your phone.  That was a whole case.  And it's still very much up for grabs.  Like, what does it mean that a cop can search your phone?  What kind of stuff can I get?

Start time: 6608.28
End time: 6610.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's not how it was when I was watching Law and Order.

Start time: 6611.52
End time: 6639.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I don't know if it's state by state.  This is being investigated at the national level.  Ed Markey has asked for reports from all the carriers responding to an article  in The New York Times in April upon about this increased use of cell phone  tracking and got letters from all of them with stunning information.  I mean, this is a huge amount.  AT&T response to 700 requests a day with about 230 of them, quote,  emergencies that do not require court orders or subpoenas.

Start time: 6639.64
End time: 6653.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's $1400 a day that they're making if they charge a buck or two.  I don't know how much they charge.  It is not an insignificant amount of money.  But it's not a profit center.  They're not making money. They're not running a racket.  Like that's, yeah, bottom line.

Start time: 6653.98
End time: 6663.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I disagree there as well, because, like I said, I think that, you know,  instead of coming and knocking on your door and asking your neighbors what  you're doing, this is how they're gathering information about people who may or may not

Start time: 6663.12
End time: 6666.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  knock on your door and shoot up the place and find out it's the wrong address.

Start time: 6666.14

Start time: 6669.44
End time: 6675.28

Transcript:  The real issue is, is it a phishing expedition or is this in pursuit of a  specific crime and a specific event?

Start time: 6675.32
End time: 6696.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's efficient police work because if you look at Oakland or fishing  a phishing police.  So here's an example. Oakland has three cops for property crimes.  There are 1500 property crimes reported every year.  So how can they best use their resources?  To Jolie's point, are they going to go knock on the doors or are they going to  call the cell phone company and say, OK, give us all you can?

Start time: 6697.22
End time: 6708.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Let me ask you this.  So one of the one of the kinds of requests  companies can make is what's called a tower dump data.  All the data, including names of everybody who used that tower during a period of time.

Start time: 6736.08
End time: 6749.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have great standards that everyone agrees on.  And these are the rules and this is what you know.  And yes, we've watched enough law in order that we know that when we use our  fast track and we go down the Bay Bridge that the cops can find that that's  trackable.  I think it all goes back to law and order.

Start time: 6751.12
End time: 6754.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I think it's you know, they took it off the air, right?  Very risky.

Start time: 6754.44
End time: 6771.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's very risky to wash your hands of this and say, hey, you know what?  You're carrying a cell phone.  It's the let the law enforcement have whatever they want.  I think we need to stand up as American  citizens and say that's unlawful search and seizure.  It's unconstitutional.  You got to knock it off.  So what would you say?  They need a warrant?  It is, by the way, it is, by the way.

Start time: 6772.04
End time: 6786.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We don't have those standards yet.  And part of this discussion that we're  having and that the judges are deciding is creating those standards.  So, of course, like police shouldn't be able to look through your phone whenever  they want for any reason at all.  But I think I give them a little bit more credit, a smidge more credit than you do.

Start time: 6799.80
End time: 6829.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  you just has to be there's no judicial oversight.  Basically, you may say there's no money in it, but it's an unholy nexus between  the phone companies, which do in fact make money on this.  Maybe it's not a lot, but they still make money on it.  And law enforcement, nobody's watching out over this.  I hope that this I think everybody needs to understand that this is going on.  And it doesn't mean throw away your cell phone.  It means it call for reforms.  And unless you're deeply cynical, as John C.  Dvorak is and say, it's all you're all screwed anyway.  Yes. And actually, Jolie is pretty cynical, too.

End time: 6983.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And I have to tell you that they may say it's about fees,  but really this is a dispute over how much these cable channels could put on  the Internet versus how much is on DirecTV.  And DirecTV is not happy with the fact that Comedy Central puts so much content  on the Internet. That's really what this fight is all about.  And for your cord cutter, you should pay close attention to this  because that's what it comes down to.  Truth is, content creators want to deliver it direct to you.  That's in their interest. They don't care.  The conduit. It's the it's the people like the cable companies and the satellite  companies who say, no, no, we want to be the gatekeeper of all this content.  We want it to come through us. If it doesn't come through us,  it doesn't go on the Internet.  And that's why I don't get Comedy Central pulling this off the Internet.  I think AMC is right. Put it on the Internet. Fine.  You know, go ahead, DirecTV, pull us off.  This is just promote cord cutting.
