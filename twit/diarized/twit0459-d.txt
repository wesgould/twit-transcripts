Transcript:  Microsoft announced Surface Pro 3 the third Surface in 18 months and while the reviews have  been mostly positive I think the only negative thing I saw was that battery life was a little  bit disappointing. It's thinner it's faster it's running the current high-end Intel fourth generation  core processors. It is pricey and Microsoft pretty much admitted we're going to just we don't want to  you know eat the low end. We want to keep a vital ecosystem of OEMs so we're going to go at the  high end. We are aiming to be exactly the same as a comparable Apple Macintosh laptop. All right

Start time: 457.64
End time: 485.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  first of all I actually think this is a smart decision for them to make but understand like  like I'm on the outside of this. I haven't read all this stuff so you could tell me like they are  definitely not trying to compete with the iPad market because the first generation of Surface  very much looked like hey man it's an iPad with a keyboard whereas this sounds from what I've heard  so far like they're definitely trying to compete with the laptop market instead. Yeah yeah and

Start time: 485.50
End time: 515.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  well they all they always had optional keyboards but this one's got what do they call it the  friction keyboard so you can actually hold it in your lap and the screen won't collapse. It's very much like the original  type keyboard but it has a few little extra. But the other thing about the keyboard is I haven't  tested the new one but all of the type keyboards they've had are still a little smaller than your  than your standard keyboard so for those of us who touch really type very fast it's a little  bit of a problem having a slightly smaller keyboard. I would I that's why this one is a little bigger in

Start time: 515.20
End time: 520.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  back here. And the trackpad is bigger too. Ben you play bigger have you played with it Ben or?

Start time: 521.34
End time: 546.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No no I haven't. I have an original but not the third one. Yeah I think it all depends on the  context that you look at it with. I mean it compared to the other Surfaces I think it's a  good product. I think there is a niche that is interested in this in this sort of product. I think  the bigger picture is looking at the program as a whole as compared to looking at one any individual

Start time: 546.50
End time: 596.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  product. The challenge you wrote the article the day after the announcement it's time to kill  Surface in your words. The problem Microsoft has is that this is the Surface is their first  hardware. They've never made PCs. They changed that long-term strategy a year and a half ago  risking their relationships with all the other Windows hardware manufacturers plus  you know kind of muddying the waters and they said well we want to make a machine that is as  good as Windows can be. I do feel like I kind of agree with you Brian that they kind of  are are less focused on the on the tablet these days and really you're kind of making a laptop  computer almost with a with a mentally removable keyboard. Why do you think Ben it's time to kill

Start time: 596.54
End time: 698.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the Surface though? What's the issue? Well I think you just kind of articulated it is I feel like the  the again if you look at it in a in a vacuum the move to focus on it being more of a laptop a  laptop with tablet features makes a lot of sense. It's a much more I think coherent product now than  it was before. The problem is is is in the process of having a new product and a new goal and a new  niche you're by definition forgetting the original goals of the entire program and and it happens to  be that the new product and the new goals actually defeat the original purposes of the product in the  first place. I think it's a classic example of you're kind of a sunk cost you're thinking about well  how do we make this better and you forget why do we even have this in the first place. If you step  back and look at why do we even have it in the first place then you realize maybe we're we're  actually already pretty far down the wrong path and we're continuing to go down it maybe it's  best to to step back and reconsider the whole thing. Your say Surface made sense when Windows 8 first came out?  I think it was there there was definite arguments on both sides when it came out but there was  definitely a case to be made both from a product and a business sort of standpoint. Now like I  think that case is gone and it's existing because Surface exists and so if you look at like oh we're  making Surface how do we make it better then it's a great product. I think it improves in a lot of ways  but if you look at it as why do we have the Surface program at all then that's where I have

Start time: 699.72
End time: 734.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  problems with it. The key question is is do we really want a laptop that can convert into a tablet  which in a sense is what it is right it's not a particularly viable tablet if you're going out  and you wanted a tablet and you wanted to occasionally type I'm not sure that's what  you'd get and if you wanted the laptop that you would use as a laptop wouldn't you be better off  with a MacBook Air or one of the good Acer's or the many excellent small laptops that are in the  market. I mean my Mac Air sure it's a little heavier but not significantly heavier than what  they're offering and it's I think a better laptop now it's not a tablet.

Start time: 737.96
End time: 756.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's exactly the point though it's like yeah if you go back to kind of first principles the very  premise of Windows 8 and the way I frame it is Surface is the physical manifestation of Windows  8 like the very premise is that people want a one device that does both and I think that premise is

Start time: 757.04
End time: 763.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  flawed. Yeah it was what was wrong with Windows 8 was it was this hodgepodge of touch and desktop.

Start time: 764.06
End time: 774.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You know personally yeah I just assumed travel with a small laptop and a seven inch tablet  so I've got both and and I use them in different different situations different scenarios.

Start time: 775.84
End time: 788.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm sure Brian and we'll have something to say about this but I think the tablet's dead.  I think that people are choosing either to bring a mobile device a phone with them  or a laptop and nobody needs this thing in the middle anymore and iPad sales are slow

Start time: 789.04
End time: 819.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  dramatically. Leo you're you are 100% right in that the worst place to get into is the mushy middle.  The mushy middle between two different objects is not a good place to launch a product because the  natural order of brands and for things is to diverge constantly right so in that regard try  this on for size right now keep in mind I haven't seen this device I don't know what it looks like  or whatever let me hype hypothesize about why this might be a good place. Why should you have

Start time: 819.50
End time: 825.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  to see it to talk about it I think go right ahead. Okay thank you. You don't need to know anything

Start time: 825.40
End time: 856.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  about it just. Welcome to this week in tech. Here's what hypothetically might be smart about this is  the way surface 1.0 was launched was here's another tablet that has an attachable keyboard  the way they're launching surface 3.0 is here's a laptop with a detachable keyboard right right  and that might be really smart right because it's like it's like if it's a subtle difference

Start time: 856.38
End time: 860.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  but it's but it is I think closer to what the market's looking for frankly well and plus also

Start time: 861.24
End time: 894.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I suspect that they are identifying a segment of the market that is underserved like nobody  who edits photos nobody who is editing videos is using their iPad to do it right it's a they're  using their laptop if they're going to use any kind of mobile device whatsoever so if you have  what ostensibly is one of those content creation devices instead of a content consumption device  and you know what you know whatever you just frame the existence of a keyboard slightly  differently I think that might be a really smart play on Microsoft's part. Remember the first

Transcript:  surface lost Microsoft 900 million dollars they took an almost a billion which by the way is less

Start time: 900.58
End time: 912.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  than the Xbox lost Microsoft. Microsoft lost on Xbox they lost a billion dollars yeah which turned  out to be an okay thing when they had the next two iterations right well if it makes you feel better I

Start time: 912.80
End time: 917.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  basically indirectly said the art relation kill Xbox too but uh but I actually the most of the

Start time: 918.12
End time: 922.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  drumbeat is spin off Xbox right so Stephen Elop and others have said let's just spin this thing off

Start time: 923.54
End time: 964.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  well I think I think Brian's right though um and that's what I mean by if you look at the product  in isolation I think it's a good product uh they there I believe there is a niche that prefers  um or I'm there has to be a niche that prefers this sort of combination right um the problem  though is by making it the product it ought to be you're destroying the business case for the  entire program and that's what I get at by saying Microsoft ought to kill it it's not that it's a  bad product and it's not that they they're not doing the right thing in isolation it's that by  doing the right thing in isolation they are losing the story in the very big picture about why the

Start time: 965.06
End time: 979.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  entire thing exists winning the battle but losing put it that way because there are so many times  where there's been the right product a genuinely good product but they didn't have the right story  to back it and I like the fact that you're framing it as a story-based decision of all companies you

Start time: 979.28
End time: 983.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  think Microsoft would understand its business better than anybody else but I think part of this

Start time: 983.66
End time: 1025.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  is a misunderstanding of why people buy windows well that's part of it and it's also I'm not sure  that's true that's why I actually used Xbox in the article itself because I think Xbox is  I used Xbox to illustrate it so things actually easier to understand um you know Xbox the reason  the an Xbox exists in the first place is that Microsoft wanted to own the living room right and  only in the living room means everyone has an Xbox not just gamers but Xbox now was only you know you  saw them cutting the connect last week was kind of like the last the last bit about reaching out  to everyone as an entertainment system it's now just about gamers like they've lost the plot  right in the big picture and that's the same thing that's happening with surface in my opinion

Start time: 1027.80
End time: 1061.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I also feel like you actually like in the surface I think this is pretty apt to the HTC One  a gorgeous device beautifully made but but aimed at a market that barely exists that is a niche  a tiny niche market high-end hardware whereas people buy windows either because it's really  cheap and I'll tell you what I hear this all the time on the radio show I need a $300 computer  yeah or they're in business and they use windows as a power tool as a truck to do  spreadsheets and they're buying desktop dells keep in mind also leo there's a there's a third

Start time: 1061.78
End time: 1071.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  element where I believe that there's a significant number of people who are buying it because it's  familiar like quite simply this is what I know how to do but it's not time of energy to put

Start time: 1071.20
End time: 1074.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  into yeah then they get one and they don't know how to use it it would have been familiar if they

Start time: 1075.22
End time: 1104.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  know no offense been but if they hadn't come out with windows 8 it would have been familiar  but they've changed the user face interface to the point where it's not familiar to most people  anymore so if you're going to invest in a in a windows 8 touchscreen you've got to learn the  metro interface I realize it's not brain surgery but you are you are changing the the paradigm a  bit and I think that's the problem as well because it's not your father's windows and your father's  windows actually works I mean I I have no problems with windows 7 it works great on the desktop

Start time: 1105.04
End time: 1110.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it works great on laptops and no offense taken I completely agree just because you worked on it

Start time: 1110.92
End time: 1118.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  doesn't mean you it's because it's your fault it's your fault had I made had I made every decision

Start time: 1118.24
End time: 1131.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that that was important to windows 8 then you'd take the blame yeah well you know it's funny  if microsoft would be completely free there wouldn't be a membership program with on both  lines I would I would be uh I'd be self-sufficient financially the irony is the irony is microsoft

Start time: 1131.28
End time: 1159.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  gives you a laptop you know with a removable I'm sorry a laptop with a removable keyboard or a  tablet with an attachable keyboard however you want to look at it and then they give you windows  8 and they essentially force you into an interface I mean yes there are ways to get around it and go  back to the windows 7 interface but they made it really hard and so where they could have easily  created an operating system that would have been actually all things to all people  in the windows world they didn't but then they try to create hardware that's all things to all people

Start time: 1159.24
End time: 1187.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  which is kind of ironic I mean the tough thing larry is that that we've seen examples of you  know for example with what uh you know apple made some extraordinarily bold decisions with the way  they created their ios uh ecosystem where they said yes yes everyone says they want this everyone's  wrong and then they they went forward um I I don't know that I want to pull that tool out of uh  microsoft's hands just because they they may not have hit the mark quite the way that apple did you

Start time: 1187.98
End time: 1223.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  know well they lost that ios ios was a new product um it was a new category uh I think what you know  the issue with with windows is it was it's a known category it's a very large category um and you  know the the if there is an analogy on the apple side it's it's something like ios 7 um but even  then like from an actual like the way you use it standpoint it was a very very small change nothing  comparable to what windows 8 kind of uh inflicted on the on the windows user base and it's interesting

Start time: 1223.84
End time: 1269.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  this is actually a really good point you make ben because uh the natural state of things is to  constantly diverge um and i've talked about this before but it's like um you know as as origin of  the species said you know there wasn't a morphing or coming together of monkeys that turned into a  man instead there was this constant divergence and all these you know some thrived some died uh but  but eventually you had this thread that led from you know from from a chimpanzee to a human or  whatever uh and and likewise i wonder if the mistake here for microsoft is not so much that  they're trying to enter the space but the mistake is that they're using the the windows name with it  right i mean it could could could it be that simply this is a branding problem hey chad focus on this

Start time: 1269.44
End time: 1312.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  that was that was the whole thing yeah go ahead so i mean what you've got here is what are they called  launchpad which is nobody uses the mac that way what are you doing i know i had to go out i actually  had to search around i actually forgot how to bring it up because i don't even i it this is the  point is ios interface on a desktop yeah but the point is they made it really optional it's kind of  it's almost hidden i mean it's there right if you really want it you can have it but they didn't  force it down your throats and and that's i like that i mean if they want to put it there fine i  don't i never use it i i literally had to kind of hunt around for the icon but the the fact is  microsoft essentially shoves metro down your throat and apple just kind of put it off on the side  you know i think i hope more people would use it you know who loves the surface pro 3 the creator

Start time: 1394.46
End time: 1401.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  no but they are now at apple pricing they're apple pricing well that's the point with the  keyboard more actually more than more than apple price are you saying they should go more than

Start time: 1401.78
End time: 1440.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  apple pricing well no i think yes i think they should i think they should do should they make it  out of solid gold the problem is when you match apple's pricing and you match apple's margins  all you're doing is saying we are a pale imitation of apple what they need to do if they want to set  themselves apart is they should figure out something a little bit extra that you know  whatever effort it takes or whatever license it requires them to buy and instead uh you know  take that and and and set themselves apart if you want to make the credible claim that you're  better than apple it seems to me maybe you should charge more than apple and that's what they're

Start time: 1440.64

Transcript:  you're 100 right ben i think that that that what you're describing is like the number one most  pervasive myth in anybody in the marketing world outside of the clock radio there's been virtually  no devices and then think about this outside of the clock radio there's been no devices where  combining crap has worked out like the the only time that you have devices that happen to combine  things that they've worked is when they define a brand new category completely for themselves and  that's what we saw with the iphone the iphone was not even though they pitched it as it's an iphone  it's a communications device it's the best you know ipod we've ever done that was the ostensible  claim but in fact what they did was they created a brand new category of device and they own that  category it's divergence you want to see divergence not convergence and what we've seen so far from  microsoft has been convergence and i think that's a mistake on their part well we're gonna break

End time: 3618.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  edition though yeah isn't that weird i mean first of all like i'm really conflicted as far as amazon  i actually deeply adore once i became an amazon prime member right like we love the ability to  click a thing and have it be there the next day and so on and of course you know weird promises of  robot drones bringing us our stuff is very appealing however uh you know their business  along with efficiency comes all of the baggage that we associate with walmart right like like we  all date walmart for whatever reason uh like for example we're not talking efficiency here though

Transcript:  we're talking amazon really acting in in a way that violates the antitrust act look at this this  is uh it looks like you may never have heard of robert galbraith uh his new novel the silkworm  a cormoran strike novel this is jk rowling this is her pseudonym yeah this book is out or about  to come out i'm not sure it's not available on amazon currently unavailable on amazon the girls  of august a big ann rivers siddon uh best seller can you order it on amazon unavailable on amazon

Start time: 3651.96
End time: 3695.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  so the question the question is some people are speculating that amazon i love amazon too i'm a  prime member i get stuff all the time but but it has had a pretty negative impact on local book  sellers and it essentially owns the online book selling market i mean is this an example that  they're flexing their muscles and that they are an evil company and that they're going to have a  negative impact on our freedom to read that's the big fear right that some people expressed at the  very beginning when amazon became literally the amazon of of the book industry and and there are  those who think that this is you know proof of the pudding that they are in fact using their power to  to control what we read i mean i don't i think it's more of a business issue but it's a scary

Start time: 3695.22
End time: 3708.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  thought i mean is that is that the claim larry that they're uh that they're actually trying to  to screw over like by not making certain things available they're trying to screw over local books  i was like what's their angle on this i don't understand why they would stand this doesn't

Start time: 3709.00

Transcript:  out of business yeah they already screwed them over brian they put them out of business now they  have monopoly power and now they're screwing publishers authors and ultimately readers by  wielding that monopoly power you know in the new yorker in february there was an article  that said amazon is bad for books and i poopooed it i think i poopooed it on this show i said  yeah you know come on amazon's great i mean yes admittedly we're losing our bookstores  but amazon sells books and they're they love books and uh boy i think george packer was right uh i  think it didn't take too long for us to realize i think this is this is the this is the problem

Start time: 3747.30
End time: 3839.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that you're getting at i mean leaving aside whether it's anti-trust or not i'm not an  anti-trust lawyer um you know uh uh the big issue is amazon kind of got the benefit of the doubt  with a lot of this stuff because they so relentlessly frame themselves as doing what's  best for for the customer customer focused and so even when it came to these book disputes  previously like there was one with macmillan uh i think was back in four or five years ago where  they pulled similar tactics they could say we're doing it because we want to make sure there's the  lowest price and and so even if you disliked what they were doing to the market you could say well  it is true they've been consistently trying to have the lowest prices i can see their angle at  being good for the consumer the problem is now uh it's by making books unavailable uh and doing  it on purpose like this is amazon's choosing to do it they are proving that the consumer actually  isn't their top priority because if it was their top priority they would keep the books available  well negotiating in the background and that's the bigger danger for amazon beyond any sort of  legal remedy that may or may not arise whether or not they violated anything it's i think not just  for a lot of people it's kind of lifting the veil that amazon had very successfully put in place  that yeah we may do stuff that you find a little uncomfortable we may be killing local bookstores  blah blah blah but we're doing it because it's best for the consumer well now there's an example  they did something that wasn't best for the consumer you use the word walmart brian it is a

Start time: 3839.80
End time: 3914.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  lot like walmart well there's a fantastic book called the walmart effect where one of the examples  they give is uh previous to walmart every time you ever bought deodorant it always came in a box and  uh walmart one of the effects you know and again there's all kinds of legitimate reasons to be  upset with walmart but one of the things they figured out is like wow we're wasting you know  10 to 15 cents per package to have cardboard printed to put this uh this in this is stupid  so they worked with the uh with the deodorant manner manufacturers and nowadays purely because  of walmart they they cut out uh five to 15 cents per product out there and and it didn't just  happen for walmart it happened for all of the other ones you you go to anywhere now you can't  find deodorant inside of a cardboard box anymore and that's all because of walmart  and and it's like i understand like like there there is efficiency what we all want is for content  creators and for the people who make the products to get a bigger chunk of it and and to have a more  efficient structure but on the other hand it's like man it's it's uh amazon is not nice to people  who own the content uh my my fire reading book is 39.99 is the retail price for it uh because  we didn't want to make the the cheapest book uh to teach how to eat fire but but amazon you really

Start time: 4193.58

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  what why he did it i mean you knew it was those ads right exactly and and that's and you know  meta filters meta filter wasn't like uh some like the demand media stuff where they were at all  explicitly built on google like they existed first and they predate google that's right right  and then google you know it so it's not like they chose to be propped up by google it's it that was  the way things went and and i mean i mean whether or not they intended to do it they worked a gift  horse in the mouth or something of that effect but the problem is is google has this power and no one  and the problem is not knowing not knowing why it happened where the issue was and and i think this  is this is i think one of matthew's broader points and it's the same thing with amazon  and facebook this week i mean there's that that the guy on facebook complaining about the the  quality of news um like i feel like a lot of these tech companies and one of the great things about  tech is the very idealistic way that people you know look at that they're changing the world and  and this sort of thing and and there's i think almost an ignorance about the power that they're  wielding and it's it's really it's dangerous i mean it's it's messing with uh like people's  livelihoods in this case and i i feel like personally just in general i think matthew's  article is very good like tech needs to get a lot more some of these countries be a lot more serious  about the power that they have and if they don't get serious uh the seriousness will be put on them  like it was for microsoft in the 90s for example right i love i love uh mark andresen's uh tweet on

Start time: 5406.38
End time: 5527.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  saying they were hashed they they were but but ebay's like it's it's our own proprietary one and  no one kind of knows what that might be um so that's it's it's even more of a black box in many  ways but the the bigger issue here is is there's no one there's no one one it's an extremely hard  problem i think it's easy to sit here and say that everyone should do a better job um the problem is  is one it's hard to secure a computer system by definition two uh passwords are really hard for  regular people to to manage effectively um but but the broader issue is no one's really properly  incentivized to fix this i mean you're getting at that with the consumers for credit card are  generally not liable um for someone like ebay or any sort of retailer uh you know i have this for  my site i have a membership program and i have uh you know i can choose the level of verification  i want to accept a credit card payment and it makes sense generally to use a lower one because  you don't want to make it easy counter problems exactly and and that that pervades everything i  mean it's and it's really i think realistically uh the target one is interesting i think it was  actually really encouraging that the ceo lost his job because ideally that is providing a better  incentive for other companies to do a better job with password security so you don't lose your job  but i think that that realistically that's it's probably going to take something where there's  just massive penalties associated with losing information because otherwise um it it's expensive  it takes a lot of time it takes a lot of expertise and it's an unforgiving job that provides you zero  benefit until like you can't prove a negative right you can't say oh this program is paying  for itself because we haven't been happy how do you how do you how do you measure that and that  that's what makes it so hard to have companies realistically give it the resources it deserves

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  i mean to me that's a lot of pixels i love the fact that i can go all the way across the atlantic  on one battery with a macbook here 13 hours on the 13 inch it really changed my life because i go  to conferences now i used to go and i would immediately look for a seat next to an electrical  outlet right that was like my my biggest priority now i can go to a conference all day take notes  go on wi-fi and not have to worry and and it's like you know it's an enabling technology it's  not just an upgrade it's it's a substantial improvement in my lifestyle when i when i when i  have to go on battery and and it's rare that you get any technology that you can make that statement

Start time: 6088.16
End time: 6111.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  about by the way that's why i buy these by the dozen these are fake electrical outlet stickers  and i just go around the airport and i uh i put those on all of it's great and then i wait that  way you get the real one right everybody else goes after the fake right it's so fun to see everybody  flocking five dollars and 75 cents for a set of four kids and what if you say you just put code

Start time: 6112.42
End time: 6150.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  no no trick code on that the macbook air is a curious situation to me because when it was  originally launched the macbook air was the highest most premium laptop out there right there is new  stories about how they're so light and so crazy but they get thrown away because nobody realized  but then they position it i mean apple positions the macbook air as their entry level version of  the laptop right now so with that being the case why wouldn't you ruin the battery life on it why  i mean it's like there's no it's your entry level throw away every college kid's going to get a  computer that seems like first of all exactly the brand that you'd want to flush down the toilet

Transcript:  my my macbook air my 13 inch air i think cost me 1400 bucks that's more expensive the cheap one is  11 inch and it only has no 899 but that's still twice the price of a comparable you know in terms  of specs and twice the price of a windows laptop so it's still not cheap it's just less expensive

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  than the other mac i tell you one thing i know we will see and that's a 4k display  the macbook pro with retina and the macbook i mean the mac pro so both support 4k displays  apple has updated os 10 to support 4k displays apple doesn't sell a 4k display they've got to

Start time: 6187.72
End time: 6235.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  have a 4k display i i think it's a really smart move i think that by and large the entire nature  of 4k has been mismanaged from the very beginning this is a whole technology where they're they're  selling the displays when literally nobody can tell the difference between 1080p and 4k when you  go to the movie theater you're not even seeing 4k at the movie theater you're seeing 2k at the  movie theater that's because you're 20 feet away from the screen correct correct but but if you  want to do it right and this is what i think apple will do very smartly uh sell 4k based on the real  estate for the screen like and i've pointed this out before i'm looking at uh six monitors right  now i would much much much much rather have one very large monitor that had enough room right to  fit all of these individual things oh that's a good idea that's an interesting well i mean that's

Start time: 6235.36
End time: 6245.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  trivial i mean i think you could buy a 4k display and do that now i think i actually disagree i think  what apple apple will do this in the end of retina which is high dpi uh yeah yeah making it you know

Start time: 6245.86
End time: 6278.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  that's dumb yeah i oh wait a minute now i have a 4k display i got one of the only the two that have  60 hertz refresh rate there's an asus and there's a sharp which apple sells they're insanely  expensive they cost as much as the mac pro itself uh 2500 bucks but i with 1093 they have high dpi  so i run it at 1080p and it's the crispest thing i ever saw it's not real estate it's just beautiful  because of the uh sub pixel rendering and then when i'm looking at an image or a video then i  get dot for dot and it's the best of both worlds you got to see it before you uh poopoo it brian

Start time: 6279.72
End time: 6299.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  well i mean i i would just say that in general what you do is you get a modest increased infidelity  and at a major major price and there is a ridiculous price premium yeah no right whereas  if you're selling real estate you know it's it's quadruple the real estate it's four times larger  than 1080p well you can do that like the much smarter way to sell it last year sony sony had a

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  1080p set right next to the 4k set and i was standing 10 feet from it watching their program  that was a custom design to show off their 4k and i could barely tell the difference i mean it was  it was a little improvement uh it's nothing compared to the difference between standard  definition and 1080p and so if they're going to sell it to watch movies then and they've got to  come they've got to do something different so you know i agree with you as a computer screen  yeah i can see it making sense but as a way of watching movie you're sitting right here

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  if you are talking about content viewing a subjective experience i heard some rumors a  friend of mine is over at warner brothers and he talked about the experience of seeing a hdr display  this is a whole new movement because everything you see on every display display you see every  time they release something on blu-ray they have to take you know our eyes see all the way to the  brightness of the sun all the way to the darkness of you know candlelight and so on uh but our  displays have an extremely narrow high end and low end of brightness on there and so he talked  about displays that are being made that are intentionally crafted using different technologies  so that they're so bright that you have to squint to look at them when something when the sun shows  up you're physically in pain great and he says he says it's fundamentally different from any  other display you've seen why would i want that because because it feels like reality  burns it burns and that 4k doesn't right there are parts of reality there's nothing there's

Transcript:  with patents is i think everyone it's the same just to tie everything again in a bigger knot  or both uh it's a similar thing to to the surface thing like we forgot the whole reason they exist  right right the reason they exist is is the the the people who came up with the idea of patents  and and go back to the founding fathers and whatnot like everyone knows patents are a bad thing  they reduce competition they make things more expensive uh the reason they exist is that  uh they are an artificial monopoly and the reason they exist is the fear that if they didn't exist  some types of innovation would would not happen and again the pharmaceutical is a great example  it takes something like seven or eight years to bring something to market and they're trivial  to copy if there weren't patent protection there would be no point in investing in no we need  seven or eight years that's clear but what the problem is in in software and technology like  there is no need for additional competitive advantage there's such an advantage to being  first to market right uh the whole reason that patents exist in the first place doesn't even  apply to technology and that that's but it's almost i i wonder if we would get traction by  going back to first principles like what's the point of patents okay now we all agree that's  the point then it becomes just super obvious that they don't have a place in software in particular  beyond the fact that you know software is math and you can't pop patent math well i felt like we
