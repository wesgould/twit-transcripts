Transcript:  This is TWIT episode 42 for February 19th 2006.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Life. The answer to life, the universe and everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to TWIT.  After a hiatus, a brief calm, we are back in the storm  and with some new face, actually a new face joining us.  Let's introduce him right now from cnet.com.  What is your title?  Editor. Yeah. Tom Merritt.  He used to be executive editor for the website for TechTV.com.  And of course his site, Subbrilliant, lives on Subbrilliant.com.  You do stuff there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I just relaunched it at the end of the summer,  which means I worked on it for the first time in two years.  That's good. I added a post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're relaunching. Tom, actually we're reciprocating.  Tom was very kind to invite me to be on his podcast with cnet.  It's Buzz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Buzz Out Loud, yeah. Mollywood, Veronica, Belmont and myself.  Really great.  We have fun. Thanks for coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You never said Veronica's last name, so I never gave you credit.  It's that way.  Just Veronica the producer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We just call her Producer Veronica.  Producer Veronica.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And also from DLTV, we've got Robert Heron here.  It's great to see you again, Robert.  Good to see you too.  Thank you for showing up last week.  Hey.  Didn't do a twit last week.  I had Robert and Woz on the line and nobody else showed up.  Well, I was half there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was dealing with my cable subscription for my modem.  Did you get your upgrade?  I did, but I'm pretty disappointed with it.  Oh, no.  I'm going to probably cancel it and drop back to the standard.  I was all excited because Tom Castor is going to give him eight minutes.  I was excited for a couple days.  What happened?  They're just not delivering the speed.  I can find if they can provide one example of an eight megabit connection anywhere.  You've been running it all the testing service.  Testing.  I've been trying to download multiple.  I guess solid four megabit.  I've seen it peak above six once and I've never even seen it made.  But they did the double upload speed.  That went down solid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You were getting four on what system?  On Comcast.  No, before.  Oh, you paid more for it at faster speed on Comcast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Basically, I want to double my download speed and double my upload speed for another 10  bucks a month.  It's kind of half there.  So they didn't.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I don't think it's going to get any faster.  Screwed, dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm just going to say, you know what?  Give me my 10 bucks a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think anybody in this room should be giving anybody to Comcast, of all people.  It's convenient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What else are you going to do?  My TV and my internet.  What other monopolies are you going to give it to?  DSL.  You don't have any choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, I don't have a phone line in my house.  There's a phone line there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you don't have to have a phone account to get DSL.  OK.  Now employed, Roger Chang.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Welcome back, Roger.  You got a job?  Yes.  Since we saw you last.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I just started Wednesday.  He's more fun if he's unemployed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, he's hangdog no matter what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He'll hate this job in a few.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Who hired you?  Yes.  It starts with the initials are P and.  Mr. Norton hired you.  So you're working for DLTV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  Is this a full-time gig?  Yes.  And Jim Lutterback and the gang over there?  Yes.  Do you hate your boss yet?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey, why does, you know, you know, I was actually talking to Tom about this.  Every job that I've actually went out and looked and got myself, I've ended up hating.  Is that true, really?  And every other job that people either offered or say, hey, there's an opening.  Why don't you go apply?  You know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So when people throw jobs at you, you like it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But if I actively go seek and find one, then it's going to sell.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you basically have no taste.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  I don't know.  I mean, I may be able to.  That's my confusion.  It's a very crude way of putting it.  But accurate.  But accurate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who's that guy who always had bad luck?  Rodney Dinkgrafield?  Roger.  Oh, that's it.  Yeah, Roger.  I give no respect.  There was a guy, this is way before your time.  It was, I can't remember his name.  It was in the Little Abner.  The guy who had always had bad luck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, vaguely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  You don't remember.  John C. Dvorak is here.  Dvorak.org slash blog.  John is now officially certified, insane.  Apparently, according to these cartoons.  I can snaggy say so in the joy of tech.  I'll put a link in the show notes.  It starts off with a doctor speaking to two people  at the back of their heads.  We'll soon know who those people are.  I'm afraid the news is not good.  Although it seemed like he was making progress lately,  your friend has now had a relapse.  The severe delusions and intense psychosis have returned  and they are manifesting themselves in his work.  In layman's terms, John C. Dvorak has totally lost it.  And then we turn around, it's Patrick and me crying.  Dvorak goes, listen to me.  Apple computer is going to ditch the Mac OS  for Microsoft Windows.  It's true.  Did you hear me?  Apple's switching the Windows.  What were you smoking when you wrote that column?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, I'll tell you, if they actually do this,  you guys are going to be eating a lot of crow minimally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why would Apple switch to?  Well, I got to...  You said this was going to happen two weeks ago.  We let it slide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What, the column?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  No, no, but not just you.  Well, the column was already in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was ready to go.  So I thought I pre-promoted it.  But I pulled out the original unedited version,  and I have the laundry list here.  I mean, it's just...  I mean, how many times...  I mean, you keep seeing this writing on the wall.  I don't know that they're going to do anything,  but it just seems to me there's too many coincidences,  and I'll go over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have to admit, I've been getting email from people saying,  you know, when you look at all these evidence,  John might be right.  Which I think just shows you that anything can be proven true  if you combine enough random facts.  No, but this is overwhelming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is one, two, three, four, right.  It's a beautiful mind.  Very good.  Five, six, seven, eight, nine.  Definitely Windows.  Definitely Windows.  Nine.  I got this like...  I got 52 reasons.  Definitely Windows.  Ten, 11, 12 things.  Tell us some of them.  And my favorite thing, I've gotten a few emails,  mostly from people that think I'm nuts.  But they have to...  Or these guys at The Comment, the PC Magazine online,  they go, you know, I hate reading you,  and I hate...  And I've read you, and I'm not going to reach you anymore.  I don't get what they're talking about.  I'll email you next week after your next call.  But somebody...  Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Use the Halid Coast cell of Twitter and...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was something with somebody who said,  because I mentioned that Apple could compete with Dell,  and some of these Mac people said, you know,  why would they do that?  Why would they want to compete with the likes of Dell?  As those...  Dell is like something...  The likes of Dell.  I'm thinking, what do you...  Is this the kind...  I mean, I think Apple people must have really  some sort of insecurity,  because if they don't think they can compete  with the likes of Dell,  those machines are homely, and they're, you know,  they're not...  And they're all made in China.  Yeah.  The likes of Dell.  The likes of Dell.  I tell you.  Anyway, read the column,  and really you can read that.  So what's your most compelling argument?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's the biggest co-inquiry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I think that Adobe keeps putting off this issue,  but we're not going to put it on the x86 yet.  Maybe 2007, they keep changing it.  And it seems to me that they're just waiting for the switch,  so they don't have to do anything.  I mean, that's my favorite one.  But the one...  I'll go over all of them.  The Apple switch ads are over.  Nobody switches.  The iPod loses the Firewire connector.  The iPod was a lever...  According to this guy who sent me the note,  the iPod was originally a leveraging tool,  and they gave up on it.  They switched to the Intel microprocessor,  which makes it pretty straightforward,  despite the fact that the PowerPC is still continuing to be developed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, in fact, you're starting to look at the Power 6,  which is looking really good.  They dropped it for a reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right.  Also, they freak out over the lawsuits over the gossip sites  for no good reason.  You think maybe they're worried the gossip sites will find this out?  Yep.  The pot of money from Bill Gates, still unexplained.  We don't know anything that happened about it.  What pot of money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The 150,000...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  150 million...  That was years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It ran out a long time ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This went into this.  The comment at Macworld Expo by the Microsoft spokesperson  that said MS Office will continue to be developed for the Mac for five years.  Why five years?  Why not six?  Why not seven?  Adobe and other high-end apps are not being ported,  and it's all about the drivers.  Who wants to deal with this?  It seems to me that it's a smart thing to dump the OS X86  and just let somebody else do all the work.  Send your email to dvorak.org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Could the same reasons be they want to dump Unix and go to FreeBSD or something?  You know what I'm hoping?  I hope you're right.  Drivers, drivers, drivers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's why nobody's gone to Unix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The only advantage is that they have OS 10.  I hope you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, they got plenty of it.  These are nice units.  Compared to the likes of Dell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For Adobe's case, weren't they going through some financial troubles too recently  and they had to downsize the company?  Dell was?  No, Adobe in particular.  So if you're going to focus your software into any market,  you'd go for the most profitable one.  There's lots of them.  Anyway, that's just a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I created a firestorm around the office today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This column came around because I got this note from this guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I thought, this guy's nuts.  And then I started thinking about it, and in that five-year,  my MS Office five-year thing is what triggered me writing it.  By the way, we're getting a million page views on this base.  It's unbelievable.  They're like burning the servers up.  You're probably getting more email than the...  So thank you very much, Apple users.  I'm going to switch to the Google OS.  That should be your next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're probably getting more email than the time you said  that the iBook looked like a toilet seat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, actually, that got the most email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What was the women's compact?  The women's compact.  Yeah, I had the women's compact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The one time it was on...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The little girl.  I opened it up and I pulled out a...  No, actually, I haven't really gotten to that point.  No, actually, I haven't really gotten as much email on this.  Really?  I get a lot of...  We're getting a lot of page views, but we're not...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know why they sent me email complaining about you.  I have something to do with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, we even got email about it over at CNET.  CNET got email?  I don't know.  Have you seen this tomorrow?  It's crazy.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's exactly the best thing that could happen to you.  It caused an OS war within my own company.  Did it?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just the emails flying around.  It's like people defending it, people saying,  oh, there's some truth here.  You can't really back it up.  You can't really back it up one way or the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then the Apple lovers, of course, come out of there.  Here's the real user fanatics, the hardcore users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This was in the New York Times on Friday.  Amazon now admits it's going to open a music store.  It's going to make its own MP3 player.  They're going to basically model themselves after Apple  with the closed music store that only works...  Are they going to license the iPod design?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's a dog.  It's not going to work.  Well, what they're saying is, look what Apple did right.  They said, we're going to create a music store  that only plays on our player.  You want to play our music, you've got to have your player.  So if we create a better...  I think this is their thinking.  If we create a better music store,  and they're going to do subscription, by the way,  so you pay a monthly or yearly fee and you get all you can eat,  and you'd have to use the Amazon player.  Good idea?  I wonder how long that would take to crack.  Better idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, aren't there a couple of companies that already do that?  Rhapsody Music Store?  I don't think it's a good idea at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think the Apple idea is very good.  I think it's an old idea, yeah.  The problem comes down to the DRM.  I don't like this locked in stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apple doesn't license Fair Play to anyone,  so you're stuck using their player with the Apple iTunes Store.  Brilliant.  If Amazon licenses their DRM technology cheaply to enough people,  then it would make at least an open platform to distribute music on,  more open than Apple's current is.  I think that's their goal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Their goal would be to make a closed...  I mean, if you're going to compete with...  If you're going to do what Apple did,  you make a closed platform, right,  and hope that people like your music store so much  that they buy your player.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you're placing them dependence on creating good hardware  that people want to buy, and that could be tricky.  I think it's going to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you've got to hope that Apple doesn't lose their lawsuit  over tying their music store to their player, too.  That's true, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that keeps the record companies happy on Apple's side.  That's the other thing, the a la carte,  one fee per all the downloads you want.  I think the music companies are going to go a little crazy about that one.  I'm very curious, Tom Merritt,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  which would you prefer, buying music and owning it,  we're talking digital downloads, or subscribing,  and having, you know, if you don't pay, you lose all the music.  Oh, yeah, buying and owning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In fact, I don't even buy DRM music.  I don't shop at iTunes Music Store.  Oh, you want to buy CDs and rip them.  I buy either CDs and rip them, or I buy MP3s clean off the net  from places like Audio Lunchbox or a place like that.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm actually going to go with buy and own.  However, I do know a couple of close friends who actually like the fact  that they can buy and just have access to all this music,  because from what they tell me,  it's like they don't like listening to the same music all the same time,  and having access to a vast library.  You know, they're able to cycle through a bunch of music  and not kind of get lost in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A certain type of person that might make sense.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're always listening to different songs.  It's not a one-size-fits-all solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do you think, Robert? Buy or rent?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm about to buy a new music player, and it won't be an Apple iPod,  so the DRM becomes a real big issue for me.  And I'm not going to buy anything that's locked to any player,  because they're not going to provide a firmware update for my new phone  or whatever player I'm going to end up using as my primary player.  That's really what it is.  I mean, granted, I have a lot of CDs, and a lot of MP3s are up to my hard drive that way.  And I might take Tom's approach and just buy it without the DRM  or buy the CD itself for good albums that I appreciate.  Unless it comes from Sony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Dvorak, you just stick with those Edison cylinders.  They're still the best way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I listen to Sirius. I don't care about owning or buying anything.  You're a Sirius guy. Is that because of Stern?  No.  Of course.  I've actually never heard of Stern's show.  Don't listen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apparently, I haven't listened to Sirius,  but apparently it's gotten really, really outrageous.  No, I'll probably listen.  No?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's more, you realize the restrictions he had on broadcast radio and how...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Bubble the Love Sponge is not out of control?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not really. He can get there, and he's got aspects to the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But is it still the show that they're showing on TV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do they still show it? They show it on on-demand now, I believe, parts of it.  It's not like they don't do the live show, and yeah,  these things done as far as I remember or know.  The answer is people want to buy music. They don't want to rent it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Forget it. It's a bad idea. Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What are you, McLaughlin?  Are you telling me to answer the question?  Yeah, exactly.  The question is wrong.  You're wrong, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Topic three. OS X has a worm.  Tom Marrett, bad news for Mac users?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No.  They have two worms.  Yeah, which worm are you referring to?  They have two worms now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was one that was a concept, but this is an actual in the wild 50 people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's two in the wild. There's one Bluetooth one that came out today.  Oh, there's a new one. There's a Bluetooth one?  And they're both nothing.  They're nothing.  Nothing to worry about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  People out there, it's your job to make something that works and destroys the entire environment.  It can happen.  It can happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In order for you to get this worm, you'd have to first of all accept a file over iChat.  Okay, that can happen.  Yeah, forget it.  Especially because it's pictures of the new leopard operating system.  Okay, that's cool. I'd like to see that.  You'd have to open that.  It's a tarball, isn't it?  Zip tarball. Yeah, and then.  That's going to happen.  Yeah, you open the tarball, and then it's not pictures. It's an application.  I wonder why. Let me run it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How do you get a story where it says OS X worm has infected 50 computers?  That's what Sophos is saying.  Who comes up with this number?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's probably all from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sophos.  10% of the Mac user base infected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's probably all from friends and relatives.  They count this stuff, you know, because I don't know how.  Sophos keeps track of this stuff.  Actually, they said fewer than 50.  So it could be one, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It probably one person got it and they extrapolated it.  I think the whole thing is just ridiculous.  No, I bet you that's what they did.  It's like, you know, Joe Schmo done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got more mail on this than I got on the Dvorak column because everybody's going,  Neener, neener, neener, see you Mac.  Oh yeah, all the Windows guys, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Does anybody even make destructive viruses anymore?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Once I just ripped your hard drive apart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was the whole thing with the Kama Sutra.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because usually it's more like about taking over your system and using it to distribute  email for spam purposes.  That's more fun.  All the tech in that word, yeah.  We miss the good old days where just, you know, your hard drive's hosed in like seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, well that's why everybody was worried about Kama Sutra.  You're right.  They're very rare because mostly what they want to do is, you know, get a computer on  a bot network and sell it to, yeah, sell it to spammers.  John, you had an interesting story.  I'm going to let you bring this one up about phone.  First of all, what is FON?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you know, there's been a number of attempts to do what phone wants to do.  FON, it's a, they're trying to make a kind of a massive Wi-Fi free access grid, essentially.  I mean, they have a slightly-  Like a big mesh network of Wi-Fi.  Yeah, but it's got its own, you know, it's got a few twists.  It's not like, you know, I mean they're all a little different.  And all these things have failed, by the way, time after time.  It just never works out because you just don't, it just doesn't happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is an Argentinian billionaire, according to Orlovsky.  Orlovsky says, I don't know if he's a billionaire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  With the recent economic downturn in that country, I didn't know there were any-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, maybe worth a-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A billion in Argentinian dollars, probably.  I think it is, I believe.  Say it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why, but I think that is, I think that is locked to the, or used to be locked to the  dollar, but it's maybe two to one now.  But the problem is a bunch of bloggers got busted for, or at least they got outed, as  we're on the, by the Wall Street Journal for working for these guys, you know, as advisors.  And then without telling anybody, they're making all these positive blog mentions, you  know, and then they've, now they're all saying, well, you know, we were going to tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So let's add them.  Who was it?  Well, there's a whole group of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you go to the article in the journal, if you click on that, it kind of names most of  them.  Okay.  This is from dvorak.org slash blog.  Yeah, I have it mentioned in the dvorak.org slash blog.  Blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gilmore, is it, which Gilmore?  Is it Dan or his brother?  Dan.  Dan, the People's Media, Gilmore?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  What is it?  What is it?  Citizen Journalist.  Citizen Journalist Dan Gilmore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So these are people perpetrating to be impartial users?  Posting this?  No, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, it seems to me, I mean, I, to be honest about it, I've talked over this concept  with a lot of these guys from Berkman, I guess, you know, I've talked over this idea of using  blogs as marketing tools with public relations people saying, you know, you know, this is  an opportunity at some point because, you know, they talk to, you know, writers in regular  media and these people are in the media.  So the problem was, is that the way they handled this with this advisors that aren't, you know,  I don't know, you know, it's almost like if you remember Comdex days, they would always  have this huge pages of advisors.  Right.  It's not quite a board member.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a little bit less than a board member.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, you're supposed to be advising, but advising is not the same as just pumping it  up in your publication.  That's not advice.  Here's my advice.  I'll write it up.  Phone.  So David Eisenberg, who is on the advisory board said, in fact, technically we are not

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  compensated.  This is from Andrew Orlowski's column in the, in the register.  He says, technically we're not compensated as no written agreement is in place.  Just a get this non-specific verbal intent.  Oh, jeez.  It makes it sound worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What, are they going to toss a bag of money off?  That's what it sounds like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, if they just come out and, you know, they meet me behind the bank, do me this favor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, it's unbelievable.  Someday I may come to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But really that just, that just speak reflects more on human nature and, you know, I mean,  come on, you're not going to ever find a group of people who are above a little, you know,  I think you've got a group right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, we'll take the money, but we do it in advance.  Yeah, and we.  No, see, the thing is you can't, this is the way, if you can't set a deal up like this  and you say, okay, we're going to hire you as an advisor and, you know, you, you know,  I will, we'll, we'll figure out the deal later because it sounds like you're, you're, you're  trying to get the guy to write a bunch of stuff and then you're going to give him money.  Well, now.  I mean, if I said, here, I'll give you a hundred or whatever, a hundred bucks or something  and I want, you have any advice for me?  And then you say, yeah, I think your thing sucks or it's good.  I mean, does anybody think it sucks?  And there, does that advice and then has anybody blogged it saying, oh, this is terrible.  This whole, this idea sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's amazing how uniformly positive all of the press has been on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  As if it was all from the same script, perhaps.  Well, I don't want to.  That's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, it just seems to me there's no criticism in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, no, you're right, because if they got paid upfront, then they can say whatever they  want.  But if it's, if they're waiting, then yeah, it's like when you say enough nice things,  then we'll, we'll send you the check.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sweet in the pot.  So Mike, I guess this is not the first time, as you point out, that people have tried to  get into the White House, bloggers, in fact, the White House.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, they try to do it.  Right.  And they buy people off.  I mean, it's a con.  It seems to be more common now than it's ever been before, or people are getting busted  more.  I'm not absolutely sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We were talking about forums.  This is a real problem in forums.  Roger, you said that in what, car forums and so on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, a lot of consumer kind of not, I wouldn't say advocacy, but for like, message boards  for people looking to buy new automobiles, new pieces of electronic equipment, oftentimes  just fine plants.  They're pretty obvious.  I mean, the original ones that you used to see were pretty good.  Yeah, this product's great.  I've had no trouble.  I don't understand what they're talking about.  They're just trying to ban out the company.  See, that bothers me, because I use Amazon.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We've talked about this in Yelp and ePinions and stuff to-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've always thought that places are filled with shills.  You were talking about some people hiring people.  Robert Heron says this is a job for some people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Friends sent me a job posting last week that listed, the company was specifically looking  for people to create 50 to 100 aliases on the various, the most popular blogs and places  to post information like that for the user groups or whatever products they are.  And you had to become, you had to integrate yourself within these communities, so they  knew you were a real person and you had the respect.  And then they start dropping product mentions.  And if a product does come up, they would mention something positive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A mole.  It's kind of like, it's almost like being a CIA person.  You go in there and then you get their confidence and then you start feeding BS.  This happened during the Windows versus OS 2 era, because Microsoft had these people  that I termed munchkins that were feeding stuff into these forums.  And it turned out much later they admitted that they had these guys doing it.  They stopped doing stuff like that, I believe.  And I think, funny thing was back in the 80s when I did my big first telecom book, one  of the guys that was helping me with the book, one of the chapter writers, Dr. File Find,  who I kind of lost track of.  He said he was going to go on all these forums and start pumping the thing.  And I said, go for it.  And I still think it's a good idea.  I think if you're honest, it's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  As long as you say who you are and why you're doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The funny thing is, yeah, I agree with that.  But I think that there's going to be a point where if you're going to start hiring people  to do this and they don't know anything and you just kind of train them to go on forums  and pump the product, I don't see how you can get caught.  These guys got caught for some other reason because they didn't.  I think it's a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What happens even in bars, you go in a bar and they hire these guys to go out and say,  have you had a Zima lately?  Well, shills.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Last time I was doubled over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That could become the new gun for hire concept for a lot of people where they could approach  one of these businesses and say, here, I have 100 accounts on these forums that are the  most popular for these products.  And I'm a well-respected member.  Pay me.  And I'll get your message out there.  You know, I don't see any way that this isn't going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now that said, sites like I mentioned before like Yelp, where you can see somebody's history.  I like that.  You know, and you see everything they've done and everything they've posted.  You can spot this.  So I think that the public can find a way around what this is going to happen, whether  anybody likes it or not.  There's going to be people out there.  And it's going on now.  They're going to be posting BS.  And you see it.  But you should be able to identify it.  Things like this Yelp site allows you to really kind of identify the person.  And when you see them veering into some, you know, promoting something weird, you can probably  catch them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, tight communities are going to have a – it's going to be harder for you to  come into a tight community.  You'll stick out like a sore thumb if you're just like, hey, this great new direct TV show  is – yeah, everybody's just going to ignore you.  So like a mall, you have to create a persona.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But get on the resume though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You have to be really savvy in that whatever you're trying to pimp.  Because oftentimes, you know, people call – especially on the car forums, people call  it.  It was like, well, you know, you should know from 92, 94 there was no, you know, power  steering offered on that line.  You know, they get really, really, really, really –  Those guys.  – kind of pedantic about it.  And then, you know, it's like, well, you know, that's full of, you know, don't listen  to that guy.  You know, he's blowing smoke.  So, you know, that could just be a kind of a reaction to that kind of behavior where  you have people just being, you know, kind of almost self-styled vigilantes looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just feel sorry for consumers because consumers who are not savvy to all of this, they go  out.  On the one hand, you've got professional journalists who are being perhaps paid by  companies.  Well, actually, you don't even have to –  On the other hand, you go to –

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Nobody's really being paid, generally speaking, the flog stuff, but they're getting blind  and dined and –  Or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're influenced.  On the other hand, you've got trusted – supposedly trusted people, real people in the forums  who are also being coerced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They just feel bad.  You know, considering how capitalistic our society is, they should go back to teaching.  Before they used – you know, back in high school, they used to teach things like –  Trust no one.  Common sense.  No, but they –  Duck and cover.  Like, you know, if you didn't want to go like the route of like going –  Don't believe everything you read.  – and everything else, they would – part of home economics, they would tell you how  to like, you know, read ads, you know, how to get the best –  Oh, consumer economics.  Coni-con.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Coni-con?  Yeah, that was a class in high school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I tested out of it.  I didn't want to take a test, you know.  But you were required.  You were required to take a test.  But not – I'm not talking –  It used to be health class.  It used to be a lot of stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They don't give those courses anymore.  They want the people to be stupid.  I mean, really, it's better.  It makes people buy more stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that – I went to a parent night at the – my daughter's going to high school  next year.  I went to the parent night, and they did have, in fact, a course.  I can't remember what they called it.  I thought it was going to be the sex course.  You know, it was like human relations or something.  But one of the first things they tell you is, look, they're all trying to get you to eat  their junk food, and then they're going to sell you a diet.  So don't believe it.  And I thought they had pretty good.  My daughter, of course, like you, Tom Merritt, said, I'm not taking that.  I'm going to test that.  I'm going to take French.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, anyway, I've talked to some top PR people about some of this, and they seem – the  professionals, the big companies seem to be pretty – they like – they understand  that there's a mechanism here that's going to be used – blogs and forums and  whatever – someday in the future.  But they're very dubious about it because they – you know, because of the situation  that happened with these guys.  It's embarrassing.  It's embarrassing.  And so they don't know how to do it.  I mean, they know how to deal with the media because – and they get plenty of ink from  the media.  But they don't quite know how to do this.  And I'm not absolutely sure a perfect mechanism has been invented.  But I eventually believe that bloggers will be part of a system that – you know, where  they get wined and dined the same way regular journalists do.  And the Democrats did the best job of it when they took those bloggers to the convention.  And they just gave them – showed them a good time, and the bloggers were just so –  Oh, but they were easy.  The bloggers just rolled over.  Anybody who gets attention to that, they go, hey, scratch my tummy.  You what?  It was the funniest thing to read these blogs.  These people were like – they were like the biggest suckers I've ever seen.  It was unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Story four is World of Warcraft, the new golf.  Yeah.  You ain't kidding.  Nintendo has a guild in World of Warcraft, a bunch of capitalists and bloggers.  We know.  Called We Know.  Yeah.  And is it people we know?  Is that the idea?  We know –

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can't remember.  It was something about – we act like we know what we're talking about.  That's what it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what it was.  But it's like the thing to be.  And apparently, when they get together and in between killing monsters, they talk about  their next investment.  What's the deal here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sure.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The deals are struck in World of Warcraft now.  I mean, I find this hard to believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's go kill that seven-headed dragon.  While we're at it, let's figure out what we want to do with the new venture capitalist  money we just got here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a virtual avatar world where you can send mail and items and –  I don't want to get this killed.  I think it sounds like it could be killed.  Join.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wonder if they let my undead priest in.  He's only a level 17.  I'm a noob.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're not going to let me in.  Can you imagine one of those like –

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You have to know somebody.  You have to get –  Oh, it's one of those.  Oh, yeah.  Only our kind of people.  They don't even say what server they're on.  I bet you my son could get out.  They didn't say what server they were on, did they?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's no way to figure out where We Know is.  It's a special server.  Unless you just run into them.  You might be able to find a friend, ask around.  You think Joyito actually is a girl in World of Warcraft?  Wouldn't that be weird?  Who knows?  Yeah, it could be anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What if it was just a bot?  No, that would be cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So is it the new golf?  PC Magazine wrote this article.  I saw it in a number of places.  I think it's a bunch of BS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's ask a golf magazine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are there four million subscribers?  The premise being that that's where business will be done in the future.  It's being done there now.  I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think the interface is the greatest.  Maybe with some of the enhancement interfaces you can add to the game would help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You could do a lot of voice over IP stuff while you're in the game.  That's true.  I do that actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What happens though is you'll be going, I've seen this, you'll be running through World  of Warcraft, monsters chasing you or whatever, and then there's just a bunch of people standing  around with their orc axes talking.  It's like, what are you guys talking about?  I should just kind of go over and say, what are you, hey, what are you, hang on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stand in front of them and start dancing.  Jump around.  Or type in slash.  Or hack them up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or slash fart.  That's the best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can take joke-tell jokes.  You can start killing them.  Yeah, that's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you become an outcast both in the real world and in the virtual world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is just tech luminaries, right?  I mean, you don't have any members of the produce marketing association in World of Warcraft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I understand Dick Cheney is investigating a membership in World of Warcraft.  Yeah, he's got a shotgun with him.  You know, they do have shotguns in the game.  A little safer.  So I don't know if you saw this, Robert, the Extreme Tech they did in Elkos Technology  Studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I had a chance to preview part one well before it hit our magazine.  And Ray Sinera, who wrote that article, is arguably one of...  He's been in the TV industry forever.  He's a scientist as far as TV development.  He's the guy who started DisplayMate.  That and early engineer for CBS putting together their original TV systems as well.  So what a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, it's a three-part series.  Certainly well worth reading.  But I thought the interesting thing was he had regular people and he had experts look  at these displays and the regular people liked the cruddiest display.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why was that?  The brightest pictures sell the best and the most edge enhanced isn't for...  It was the sharp, the edge enhanced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They thought, oh, that's sharp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  When in fact it was smooshed.  That sells TVs.  And that's why every TV you'll buy in the store is set that way.  It's set to be as bright as blue and as edge enhanced as possible as one of the main defaults.  And unfortunately, that's not accurate or faithful to what the director had in mind.  But it sells more TVs.  And that's just the simple fact of it.  And it won't change how retail channels work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not going to ask who's right.  Is the expert right or is...  I mean...  You know, it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think most...  Oh, go ahead.  I was going to say, but those TVs at their default settings, you bring that...  That might look good in the store.  You get that home.  And if you watch that for a while, it causes eye strain.  It hurts.  The TVs are so bright nowadays.  Rob, why do you have bandages over your eyes?  This is a class action one.  You need sunglasses to look at some of these.  I've had TVs, literally, if sitting in front of it, you could not look straight into it.  There was so much light coming out of the front of it.  And every year they keep bumping it up a couple more notches.  And these are some of the brightest TVs I've seen.  And it has nothing to do with how bright a TV can get.  And when the room lighting becomes fixed at a nice little level, it's how dark can the  TV get.  And that's something...  You can educate, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I got my TV like three years ago, and the first thing I did is you got to turn on the  brightness and contrast because it's like everything's blown or washed out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It has affected the way I write reviews now, though.  I simply say, look, you're going to see how it looks in the store, but you really have  to get it dialed in right.  Or hopefully the manufacturers will provide either presets or settings that like once  you get it home, you can just click one button.  Get it right to where it should be for nighttime viewing, daytime viewing, and store mode for  the crazy...  I'm wondering if that's just the difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm also wondering if a little bit of the engineers is they tend to look at monitors,  like preview monitors, to tell if whether or not a picture's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you have something that's accurate and you compare it to what you're seeing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When they mix records, they still...  In the studio, they'll put it on some crappy speakers just to see what it's going to sound  like, what real people listen to instead of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, yeah, but audio...  The reference monitors that you use often don't sound as lively or...  Right.  So they'll put them on...  Yeah, they kind of flat.  But they do that for a person because they need to hear all the different tracks to see  if there's any...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The other cool thing about Ray's shootout too is that he put together not only all L  cost technology, which is a good rear, but arguably the best rear projection technology  out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What is this for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So people didn't know what we're...  Oh, liquid crystal and silicon.  Rather than like a DLP chip where you have mirrors that reflect light, you basically  have a liquid crystal mirror that can dim individual pixels.  And it turns out it came out of the gate doing really, really well.  The first couple displays were probably eh, but Sony's using it at JVC.  A company called Brilliant makes one of the best displays I've seen this year.  And the other thing too was the setup.  Are they cheaper?  They can be.  Typically though...  Which is a replacement for LCD, basically.  Yeah, it depends on the overall quality.  LCD projection, I should say.  Does it have the screen effect?  No, it's very minimized because of the spacing between pixels is very, very small.  That's gone.  And also the speed of the imaging system itself, it works at about 120 hertz, which is fast  enough to eliminate all flicker.  And because it doesn't incorporate a spinning color wheel, it uses actually three separate  panels and prisms, split light sources.  You don't have that rainbow artifact that you'll see on DLP TVs.  Some people are really susceptible to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I like to...  Most people don't notice until you train them to see it.  And I try to do that.  I do it all the time.  It's kind of funny.  You just give them, you know, there's ways of seeing it.  And once they start seeing it, then they see it all the time and they get really mad at  it.  And you can't un-train either.  Once you see it, you're done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Any harsh, any really fixed white line, and if you just move your eyes left and right  really quick, it almost, you'll start to see the artifact itself.  Yeah, you just see a nice rainbow.  You've done it for everyone.  Even the latest...  Pretty.  I actually want to do it with a double speed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Spinning wheels is still, you can still see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The best way to get around that is just to move to a three-chip system like they use  in digital cinema and commercial theaters.  So you don't need the wheel at all.  No.  And they're three times brighter suddenly.  So do they have RGB DLP's?  And they're three times more expensive.  Do they have?  Well, actually at CES, two companies showed off an LED lighting system to replace the  bulb that used sequential RGB LEDs, red, blue, green.  But the problem is, is that they're sequential.  So you're going to have a red flash, a blue flash, and a green flash.  I don't think that's going to eliminate the color wheel problem.  Granted, you get rid of the spinning color wheel and your bulb life suddenly skyrockets  because it's LED.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But they're coming out next month.  We'll see.  We'll get some.  Well, I see Leo's got another story up which you want to mention since we talk about corruption.  Corruption, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  AT&T apparently paid a couple of congressmen to promote this quote, preserving innovation  and telecom act, the act that actually bans municipal Wi-Fi.  According to Rushal Shaw's blog, and Preston Grohl wrote about this in his blog on CMP,  Shaw dug into AT&T campaign donations and found that the top recipient this year is  Pete Sessions, a Texas Republican.  Number two is Senator John Ensign, a Republican from Nevada.  Sessions proposed this law.  Ensign proposed a similar law in the Senate.  Basically, AT&T, now we actually were blaming Verizon before, but I think maybe AT&T now  has that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you don't even know who AT&T is anymore.  They bought out this company and that company.  They mean Pac Bell became...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  SBC bought AT&T and then renamed themselves AT&T.  So it's SBC, really.  I'm confused.  Well, we think.  Anyway, the phone company.  Wait until they change singular to AT&T.  That'll mess it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  It's all going to be AT&T.  Anyway, I just thought we hit...  Where's Judge Green when you need him?  We talked about this before, but I think that this is a little bit more of a smoking gun  in that.  They should be protesting corporations that do that sort of thing.  It's unbelievable.  That's just...  I mean, it's clearly not in the public interest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No.  These congressmen should be taken out and shot.  Suppressing Greece should want to provide...  Dick Cheney.  That would take care of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Free Wi-Fi, the greatest evil corporations have ever faced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What?  Yeah, it's trouble, I tell you.  It's trouble.  It's trouble that they're on the backbones.  Consistent free access that, oh, we might not make a whole lot of money off of, but...  We might mention that.  I mean, that's a big battle over going on right now, whether you've got Verizon blaming Google  for being a parasite on our backbone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they're going after Congress trying to get the tiered internet thing written into  the Broadband Law Act.  Let's get their names, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what is the idea?  They want to have a second paid internet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, well, no, they just want to charge everybody again.  So Google's already paying for their bandwidth, and you and I are paying to get the...  They want to charge Google and us.  Yeah.  So then they want to charge Google to go faster over the net, right?  So that's the clever part, which is we'll still deliver your traffic at the old speed,  but we're going to deliver our own traffic, in Verizon's case, at this new faster speed  and use up all the rest of the bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We've talked about this before, but there's got to be some way to kind of take back the  bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think maybe you might just have to separate...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's funny that the way it's been going, because this was predicted in the late 90s...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When the NSF, it said, we're going to privatize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then all these little ISPs bloomed all over the place, and there was a million of  them, and then there was, I guess it's not going to happen.  And then all of a sudden, over just the last few years, during the current situation in  Congress with everybody rolling over for these guys, they're becoming one big company again,  and they're taking over the internet.  They're putting the country at risk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the idea that AT&T can go by congressmen really scares me as far as the tiered internet.  I mean, it's bad enough to do killing the municipal networks, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, no kidding.  I mean, it would be just campaign contributions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not like there's enough money for people like me who are out there trying to find faster  internet connections and willing to pay for it, let alone to provide free Wi-Fi.  It doesn't have to go 8 megabit, 2 megabit, or 1 megabit, up and down for free for everyone  in major cities or wherever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not necessarily for free in some of these cases.  In some of these cases, it was going to be for pay.  It was just a municipal utility, and they said, no way, and we want all the money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wrong.  It should be like the water companies.  They've got to get back to...  I mean, I think privatization is great, but I think that some situations need to...  This is a case where it should be nationalized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You wouldn't allow a private company to run the interstate highway system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think you would just separate it like a conflict of interest.  What they used to do with media companies, like, you know...  You couldn't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  License it.  Maybe make an FCC licensing.  That's what we need.  In protest, I'll leave my router wide open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is a story that we should look at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Firefox memory leak.  It's not a bug.  It's a feature.  Actually, it is a feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know what?  I don't think so.  I was thinking about this because I didn't even think about this until I realized that  I go and hit my...  Every so often, you get on a web page that's got just so many links.  Right.  You have to be using tabs for this to happen.  I use a lot of tabs.  The next thing you know, your system is bogged down, and you go and you hit your task manager,  and Firefox is like stealing all the resources.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because what's happening is it starts to load pages.  Hundreds of megabytes.  Yeah.  It's loading these pages into cache because it thinks you may go see them.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Maybe a bad trust.  You know what?  If you have a reasonable speed, you don't...  I mean, this is an old-fashioned idea.  There's no advantage to it.  This was an idea that was years ago when you were on dial-up and there weren't pages with  a million ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Remember, people were selling these programs that would do this background downloading.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but it was when...  Because there were only maybe a few links.  But now, you go onto a web page, especially something like, say, any one of these commercial  sites, they got a hundred links to advertising and all kinds of stuff.  Now, you can't turn this off, I think.  Yeah, you can.  I got to find out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The default per tab was supposedly eight layers, or forward or backward.  So, it was like if you had surfed on that page to a couple different pages, basically  preserve the last eight pages you had been on for each tab.  And then, so if you've got a few tabs open, you've been surfing a few different pages,  suddenly that started adding up.  And just by going in and either changing it to something far smaller or zero to disable

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it.  Zero it.  I think it should be disabled.  I don't think you need this anymore.  This is an old idea that, yeah, it was great in 1993.  It should have been the default.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the default, it was a mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So anyways, and it defaults differently depending on how much system RAM you have.  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It looks at your RAM.  So, you type about colon config in there and you just, it's the browser.sessionrestory.maxtotalviewers.  You set it to zero.  It takes care of it.  Problem solved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, I didn't have this problem in Mozilla Suite, which I just stopped using when Firefox  1.0 came out.  And so this might make me switch to CMonkey.  I wonder if CMonkey does this.  Because that's the new Mozilla Suite that has the composer.  It's just a setting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I mean, I'm sure it has the capability.  Really the only question is what they set the default to be when you install the browser.  And it should probably should be turned off unless you, you know, on a slow...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's using 50% of my memory right now.  Is it?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was checked.  That's another problem I run into on websites that we mentioned.  It was just the advertising that's linked on other, it's being distributed from other  servers outside of the domain you're currently visiting.  And sometimes...  Turn that stuff off.  I was using Adblock and updated filter sets to keep, strip all ads out.  And I visit a lot of pages where I like to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think turning off ads is a good idea, especially on our site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but I ended up disabling all of that and going back to the old way I used to surf.  And I'm just amazed at how much longer things take to load up.  Oh yeah, there's a lot of jumps.  The sheer number of objects being thrown onto anyone.  Hundreds of times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a simple setting in Firefox just to say block third-party images.  Oh, okay.  Now, that kind of screws up some sites, including ours, because I sometimes put images on another  server, but you know, big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, that would screw up most sites, most bloggers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we'll get our images from another.  Yours is an example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm sure you...  I deep link a lot of stuff.  I try to don't do it with the small sites that can't afford the bandwidth.  I mean, it's usually the BBC or something, but...  Or the story that I'm linking to will have an image, I just put it up.  But people, it's very controversial that people do that.  But the fact of the matter is that you can do that legally and you can't really steal  images, put them on your own server and serve them.  That's actually a legal copyright violation.  I talked to Larry Lessig about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's better to link to somebody's image...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  From a legal perspective, but it's considered rude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, because you're sucking their bandwidth.  Yeah, but you know...  So the question is, download their image or use their bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Break the law or be rude.  Which one do you want to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm rude anyway.  I would just make an ASCII image of that and just put it on there.  What if you took a screenshot...  We need another hat.  Break the law or be rude.  What if you took a screenshot and just cropped it?  Oh, I forgot.  I have so much twit merchandise now, people have been sending me, because we said we were  going to be opening this store and we're working on doing it.  Oh yeah, so did you bring anything for us?  I forgot, and I have twit army buttons, I have...  I need a hoodie.  We got hoodies in the...  Those hoodies are sweet.  Somebody sent me twit toothbrushes.  Wow.  Yummy.  Are they used?  I have like a thousand twit...  So anyway, I'll thank you.  A thousand?  What's a twit toothbrush?  It says twit on the handle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a toothbrush.  I don't know what you get from the dentist.  It is.  This guy specializes in dental giveaways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, if he has a Sonicare attachment from my electric toothbrush, he's going to be like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're going to have to blog all the guys who did all this stuff so you can...  I got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Get this shot, I got to show you this.  This is Scott Evest.  Look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You should get an ad, you should pay for that.  That's an ad.  But this is the Scott Evest...  He did pay for it, he gave you a free hoodie.  He gave me a free hoodie, I didn't pay enough.  That's nontraditional advertising.  $30 off for the...  It's a twit hoodie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a twit hoodie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a twit hoodie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a twit hoodie.  It's got 43 zippers in the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just put your hand in my pocket.  I don't really want you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've seen that trick before.  I'm not buying it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What kind of party is this?  It's great for people.  Anyway, he has offered us $30 off.  I have to get the coupon code.  Oh, it's Twit.  Okay, so if you go to scotevest.com and you can get $30 off of...  This is only going to last until while supplies last.  You know, because I wanted to get some premiums for your Twit listeners, so he was very kind  to offer these.  No, he's not paying us to do this.  It's...  I know.  I know, I know, I know.  Let me see what the deal is.  Mr. Jordan.  Nice guy.  The Ultimate Hoodie or the Sport Tech 4.0.  So you go to scotevest.com and you can...  These are expensive.  Well, not if you get $30 off.  They're well made, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Are they?  Listen, you can't get pockets like this on your...  The hoodies, everything I've had made by him, I still have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, these are great.  No, these are great.  Okay, well, I'll try to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Even the hats.  I'll try to worm a freebie off the guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll get you one.  I'll get you one.  Hey, you know...  I have friends.  Anyway, because you know, you can't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's got a jacket with a liner in it that I really liked and a really tough, good coat,  but also...  I like his stuff.  I don't know who...  Man, you guys are unbelievable.  Hey, you worked, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Scott's a nice guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like him.  I like his products.  Party Poker.  Party what?  It just says a really...  Party Poker.  Oh, they pay big dough.  And if you're an affiliate with them, because I've been looking at affiliate systems, obviously.  So you have to pay big dough.  You have to pay big dough.  You have to pay big dough.  You have to pay big dough.  You have to pay big dough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You have to pay big dough.  You have to pay big dough.  You have to pay big dough.  So you put one of those blinking things that say,  Party Poker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's either 25 bucks or 50 bucks a person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If they sign up?  Yeah.  Or do they have to pay us?  It's really high.  It's really high.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For like the boxers, you get goldenpalace.com, like penciled in on their back or something.  Yeah.  Well, the reason I bring it up...

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, I know, it's unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  These boxers go out there and some of them sweat it off and some of them don't.  I know.  It gets kind of nasty when you hit them.  They had one the other day, a really famous boxer, a boxing fan.  I mean, this guy was like a high schooler.  I mean, this guy was like a high end guy and he's like got to sing on his own.  What is this guy?  He's making millions on this fight.  He's picking up another 50 grand or whatever they get for the hand you the envelope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That sandwich with Mary's face and the grilled cheese sandwich, they paid like 60 bucks,  thousand bucks for that.  They got money to burn these golden palace guys.  Anyway, it may be a bad business coming down the road because...  Now, I wondered, is this illegal?  And apparently it is illegal to gamble online.  Yeah, the Wire Act.  The Wire Act.  And it's of course illegal to run such an operation in the United States.  Cutting into Vegas is an action, man.  In Atlantic City.  So now there is a new law that...  Is this a new law or a proposed law?  Proposed law.  It's not a law yet.  It's a bill that says playing poker online will be a punishable offense five years in  prison.  Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is going to be a dead letter law.  They can't catch anybody and they won't enforce it.  It's ridiculous.  Five years in prison.  How are they going to catch you?  Well, they know what you're doing.  Go sit in the library and play.  The Congressmen.  I just wrote something on the deep packet analysis stuff that's going on now.  They're trying to...  The big companies...  Cisco's got some new gear where you can say, ah, this traffic that we're getting here is  Skype.  Right.  Then they want to charge you more.  Ah, see that'll go online.  So one of the phone companies will get...  And Cisco doesn't care.  They sell their grandma down the river to sell an extra router.  They build a router that does all this stuff and then it's expensive and they sell it to  the phone companies.  The phone companies use it and they say, well, the way we're going to charge you for your  connection is that if you have local and non-discount service with us, it's going to be this much.  If you use VOIP, you're going to be charged an extra so many cents a minute or whatever.  We know that you're using it.  You say, well, how are you going to even know?  With these new deep packet analysis systems, you can see that it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, it's brilliant because then they can charge you for your ISP.  They can charge the other companies for the bandwidth.  They can charge Vonage Extra to carry the VOIP and then they can charge you extra to use  the VOIP.  They're making money four times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there are quite a few people who listen to it who cannot in fact use BitTorrent because  their ISP is sniffing for BitTorrent.  Not just the ports, but they're sniffing for BitTorrent packets.  That's bit discrimination.  It's a bit discrimination.  And that's why BitTorrent is starting to put encryption into its protocol so that it will  hide what's going on and in fact allow people to use BitTorrent.  I guess that's what will have to happen.  I think Skype's doing that now.  Actually that was a big story this week because the feds can't wiretap Skype.  Well, hasn't it always been that way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Every VOIP package I've looked at includes pretty high-grade encryption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't they have Echelon or something?  There's ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if you're a terrorist, you just use a free Skype and they can't tap you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, you would have...  The SIP network stuff, same way.  You would have the encryption in place, but with this analysis, I'm sure you can still  tell that it's a phone call.  You could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sure it would take you a lot longer to crack it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You go overseas and buy the stuff though that's technically uncrackable.  You could probably know that there is a tunnel between party A and party B. You don't know  what traffic's on that tunnel.  You just know that there is a connection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think through analysis you should be able to figure it out.  And then we have the quantum encryption on a chip.  I think there's guys that can take a look at that stream and say, ah, that's typical  of a phone connection.  But they might not know what's in it.  Yeah, they don't need to know what's in it.  They just need to know what is one and then they can charge you another dollar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or for the terrorists, they need to know what's in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think terrorists are using Skype from a cave in Afghanistan.  They hate freedom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It says security experts are not completely convinced that Skype is as secure as it seems  because the company hasn't made its technology open to review.  But according to Bruce Schneier, security expert, if Skype's encryption is weaker than  believed it still would stymie the kind of broad eavesdropping that the NSA is reputed  to be performing the echelon type stuff because they're not going to, you know, even if it's  only 40 bit encryption, they're not going to crack all of these streams to figure out  what's going on.  He says even a weekly encrypted call would force a neistropper to spend hours of time  cracking it.  So my privacy of voice is illegal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  These guys are using throwaway phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Skype says there are no back doors that could let government bypass the encryption.  However, he says they cooperate fully with all lawful requests from relevant authorities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I gave up on Gizmo.  I couldn't get it off my system.  I mean, it would know it's just always boot all the time and I couldn't cancel the things.  A lot of applications do that.  I don't like that.  It's I guess and I couldn't figure a way to stop it from doing that.  Nothing's worse than Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Quick time is my other big stick it to them.  You uncheck the boxes during the install.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It just sticks itself right back in and you say don't install it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't install it as my primary music player.  Don't take over all my associations for my programs.  Uncheck that.  Uncheck the other thing.  It says don't start on Windows startup.  And both things happen immediately.  And it's just like, oh, and then I got to go back in and suddenly, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You have to use the third party program to actually uncheck it.  It's terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really?  No, no.  You can go in after it's installed and find all this in the buried menu system of Quick  Time.  Find the preferences and undo it.  Why give me that thing during the install that gives me the impression that it would  be a deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's like, well, you know, Quick Time.  What is that Intel story?  Like the button that just doesn't do anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's an interesting Skype story as well.  Well, apparently he's done a deal with Skype.  Oh, yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In fact, I thought, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The lockout, right?  The conference limiting.  This is a bad idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Skype currently is limited to five people in a conference.  The host and four others.  That's why we have five people on Twitter.  In theory, you could do a lot more.  In fact, there's one service that allows you to do 500.  Now bandwidth is going to be an issue at that point.  But with the new Skype, you can get up to 10, but only if you're using an Intel processor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  In fact, the CPU ID on startup goes into a file somewhere that just looks at it and says,  ah, that's an AMD chip.  Sorry, it's not going to work.  There's no technical reason for that.  This is a ridiculous situation.  In fact, these people should be ashamed of themselves, both Intel and Skype, for doing  this deal.  I expected of Skype, and I don't blame Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do.  Well, it's eBay, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, but what does Intel think?  What's the point?  And the other thing is, how long do you think a workaround is not going to be created to  fix this problem?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, if I'm an AMD user, I use Gizmo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Screw that.  There's a lot of common features.  There's a lot of common features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe they're just looking at enterprise users where people have to replace a bunch of…

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, are they making the claim that, well, Intel's SSE is better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, they're not.  The whole thing is it's got nothing to do with anything except it's just a sweet deal.  So I guess they threw a bunch of money at them.  There had to be some money going into it.  I think that's…  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it's sleazy.  It's a profit thing.  It's sleazy.  Yeah.  I moved to AMD.  I'm not looking back anytime soon.  So, GeneX has shipped a rootkit with Mr. and Mrs. Smith on the DVD.  Only in Europe, though.  We don't have to worry about it here.  Germany, right?  Germany.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, there's no info on what the rootkit's…  Most of the black sites are in Germany that copy stuff.  This is copy protection.  I don't know how it works, but…

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The rootkit replaces…  It doesn't…  This is a rootkit…

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a cloaking mechanism.  So I think maybe calling it a rootkit is a little bit…  Cloaking device.  …a little bit much because it doesn't hide files or registry entries.  It merely hides the process.  So when you hit control, I'll delete, you can't see that the copy protection is running.  But files aren't hidden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm telling you, the auto-play feature on Windows systems is probably one of the second  evil things about that entire…  Just hold down the shift key.  It bypasses it.  If you insert a disk…  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just hold down the shift keys.  You put that disk in.  Yeah.  Just turn it off.  Yeah.  You know what?  I guess it is.  You don't need it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Because what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Every DVD has…  And your actual player is a piece of junk.  Garbage.  Complete garbage.  Yeah.  But the show has turned negative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Alcohol has updated recently.  They've got a brand new virtual drive that I haven't had any problems with any of the  new copy protections.  Ooh.  Although some of the new copy protections, they won't copy though.  Here's a happy…  That's the thing.  What's the…  I just don't want to put the disk in every time I'm switching between three different  games.  That's the problem I run into.  I used to have three optical drives in my system for that problem, but now I have a  new system with just one.  I used to make virtual drives and just mount the images.  But most of these new copy protections now just refuse to work off of any kind of virtual  drive.  Here's a happy story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are hacks for that.  A happy story.  A happy story.  Hookers are asking families…  Hookers.  Hookers are asking families…  You need more stories about a Hookers.  Don't let your kids buy Grand Theft Auto.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, because…

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is there an upsurge in Hookers getting beat up by kids?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think the term is… correct term is prostitute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what they call themselves, sex workers, actually.  Sex workers is what we should call them.  The site is SwapUSA, Sex Workers Outreach Project USA.  They're asking parents to assist them in calling for a ban on the game because it promotes  violence against sex workers and everybody else.  Yeah.  Really.  Everybody gets beat up in that game.  I think it's anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ignorant.  Yeah, the cops get shot and everything.  It's terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and I can ride a tricycle around for days on end.  It's an open-ended sandbox.  You know, it's funny.  My kid…

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can do anything in that game.  That's what my kid is saying.  He's saying, Dad, get me Grand Theft Auto.  And I promise, what I'll do is I'll ride the bike out into the country and we'll  just ride around.  You can.  You can.  Yeah, you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But you think that's what he's going to do?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Get it to him.  The kids love that game.  You know, the thing is that…

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And whip the gun out the side.  The kids get bored with it and they go through this process.  You should just let it happen.  Let it get through the system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look for the union label.  I'm disappointed in prostitutes right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That better not be the general opinion of all of them.  That's some ignorant talk right there.  It's on the bed.  Video games and violence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Pod fading?  You guys hear about that?  One guy stopped his podcast and has big news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is how overheated this whole podcasting thing has gotten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You just can't sleep ever.  Just to keep up to date on everything.  Blogger stops blog.  Stop the presses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was a podcast about serenity, right?  And there was a couple and they had some kids and they got a job and they said, well, we  can't really do this anymore.  Now it's pod fading.  Well, it was the official loss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or not the official, but the loss.  They had to quit because of their jobs too.  So maybe that's part of the pod fading.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do we have jobs?  What is the deal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're the one that gets to put the podcast together.  You're obviously unemployed.  I am basically unemployed.  He's self-employed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I do a podcast with Roger on Sundays just for the…  We're all self-employed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A message has been handed to me.  At the end.  Oh, we have to thank Adolf Gasser Studios in San Francisco.  That's where we are today.  Right.  Gasser, probably one of the best named camera and photography companies in the world.  It's a pretty spectacular…  And video accessories is great.  We got our cameras at Gasser's, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And we buy a lot of equipment.  Yeah, they supply the pros.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They supply the pros and us, which is pretty amazing.  I think I don't have anything else.  I mean, there were a lot of other stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, there's the Dutch cartoon thing, you know.  The Danish?  Danish, what am I saying?  That's not a tech story.  That thing is gut.  That's a terrible story.  It's just crazy.  It's not a tech story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do think it's interesting that Halo 2 will only ship on Vista, not on XP.  Who cares?  Okay, I don't either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Direct TV on the Xbox 360?  How about the…  Let's see some new game.  I'm just looking at the list here.  Really?  There's some Ars Technica article saying that they found a tab reserved for Direct TV in  the Xbox 360.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got to deal with Microsoft rolling.  I just hooked up that media connect so I can do my Media Center PC to the Xbox now and stream  stuff back and forth.  And I'm starting to dig that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Makes sense, though.  It's like every science fiction book ever written.  There's only going to be two companies in the world and they're all going to…  Every restaurant will be Taco Bell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sorry, I called it a tab.  It's a blade, right?  It's a blade.  Please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My mistake.  I can't wait for the PS3, though.  I'm not buying an Xbox 360.  Those games fuzzers are sore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just want to see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I like the Xbox 360.  I think it's cool.  You love it.  You've always said you love it.  It's a little noisy.  I like it.  Mine's not noisy.  People get noisy ones, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really?  Your power cord is bursting.  No, I mean it's louder than the TV.  It's actually a pretty good fan and it's louder than that.  Maybe what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  TV projectors are loud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's not as loud as a TV projector.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You won't be able to run a Vista or you at least won't get this Aero Glass unless you  have a DirectX 9C video card.  But that's not all video cards.  It's not even most video cards, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All current video cards, all the current high-end, anything, any of the latest generation from  any video or ATI, any of the last two generations would support that.  The bigger issue is HDCP support, the high-bandwidth copy protection system that they use.  Right now you cannot build a system that will support the full resolution of Blu-ray or  HDVD when it ships.  You're going to be basically forced to down-res it because no current card supports encrypted

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  output.  So if you were going to build a machine for Vista and you plan to play high-res DVDs or

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  something.  Yeah.  All current video cards will not provide that full resolution support.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When you were explaining to me, some of them say they have HDCP support and they don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  ATI has a couple of cards that have been listed on their page.  Old cards too that say HDCP supported.  Yes, I guess technically you could, but there's physically no encryption chip on there with  the unique key that identifies that card that can make the handshake with another HDCP display.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So they support HDCP, they just don't support unencrypted.  It doesn't work.  They can't fix it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It requires adding a chip and I think they should just confuse the situation further  by just saying they're HDCP ready.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've been waiting for TV manufacturers for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It also depends on too how soon, there's really no reason to have at this point to have an  HDCP enabled video card on a computer because there's nothing we can currently use it with.  But in the next few months, if the timelines are holding right, we'll have the PC drives  for Blu-ray.  They were saying March, I don't know.  It's going to happen by March.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Couple more stories and we're going to wrap this up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't see this one, no.  The mayor of New York City, Michael Bloomberg, is walking through the legislative offices  of Albany for the city and he's getting a tour and office assistant Ed Greenwood, the  ninth.  The ninth?  Wow.  That's what it says here.  I had no idea.  I don't even know.  IX, you ever see IX after a name?  Maybe that's his last name is IX.  Ed Greenwood IX was going over some papers at his desk.  The mayor comes over, they pose with a photographer for a picture.  The mayor looks at his desk.  He's running Solitaire on the computer.  The mayor leaves, calls the boss at the office.  This guy's a jerk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Fire this guy.  Bloomberg's a jerk.  That's so 1950s gangster movies.  He's been playing Solitaire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The guy, Greenwood IX, earned $27,000 a year.  Oh please.  He'd been working there for six.  The guy's lucky and he lives in New York?  How does he afford it?  He was lucky to be fired.  No, he's up in Albany.  Well, still.  He was lucky he was fired.  He'd been working there for six years.  How old is this guy?  He says, I don't know, he says in a telephone interview, he limited his play time to his  one hour lunch break or during quick breaks when he needed a moment of distraction.  Well, that's a lie, but it's a good lie.  No, you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's probably, it could be true.  He makes $26,000 a year, he's cutting some slack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The idea that you can work every minute of your work day from nine until five is a bad  idea.  People won't be productive if you make them do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This poor guy, he's got a kid, a toddler, a baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Someone should go to Mayor Bloomberg's office and see what the hell's on his desktop running.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He probably can't even use a computer.  Tetris.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Bloomberg can use a computer.  It's probably a planter.  Michael Bloomberg.  It's a myth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I, you know, he has a company.  I mean, it's like the couple of guys, Finis, Connor, you know, these guys who did the hard  day, they didn't use computers.  They were just manufacturers, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's like those guys, the executive producers of the Oxygen shows back when it  was this great big integrated network, they had their assistants print out their emails  for them.  This was in the dot com boom days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oxygen, another Paul Allen adventure.  Oh, let's not go there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, god.  Microsoft's anti-spyware program uninstalls Norton antivirus.  Well, that's a good thing.  Partially.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It doesn't even do a good job of it.  It just messes up the registry so you can't fix it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's brilliant.  So they botched the only good thing they tried to do.  It's hard to uninstall Norton, actually.  Yeah, it's really, it's one of those programs you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Somebody sent me a white program, but I'm not going to.  They made an honest mistake that they called it spyware.  Is that malware?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know what the deal is.  According to Microsoft, it's, hey, it's a beta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hey, it's a beta.  It's a beta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Everything's beta.  The Google defense.  Yeah, we were supposed to get a lot more, but you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is Gmail still beta?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Skype is beta.  And they got Scholar.  Have you seen that?  You know why?  That's a new one.  You've seen Scholar.  I heard about that.  In fact, it's pretty, it's actually almost useless, but it looks up all these scholarly  papers that you have to pay for.  I mean, you find all these papers because there's all these weird sites that, and they  have all this cool stuff on there, but then you can't read any of it.  You can get to the abstracts usually.  I was looking something up the other day and I ran into the beta of Google Scholar.  That's a good idea.  I like Scholar.  It's very cool, but you know, when you realize, you don't realize until you go there that  there are all these sites that have all this scholarly stuff that, and you can't look at  any of it because they want you to pay them.  It's not a website.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ten bucks or whatever.  Consumer Reports does that too.  Can't look at anything on this site unless you have a subscription.  It's a cheap one.  Totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they don't have ads.  So Google, what's your target price now?  Same, 500.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's got to take a, it's got some profit taking.  I mean, come on.  It was up yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I noticed it was up a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It'll get back on track, I think.  All I need is one, two.  Is Google evil?  Two good quarters in a row.  I think they're evil now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why?  You do not?  They've bounced over.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  They're now evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is bull.  We actually have tried to go through two weeks worth of news in one show, and I think we're  probably running out of time here.  I want to thank everybody for showing up.  It's nice to see you.  Tom Merritt, please come back.  Yeah, thanks for having me.  And send Molly over too from CNET's Buzz Out Loud.  That's the Buzz Out Loud podcast.  She does, of course, Anchor Desk, which is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She does the Buzz Report.  The Buzz Report, I'm sorry.  Rafe Needleman does Anchor Desk.  Oh, is Rafe doing that?  Oh, Rafe's great.  I love Rafe.  We should have him on too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, sure.  I'm sure he's doing a great job.  Roger now is employed.  Yes.  And we're glad to see that with DLTV, as is Robert Heron.  Yeah.  Pretty soon we're going to be outnumbered here by the DLTV crew.  It's growing.  John C. Dvorak, dvorak.org slash blog.  Patrick couldn't be here, was a little under the weather.  Get well soon, Patrick.  And I guess we want to thank our friends at AOL Radio for providing us with the bandwidth  and posting this show on their podcast channel.  Don't forget the hoodies, not a Twit hoodie, but a Scott Evest hoodie at Scott Evest's  website, $30 off if you use the Twit coupon code.  Also on the...  Whatever that other thing was.  I can't even remember.  It's going to be on the blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Go ahead and check it out there.  Twit.tv.  I'm not even getting paid for this.  We like it so much we forgot.  I forgot.  We've got to start getting paid for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're thinking about it.  Actually, there's a big meeting in New York.  Big meeting.  One that some of us are going to go to.  We're supposed to tape something for that big meeting.  We'll tape something.  Yeah.  But for now, it's time to put this thing to bed.  Another Twit is in the can.

Transcript:  I'm going to have to go to the bathroom in the middle of the show.  Thanks.  Somebody said, they weren't paying attention.  They had the perfect opportunity to say,  another Twit is in the can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That took you a week to figure that one out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Somebody else, somebody sent me an email saying they should have said that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I should have said it.  I don't know what I'm going to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Too much work.  The problem is, there's no limit.  My server's completely collapsed.  So here's the deal.  I'm just trying to get the thing up, but I have the hell of a time.  What blue screen's like?  Forget it.
