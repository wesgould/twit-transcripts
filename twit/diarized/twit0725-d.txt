Transcript:  January, June 29th, 2007.  Let me get my numbers right.  June 29th, 2007, 12 years ago.  The iPhone hit the stores.  I remember, did any of you wait in line  or do anything to get-  Oh yeah.  What'd you do, Jason?

Start time: 264.84
End time: 282.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was in line for five or six hours.  Me too.  It was just about this time on that day.  I kid you not.  I remember it being between 5.30 and six  when finally the first person got one  and I think I was 12th or something in line.  Wow.

Start time: 282.78
End time: 317.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I wasn't gonna go to the city to the Apple Store,  which is where the faithful went.  But I knew the line would be,  I knew the line had started three days earlier, basically.  So I went to our AT&T store here,  hoping they would have enough units.  And I was like seventh or eighth in line.  The people, the guys in front of me  had come all the way up from Google, from Mountain View,  two hours south of us,  because for the same reason,  so they came to the Petaluma AT&T store  and we were talking, he said,  yeah, I've just pulled three all-nighters  getting Google Reader ready for the iPhone.  Wow.  That was a wasted effort.

Start time: 317.32

End time: 329.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was still in college and so I did not have the money  for an iPhone.  It was one of those things.  I also was a teamable customer.  I really wanted one, but I was like, yeah, no.  This is my rent.

Start time: 330.72
End time: 334.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You would have had to move to AT&T  because they had an exclusive on it.

Start time: 334.38
End time: 337.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly, and not only that,  but then it was like $700 or something.

Start time: 338.79
End time: 353.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, no, it was expensive.  Walt Mossberg tweeted, the reason I know this,  he tweeted, oh yeah, my first review of the iPhone,  this is his 2007 review,  it's still up on the web at allthingsd.com.  He noted it was a very expensive $499.

Start time: 356.20
End time: 359.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, so it was $500.  Regardless, that was 500 more than I had.

Start time: 361.58
End time: 365.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, it's still expensive,  but a lot less than a modern iPhone.  It's half what a modern iPhone is.

Start time: 365.48
End time: 377.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, totally.  Though, to be fair, you were still in a contract.  It wasn't subsidized.  In subsequent years, they would sell it for $199 or $299  and it was subsidized.  In that case, it was not subsidized,  but you still had a contract.

Start time: 378.54
End time: 427.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's fascinating to read Walt's review  because on the one hand,  Walt was smart enough to realize this was very important.  He said the iPhone, the headline is,  the iPhone is a breakthrough handheld computer.  He understood right away, this isn't a phone particularly.  This is a computer.  He says the phone's minimum price is a hefty $499,  but people are already,  three days before the phone comes out,  lining up outside Apple stores  for when they go on sale Friday evening.  He said it's not a great phone, again,  the beginning of the not such great phone.  So I think it's funny that he talks about how thin it is  and how big the screen,  it has the largest and highest resolution screen  of any smartphone we've seen  and the most internal memory by far.  Anybody remember how much internal?

Start time: 427.88
End time: 447.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was four or eight.  They would do both.  And then they ended up dropping the four gigabyte model  because they dropped the price within like 60 days.  And there was a big kerfuffle over that,  but they dropped the price really soon  and they got rid of the four gigabyte option.  And then they added that spring before the 3G  and eight gigabyte or a 16 gigabyte option,  if I remember.

Start time: 448.28
End time: 452.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's right.  So it came in 499, you got four gigabytes of storage.

Start time: 453.20
End time: 463.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See, okay, so I was right.  It was $600 for the eight gigabyte.  $600 for the one you wanted.  That's right.  Exactly.  I do it close to 700 for the tax and stuff.  No, this is making sense.  And I was like, wait, was I that off on price?  Yeah, no.

Start time: 464.66
End time: 478.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Also, no support for 3G.  It was edge only on the AT&T network,  which meant it was pig slow.  It didn't have cut and paste.  And most importantly, it didn't have an app store.  I remember when Steve announced it,  he said, well, you don't need,  all you need is the web.

Start time: 479.10
End time: 513.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It was on 2G and all you needed was the web,  which was just made it painfully, really painful.  I remember going to a meeting of some developers  here in Houston where someone had been to a session  at Apple where they had taught him how to program  these web apps.  And he was explaining this to them.  And they all said, but it's 2G, but it's 2G.  And it was, the devs knew what was coming  and that it was going to be the kind of things  they were gonna have to do in order to make it even work.

Start time: 513.56
End time: 516.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Did you have to wait in line to get it, Dwight, or?

Start time: 517.62
End time: 543.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I did not get one right away.  I waited till the 3G,  S. Smart.  Or rather the 3G.  But the one thing that I did do is I went and interviewed  all these people in line, even in Houston.  And if I remember right, it was raining that night here.  Oh wow.  And so they were out in with umbrellas and in tents.  And of course being Houston, it was really hot and rainy.  So it was like a sauna.  And I thought these people were crazy.

Start time: 544.18
End time: 569.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Reading again from Walt's review,  the phone is simply beautiful.  It's thinner.  Can you get me my phone?  Is somebody there to go?  Oh yeah, I've got one here too.  Yeah, my phone's in the back cupboard there in my museum.  The iPhone is simply beautiful.  It's thinner than the skinny Samsung Blackjack,  yet almost its entire surface is covered by a huge,  vivid three and a half inch display.

Start time: 571.84
End time: 574.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But at the time, that and the fact that it was capacitive,

Start time: 575.36
End time: 576.60
Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  that was so huge.

Start time: 576.84
End time: 583.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I remember going and playing with it and being like,  looking down at my trio and being like,  I hate you so much.

Start time: 584.94
End time: 681.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's like two things I remember from that first week,  or first few weeks with the iPhone,  because it was so slow.  The typing was a nightmare  because on that three and a half screen,  it was just tough.  But I remember going into a Home Depot,  and I had to buy this part,  and it was like a plumbing or electric,  something at the house was messed up.  And I forgot to look up whatever,  sort of the size of something.  And I was there and I was like,  oh shoot, I forgot to do that.  And then I was like, oh, hang on, wait.  On the iPhone, I could just look this up on the web.  And it took forever.  It probably took five minutes to load.  But I looked up which part I needed,  and I was like, oh, I was able to do this.  Because before, you try to do that on a Trio,  or one of these Windows mobile devices at the time,  and it was just brutal trying to look up a webpage  on those devices.  And eventually, it wouldn't load,  or parts of it would fail,  and you'd just be like, forget it.  Whatever, in this case,  I would have just gone back home  and figured out what I needed.  So I remembered that.  And then I was still a little unconvinced.  I remember my review at the time was kind of like,  still even handed.  Like clearly, this was the future of phones.  But I couldn't really advise anybody  to go out and buy it right that moment, right?  Because most people were paying 100 to 200 bucks for a phone  on contract at that point, versus having to pay.  You really couldn't recommend anybody get the four gig.  You're like, if you're gonna do this,  you're gonna have to just get the eight.  You know?  Four gigs.  Four gigs.  But no apps.

Start time: 681.60
End time: 683.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You didn't have to worry about putting apps on.  Yeah, but the operating system

Start time: 684.00
End time: 687.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  must have taken more than half the storage.  It did, it took a bunch.

Start time: 687.16
End time: 693.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you're gonna take any photos, or do video, or anything.  People were using it as an iPod,  which a lot of people use it as an iPod, right?

Start time: 694.08
End time: 708.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So Walt said in our tests, we were able to get 1,000,  how many songs?  More than 1,000 songs on there.  So, you know, it's the size,  remember, five gig iPod was 1,000 songs in your pocket,  the original iPod.

Start time: 708.44
End time: 790.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I had an iPod Nano at the time that was like eight gigs.  Well, that's the thing, yeah.  That was, that little tiny thing was eight gigs.  And I was like, ooh, I don't wanna carry this,  and the iPhone, both.  But I remember where I really became a believer was,  I wanna say this was like a month into testing it,  a month or two.  My daughter was only, she was three at the time.  And when I set the phone down,  I'd been taking some pictures with it,  and I had been showing her the pictures  and that kind of thing.  And I was like, oh, you know, that picture that we took,  and she picked up the phone, swiped to unlock,  tapped the phone, and started flipping through.  And I was like, holy crap,  like the three-year-old has already figured out  how to use this thing.  Like, this is incredible.  Because you know how it was back then,  if you were trying to get,  I remember trying to teach people  how to just get to the phone app  to make a call on a Windows phone,  or a Trio, or something like that.  They're like, look, I know I can get my messages on this,  but how do I make a phone call?  And people would just freak out  at figuring out how to do the simplest things.  And you know, when this thing was that easy to use,  I was like, okay, yeah, this is something different,  and this is gonna be pretty special.

Start time: 790.26
End time: 841.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Walt said the 8GIG model held 1,000 third-unit songs,  a dozen videos, and get this, over 100 photos.  I took 100 photos yesterday.  And over 100 emails, including some attachments.  This is not the original iPhone.  This is the 3GS, but it's the same size and form factor.  Put it next to a Samsung Galaxy Note 10,  and you can see how far we've come.  And yet, this is so important, this phone.  This is really, if you look back now,  I think Walt undersold how important this phone  was gonna be, and he saw, I think, the importance of it.  But this was the beginning of carrying a supercomputer  in your pocket, having full 24-7 access to the internet,  always on, always connected.  That is life-changer, and we've seen that  in the 12 years intervening.  I think our lives have changed 100%.

Start time: 843.68
End time: 876.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, without a doubt.  I mean, I think it's funny.  Sometimes people think that you're being hyperbolic,  and I remember the 10th anniversary,  I wrote something about how it changed,  like that you can't make any, you know,  it's been one of the most important technological advances  in our lifetime, and I think that's absolutely true.  I mean, you could maybe say the microcomputer or whatever  is the only thing that might have the same amount  of impact, because when we think about what our lives  were like 12 years ago and what they are now,  they're so different, and the primary driver  on why they're different is the phone.

Start time: 876.54
End time: 885.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, we talk about Twitter and Facebook,  but without the phone, Twitter and Facebook  aren't as powerful. Those wouldn't exist.  Yeah, I mean, they might exist,  but they wouldn't be very important.

Start time: 886.24
End time: 905.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When the history of the smartphone is written,  all those other devices, the Trio and the Blackberry,  all the various Windows mobile devices,  those will all be preludes.  They will all be proto-devices to when it really happened  when the iPhone arrived.

Start time: 905.96
End time: 927.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's also important because we are now  in the midst of new technologies.  I don't know if there is a technology  as important as the iPhone in our midst today,  but we do see things like VR and augmented reality,  and it's very primitive, very simple, very unusable.  It's important to remember, so was the iPhone,  even when it first came out.  Is this it?  But it accelerated quickly.

Start time: 927.60
End time: 929.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, it got to the point.  A lot of iPhones, but not the right one.

Start time: 929.92
End time: 930.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It did.

Start time: 930.98
End time: 964.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It got to the point within, I'd say,  the second generation where it actually was usable  by most people, and certainly having 3G helped it a lot.  I mean, it made a leap very quickly.  I had a Blackjack at the time that it came out,  and I loved my Blackjack until I saw people  using the original iPhone, and even though it was slow,  I had to have one where I could afford it, and I did.  And I think a lot of people were like that.  It made the leap, I'd say, within two years  to being an essential device.

Start time: 964.52
End time: 972.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And very famously, Google was already developing  its first Android phone, saw the iPhone,  and said, back to the drawing board.  They threw everything out.  Right.

Start time: 973.24
End time: 988.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep, they said, we're no longer gonna be taking  on Windows Mobile and Blackberry,  and instead this is going to be what we go after,  which is obviously the right move.  A little bit complicated by the fact  that Eric Schmidt was on the Apple board,  but that aside, I mean, that's something  that's right in the big view.  Which, by the way, I gotta point out,

Start time: 988.50
End time: 1012.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Steve Jobs never forgave him.  He said Eric stole everything.  Oh, of course not.  There it is, that's the old, that's our old baby.  There you go.  Let me see if I was rich enough.  Yes, I got an eight gig.  By the way, every once in a while we fire this up.  I think the last time, Christina was on the 10th anniversary,  and it still works.  So I got all my phone numbers on there.  In my old songs, I was apparently very much  into Britney Spears at the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oldest clothing.  Yeah, and if you have an Android phone now,  and I do, and I think there's some real,  I mean, I love my Samsung, you still owe it to Apple.  These black slabs of glass wouldn't exist without Apple.  And by the way, without Steve Jobs,  who, I mean, we've all read now the stories  of that first demo in January of 2007,  where that thing barely worked, but he sold it, man.  He made it the thing you had to have.

Start time: 1049.04
End time: 1141.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That relationship with the carriers too,  one thing that gets overlooked is,  he had the mojo to go in there  and change the relationship between phone makers  and carriers, because the carriers really dominated  how phones were designed and built back then,  and they strong-armed all of the phone makers  into making the phones that they wanted,  and they did most of the marketing,  and they did most of the, again, the design  and the integration of the way the phones were made.  They did a lot of those decisions,  and Steve Jobs went in and said,  "'No, we think we can handle this better.  "'Look, we have a lot of loyal users  "'who are gonna be interested in this device,  "'and we think we can handle that,  "'and if you wanna be part of it,  "'then we'll give you an exclusive,  "'and you'll be the one to have this device,  "'because look, it's gonna be great,  "'and you wanna be part of it.'"  And that did forever change the shift, the balance of power,  and put phone makers back in charge,  and for the better, right?  Because not only Apple, but a lot of others came on,  HTC, Samsung, and others quickly, LG at the time,  even though since they've had their challenges,  but they came in and followed up on what the iPhone did,  and innovated that then a lot of the features  they worked on eventually came into iPhone as well,  and it really unleashed this innovation,  this wave of innovation that wouldn't have happened  unless it was decoupled from the carriers  and the way that it was.  I don't think-

Start time: 1142.61
End time: 1155.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, but you wanna know something?  They're still imitating.  I know.  This is the LG V50 ThinQ, the Sprint 5G phone.  What does this look like?  This looks like-

End time: 1163.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Like a big iPhone, what the hell?  It even has the notch.  They're even imitating the notch.  It does.  Yeah, the notch is like-

Start time: 1163.74
End time: 1168.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  In fact, people will see this on my desk and say,  "'Oh, you got a new iPhone.'"

Start time: 1169.30
End time: 1297.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'd have to say, "'No, I didn't.'"  But to be fair, there's not a whole lot you could do.  I mean, this form factor is that way,  because that's the way it is.  You gotta be a black slab of glass,  gotta be edge to edge.  How many-  But that notch.  You're not gonna make it round.  You're not gonna make it a pyramid.  Oh, the notch.  That notch that everybody made fun of when it came out.  Yeah, I know, but you know what?  The Samsung doesn't have a notch.  It has a cutout.  I have the OnePlus 7 Pro now,  which has instead of, actually, it's a perfect black slab.  And the front-facing camera comes rising out of the top of it,  which is pretty hysterical.  Everybody's not slavishly copying Apple.  They did drop the headphone jack on a number of those phones,  which I guess is a slavish copy.  But still, you hold this in your hand,  you realize how important it was.  It's hard to believe.  I don't think we knew when Steve announced this  that he was sick,  but he died only four and a half years later.  He was already deathly ill.  This was his really,  this and the iPad were his last great creations.  And to his credit,  I don't think this exists without Steve Jobs  and one other guy, Johnny Ive.  And that takes us to our second story  because it was this week we learned that Johnny Ive,  who really has only been half there anyway,  apparently is calling him Mark Gurman,  only goes in two days a week anyway,  has finally admitted he is leaving Apple.  And that really is the end of the era, I think.  I think the best quote comes from John Gruber,  who says, let me see if I can,  it's right at the end of his article,  I don't worry that Apple is in trouble  because Johnny Ive is leaving.  I worry that Apple's in trouble  because he's not being replaced.  I don't know who you'd replace him with,  but what's happening is the design team,  Evans Hankey, vice president of industrial design,  and Alan Dye, vice president of human interface design,  are gonna report to Apple's COO, Jeff Williams,  in a way this feels like the end  of the design era at Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, Gruber's point, and which I think is a good one,  is just that nobody's gonna replace Johnny Ive, right?  Like with the iPhone, right?  He designed something that's gonna have impact  for decades after he's gone, very likely, if not longer.  But the position, chief design officer,  because of Apple being such a design-centric company,  that is critical.  And to not have that, I think is,  and that is what Gruber said, and I think he said it best,  because that is critical, and for them not to do that,  not even to try to replace him, not to,  whether it's if you are going to move somebody up internal,  or you're gonna go find somebody at another brand,  or bring somebody up from the outside,  the way they did with Angela Ahrens  when they wanted to take the retail stores  to the next level.  Not doing that, not committing to that,  is what is questionable, and it's what worries people,  because there has been, beyond this year,  where there have been a really pretty interesting  and exciting wave of some new products,  their design chops have been called into question  the last few years,  and their commitment to design in the same way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I think you're exactly correct.  I mean, they were obviously,  I think some of the best industrial design work  and some of the best consumer electronic work was done  because of the two of them, and because Johnny Ive is,  and he's so young, he's like 52,  which just makes me feel completely inadequate.  He's done a lot.  Yeah, he has, I'm saying.  He's done so much.

Transcript:  And then Jobs came back.  He was gonna leave, and John Rubenstein  and Jobs were able to convince him to stay.  But no, I mean, I think that the two of them together,  you're right, they had this sort of synergy,  but I don't know if it's fair to say that when Steve passed  that he wasn't able to do the right things.  I always got this sense from reading the various profiles  of him in places like the New Yorker  and Financial Times and things like that  that his personal interests kind of shifted.  He was all in on the watch.  I think the watch was he was all in on,  and that was supposed to be,  it was very much marketed in the beginning  as a piece of jewelry and as a fashion kind of timepiece.  And that didn't work, and so they had to pivot to health,  which obviously did.  But when you make that pivot, the design  and the things that go into that kind of design  become a little bit less important, I think you could argue.  He got really interested in doing the space ship.  Yeah, Apple Park.  And so I don't know, I mean, I don't know the guy,  but it wouldn't seem unfair to say,  okay, you've been at this job for 27 years  and your own personal interests and the things you like.  And if you look at his other collaborations  that he's done with his friend Mark Newsome,  maybe he has just a different aesthetic  and different things he's interested in.  And maybe that was related to Steve Dine, maybe it wasn't,  I don't know, but I don't feel like-

The G4 cube is-  I love that though.  Man, was that a great computer.  And it's a great design, it didn't work.  It cracked.

And yeah, you definitely see the iMac,  Bondi iMac in that.  He did this crazy-  I've just learned that we got rid of our,  we had a 20th century, 20th anniversary Mac.  But when we moved studios, we got rid of a lot of stuff.  I hope somebody, Apple went to a good home.  Probably Alex Gumpel got it.  There's the cube.  I loved my cube, but you're right.  It wasn't a smart design.

Transcript:  You know, what surprised me when the announcement came  that Johnny was leaving was almost immediately,  there was, as you said, Leo, this criticism  of Johnny Ive's designs that essentially  they have driven the entire industry to devices  that aren't repairable, that can't be, that aren't modular.  Mice you can't charge while you're using.  Right, right, right.  And it is, to a certain extent, I think they're right.  But I think that the, if you look at the things  that were happening about the time of the iPhone  and around the time of the iPad, that was already in play.  I think there were a lot of things coming at the time.  Things were getting thinner, things were getting smaller.  And I think I've just took it to its natural progression.  I'm not sure that he deserves all the criticism  that he's gotten.

Start time: 1644.38
End time: 1662.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Maybe not, although Gruber does point out  that if you hadn't had the Apple design team  insisting on thinner and thinner laptops,  you probably wouldn't have the butterfly keyboard.  Apple wouldn't be so dug in on this keyboard  that clearly is a failure.  And that hurt Apple, honestly.  Oh yeah.  No, that's not what I meant.

Start time: 1663.68
End time: 1688.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Particularly since other makers of laptops  and other devices have made them small,  but haven't made the same kind of sacrifices.  You could buy some really nice Windows machines  that have a lot more connectivity types,  that are very thin and have an excellent keyboard.  So it's not, Apple doesn't necessarily,  they've driven things in a certain direction,  but a lot of people have improved on what Apple did.

Start time: 1696.58
End time: 1761.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I hope so.  I mean, I think the big question is going to be  what takes control of design at Apple?  Because I think that's kind of John Gruber's point,  and I agree with it,  which is that it is sort of disconcerting  that there isn't kind of a figurehead  who is now at the company  who is making those design decisions.  I think you could be optimistic and say,  this might be an opportunity.  There might be plenty of people at that company  who have had really good ideas,  but haven't had the opportunity to express them  and to execute them,  because you had one of the greatest industrial designers  of all time working there.  So how would anybody else get a chance  to even make any sorts of changes  or to put their own vision out there?  So I think it kind of depends, right?  But definitely, I think this is an opportunity to say,  we don't have to be, I guess,  maybe beholden to these decisions.  We can make other decisions.  But obviously, if there is a change to the keyboard design  within the next two years,  in all likelihood, that design was led by Johnny Ive's team.  These things don't work in the vacuum.  These decisions are made far in advance.

Transcript:  Right, and at the end of it's end,  he's forming his own company,  and Apple is going to be one of his exclusive clients.  I don't buy that.  Not how Apple would guide people.  It might be an advisory thing.  I don't know, but I'm just saying,  you could understand that if it got to it,  if they didn't have,  they wanted somebody to kind of do a general design  and then they would hone in on it,  that could be still somebody that they want to go to.  You never know.

Start time: 1790.66
End time: 1873.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I'll play devil's advocate on this a little bit.  Sorry, Dwight, I'll make this quick.  I'll play devil's advocate just a little  and say one of the reasons,  you have to ask why would Apple do this?  Tim Cook knows it's a design-driven company.  Obviously, so do the other people at the company,  Phil Schiller and others.  Why would they make this change?  And from their perspective,  it could be that design has taken them,  having a design chief be able to have,  to be able to overrule some of these other  sort of functional decisions  to the point you made earlier, Leo,  may have not been, may have not served Apple real well  in the last few years.  And this may be an acknowledgement of that  and a fact that design is still gonna be important to them,  but that they're going to follow users  and user needs a little bit more  and be less beholden to sort of an aesthetic decision  by design that leads to the touch bar,  that leads to a somewhat compromised first design  of the Apple Watch, that leads to the challenges  with the, even with the headphone jack  and with other things.  And so perhaps that pragmatic design  will be part of what they're going for with this move,  if we're trying to read the tea leaves  and understand why they might've done this.

Start time: 1874.44
End time: 1922.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, that's a good point.  I mean, actually, because when they gave Johnny  the figurehead title of chief design officer  and had everybody report to him,  it was kind of officially stating what had already been,  at least from what I understand how Apple works,  they're very secretive,  but based on things that have been written  was that Johnny's design team operated in their own silo  and were kind of separate from everything else.  But when you actually give him that spot  on the reporting structure, that makes that very clear.  This could be, like Jason's saying,  maybe a potential reset of saying,  okay, you still do your own thing  and what you do is still leading the company,  but this is no longer going to be separate  from the rest of the work that's being done  so that if we do have concerns,  maybe in some other areas,  that's going to be taken into account as well.  That's a pretty good theory, Jason.

End time: 1935.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's funny, go ahead, Go ahead, Go ahead.  Well, also, one thing I think you ought to think about  is that they haven't said they're not going to replace him.  They haven't said they're not going to have  a chief design officer, they just haven't yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I feel like Apple made him,  so there's two ways to look at this.  So on the one hand, you could say,  oh my God, John and Paul have left the group,  we're stuck with Ringo.  And without the two most important people,  I think in personal technology over the last 30 or 40 years,  Steve Jobs and Johnny Ive, that doesn't bode well.  You're not going to see another thing like this iPhone.  There's not that, you know,  who's going to make that next thing?  On the other hand, you could say  there was a big mistake made by Apple a few years ago  because they put Johnny not only in charge  of industrial design,  but in charge of all user interface and software design.  And that was actually the point where iOS went way south  with iOS 8, which was horrifically poorly designed.  And I think you could make the case  that Johnny Ive running software  was a big mistake on Apple's part.  So I think there's two point of views.  I'm not sure which I hold,  and I think you're right, Dwight,  it could very well be, I mean,  it can't be there's only one Johnny Ive in the world.

It remains to be seen if Apple will be the company  that has that or if it's another one.  I mean, it's interesting.  Robert Brunner was the guy who hired Johnny Ive at Apple,  and he was the Apple, the lead Apple designer before that.  And he went on to be the lead designer for Beats by Dre  and is very talented in his own right.  But I talked with him a number of years ago  at a Beats event and he said,  and in very good natured way, I have to say,  it was in no way with any bit of bitterness at all.  He was like, I hired Johnny Ive  is going to be on my tombstone.  And this is the guy that created the power book,  that created Beats, that is in his own right,  like a very, very successful  and amazingly talented and successful designer.  But yeah, he knows, I mean, and again,  like it was completely good natured about it.  It was no bitterness at all.  But he was like, yeah, the fact that I hired Johnny Ive  is going to be what I'm best known for.

I mean, I think you could absolutely say that the language,  the way we think of Apple was very much influenced  by how it looked, and Johnny is the man behind it.  So I wonder, I mean, is it gonna be,  what happened to the Bauhaus after Mr. House left?  I don't know.  It may, it isn't gonna be the same.  It'll be a different design, a different language,  and maybe it'll even be a different company as a result.  I wonder.  These two, Jobs and Ives,  Ives were really one of a kind.  It's not like he's dead, but I don't think he's,  honestly, when Apple says, oh yeah,  we'll work with him in the future, no, no, no.

And it's hilarious.  Heiner's wearing them right now, but-  Oh yeah, I would wear them right now  if I wasn't worried about having weird, like,  Bluetooth conflict with my plugged-in mic.  But I mean, you see them everywhere.  It's so funny.  When I left New York City for Seattle,  they were just starting,  it had been about six of the months  after they'd been released.  You were just starting to see them all over New York City.  And when I came back a couple months later,  they were everywhere.  And I always joke that Seattle's like six months  behind New York, but, and it's true.  And you know, six months after they infiltrated New York City,  they were everywhere in Seattle.

We now know they're bad for your hearing.  A good article in Medium by Angela Lashbrook,  she writes about science in Medium.  She says, because they don't do noise isolation,  she's quoting a professor of otolaryngology  at Case Western, people turn up the sound louder  because the outside noise is getting in.  And she says, I'm seeing a lot of younger people  in their 20s coming in with ringing in their ears  related to this all day earbud use.  It's noise trauma.  So not only are they bad for you,  not only do they look dumb,  they don't sound as good as a dozen cheaper headphones,  and they're bad for you.

And he was great,  because if you see an Apple product on the street,  you know immediately,  you know those AirPods are an Apple product.  You know that iPhone is an Apple product.  It's immediate.  But at the same time, he was also a slave to style.  And sometimes that's not the most functional thing.  Like those AirPods, I don't think are very good.

And they were both very nice,  but I tried to joke with Johnny  before the interview started to kind of break the ice,  and I was like, can you say aluminum for me?  And he did, to his credit,  but he was very clearly like, he didn't want to meme,  so I'm sorry that I made you meme Johnny.  But I had to.  I was like, I'm never gonna have this opportunity again.  I have to hear him say aluminum,  because it was such an iconic part of Apple's product rollout  that he was for so long.

I think it's an opportunity I do for Apple.  And to maybe focus a little less on design  and more on functionality, that would be my vote,  because I can't use that keyboard.  I won't buy an Apple laptop till I fix the keyboard.  Our show today brought to you,  we got a great panel, by the way.  Thank you, Christina, Warren, for being here.

We were wondering when,  because when Apple announced the 2013 Mac Pro,  it made a big deal.  We're gonna make it in Texas.  It's gonna be made in the US.  Didn't work out so well.  A number of people I've talked to,  including myself, the first one we got,  didn't work so good.  We had to turn it back in, get another one.  Never did work quite right.  Apple has announced they are manufacturing their new Mac Pro.  Actually, they haven't announced it.  According to people familiar with the plans  in the Wall Street Journal,  the new Mac Pro will be made in China, Shanghai.  Okay, nothing to say about that.  I mean, it makes sense.  Everything else is made in China.  Why not, right?

Transcript:  And then not, and then just taking a bunch of money  and then not actually doing anything, right?  Like, this stuff is all, I mean,  every other aspect of what they're doing  is going to be made in China.  So you're paying twice in some cases,  to ship it to Texas to then assemble and do other stuff.  Like it just, I don't know,  it doesn't make any business sense.  And the end user, I think,  as it's obvious, hasn't really cared.

Start time: 2958.40
End time: 2975.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There's also the issue of, frankly,  manufacturing capabilities.  They have an amazing capability,  which I think is a lot of,  because Apple went to Shenzhen in 2007  to get the iPhone made.  And in the intervening years,  they've just gotten better and better  at this kind of manufacture.

Start time: 2976.68
End time: 2991.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So the question becomes,  what happens to the manufacturing facility  that was doing the Mac Pro in Austin?  Is it going to be,  are they going to be building something else  or those people are going to be laid off?  That's, those are some good questions to ask.

Start time: 2992.39
End time: 3003.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Were they already laid off?  Like, we don't know.  I mean, I would be genuinely very curious  how many Mac Pros have actually come off  that assembly line in the last few years.  Because they haven't had any updates to that product.

Start time: 3003.62
End time: 3005.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They didn't need to make anymore.  Nobody bought them.

Start time: 3006.08
End time: 3030.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what I'm saying.  So, but even if you assume that they had been making them,  still, like they haven't made any changes to that line.  So you could have a certain amount of surplus  and then you don't need anymore.  So, I mean, I would be curious if I were somebody  who was in Texas and had access to that thing.  I would want to look in and see,  is this plant still operating?  Dwight?  And how long has it been going on?  Exactly, yeah.  I mean, somebody at the Houston Chronicle.  Trip to Dallas, Dwight.

Transcript:  So Apple put $100 million into tooling  and equipment for that plant.  Actually, it's in Austin, not Dallas, sorry.  Yeah.  It was run by Flex.  Neither Flex nor Quanta,  the new company that will be making them in China.  Although Quanta is, by the way, a Taiwanese company,  are commenting on the plans  that the Wall Street Journal is reporting on.  Apple's spokesperson said,  final assembly is only one part of the manufacturing process,  which by the way, tells me it's going to be in China.  Adding the company's investment support,  two million American jobs,  the Mac Pro is Apple's most powerful computer  used by a relatively small number of professionals.  So it's not a big deal.  Remember, I don't know if you remember,  but in 2017, President Trump said  that Tim Cook had promised him  that they would build three big, beautiful plants  in the United States,  a claim at which Apple at the time refused to comment upon.  And as far as I know,  Apple has not built any plants in the United States.  They are building bigger facilities,  campuses in Seattle and Austin and New York City.

Start time: 3106.28
End time: 3186.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, I think the thing we have to keep in mind  with this system is this is a massively cutting edge system.  They're using the most advanced chips in the world.  Some of these chips are so advanced,  we've never even seen them before outside of laboratories.  And so I think that probably limited  some of what they could do.  For better or worse,  the best chip making plants are in China  and they're run by Taiwanese companies  like Quanta, like Foxconn and a handful of others.  But they probably had to do this  because in order to get the latest parts,  they didn't wanna make a bunch of parts here,  ship them to some part, another part of the world  and build them there.  These things have to be engineered really well  and they have to be integrated perfectly  because these are cutting edge technologies  that are just not normal.  And are tough to replicate in facilities  that aren't doing, that aren't building these things.  And manufacturing really is advancing  to where it's trying to bring design  and different parts of the business together  with manufacturing.  So I suspect that's why this had to be built  where it's built.

Transcript:  There was, I read a long thread on Reddit  about the holes in the case and different,  I love Reddit for this.  You get obsessive industrial machinists in there saying,  well, I think it was a cylinder,  it must've been a cylinder drill or whatever.  And they're talking about, but no matter what,  there was no clear consensus.  It was a hard thing to make that weird cheese grater case.  And of course that's very Apple.  In fact, in all likelihood,  they're gonna build a special machine  that makes those cases, right?  Totally.  According to the Wall Street Journal that flex,  you can stop the phone calls, Dwight.  According to Apple, that campus,  the flex facility hasn't really been,  making the new Mac Pro in China isn't likely  to affect many workers in Texas  because demand for the old model fizzled years ago.  The flex workforce had shifted to refurbishing  already made computers, former flex employees said.  The flex plant continues to make products  for HP and other companies.

Start time: 3248.14
End time: 3358.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Profit deal.  So there's so much for that.  That is related though.  I wonder if Apple knows something,  because as Tim Cook has been calling President Trump,  frequently I understand,  trying to figure out what the trade situation  with China is gonna be.  This could impact Apple dramatically.  And if they're putting manufacturing China,  I wonder if that's a signal that maybe he heard  that the president told Tim, don't worry,  we're not gonna have to worry about tariffs  because the Chinese are gonna cave.  Apparently at the G20 summit,  there was some progress made with President Xi  because guess what, Huawei, it's okay again.  Go ahead, get a Huawei phone, get a Huawei laptop.  It's not a national security concern anymore.  It turns out it's not.  It was a mis...  And this is exactly what we thought would happen.  So what's happened apparently,  they're still on the entity list.  This is a list that US companies  are not supposed to deal with Huawei.  And this was a big problem for Huawei  because that meant Qualcomm couldn't sell them chips.  Google couldn't give them Android updates.  There was a lot of stuff that...  And then at that point, even Arm,  although I think they retracted it,  but at first Arm said,  well, then we can't work with them.  Arm's like, we can't.  Yeah.  So it's a death sentence for any company.  Completely.  And but apparently,  as much as they were talking about security,  it wasn't exactly security because now apparently,  and this is a lot of money,  billions of dollars in money flowing back  in the United States  because Huawei can now buy Qualcomm chips again  and Google can now support Android again.  The president, it's a weird roller coaster.  The president said only on the stuff  that there's not a security issue.

Start time: 3372.70
End time: 3427.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  According to PC magazine,  it's unclear whether that extends  to the 5G network technology Huawei is developing.  Google is okay.  Obviously, Qualcomm is okay.  Intel is okay.  He said that these are complex  and highly scientific products  created by US tech companies.  I wish I could do a Trump impression, but I can't.  I need Alec Baldwin.  What we've done in Silicon Valley is incredible  and nobody's been able to compete with it  and I've agreed to allow them to continue  to sell that product to Huawei.  The ban actually hadn't taken effect.  Remember, they gave it a three month halt, a pause,  but it was affecting the development of future products.  Remember Huawei pulled back their Matebook.  They were gonna release a new laptop.  Huawei said, well, we're working on our own OS.  We've got new suppliers.  So I don't, it's all up in the air.

Start time: 3430.30
End time: 3506.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The bottom line is that the US and China  are so closely interlinked.  That's the problem.  Like the economies of the US and China  are so closely interlinked that it's really not  that possible for us to have a trade war  without really shooting ourselves in the foot.  And one of the things that's most troublesome  about sort of some of the stuff now,  walking back some of the tech stuff,  because it's terrible PR,  is that people that maybe it's not as terrible PR  for like farmers who were selling a lot of soybeans,  a lot of other things to China,  and now China cut some of that off,  a lot of that off in retaliation.  And then they got handouts from the government essentially  to help compensate for that,  to help weather sort of the storm.  In the end, it just doesn't leave a very good taste  in your mouth when you realize like some of the people  who where these things aren't a PR disaster,  get hurt and bear the brunt of this,  and whereas others don't, right?  And so in the end, the China trade thing  is gonna get worked out because it behooves  both parties to do it.  Our economies are just too interlinked to not do it.

Transcript:  But who's to say that tomorrow Trump won't say,  oh, no, wait, you can't sell to Huawei anymore.  We still have a lot of issues.  That could happen tomorrow.  He's so mercurial and so unpredictable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You got the feeling that they like decided this,  they were having lunch, President Xi gave him  some of his sandwich, and he said,  okay, we'll let you have Huawei.  I mean, it was feels like that.  It feels like, oh, he's a nice guy.  I don't wanna do that.

Start time: 3530.96
End time: 3562.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really feels like he was like, oh, he was nice to me.  And he said some kind words, he fed my ego.  So now all of a sudden, all these reasons  that we were giving before are completely beside the point  and we can do this.  And I think it's that hypocrisy and that,  as Jason points out, it behooves both sides  to work together and it'd be very bad.  Trade war is very bad for a lot of companies  in the United States.  But the rationale between being like,  oh, this one company is bad for these reasons,  it's always struck me as suspect.  If there really is a security concern

Start time: 3563.02
End time: 3564.48
Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  and there have been a lot of people

Start time: 3564.54
End time: 3571.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  who've made the case that there is,  then that should be on its own.  It shouldn't be leverage to try to get better terms  for a trade deal.

Start time: 3571.51
End time: 3673.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Absolutely.  I've been saying this, I've been saying,  well, let's see the evidence.  I mean, I understand they can't tell us all the evidence,  but if you think Huawei is a problem, let's find out why.  And there is some evidence now,  Wall Street Journal reported this week  that Huawei gear is much more vulnerable to hackers  than rivals' equipments.  This is from a study of, it's kind of a strange study.  So I'm not, I don't know if I really understand it.  It's from a company called Finite State.  And what they did is they took the firmware  of a bunch of network switches, 5G switches and so forth.  And they did it pro bono, they said,  not on behalf of any government.  Although the fact that they feel like they have to say that  makes me a little nervous.  What they did is they analyzed more than one and a half  unique files, one and a half million unique files embedded  within 10,000 firmware images, 558 products  within Huawei's enterprise networking product lines.  They said the rate of vulnerabilities,  maybe this is getting garbled by the journal,  although the journal's tech reporting  is usually pretty good.  The rate of vulnerabilities found in Huawei equipment  was far higher than average,  than the average found in devices manufactured by its rival.  And that more than half of the Huawei firmware images  they tested contained at least one vulnerability,  which Finite State described as a potential backdoor  that could allow an attacker with knowledge of the firmware  and a corresponding key to log into the device.  So this is the first smoking gun we've seen  that maybe there is a backdoor in Huawei networking gear.  Perhaps they're either by error or by the intention.  Or intentional.

Start time: 3674.04
End time: 3714.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, one of the part of that that really struck me,  but beyond just the potential of having the backdoor  was the fact that older versions of the firmware  had fewer vulnerabilities than newer versions.  And that could be a number of things.  That could be poor QA, that could be intentional,  you don't know, but you're right.  Like that, and I don't know a lot about the company  that put out that report, but that is certainly concerning,  which again, goes back to what we were saying before,  if there's a security issue, then that should be the focus,  and that should be the reason for the ban.  But this shouldn't be used as leverage  and then given as an excuse when trying to  organize it or I guess negotiate a trade war.

Start time: 3715.04
End time: 3735.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The problem is that our government has been willing  to use trade as well as other things like foreign aid  as a diplomatic weapon.  And that conflates these economic issues with other issues  and it makes it really difficult.  And it also makes the path meandering.  However, I mean.  True, I think.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Start time: 3760.60
End time: 3771.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, General Clapper doesn't like them.  But it's not clear that that's based on,  well, we've been looking at the evidence  and see here's the problems, or well, they're Chinese.  Can you really trust them?  That's what I don't know.

Start time: 3772.84
End time: 3830.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I think the report, so from the reports that I've read  that I understand in terms of what the intelligence agencies  have some of the stuff that's either available publicly  or through Freedom of Information Act,  is that what they don't trust is some very close relationships  with people high up in Huawei with the Chinese military.  They haven't brought the hammer down as much on ZTE.  ZTE was a little, they sold some things to Iran  and we didn't like that.  And they were penalized for it, essentially.  But they've not gotten nearly the scrutiny.  Same thing with Xiaomi, same thing with OnePlus,  same thing with a bunch of other Chinese companies.  It's been Huawei that's really been picked on.  And my understanding is mostly is that the intelligence  agencies don't trust this very close relationship  with some people very high up inside Huawei,  their relationship with the Chinese military.  And of course, it's also the kind of things

Start time: 3830.12

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  that Huawei's building.  You know, they're building things that are at the root  of our, right, backbone stuff.  It's not just a matter of your phone  or other consumer devices.  It's things that actually, if they were controlled  by a government, would be very bad.

Transcript:  We had one of our visitors to the studio the other day  works for Nokia in their 5G division.  I said, is this an opportunity for you?  He said, oh yeah.  Oh, 100%.  So Nokia and Ericsson, who also make 5G gear,  but are much smaller than Huawei in this realm,  they're stepping up.  But the problem has been that US companies  are not offering quality gear at a reasonable price.

Start time: 3867.40
End time: 3890.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they never have.  I mean, 4G was like Ericsson for a large thing.  And then Huawei really has come up since then.  But when 4G was starting to expand,  that was all Ericsson stuff.  And I mean, Nokia, the reason that it still exists  the way it does is because of its networking patents  and the infrastructure it builds there, right?  That was separate from its mobile phone division.  But you're right, there have been.  The US companies, we've never had a real presence  in that space.

Transcript:  On the other hand, we buy a lot of stuff  from Chinese companies.  I buy Lenovo laptops.  Absolutely.  And even if it's not run by somebody who used to work  for the Chinese military like Huawei is,  I think, I might be wrong,  but I think the structure of the Chinese government  is such that any company that's a Chinese company  is at any time at the mercy of the whims  of the government, right?  If President Xi says to Lenovo,  we'd like you to embed this malware,  what's Lenovo gonna do?  Say no?  On the other hand, I think we also should rely  on the fact that the Chinese want to do business with us.  And if they feel like their gear's not trustworthy,  I mean, we've demonstrated,  we practically put ZTE out of business last year.  We almost did the same thing with Huawei this year.  We've demonstrated that that's bad for business to do that.  Now, this is the 2012 US government review.  This is from the Wall Street Journal.  Review of security risks associated with Huawei  did not find clear evidence  the company was being used by China,  but concluded the gear presented risks  due to the presence of many vulnerabilities.  And so that's what this most recent report also said.  It's not that these look like intentional backdoors.  It's impossible to tell,  but they are in effect de facto backdoors.  So that's a good enough reason.  They're just not secure.

Transcript:  The fear from the US and Europe about gear from,  so Huawei makes a lot of really good gear,  a really good backhaul gear for 5G infrastructure.  And a lot of this happened just as they were on the doorstep  for making a lot of inroads into this 5G,  giant 5G build out that's about to happen, right?  So don't underestimate the fact  that a lot of this sort of FUD,  if you wanna call it that,  whether if you don't believe it, that's what it is, right?  That this happened just as they were on the doorstep  of signing a lot of big deals all around the world  to put Huawei gear as the backbone to a lot of 5G networks.  And this has scared off a lot of that,  even in places like South Korea.  South Korea is their biggest trading partner.  They are South Korea's biggest trading partner.  And South Korea has kind of pulled back  and now gone with more Korean manufacturers  to build their network just as one example, right?  And if you're having a hard time convinced in South Korea,  you're gonna have a lot harder time convinced in Canada  or the United States or France or whomever.  So a lot of this trade war stuff,  there's a lot of posturing that goes on.  And this isn't gonna be a very popular thing to say,  but I think Trump for better or worse,  one thing he does understand well is negotiations.  He's been doing it his whole life as a real estate tycoon.  And so he understands in negotiations,  you can say things you don't necessarily mean  to try to gain more ground  and give you better bargaining power  and better negotiation tactics.  So I think that,  I don't think he really wants a trade war with China,  but he wants to get better terms for the US  in our trade negotiations.  The threat of it is bad.

Transcript:  But of course, we also understand the threat of a trade war  with China is bad for US too and tariffs are taxes  and ask a soybean farmer how he feels about the whole thing  and it's not gonna be a good story.  I have to say though,  after reading this Wall Street Journal story,  I'm starting to think maybe there is evidence that Huawei,  for instance, if you were gonna put back doors  in your gear, you wouldn't put something that says,  back door for the Chinese government.  Back door, yeah, right.  You do something that looks like it could have been  a mistake like a hardwired password,  which is a common error made in firmware.  But there are some things that are a little suspicious.  You mentioned this, Jason, according to the journal,  a particularly unusual finding was that security problems  became worse in at least one instance for users  who patched a switch with an updated version.  The fix is supposed to make it better.  So suddenly these patches are coming out  with more holes than before.

Start time: 4146.92
End time: 4180.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, no, that's a problem for sure because  you could make the argument that a lot of,  some of the issues with some of these things  is that you have bad OPSEC on behalf of the municipalities  and companies and people who use this equipment, right?  But if they're doing best practices and updating firmware  and trying to install updates and then they're being  less secure as a result of that, that's a big problem.  And that's a concern for sure because you should never  be putting the people who are maintaining your systems  in the position where they have to question,  should we install this update or not?

Transcript:  The journal quotes Michael Wessel,  who's a member of the US China Economic  and Security Review Commission, who says,  it's hard to see that the range and depth  of the vulnerabilities could be anything  other than intentional.

Transcript:  Let's take a break.  We're gonna come back.  We have much more to talk about  including the ebook apocalypse,  the hackers in your curtains.  And let's see, there's gotta be something  of equal interest.  Oh no, well, I had a great tease, but I lost it.  That's kind of the story of my life.  I had a tease, but I lost it.  There's no point in teasing on a podcast.  If it's too good, you just skip the ad.  And I don't want you to skip the ad  because it's from Captera.  I really like these guys.  A lot of times I get calls from people saying,  I have a veterinary business.  What's the best software for me?  Like I would know what the best veterinary software is.  I can tell you one thing,  a lot of businesses, and I include ourselves in this,  are using software that somebody wrote years ago,  somebody who's long gone, not being maintained,  or it's by a company, a little tiny company,  and they never updated it from Windows Vista,  or that kind of thing.  I know, there's some of you who are running old computers  just because the line of business software  you absolutely have to have will not work on anything else.  There's New York City Subway's being run on OS2.  So this happens, I know this happens,  but there is, for your business, a modern solution.  We had an intern write us a sales system,  but I swear Lisa curses every time she has to use it.  We're finally getting a good modern CRM system  thanks to Captera.  Captera has an amazing selection.  It's a directory of business software, 700 categories.  Yes, CRM, IT project management, e-commerce,  link management tools, web conferencing, every category,  but also direct line of business software  like Veterinary Office or Yoga Studio software.  The thing that always amazed me,  you can search for the most obscure thing  and you'll find a dozen programs,  and then you can narrow it down because they have filters.  You can filter it on product rating,  how many seats it supports,  how it's deployed on premises or in the cloud,  various features, can you make appointments,  can you send bills, that kind of thing.  Then find the ones that fit your exact needs,  compare them side by side up to four at a time.  They'll even show you a list of related categories  for further options,  but the best part of Captera is the reviews.  There are almost now a million reviews on Captera.  There is a thousand new reviews every day by actual users.  They're very careful, they vet these reviews.  So when you look at software and you say,  well, maybe this will be good for us,  you can read those reviews and you can know.  Somebody is actually using it.  This is the pros, these are the cons.  No matter what kind of software you need,  Captera makes it easy to discover the right solution fast.  And once you find that software, pay it forward,  leave a review, that helps other buyers as well.  All of this is absolutely free.  No charge, millions of people use Captera  to find the right tools for their business.  There's no upsell, there's no free,  it's not free, it's free free.  Captera.com slash twit,  C-A-P-T-E-R-R-A dot com slash twit.  If you've been assigned this weekend  to find software for your business,  I just made your weekend.  Captera.com slash twit.  Captera is software selection simplified.  And we thank them for their support of twit.  Thank you for supporting us back  by using that special URL, captera.com slash twit.  So sometime this week,  books that you bought in Microsoft's ebook store  will just disappear like magic.  Now to Microsoft's credit,  they're gonna reimburse you the cost of the book.  And if you put notes in it, if you wrote stuff,  if you put your own content in there,  it's gonna disappear, but they'll give you $25.  Which is I think very nice of them.  They're not required to because guess what?  You never owned those books.  And this is I think a really interesting story  because it underscores a fact  that nobody really wants to think about,  but it's absolutely true.  You don't own your books, your digital books.  You don't own your digital movies,  your digital TV shows.  You may have bought them, but because of DRM,  if that company stops supporting the authentication server  or decides not to support them, it's bye bye baby.  Amazon.

I'm as concerned as anyone else is when it comes to,  when we have to, I guess, look at the big picture of,  like, as you said, you don't own your digital content.  You own a license to it,  but you don't actually own it yourself.  And I think this is why the EFF has successfully fought for,  I guess, various terms in some years  where you can overcome DRM,  to own your own copies of things,  various exceptions to various copyright laws.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I'll say it outright.  I definitely have.  Is it illegal to do that?  That's unclear.  There have been exceptions  that have been part of various things,  but I mean, it's unclear.  I think if it's for private use, it would be very-  You can't make backup copies.

Transcript:  Yeah, there have been various exceptions  to various parts of the DMCA that have allowed for this.  I don't know if it was renewed the most recent time.  I know the EFF has fought for it before,  and as Dwight was mentioning, the DVD CSS case,  the DVD John case has said that you can use those things,  but I don't know specifically for this type of DRM  and for these types of books things, but yeah, I mean,  I think that if you're not distributing the content of it  for your own use case,  whether it's actually technically legal or not,  the real ramifications are nearly non-existent.  That said, I'm not a lawyer, but I do think this is why.

Transcript:  Handbrake interestingly no longer does that by the way.  When you download handbrake to rip a DVD,  you have to download another thing.  Go download VLC because they don't want,  so maybe they won the court case,  but they're sure acting like they lost.  They don't want you to be able to crack DVDs  with just handbrake.

Transcript:  Right, then you're locked out.  And I mean, I think this is why DRM  in a lot of ways is dangerous.  I mean, I think that in an ideal world,  because these things are going to happen,  I think in an ideal world,  and this comes down to rights holders,  so you can't hold the companies  necessarily fully responsible,  but in an ideal world, if you were to do this,  I think the best thing to do would be to unlock,  you know, give users a way to unlock the content  and have it without DRM on their systems.  But I do understand that there are probably, you know,  their own contracts that they made with publishers  and whatnot that, you know,  requires some sort of DRM to be there.  And if they choose to no longer maintain the servers,  that doesn't change the contract they've made  with the content owners.

Start time: 4949.94
End time: 4963.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly, I think you're right.  I think that's probably how that works,  is that they have a certain call home thing,  and you have to call home within X period of time.  And then if you're not connected within that period of time,  it will give you some sort of error.  Yeah, I would suspect.  Is that how Kindle works?

Start time: 4966.02
End time: 4972.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You can turn off WiFi in the Kindle,  so it no longer has access to the internet,  and you can still read books.  But I- Yeah, I think that Kindle

Start time: 4972.82
End time: 4977.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

End time: 5016.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and so in that case,  if you never connected that Kindle  to the internet ever again,  yeah, you could read those books forever,  but if it connected to the internet,  and then it found something different,  like in the case when they removed the non-licensed books,  then that's how it's able to do that.  But yeah, I think Kindle and Audible,  both they're linked to the device itself.  They get a key,  because that's how Audible was able to work with the iPod.  The iPod didn't have WiFi,  but once it's on there and it's on that hard drive,  it's there for life.  But if you wanted to update or add new things,  then obviously it could still check  to make sure it has access to those things.

That we feel amazing when we're like,  oh, they're actually letting us use our content  the ways that we think we should be able to.  We get excited about things that we shouldn't be excited by.  But yeah, I mean, I agree with you.  I have still a ton of Blu-rays and DVDs,  but I've stopped buying physical books for the most part.  And I don't buy a lot of physical media anymore  because I don't have room for it, even though I love it.  But it is scary when you think about,  well, what is the future of this?  I'm a data hoarder, so I think a lot about those things.  What's gonna happen in 20 years?  How will I be able to play this content  or use this content?

Transcript:  Well, so that's what happened to me.  I was backing up these 500 audible books  because normally you just download it  when you wanna listen to it on the new device.  But I thought I should really have a backup of it,  of all of them.  So whenever I buy new books, I now back it up.  I put it on my NAS.  Eventually it goes to Amazon's Glacier.  So I mean, because years from now,  I would like to know that those books are still available.  But before I did that, I stripped out the copy protection  because otherwise there's no point in backing it up.  So I'm looking at a FAQ on circumvention and the DMCA.  And it specifically says,  it is illegal to disable an access control device  in the storage media of an entertainment product,  creating a patch for a software program  or electronics product.  It's explicit that you can't do that.  But again, I don't think any judge, if you said,  well, Your Honor, my books that I bought from Microsoft  won't work after April, after July,  I can't imagine the judge would throw you in jail.

Don't do that, be ethical.  Right, so realistically, no one is going to know  if you do this.  It's just one of those things.  It's a technicality.

It was their response to Ultraviolet  and it was better technology in a lot of ways,  but Paramount and Lionsgate  and a couple other smaller studios at MGM  never were part of it.  They were big on the Ultraviolet train  and so it's going to be interesting  to see what happens there.  Voodoo is interestingly a library for both.  So if you have stuff on Voodoo,  presumably it will be converted, I guess,  to your Voodoo library,  but whether it will then be accessible  in your other linked libraries remains to be seen.  But yeah, no, you're exactly right.  This was a big play by the movie industry  to try to create a DRM way of distributing  digital copies of movies easily  to try to prevent people from downloading.  And it never really took off for a lot of reasons.  It was hard to set up accounts.  There were a lot of issues around quality  and codes were hard.  And what would usually happen was that  also the backend software was so hard to use  that most of the studios just wound up  giving people iTunes codes instead.  But yeah, I mean, this is a lot of people  in the data hoarders community  and in the Ultraviolet community,  two weird groups that I'm part of  have been talking a lot about this.

And I mean, and I think that this is why  it's important to look at open standards  and at least having certain things available  so that in the event that these companies  go out of business or they change models or whatever,  there can be a way for you to locally  still have a server that will respond  to those types of things where you can at least  on your own, maybe it doesn't give you any updates  or do anything else, but you could at least  still communicate with these types of devices  because this is what's so different  about the current world we're in,  which is that so many of the things that we buy  are completely incumbent on third party services  that are living in the cloud somewhere  and all it takes is a change in an API  or a business decision change or somebody  going out of business and what you have,  whether it's hardware or software,  is no longer going to work.

Transcript:  I mean, okay, so I had an iBo.  Remember the iBo?  When Sharper Image went out of business.  The dog, the robot dog.  Yeah, the robot dog.  When Sharper Image went out of business,  I got one really cheap and I loved it,  but they have had issues  and they weren't connected to the internet that same way,  but said they have battery issues.  The batteries are custom and you can't get them anymore.  And so in Japan, people have had massive funerals  for them.  No, it's fair, but people are very upset.  They have these things, Leo, you laugh.  But people have had these as their home pets  for 18 years.  It's like losing something else.  It's a big deal.  When that happened, I was upset  that the batteries can't charge anymore,  that my iBo is no longer functioning  and it's just a thing in my mom's basement.  But it's still, if you could presumably get a custom battery,  it could come back to life.  Like this, I look at it and I'm so sad.  I'm like this.  I know.  You go through the trouble of making this  anthropomorphic kind of being  to get us all to like the robots  and then you turn it off.  It's like the movie AI, the Steven Spielberg movie.

Transcript:  Well, see, that would be the interesting thing.  This is why I'm a proponent of open source  for some of these things.  I agree.  Because I'm completely in line with companies.  I don't think that you should hold any company accountable  to maintaining an old server for a long time.  Last year, Sonos got some flack  because literally some ActiveX flash thing for a controller,  they last sold in 2006.  They were like, okay, we're not gonna support this anymore.  And we'll give you a certain amount of money  to buy a new controller and you can use our app.  And people freaked out.  But I understand they had old unsafe code  that they were having to maintain  with some other other stuff  for a thing that hadn't been sold in 12 years.  I understand that a business reality say  you can't maintain this forever.  But in a perfect world, you could say, okay,  but if we're using open source things or whatnot,  we will at least open source how some of this stuff works  so you can run your own server  if you have the ability to do that.  And it's even a business opportunity for other places  to maybe say, hey, we will host this in a cloud for you  and you can access it.  But to me, that would be the best way to do these things  is to say, if you have the means to do this yourself,  you can set up your own local thing  and still engage with your device.

Transcript:  It's such a great idea.  And it really is, that's like a good hygiene  and good digital manners of the 21st century.  If you're going out of business, open source your stuff,  put it up on GitHub, let somebody else,  if they have the resources or even hobbyists,  do something with it if you're no longer going to  be the curator and the guardian of it as it were.

And I mean, Anki is right now, it's an iOS app.  And so presumably it'll work maybe the next version,  but there's gonna be a time when that code  is not gonna work correctly.  And so again, I think it'd be great if the Anki people  would open source what they have so that somebody else  can find a way to make it work if they have the capabilities.  At least give people the option.  I'm not saying you need to maintain it or run queries,  but just putting it out there,  I think that would be really nice.

Start time: 5748.78
End time: 5787.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so.  I think things like that, obviously that's really good.  Or just, you know, if like when Google shut down,  you know, Revolve, it would have been really nice  if they had released some of the code  so that people could locally run those things.  Because the problem with Revolve  was that the devices themselves still worked.  It was just that because there wasn't a central server  to connect to, they couldn't do anything.  But there's no reason it couldn't have been,  somebody couldn't have, you know,  augmented things to run locally on a network.  So yeah, but I mean, I think as much as you can use  open standards, obviously that's even better.  But I don't know, I like the idea that says  if you're gonna get out of the market or go out of business,  you know, open source your stuff.

Transcript:  Another, a third Florida city has fallen prey.  So it started with Baltimore,  which got ransomware encrypted for three weeks.  I don't know what's the city of Baltimore.  I think they're still hobbling along.  Yeah, they're still fighting it.  They did not pay, right?  They didn't pay the ransomware guys, no.  Then Riviera Beach, Florida, a small town, 65,000 people,  decided, they got hit, they decided to pay $600,000  to get their ransomware unlocked  on Monday, Lake City, Florida.  This is a Florida man's story.  Lake City, Florida, another small Florida city,  voted to pay half a million dollars in ransom,  Bitcoin to the ransomware gang to get their data back.  Now a third Florida city has also fallen.  They're trying to decide what to do.  Biscayne Bay, the problem is,  it's a really tiny city, 1200 people.  And I don't know if what they decided,  they had a town, the village,  whatever they call it, a village hall meeting last night.  I don't know what they ended up deciding to do.  Is it ever a good idea to pay the ransom?

Start time: 5881.54
End time: 5903.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I guess it depends on how much  you need that information, how good your resources are.  Like in some cases, in some of these cities,  I think the reason they paid the $600,000 as bad as it is  is that the cost of recreating those things,  well, A, they have insurance,  B, the cost of those things is going to be substantial,  and C, they clearly don't have the IT staff  who's skilled enough to do what they need to do.

Start time: 5903.24
End time: 5915.70

Speaker: SPEAKER_10

These are people who are putting out there  some fairly sophisticated things,  and just the random IT guy that they hire  is not necessarily himself or herself  going to have the skills to be able to go in there  and fix it.  You're going to have to go outside  and it probably is going to cost you more than the $500,000  or $600,000 to recover from it.

And you don't have a way of recovering that  except to pay the ransom.  I think I can understand why you'd pay the ransom.  That's a huge breach of your responsibility.

Transcript:  Now, my other thought on this is, of course,  no individual listening to this show  should ever pay the ransomware fee  because these are bad guys.  You're like saying, oh, I'll give you $10,000.  I'm sure you'll give me the key.  No, they're just going to say thank you, goodbye.  But I think if you're a high profile case like these cases,  you're probably likely to get the key  because the ransomware authors  do want you to think it works.  Otherwise you would never pay, right?

Start time: 6019.82
End time: 6038.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, totally.  I mean, and that's the thing too.  I mean, I think it's always probably stressful  to consider am I going to pay  and are they going to unlock it or not?  But it's in their best interest to unlock it  because that's how they can convince people  to continue to pay them.  My dad, my dad has been the victim of ransomware,  not once, but twice.

And so then my mom found out and then they,  I guess disputed with Amex and it was fine.  The second time I think that I was just like,  we have a backup from a while ago.  You have most of your stuff in Office 365.  We're just starting over on this.  And then I made sure that he wasn't running  some of the stuff he was running before,  but I live really far away from my parents  so I can't monitor his activities.  But as I understand it, they did unlock his system.  It's just, but it's a ridiculous kind of scenario  and they go after people who aren't tech savvy  and they go after municipalities in this case who,  look, I mean, at $600,000, that's a lot of money  and that's a lot of money for those towns.  But again, if A, they probably have insurance  and B, the cost of not getting around it otherwise  is probably way more than that.  I just hope that any of these cities who pay the ransom  will then immediately conduct a real security audit  and hire and pay people even though it's going to be expensive  for them to actually secure and create best practices  around what they're doing.  Unfortunately, I kind of don't believe that'll happen,  but that's what I hope they do  because otherwise this is just gonna happen again.

Transcript:  Larry Dignan writing on a ZDNet said,  it's actually in many cases a good idea  to pay the ransomware.  Many of these cities often said that was what we,  our advice was that we were given.  Fortunately, I think they had some insurance,  although I imagine their ransomware insurance costs  are gonna go through.  I didn't know you could get ransomware insurance.  I might be looking into that.  The FBI still says do not pay ransomware.  There's some reasons not to.  One is it just encourages them.  Two is there's no guarantee you'll get your data back.  In most cases, these come in.  Go ahead, Jason.  No, Jason, I'm gonna rule on this one.

I think you have another story about a guy  who almost fell for a similar thing in your list today.  A security guy, a guy who knew better.  And so it's kind of also embarrassing for the city  because one of their employees fell for something  that hopefully they had been trained about.  I think every company and every institution  does a lot of training around this,  but people still fall for it,  like the security guy in this instance.

Transcript:  Well, this is the thing, and I still see in,  and I know the Houston Chronicle never does this,  but I still see in WarCnet or Microsoft  and many other places say,  oh, if you don't know the person that the email came from,  don't open it.  And that's exactly the wrong advice  because it always comes from somebody you know.  You think you know, right?  Or your boss.  So it's really important.  So yeah, job one is to train employees not to click links,  not to open emails, and not to open attachments,  especially to be suspicious of attachments from the boss  or from coworkers because the spearfishing attacks,  I'm sure this is why it's cities, it's happening in cities.  It's easy to see who's in the city government.  It's on the website.  So you go to say, who's the city manager?  Okay, that's his name.  Okay, who's the comptroller?  Okay, that's his name.  Send an email from the city manager to the comptroller  saying, here's the spreadsheet.  I'm a little concerned about the numbers here.  You better open this and look at it.  How many controllers are gonna say, wait a minute,  that couldn't have, they're gonna open it.  So that's job one.  Job two, have a good backup and immutable backup.  I've been told, check me if I'm wrong,  that Google does not allow spearfishing  and ransomware attacks to go through  because they scan and they block these malware attachments.  And certainly if you have a good intrusion detection  and hardware firewalls, we have hardware,  Sophos hardware running to protect us,  Cisco umbrella and stuff like that.  That kind of software is gonna filter that stuff out  before it even gets to your employees, am I right?

Start time: 6344.02
End time: 6389.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true.  And we have things like at Office 365,  somebody in IRC mentioned this and if this is true,  there's advanced threat protection for things like that,  that go into things like that.  And I mean, this is actually arguably in some ways  kind of a reason to use software as a service  if you're these types of governments  because you can get updates to these types of things.  I think the issue is that most of the time  they're running older versions of server products  and maybe of email servers or other things.  And it's not doing that because they were making decisions  about their stack a while ago  and haven't allocated money in the budget update.  And that makes sense, right?  I mean, things are expensive  and you can't expect small governments especially  to always be up to date on stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They would not, but the issue is that  they might've set something up in 2003, right?  And maybe haven't updated since then  because you were talking in your last ad break  about things like that.  Like this is a reality of how these things work.  It's reality for small businesses.  It's even a bigger reality for small governments  and for city governments.  And as we've seen with Detroit,  that's a much bigger city  than you would think would be impacted by that.  But if they have other pressing concerns,  I can understand that people in their city council  would argue against spending money on tech stuff.  This is probably why we need more people  who are tech savvy to be in roles in government  at all stages, if we're being honest.

It is.  That's on our Hands On Tech channel, our review channel.  We take reviews from all of our shows  and additional reviews of new products  and we put them on a channel called Hands On Tech.  If you're not a subscriber to that, it's really good.  Actually, what everybody should do  is pick the podcast you like.  Maybe it's not mine.  Maybe it's Jason's or Christina's.  Do you have a podcast?  You must have a podcast, Dwight.  I mean, how could you?  No, no.  No podcast?  No podcast.  All right.  Well, if you have a podcast that you love, subscribe to it.  That's the best way to make sure  that you get a episode every week automatically.  You don't have to think about it.  And it's the best way for us as podcasters  to build an audience.  Don't forget to subscribe to all of our Twitch podcasts.  When you get our Twitch podcasts,  you're downloading them from our content distribution network.  It's really amazing.  Cashfly is a CDN, a content delivery network  that gives you better speed, more reliability.  It's up to 10 times faster, the traditional delivery methods,  up to 30 times faster than other CDNs.  The way it works is it has servers all over the world.  And when your users come to download your app,  to access your data, to download your podcast,  they do it from the server that's closest to them.  And that speeds things up by a lot.  And because there's servers all over the world,  it's got 100% SLA.  I know people say, you can't have more than whatever it is,  five, nine, six, nine.  No, you can.  Because they have so many servers,  they can guarantee 100%.  And there's an SLA for that.  The best user experience for all your customers,  no matter where they are, what device they're on.  I am a huge fan of Cashfly.  I never get that 3 a.m. call, the content,  the system's downward, people aren't getting the podcast.  The roads must roll and Cashfly keeps them rolling.  Join the thousands that trust Cashfly's reliable network,  LG, Microsoft, Adobe, Ars Technica.  No billing spikes either because Cashfly works  to make a plan tailored to your needs.  We have very spiky demand, as you might imagine.  A lot of people download stuff Sunday night,  they download Twitter.  But what Cashfly will work with you is to base it  on your yearly trends, not your daily, nightly,  weekly, monthly trends.  That way you get a great result.  See, five by five is on Cashfly.  Cashfly's awesome.  On average, customers who switch to Cashfly save 20%.  That's a nice chunk of change.  Just for you right now, Cashfly will give you  a complimentary detailed analysis of your current CDN bill  to see if you can save 20%.  Roblox uses Cashfly.  Zapier uses Cashfly.  Procter and Gamble uses Cashfly.  The NFL uses Cashfly.  Twit.cashfly.com.  See if you're paying more than you should be.  Twit.cashfly.com.  We thank Cashfly for literally bringing you our show.  Robert Heaton, software engineer.  This was such a great piece.  I had to bring it today.  Three weeks ago, he writes,  I received a very flattering email  from the University of Cambridge  asking me to judge the Adam Smith Prize for Economics.  Wow, what an honor.  Now he does point out, he's not an economist.  He does have a subscription to The Economist.  And he's read Capital in the 21st Century,  but he's not an economist,  yet that did not raise any alarm bell.  Well, maybe a little.  He got a little suspicious,  so he says I reflexively did  some basic security hygiene checks.  The email was from a Cambridge,  University of Cambridge, cam.ac.uk email address.  There was a link to know more about the Adam Smith Prize.  The link was on the Cambridge domain.  He said it struck me as a little odd.  The page was hosted inside somebody's personal directory  instead of on the main site,  but well, maybe less bureaucracy.  So he clicked the link  and read a little bit about the history of the prize.  That was his mistake.  Can you pinpoint the mistake at this point?  He clicked on the link.  Yeah.  He said if the person sending this email  had added seven extra words to this page,  I would have been screwed.  This page must be viewed in Firefox.  The reason is there's a zero day, it's been fixed,  but there was a zero day in Firefox  that allowed a bad guy, a malformed webpage  to attack your Firefox  and steal all your passwords stored in Firefox.  It's been used against the folks at Coinbase  with great effect.  And I guess it was being used against even more than that.  He didn't see any problems, so he emailed him back.  He went back and forth.  He did say, I'm curious,  why did you ask, who recommended me?  Gregory, not his real name, replied,  we got a candidates list from San Francisco State.  Now he says, I'm starting to worry.  He says, probably there's another guy with a similar name  sitting in his office wondering why he wasn't being asked  to judge.  He says, hi, Gregor, I'm starting to wonder  if some wires got crossed.  I mean, I've read some books by Paul Krugman,  but I'm not an economist, I'm a software engineer.  Is there another Robert Heaton in San Francisco  who knows more about economics?  And then Gregory, yeah, might be a mistake.  I'll get back to you.  And that's the last he heard from him.

So they are scanning, there are databases.  Edge uses it, Chrome uses it, Firefox and others use it.  Obviously, that page wasn't flagged  because he was able to go to it without a flag.

And yeah, I mean, and if they had put, has to be viewed.  Although, I mean, I think there's something to be said,  has to be viewed in Firefox, but probably in some cases,  hopefully raise suspicions.  Like I know for me, if I were to read something that said,  you have to view this link in this browser,  and I don't know who it's from,  I would like to think, I can't guarantee this.

Or I would disregard it and try to use  the browser I typically use anyway.  But yeah, I mean, it's scary for sure.  I think that the thing here too is the fact that  it was able to grab the passwords from Firefox's browser.  This is probably another good kind of, again,  diversification of security stuff.  I tend to try to store all my passwords  in my password manager.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So scary, because this is, I don't know,  I mean, any one of us could have fallen for this.  Totally.  Yeah.  Yep.  Did you, when was it?  Was it this week?  I guess it was, that CloudFlare for three hours was offline.  And that was like, what CloudFlare?  This is the internet backbone for so many sites  to keep them safe from DDoS attacks.  Wasn't a DDoS attack.  It was a bad BGP route.  This is such a horrific story.  And it's happened, what's really horrific  is it keeps happening.  So the Border Gateway Protocol is a protocol,  and I am not an expert on this.  Steve, I think, did a better job  explaining this on security now.  But in general, you can use a router  to broadcast your route to the internet.  And if it's properly formed, it says,  if you wanna come to my website,  this is how you get here,  if it's malformed, you can in effect say,  all internet traffic, come to me.  And that's what happened.  A small internet service provider  screwed up its BGP route.  Actually, it did it because it was using an optimizer,  and the optimizer screwed it out  as a DQE communications and ISP in Pennsylvania.  They used the optimizer and essentially published a route  that said all internet traffic should go through  a small company in Pennsylvania  called Allegheny Technologies.  Now, the transit provider for DQE  was a little company you might've heard of called Verizon.  Verizon then broadcast that route worldwide.  Yup.  Cloudflare noticed it, as you might expect they did,  and then they tracked it down,  and they figured out it was coming through Verizon.  They tried to reach Verizon.  Nobody answered their emails.  They're actually in their blog post.  They published the phone calls, the emails.  Urgent, route leak from your customer.  Here's the phone calls they made to DQE's knock,  to Verizon, to Verizon engineers.  They tried pager duty, they tried to wake up everybody.  Finally, DQE responded.  Three hours later, they were able to fix this.  But, whoop.  Is that me?  I think maybe Verizon's on the line.  But this is in the Cloudflare blog post.  How could this leak have been prevented?  There are multiple ways this leak could have been avoided.  For instance, you can configure your session  to have a hard limit of prefixes to be received.  So if all of a sudden the entire internet arrives  at your door, you go, oops,  and you take that route offline.  If Verizon had such a prefix limit in place,  none of this would have happened.  It doesn't cost a provider like Verizon anything  to have such limits in place.  And there's no good reason other than sloppiness  or laziness that they wouldn't have them.  There's other ways to do it, IRR filtering.  There's an RPKI framework that prevents this.  It has happened before.  It probably will happen again.  We're losing people right and left here.  We just lost Dwight.  Now all three of you have fallen off.  Skype must be having some of these problems too.  Anyway, it's just another caution,  a second cautionary tale.  We really gotta get people to do the right thing  and protect the internet.  This is ridiculous.  This should never have happened.

Start time: 7276.24
End time: 7302.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it never should have happened.  And then it's really frustrating that Verizon,  it took them three hours to get back in touch.  Three hours?  You would think that with one of the biggest backhauls  in the world, there should be an easier way to like,  because obviously they use PagerDuty.  Obviously they have people who are on call  for these purposes.  For partners who are the size of CloudFlare,  I would like to think that they would be able  to have that direct line.  That's kind of the concerning thing.

This is mostly a story about why you shouldn't,  you should be careful not to give any company  too much information.  And you certainly shouldn't use open wifi networks  at hotels or coffee shops.

I 1,000% agree with that, but there's a certain irony  that at the base level, at the top,  as we saw with the Marriott hack,  I was like, and I'm one of those bomb boy,  like, ambassador people.

Start time: 7458.50
End time: 7470.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Speaker: SPEAKER_10

That's why that was the fine.  Well, you're gonna get that loss anyway.  And free meals from the state for four months.  FCC has allowed Verizon to,  now remember, Verizon doesn't lock its cell phones  because of a consent decree with the FCC.

Start time: 7522.32
End time: 7561.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they will auto unlock, that's the good thing.  Like I'm a Verizon customer begrudgingly  and I am at least happy, like this is frustrating,  especially for people who do go internationally or whatever,  but this is, at least it's only two months  and they'll auto unlock.  What's always frustrated me before,  like with AT&T and some of the others  is you have to call them.  And even if you bought it outright,  they'll give you the runaround  before they'll unlock your phone.  And you're like, okay,  but I'm going to another country.  Oh, we'll just pay our inflated rate.  I'm like, no, but I don't wanna do that.  So that's at least, I guess, good  that it'll be auto unlocked,  but it is disappointing that they're able to auto lock,  that they're able to lock people's phones.

Start time: 7561.52
End time: 7593.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They're excused for this, which they,  and by the way, they've been locking them  before sale as well.  Their excuse for it is to prevent theft.  But T-Mobile had none of it.  They told the FCC, there's no evidence  this limited action would have the desired effect.  During the 60 day period,  a fraudulent party would merely be required  to make a payment of about $40.  And Verizon would unlock it.  So there's no evidence this is gonna do anything.  I don't know.  Verizon, I think probably would just like  to slowly increase this from 60 days to 90 days.

Start time: 7594.64
End time: 7607.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, that's totally what they want.  They don't want people to leave your network.  They don't want people buying their phones  and then able to use them on another network.  And it's like, okay, but as long as I'm paying my bill,  then why do you care?

Start time: 7608.38
End time: 7621.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Exactly, this matters even less now.  In the old days where you bought a phone  and it was subsidized,  you could make a certain argument.  Yeah, they, it's their phone still.

Start time: 7621.26
End time: 7623.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right, during the subsidy period.  Yeah.

Start time: 7623.84
End time: 7654.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but now where you're not,  that's just not a thing anymore  and you are essentially leasing this phone,  but you are paying for it.  And a lot of times not directly to the carrier, right?  Sometimes it's to whatever the third party is.  So yeah, it's really not cool  that the SIM locking thing is still a thing.  Would love to see the FCC take a stronger hand  in making SIM locking illegal.

Start time: 7654.78

End time: 7709.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I 1000% agree.  I mean, and it's interesting,  but at this point, people have moved  to these payment plans.  Like, Apple obviously has their own  and if you get your phone through Apple,  then it's unlocked by whatever.  But then Verizon and AT&T and T-Mobile  will have their own kind of payment plans  where they'll say, oh, you just have to pay  an extra $20 on your bill.  And for some people that can be more convenient  than having to get a secondary contract agreement  with another company.  But I think that that really is kind of  the best case scenario for consumers.  If you can get it directly through your phone manufacturer

I asked Kevin Rose, I said, I want to start a business.  Your experience in this, what should we do?  He said, go to LegalZoom and they will do that  because I can't afford a lawyer.  They will do all the documents for you.  It's great.  They'll do LLCs, DBAs, S-Corp.  And by the way, you can also do your will there.  Your last will or living trust.  They have a friends and family discount right now  and I want you to take advantage of it  because it's almost too late.  LegalZoom's not a law firm.  I want to make this clear.  Although they do have a network.  They've organized a nationwide network  of independent attorneys who can provide actual advice  from attorneys for your business.  But what their whole idea was to create,  there's a lot of stuff that's paperwork  so that you can get a lot of the stuff done.  Business formation, wills and trusts,  intellectual property, we did our trademarks with LegalZoom.  You can just do with LegalZoom, save huge amounts of money.  And then if you need a lawyer, no problem.  They have lawyers that pre-negotiated flat fee prices  with them all over the country.  Don't wait another minute putting off the things  you need to get done.  There is, I mean, I wish we didn't need lawyers,  but it's true, we do.  We need paperwork.  This has to happen.  And if you're starting a business,  if you don't have a will, you've got to do this.  Visit LegalZoom.com right now.  The friends and family discount is 10%  and you can use the offer code TWIT at the checkout.  So please use the offer code TWIT.  That lets them know you heard it here, which helps us.

Transcript:  So apparently they're buying up restaurant web addresses  for restaurants that don't use Grubhub, I guess.

Start time: 7848.96
End time: 7908.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, it's even worse.  Sometimes it's that don't use them,  but a lot of times it's web addresses that do use them  and it will take them to their Grubhub page  and the Grubhub phone number.  So if you call the order,  you're actually going through Grubhub.  Oh.  And not the restaurant itself, right?  Because a lot of the restaurants themselves,  they'll use Grubhub, which also owns Seamless  because it can be more convenient  and they handle a lot of backend things,  but it costs them a lot of money.  And I know that when I was in New York City,  where Seamless rules the whole kind of space,  very frequently a lot of the delivery places  would have things inside the food saying,  please order directly from our website  because they can get better,  they don't have to pay as much money there  and their margins are a lot better.  So the idea would be, okay, I Googled this restaurant  and rather than going to the page  that has their own delivery system,  which might cost them less money,  instead Grubhub is buying their very similar domain name  and trying to filter everything through them.

Transcript:  This is kind of a expose published in New Food Economy  at newfoodeconomy.org.  Grubhub sent them a statement saying,  Grubhub has never cyber squatted,  which is identified by ICANN  as a generally bad faith registration  of another person's trademark and a domain name  as a service to our restaurants.  We have created microsites for them  as another source of orders  and to increase their online brand presence.  Additionally, we have registered domains on their behalf,  consistent with our restaurant contracts.  We no longer provide that service  and it's always been our practice  to transfer the domain to the restaurant  as soon as they request it.

Transcript:  So I actually ran into this a couple of weeks ago  where I ordered some Chinese food  near the Chronicle for lunch  and I had done this before online  with this particular restaurant  and I would go to their website  and they would have their own system.  I went, I Googled their website and clicked on a link  and it took me to a Grubhub site  and it was not the restaurant itself  and I thought, wait a minute.  And so I manually typed in the URL, which I knew  and it took me back to them  and then when I clicked on their order online,  it took me to a Grubhub embed page on their site.  But my initial trip, my initial click,  took me to this Grubhub thing that didn't look right  and it almost looked like it had been hijacked.

Start time: 7994.94
End time: 8015.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So this actually happened to you.  So the reason this works is because Grubhub's contracts  with the restaurant give them a higher commission  if the customer comes through Grubhub to the restaurant  as opposed, so if you go to the restaurant page and order,  even if Grubhub delivers it,  they don't make as much money  as if you go through Grubhub to get to them.  So it makes sense.  And that's what I wound up doing.

Start time: 8015.70

Transcript:  So it's really, it's just so not cool because,  for example, there's a small business owner,  not far from here that owns a smoothie and sandwich shop  and they started taking one of these services recently  and I was asking them just because they're great  and a lot of us go there  and I was just like, how's that going?  Just what, is there a good reason to do it?  And they're like, look, we think of that as 80% of a sale,  because the service takes 20% of that sale in this case,  80% of a sale that we wouldn't have gotten anyway.  So for us, we're willing to do it.  We take a smaller margin, but that's why we're willing to.  But if that's a customer that would have come to them anyway  and then they're getting redirected  and basically Grubhub's taking that,  they're really taking money straight out of the pocket  of small business owners who are working on small margins,  who are just trying to make it  and trying to live off of this and pay their employees.  And so it's just so not cool.  It's in such bad faith that they would do it.  It just makes you not wanna do business with a company  that would try to literally just take money  out of the pocket of small business.

Transcript:  This is an example.  This is, in Daytona Beach,  there's a sub shop called Molly Hatchett's,  their, which is a great name,  their URL is mollyhatchett'ssubshop.com.  And if you go there, you'll get the real Molly Hatchett's  page where they have their own online ordering system,  not a Grubhub system.  But there is a Grubhub page they made,  mollyhatchett'ssubshopdetonabeach.com,  where the order goes through Grubhub.  And of course they make a lot more money.  In fact, they don't make any money  if you use Molly Hatchett's order system.  So that is kinda, that's close to the main squatting.

Transcript:  I definitely think so.  I mean, and I like seamless Grubhub.  I use them a lot, but that's,  I'm not a fan of this in the slightest.  And especially since that article,  and I read it, I was not familiar with that publication,  but it's really good.  They've talked to some business owners  who have seen the fees increase over the years,  and they've had to kind of,  it's impacted their businesses quite a bit.  Like really makes you kinda, it's gross, right?  Cause like, they're already, they have a good service.  And it's one of those things where a lot of,  I think restaurants would use them anyway,  knowing, like Jason was saying, knowing the trade-offs.  But this is going into another direction.  Like this is literally trying to use your own SEO,  your own purposes to take,

Transcript:  Right, we have, when the Chronicle moved from downtown  out to a, not necessarily suburban,  but a rather further out location,  we're kind of, you have to get in your car  to go somewhere to get any food.  And so, we have two services here that are very interesting.  We have one called Lunch Drop,  where every day there are two different restaurants,  and you can choose from the complete menu  of either of these two restaurants,  and you pay, and there's a very small delivery fee,  because they're bringing items in in bulk,  and you can get one from either of these restaurants,  and they usually arrive hot, and it's fresh.  And then, there's also a company called Fuda  that comes in and allows places, restaurants,  to set up pop-up shops in our cafeteria area.  So, we have like a Chick-fil-A from down the road  comes in and sells Chick-fil-A.  We have a bunch of barbecue places that come in,  and those are good.  We have a lot of Asian, we have a lot of Halal comes in.  So, every day there's a different restaurant  in the building, and you order through an app.  You go in, you pick what you want,  you show them your barcode, and you walk away.  I'm so impressed.

But for you, and I imagine a lot of businesses in Houston,  that's a sensible business.  And what is empowering this?

You know, there's all this footage nobody's ever seen  from all the different cameras.  And they just put it in this timeline,  which is a brilliant idea that you can participate  in real time if you wanted.  You'd start right now.  And you'd go up to, what is it, July 11th is the landing?  July 20th.  20th.  July 20th, yeah.  You could have it running in the background at all time.  But there's a lot, unfortunately,  if I'm searching Apollo 11 timeline,  there's like 800 of these.  Oh, here's an interactive timeline.  Let's see if this is it.  Is this the one?

In fact, Bloomberg did a good job of tracking this down  because they were looking at,  they used social media to check resumes  posted by Indian engineers  and a company called HCL.  And many of them had on their resume,  they helped design and test  Boeing's MAX flight display software.  Another Indian company handled software  for the flight test equipment.  So, in fact, it was much less efficient  because the coders from HCL Technologies  were designing specifications from Boeing.  So it added an extra step.  In fact, it took many rounds, according to one engineer,  going back and forth because the code wasn't done right.  That's not a reflection on the Indian engineers  by any means, but.  No, not at all.

If they're making $5 an hour,  which was the going rate at the time.  It's a process problem.  It's a process problem, I guess.  Yes.  And we've seen this happen so many times  in so many American companies where they outsource  and the results are not good.  Let's see.  53 essential tech bro terms.  How to speak Silicon Valley.

It's funny because it's true.  The president's tweets might be,  if you look at the president's tweets,  you might see a gray box.  Twitter has finally somehow addressed the conundrum  of what do you do if the leader of the free world  doesn't follow your rules?  You can't cut them off the platform.  So they're rolling out a new notice for tweets  belonging to public figures  that break the community guidelines.  What they do is they'll give you a gray box that says,  the Twitter rules about abusive behavior  apply to this tweet.  However, Twitter has learned it may be in the public's  interest for the tweet to remain available.  And then they have a button view.

I think that for people who have their own income streams,  it's a different scenario.  But for a lot of smaller creators,  not being able to monetize is actually a pretty good way  of shutting down people, you know.

Of course, a lot of people rushing to the airport  to catch a flight or pick up travelers.  The detour took them to a dirt road  near the border of Denver and Aurora.  She wasn't immediately concerned,  they're quoting Connie Monsey's, thanks to crowd psychology.  My thought was, well, all these other cars  are in front of me, so it must be okay.

But I mean, what I wanna know is how many Ubers this was.  Because this would be terrible regardless.  You're gonna miss your flight, you're late for the airport,  whatever, but imagine if you're the person  who's in the Uber, who the Uber driver just followed  Google Maps blindly and then you're like,  everybody involved there, that would be terrible.
