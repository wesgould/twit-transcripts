Transcript:  Elgin dot com el gan dot com  So, okay, we could start the show in two ways  We could start by talking about the election this week or we could start by talking about the new emojis  Broccoli before chocolate. Yeah, all right ripping the band-aid off. Okay. Okay, let's rip the band-aid and we'll just what we will tell people though  Because I have to say I think I would bet almost all of us on whatever side of the aisle  We are are kind of tired of this and we would like to take a break  And I loved Garrison Keillor. I quoted this when you were here on Wednesday on twig to go out and you know  What do you say was very funny take some yoga classes?  Ten some kale something like that. Yeah tend to our marigolds and relax a little bit  But we will rip the band-aid off for this first segment  So I reassure you in fact if you want to fast forward through the first segment, I wouldn't blame you but yet I  Think we have to talk about a number of things including social media's impact on the election. Yes  And what let's do this in a nonpartisan manner  I don't you know  One of the things that it's kind of disheartening to me is all the blame that's being thrown around now by the losing side  Which happens I guess every four years but and also the winning side oddly enough. Yeah

Start time: 329.38
End time: 335.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

End time: 381.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know. Is that true? I think that young people as in a generation younger than Alex and I I'd say college kids  Let's say yes  Both Alex and I have aged out of the 18 to 25 demographic.

Start time: 431.74
End time: 474.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Anyway, action has to sell the argument the argument about Facebook is that Facebook became a conduit for fake news  fake news being  trumped up stories  Contended well about either side but but mostly about Hillary Clinton  Saying things like you know, oh the you know, she's already been indicted all sorts of stuff  That was demonstrably not true and yet because people get their news from Facebook and read it more than once over and over and over  again on Facebook it became it started get the weight of of truth and  The the accusation which I'm not sure I buy is  That Facebook has some culpability for this that they should have done something about this

Start time: 475.02
End time: 492.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's a two-part point. The first thing I'll say is for a lot of people Facebook is the internet  It's where they start is where they go from and so for many people they presume that what they see there has some sort of  Veting I think behind it. They don't they don't look at do they they think there's vetting no  No, not vetting per se but there's something there that gives it some credibility. It is because it's there

Start time: 493.02
End time: 519.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not just some random website exactly except it is in fact, it's Macedonian  Rangers  Random websites, but because they saw there's a lot of money to be made in clickbait by the way  They're not partisan but in clickbait articles  Drived that they promote on Facebook that drive traffic to their sites which have ads and they make money on this  So there's I was reading an interview with a Macedonian 16 year old who created a political site for this very reason

Start time: 520.00
End time: 526.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Brilliant if it didn't bring down Western democracy, but the reason why I see that might's my contention it didn't and by the way

Start time: 529.00
End time: 534.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Zuckerberg's also contention is that's crazy. How could that we'll get to suck. Yeah, he's like I

Start time: 535.34
End time: 606.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wanted to get to suck. I mean he's he's he's had a couple of  Obnoxious things to say about all this the first of which is that it's crazy to say that Facebook  Sway the election and then when people like me started tweeting  So you mean you're telling your advertisers that Facebook is not influential in any way  Exactly. And so he backed off that and said well no 99% of the of the news on Facebook is legitimate news  So you're saying 1% of it is false. First of all, second of all, you said you couldn't identify  What's fake and what's real? That's very difficult problem. So that's what you told me now exactly either, you know  What percentage is fake or you can't tell you know, it doesn't you can't have a both ways  You either can't tell or you know that 99% of it is real. So he's scrambling because he he doesn't want to  Let's look at it this way. If you if you want to blame Zuck think of this as a business problem if he was losing  30 million users a month. Okay, his shareholders would say you have to fix this and he wouldn't say well  There's nothing we can do when it comes to making money, right?  He never says oh, we're not really like doing anything about this now in fairness  He said he did say that he's gonna do something about the fake news problem  They're gonna do as much as they can but wait him. All right

Start time: 606.82
End time: 652.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, no, so here's the thing we can look back in terms of history when it comes to the way that Facebook has dealt with  News before which is that they have as a platform  Traditionally affected the way that news has been seen on the newsfeed point-blank period  There was a time in which when I was on Facebook, I could see nothing but up worthy posts  I could see nothing but yes, you know 10 fixed that 10 ways that'll blow your mind mashed potatoes  And they fixed it yes and they fixed it and so the issue is that it comes down to is if you've interfered in the  Way that news is presented before on your platform  What makes it what makes this different now and what about this time?  What about the way that this news or this non news is being disseminated through your platform?  What about it makes it an exception to the rule that you've already set for face?

Start time: 653.26
End time: 678.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, but I've been getting fake news on the internet since the internet began I've been getting  Foolish emails. I've been seeing on every social medium up to this point  Stupidity why is fake? Hey, why should Facebook be held responsible for what how people use it? They use Facebook  Facebook is a tool. Okay, and I don't think Facebook needs to be any more responsible for the content than the phone

Start time: 679.26
End time: 697.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sound that sounds reasonable until you realize two things the news feed algorithm that sorts and shows you stuff of its own volition is an editorial  Product and trending topics is also an editorial product. They should dump. I agree with you. They should dump trending  I don't care about if they're jumping or not  But as long as they're gonna be making editorial choices with what content they show individual people, especially in a political nature

Start time: 698.70
End time: 720.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're making a stand as a media company just so everybody's clear on exactly what's happening. Facebook is not showing you they're blocking  They're preventing they're censoring whatever you want to call it  Something like 80 plus percent of what the people you follow post so on average generally speaking  So what is the criteria? What should it be the criteria right now? The criteria is whatever is viral  Well, these false memes are designed to be viral. So this is easy to fix

Start time: 721.13
End time: 735.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay  Dump trending topics and make the news feed be most recent which by the way, you can do for yourself  Temporarily sorted just temporarily sorted no algorithm. Why can't what what if Zuckerberg did that would everybody say?  And that solves it it makes less money

Start time: 735.78
End time: 738.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a two steps forward two steps back. You know why it makes less money

Start time: 738.94
End time: 741.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why is you don't enjoy it as much you don't spend as much time on the page?

Start time: 741.62
End time: 744.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not as sticky as I know that eating carbs is bad for me. The fries are delicious

Start time: 745.12
End time: 769.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So all Facebook is doing is what it should do as its responsibility to its stakeholders  Which is making maximizing profits by making you spend more time on the feed  It's created a computer computer is nonpartisan that doesn't have an opinion. It's merely  Crafting the feed with one goal in mind you feed into the computer  Okay, your only job is to make somebody who read stay on that page as long as possible. Okay, got it  I'll take it from here

Start time: 769.72
End time: 776.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I too am a capitalist but I do think they have a higher more responsibility to the people because they've 1.7  I think that way lies

Start time: 776.84
End time: 808.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Trouble not not at all not at all because because essentially fact-checking exists. It's a tradition that's been around for decades  Organizations are really good at it. If you're a hundred organization, they are a news organization  Social media site they are determining what we see and what we don't see period  They're editing what's out there so that we see a minority of what is posted  They're giving you more of what you want. But but here's the thing people don't know that  Right people don't want lies. They they think if they went up worthy hurt them they stopped it. Okay

Start time: 808.96
End time: 811.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, no, so up where they still exist and they still do this

Start time: 811.92
End time: 826.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All that linking to link bait click bait articles made people dislike Facebook  I remember I was like, yeah, and so they got rid of it. Yeah, I think that what it comes out a political thing  They just got rid of it because you didn't like it make Trump unprofitable again

Start time: 827.42
End time: 846.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Also, I think so what you want the problem the problem with the evolution of moving it back to the most recent timeline feed  Is the fact that they censored that stuff and they limit that stuff because if you saw a raw feed of what?  Everybody you were friends with posted or friends of friends posted on Facebook  It would look like the most insane waterfall time I choose to follow

Start time: 848.60
End time: 853.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I do that. I always look at most recent. It's almost recent. I look at both

Transcript:  Let's stop talking about like small points talk about the impacts of this  So my dad currently lives in Alabama of all places and he works down there  And so we talk on the phone more often than you know  I think what we'll do but he was telling me about voters down there that he hangs out with and just just people from the  South very kind of standard people down there and the things they actually believed were true about Clinton  He brought this up unbidden by the way  I didn't bait him into this and he was like I was really confused of what they thought was true that they claimed they had  Read on the internet and he says from Facebook

Start time: 889.54
End time: 911.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  People voting in geographic proximity have  Similar opinions even if they never went online  You hear from your friends you hear at the corner store. You hear from everybody  That's the story you hear you buy it. I respect entirely. What do you want to do?  Do you want to have some sort of magic headphones? I think balance the information

Start time: 912.10
End time: 938.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, you don't bounce it politically you you you have fact-checkers just like every news publication ever had  No, but okay should Facebook Facebook no because Facebook needs to look the things you see are based on criteria  One of those criteria should be is it patently false or is it not patently false if it's gonna decide that big fact-checkers  And also I don't believe is there a is there agreement among if there's a news story that says Donald Trump is Jack the Ripper

Start time: 938.78
End time: 944.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, that is so false legitimately wrong stuff, but then there's a lot of stuff in the middle everything ranks

Start time: 944.90
End time: 961.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That this is a this is a this problem has been solved long ago  You can rank things as the fact-checking sites do of which there are more than a hundred and most of them are really good  Something is either more or less true  It's factually true or it's patently false the patently false stuff should get at least a ding against it as if nobody clicked

Start time: 963.32
End time: 965.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You see a big red thumbs down. What do you?

Start time: 967.94
End time: 1027.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Users already can report false news it actually exists already within the Facebook UI  There's a good solution it already exists. It is about three layers deep  I'll tell you that so maybe if we go to I don't like this and then you have to say it's  Why is it false and then you have to say it's a false news?  It's the same abuse process for everything else it exists  But if you're going to have a reporting system you can do two things one you can make it not so buried in the UI to  Make it easy for people to report and two you can follow up with it  And if that's the case you follow up and just like when people do  DCMA takedowns or when they do copyright takedowns they can look at it and they could say okay  Well, what is this is it true or false and then they can adjust the algorithm accordingly  That's kind of in a perfect world how the workflow should be but at the same time  I think the difficulty is and you said this before which is truthiness exists  And there's always going to be a level of people who believe that certain things are true  Certain things are false and then certain people who also believe that snopes is a liberal mind control organization  It isn't

Start time: 1027.84
End time: 1053.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, my question is why are we having discussion?  Now had we won the election had we had the Democrats won the election would we be having this discussion?  I would hope that we would still be I think not we didn't have this discussion before the election  Well, who writes the script seems to me as if this is  Kind of another one of those blame game things. Oh, well we lost so it's Facebook's fault

Start time: 1054.24
End time: 1080.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's forget about the outcome of the election then I I'm on Twitter a lot I'm on social media  I'm Twitter do this never get an end. I remember I've been around for a long time arguing online about politics for several elections now  Right, and this is the first election where you couldn't have an argument about policy or politics  You'd start to have an argument and the what was coming back at you was like you were trying to disprove  Like weird thing like you know, I know to a political argument

Start time: 1080.84
End time: 1092.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We teach people to have more critical judgment and to understand what's true and not true and do their own fact-check  I feel like putting the responsibility on Facebook to do this is completely the wrong thing

Start time: 1092.66
End time: 1113.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No one no one is saying that Facebook  But always if they're going to make editorial choices like the newsfeed and trending topics  They should accept the full responsibility of that choice or do nothing that is editorial. Yes report our point  They can't have their cake needed to that's all we're trying to say  I don't want Facebook to become the supreme arbiter of all things true because they'd be horrible at it  But right now what they're doing is bad

Start time: 1114.84
End time: 1125.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 1125.84
End time: 1144.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's wiki has a by the way a fabulous system that seems to work quite well  Yes at getting it aiming towards the truth  There are obviously many inaccuracies and falsehoods on Wikipedia, but it seems to self-correct very well  That's a nonprofit site does I mean it's the almost the antithesis of Facebook

Start time: 1145.96
End time: 1180.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It also has some of the longest standing information wars that exist and yes by the power  They use as they should so if right so if for example  Facebook allowed the intake an easier intake of false news reports and  They were able to use that as a guideline in order to create a better system for how they manage the algorithm  Especially when it's related to news then it's exactly like what they were doing before what they've always been doing  And it's also in line with their policy the issue is they don't Facebook

I agree moments Twitter has responsibility  Because they've they've decided they've taken it upon themselves  So this goes back to it actually an age-old conversation on the internet that comes down the telecommunications act of  1996 actually of 1938 there are you a common carrier?  Like the phone company the phone company  Has no responsibility for the content of phone calls because it's a common carrier under Title 2 under Title 2 I  Would submit that social media is that?  But I understand what you're saying is when they take on a larger role is this slippery slope and in fact  I think that's why I would advocate they take on no role they stay a common carrier  The minute they take on a role then they have a higher response

We don't really know  What is gonna happen of course one hopes that the most misogynistic racist things that he said and encouraged were  Inappropriate rhetoric that he will abandon, but we don't know and so what I'd like to do and maybe I maybe that's wrong  But what I'd like to do is defer  judgment until such time as  He says what his policy I think that's the FCC

He uses a Galaxy phone  The Android postings are usually the most unhinged late-night postings seem to be from the real Donald Trump  Maybe he lets the transition team and the government take over at POTUS and I love the idea that we're seeing an  unexpurgated  View of the president isn't that direct drive?

We've seen companies use  Third parties like we pro in India to hire unskilled workers at a very low rate  Disney did this  Appallingly hired hundreds of unskilled workers brought them in or moderately skilled workers brought them and had Disney's own IT guys train them  and then fired the Disney employees and kept the  Invited employees that's a misuse of H1B and I do think the Trump has condemned that  He's also suggested that the H1B minimum wage be raised. So it's not a cheaper way to get  staff talent  and but at the same time I  He's also got a pro-business stance. I'm I have no I think this is

Start time: 2200.20
End time: 2241.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's one perspective that I haven't heard expressed and I think it's a valuable one  the the the current are the way us the US currently  enforces and  legislates immigration is  People at the bottom of the economic ladder are unprotected by immigrants  So people come flooding in by the millions to take  lower skill lower wage jobs and and lower skill lower wage  Americans have to compete again with those immigrants for those jobs. Whereas in the white-collar world, there's this like  ridiculously small cap  Right HBH B1 visa program  It's the lawyers and these professionals and the college grads are protecting themselves from having to keep it compete with immigrants

Transcript:  And this is the other thing Trump has said is if people well  I don't like seeing people come to our country go to Harvard and Princeton get this great training and leave  I want to keep them in the country which makes perfect sense via the H1B visa program  I think the phrase I don't understand what his policy is. Yeah, right. That's all I'm saying  And that's why in some respect. I think it's a good idea to wait and see what he does  Because he is he's got kind he you know Apple on the one hand he tells  Apple well  You know from now on if the FBI asked you to unencrypt you're gonna unencrypt and by the way  Time to start making all your stuff here in the United States on the other hand  He says but we're gonna let you take all those billions of dollars you have in Ireland  We're gonna let you repatriate that at an all by mere 10% tax rate and we're gonna cut the corporate tax rate  So did you do if you're Tim Cook do you go?

Transcript:  Yes, he said both things he said he said it's crazy to think that we determined, but we're working on it  We know it's a huge problem. It's a very difficult problem, and we're working on it  We're trying to reduce the amount of falsehoods on on  Facebook, but I think there's there's simply two things they need to do number one  They need to look at the algorithm and and they need to to  De-viralify  Things that are obviously false. I think that would be a nice step don't delete them  You know don't ban them like you ban other innocuous things like women's breasts and stuff like that when they're breastfeeding  But D. You know don't let them go so viral take a couple of points off or something like that  Right exactly, and and I think the other thing they need to do is they need to work on this filter bubble problem  I mean there has to be some  Responsibility because filter bubble is self-reinforcing the more of the  More inside the bubble you are the more the stuff you see makes you more inside the body think forced busing is the solution

Transcript:  In the old days when TV used to go over the airwaves the idea was that the American people own the American airwaves and therefore  We know you'd like to just do nothing but have frivolous entertainment news channel ABC NBC CBS  You miss those but but you have a responsibility because we're letting you use our airwaves and therefore you have about responsible news  Let me finish this one point though, and and so Facebook comes along says well  We're gonna replace the the TV stations, and we're gonna send all this stuff, but we're not gonna take any of that responsibility stuff  We don't want anything that's gonna stop us from making massively billions of profits what they need to do is  Inject the other side into the filter bubble even if people don't like it even if it makes people spend less time online  I think that's up to people I followed every all 17 GOP candidates.

What if we did that? It's called the news hour  No, actually it's you find a lot of people who would disagree with that you're talking about the PBS news  Yeah, but well people are gonna disagree with facts, but here's that's why this is the problem is who's gonna decide  Who's gonna run that not the government vote for me?

We are a place. We're not a thing  No  You're a thing  You exist and you make decisions and you make decisions about what people see and about what people hear and about what people watch  So knowing that knowing that's the case, right? We need these I mean everybody and I'm not just talking about Facebook  I'm not just talking about social media sites  You can argue now that Netflix has a vested interest in what they do as they're not a plat just a platform anymore  They create their own content you have these companies that are now pushing forward their own interests  Whether that's their own content by pulling their own media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Try to do is avoid as many rules as possible because the more rules the this is just an intractable problem  I agree the best thing to do would be to start educating people  That everything you read on the internet is not true and start using your freaking brain  The problem is they believe they believe it because they want to believe it and there's nothing you can do about it

Transcript:  I was going to say that I don't know if Twitter exactly does anything in terms of news curation that are really well curated  But isn't that what you follow?  well  The thing is for me. I don't necessarily go to Twitter for news unless it's breaking  I look at it to see what the conversation is I look at it to see how people are discussing news rather than the news itself  If I'm learning unless it's a an immediate breaking news story if it's news of the day  I'm probably getting it off of an RSS reader. I'm probably getting it off of the sites that I frequent  It's part of my natural news gathering experience as Alex knows him in his house of tabs that he lives in  You just have so many tabs open you read and you refresh and and that's part of the you know the news gathering game  I think that Twitter's real thing is the conversation  So if you want to separate the two I mean nuzzles a great way to do so I will say the only downside of nuzzle

Oh, that's a good question  Dragon quest didn't make was that sell that didn't make the cut on not buy one now  I don't think it made it  I'm the probably the one that I'm most interested in in playing for real is a little known title by the name of star tropics  It's actually a game that my parents own  And it's actually very cool  It's kind of like are you gonna like it when you don't have to blow into the cartridge and well the reason why the NES classic  Is such a boon for retro gamers is that it actually has an HDMI port built in the issue is that when you actually do you?  If you run in a traditional NES through on a modern TV  So not a CRT television what ends up happening is that there is a lag that develops because they're actually converting the old  AV inputs into HDMI so the way that you say play Mario which is in within fractions of a second for example  It's a difference between you hitting the Goomba and the Goomba hitting you so a lot of people are very excited  Because then it gives them the opportunity to actually play on their modern televisions with the same response that they're used to actually I read a review

Transcript:  On that note our show today brought to you by Wealthfront  Wealthfront is a low. Oh love Wealthfront Wealthfront is is a new category  They sometimes they call them robo investors, right? Is that a little advisors advisors, but this does such a good job  It's amazing  now the  problem that  Robo advisors solve and Wealthfront sloughs the best of all the robo advisors is you need to be saving for long term, right?  You need to have a retirement fund  You need to save for college or that house you want to buy her just a rainy day fund and savings nowadays  Mean doesn't mean put it in the bank because the save what is the savings account like a quarter of a percent or something  It's ridiculous. So you're actually losing money. I think because it's barely keeping up with inflation instead  You need to invest but you don't have time  Trust me. You think you have time you don't have time to run your investment and if you're gonna go out and get an investment  You ought to know the traditional advisors charge between one two or three percent of what they manage and you know  One of the things that they're talking about  deregulating is this is this rule that requires an investment advisor not to have a  Stake in the stocks. He's telling you to buy that's that's gonna get turned around in which case now  Not only are they charging one two or three percent of what they manage. You can't even trust their advice  So  Wealth front this has fixed it all first of all one quarter of 1% a year  That's 25 basis points with no additional charges. No transaction fees. No hidden fees and it's a computer. So it has no biases  It's actually it's doing what it can to maximize your return  Minimize your taxes. It does something called tax lost harvesting, you know, you want to test a financial advisor?  Ask him are you doing tax loss harvesting? How often are you checking my balance my portfolio?  weekly monthly quarterly yearly  With wealth right it's every second because it's a computer  The system is based on Nobel Prize winning academic research of the best investment practices the best investment advisors people like Burton Malke  Charles D Ellis these guys wrote the books literally on how to make money on Wall Street and they have figured it out  I've talked to so many people now who use wealth front because of these ads and who say it has been great for me  They just introduced their 529 college savings plan. It's kind of like a Roth IRA for college  Three billion dollars in assets and growing fast because it works, but I don't want you to trust me  I want you to go to wealth front comm slash twit look at it  Take a look at their returns their historic, you know returns see how it works  They'll even generate a sample portfolio for you for free with just a few questions based on you know, your time frame and your  Risk tolerance that kind of thing and you get that for free  You could just take that with you see what allocation they recommend and if you sign up to invest I love this a  Little sweetener. They're gonna manage your first  $15,000 free of charge forever, but you have to go to wealth front comm slash twit wealth front comm  slash  Twit take a little of that money you set aside for your NES classic  Put it in wealth front. You can start with as little as 500 bucks  We had a great week on to we had a lot to talk about and our PlayStation Pro review  I mean it well, you know what? Here's a convenient thing.

I'm not gonna buy a mattress without lying on it, but really let me ask you something  The last time you lay on a mattress in a mattress store was that a satisfying experience?  Would you really get a sense of what that mattress is gonna be like when you get at home?  No, because it's broad daylight you got your shoes on and the sales person is looking at you like and that's no fun  Not for anyone  So when the Casper mattress comes see you know you don't have one night or two nights or even ten minutes  You've got a hundred nights to lie on it to whatever moves you whatever you need to test it. I personally  jumped up and down and  Then I invited my close personal friend  Ozzie the dog to lie on it with me and when Ozzie we have it's always heavy enough to like actually seven pounds  Yeah, he didn't even put it skirts across. He didn't put a tent on it  No, but he did like it because it has just the right sink just the right bounce  It's firm because it's got the memory foam, but it also has the the latex on top of it  It's just gives you a little you see so your hips  So yeah, this is you know sometimes your hips like you feel like you're flow it's no this goes they go in but then they find  respite  It's the 2016 Business Intelligence Group Innovation Award winner one of the best mattresses you ever eat  it's  Best the best one of the best the best I've ever slept on sleeps cool  So he's never too hot you never sweaty look at that pineapple loving it  Loving it on the Casper mattress.

Transcript:  It also feels a little bit neoprene II and that's kind of how it feels to me is it feels a little bit like neoprene  Which again it makes a lot of sense  But I'm putting it on I mean I sort of it's easy to adjust versus  The oculus and the vibe which can have several straps  And you got to like do some calculations measure on head doesn't have audio though  It does not so that's a piece of it. You will have to connect headphones into the phone  Um I used what many people are calling the killer app which is YouTube VR  And I will say YouTube VR super neat it obviously takes advantage of 360 degree videos  But also you're allowed to watch anything in YouTube's current library  Done on like that fake  Living room set up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'm I am an old lady at heart so I still own a television  So it's not necessarily I would say like a game changer for someone like me  but if you're on an airplane for example, and you want to watch something and you have  Wi-Fi that's something that you can do the one downside that I will say  That I found a little bit difficult is that the phone heats up like the dickens  Yeah, that's all of them do this, but I've used the gear VR though  And I think part of it has to do with the fact that it is a hard plastic  Interface that allows for an open back  Yeah  And I don't know if it's because it has that my galaxy s7 has actually shut down

Start time: 6783.64
End time: 6829.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it fits. I think it fits really nice. I think it's really easy and accessible  The one gripe that I always have is that I don't necessarily think it is small face friendly  You know if you've got kids or if you've got you know people with small faces  They might feel like it's still a little bit too big in the optical space is a little bit too big  That's that's what I find to be my my biggest  Difficulty and being able to like see underneath like through the nose like I have that problem  But that could also probably be a fit thing. It's a it's like a good  First crack if you're really interested in getting into VR, but you don't necessarily want to  Upgrade your rig or you are not a PlayStation 4 owner  It's definitely the way to go if you want to see something that's more accessible less resource-driven

Start time: 6830.02
End time: 6842.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And also it's got some like some cool stuff and you probably used it with the pixel XL the bigger phone  No, I use it with the because I have the I have the little pixel looked great  Okay, that was because this is 1080p. That was my concern

Start time: 6842.14
End time: 6861.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This might be it looks really nice and and there wasn't I didn't feel like there was an absence of that immersive feeling with the smaller  phone any  Stomach upset nausea. No, but I do you get anything anyway, I have  Okay, one time I got a little bit overzealous playing Minecraft and had to sit outside me too

Start time: 6867.96
End time: 6918.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're looking up a lot controller it's the controller feeling it's it's hard to describe  It's like a disconnect between the way that you want to move. Yeah, and also for me  I find that having to turn my whole body to look at something makes me nauseous very quickly  I will say that I think that it's probably because of the  The resource barrier  Involved in having a phone based VR system makes it so that those high-motion games really aren't a factor. So you won't have  As many opportunities to puke your guts out  But I think I think that if you're like a media consumer and you really want something that's going to  Kind of show off VR but like in a friendly like hey mom  Try this on Thanksgiving kind of way and not a like I want to be in the world of Minecraft kind of way  Then that is definitely the way to go and it's  Definitely more of a crowd pleaser than cardboard and it's only 80 bucks

Start time: 6919.12

Start time: 6948.66
End time: 6992.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um, it's I think that if you own a PlayStation 4 that's the logical progression and you if you are interested in VR  Then that's really the way to go  You don't have to worry about buying a new phone and having it having hit the resource ceiling  You don't have to worry about upgrading your PC or building your own PC or having like these  70,000 USB ports that you need for the HTC Vive  It plugs already in it's not perfect  I would say like it in terms of like the the fidelity to the VR experience what people love about the vibe and the oculus  You're not going to get with 100%  all cylinders firing on the PlayStation 4 but if you  Just because of processing power  But if you already own a PlayStation 4 and you're thinking about VR like I that's my recommendation

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If it's in HD you too if it's in HD  You can watch it  It doesn't need to be VR  And so if you like I said if you are somebody who doesn't really own like a huge monitor if you're a laptop only kind  of person or if you want to have  greater  I guess entertainment  immersive value while traveling  It's really great. I I personally think that it was a lot more fun and a lot more useful than  some of the  the in-app  Like the media apps that I've seen I don't know something about the way that YouTube has created its VR app  it feels  very natural and also  Allegiant to the YouTube experience.
