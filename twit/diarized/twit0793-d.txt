Stand back kids.  This is one for the ages.  You're going to want to put your thinking caps on because I have the two smartest people I know in the room.  Well they're not. They're only figuratively in the room.  They're in their own rooms because you know nobody can be in the same room with me anymore apparently.  Joining us right now from the future today Institute.  The wonderful Amy Webb.  It's great to see you.  Amy Webb dot I O.  Hey Leo.  The signals are talking her book about being a futurist.  Her latest that what is the gang of five.  No what is the name of the big nine.  The big nine. There's nine not five.  What am I saying.  The big nine and soon a micro  biology or not micro.  What kind of biology.  That it's synthetic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's why it should not be called re writing life because you can't say it.  No I like it. Re writing life is good.  Just practice.  Big big nine is currently out and available everywhere.  And Amy's been on triangulation a couple of times.  So has this guy Corey Doctorow who is the author of too many books to count.  Welcome to his new site is pluralistic dot net.  This is the new one.  A tax surface and he's doing something very unusual with this.  He's doing the audiobook via Kickstarter.  Why is that Corey. Welcome.

Start time: 235.60

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have done I should say is it over.  Kickstart is over. Yeah it did very well hundred and two hundred seventy thousand dollars.  Wow.  The eye as doctrinal matter don't allow  DRM on my work.  There is one company that dominates the audiobook market audible  and they have a mandatory DRM requirement.  I say that that's there to protect us authors.  And of course if you want to remove the DRM from an audible book you just type into your favorite search engine.  Very easy.  Yeah.  But under section 12 one of the digital money and copyright act it's a felony punishable by a five year prison sentence  and a five hundred thousand dollar fine to tell someone how to remove their DRM.  And so what that means is that I as the author if I sell you an audiobook on audible  and locking you to audibles platform forever  and I can't authorize you to take my work and leave it.  So if I ever get into a situation where I feel like Amazon's offering me a deal  I don't want to take and I try to go to one of its rivals.  You have to surrender your books to come follow me somewhere else  or maintain two separate and parallel sets of infrastructure to do it.  So this is terrible and I don't like it.  Amazon promised they would drop audibles DRM when they bought audible in 2008.  I've been waiting for 12 years.  I'm not holding my breath anymore.  And you know my publishers Macmillan they're they're very nice people  but they had the very sensible position that if I wouldn't allow them to sell my audiobooks  in the place where 90 percent of the customers were they didn't want to pay me for those rights.  And I was like that is perfectly fair and they said but you can keep them  and you can make your own audiobook.  That's why I did.  Yeah.  Yeah. So I went out I got Amber Benson who you may know as Tara from Buffy  but she's also a brilliant novelist.  I got her to record it at Skyboat Media which is a tremendous audiobook studio here in Southern California.  And we had my sound editor John Taylor Williams who's been editing my stuff for 15 years do the edit  and I pre sold it on Kickstarter along with the e-book which I sell on behalf of my publisher.  So if you buy it for me I give Macmillan 70 percent.  I take the 30 percent Jeff Bezos would normally get  and then my publisher takes 25 percent of that which is the author Sharon sends it back to me as a royalty.  Comes out to like 48 and a half percent which is it's a it's a it's a  bad.  So it's not bad.  Yeah.  I sold it. I sold the first two audiobooks.  I sold all three e-books.  I sold the new audiobook and all together we raised 270 thousand dollars including three ten thousand dollar pledges  for commissions to write new Little Brother short stories which are going to be the nucleus of a new short story collection.  So I got another book out of it as well.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This newest attack surface is the third in the Little Brother series.  Yeah.  And highly book for adults.  Highly recommend.  Yeah.  Highly recommended.  So that's good.  So if people want the audiobook do they go to the Kickstarter page or is there somewhere else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No that's that window is closed.  So that was your 15 dollar preorder price.  Now it's a 25 dollar audiobook that now that the preorder advanced price is over  and you can get that.  It's an audible exclusive which is to say it's exclusive of audible.  You can get anywhere that is an audible.

Transcript:  CrapHound.com amyweb.io  And now that ends the show.  So thank you very no I have a lot more to talk about.  I don't know where to start.  Normally you know we would talk about the iPhone event.  But when I have two big minds big brains here like this that seems kind of trivial to to talk about.  I want to talk actually about the story you put in slate this week.  Corey if you don't mind.  Because it kind of rang a bell with me it kind of hit home.  The dangers of cynical sci fi disaster stories.  It seems like that's all we're seeing these days.  And certainly if you're watching sci fi on TV on Amazon Prime or Netflix or HBO Max.  It's it's dystopia as far as the eye can see.  You've written your share of cynical sci fi disaster stories.  Why are you going to stop.

Start time: 523.66
End time: 681.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well I would say that I have written my share of cynical sci fi disasters.  If not the whole story was cynical I tend to be a pretty idealistic and optimistic or at least hopeful person.  I like everybody really enjoy a zombie apocalypse story.  There is something really exciting.  We're living in.  Yeah sure.  Yes.  And you know I'm a pulp writer I write science fiction.  I'm a pulp reader I read science fiction that means I like a lot of plot in my fiction.  And usually you know the two plots are person versus nature and like person versus person.  And if you're if you're trying to like really lean into the plot you could do person versus nature versus person.  And that's the story where like the tsunami knocks your house down your neighbors come over to eat you.  Yeah.  And those stories I've really enjoyed that there's so many of those that I've read that I've enjoyed and I've and there's a little brother actually opens with a scene like that where they're in.  After a terrorist attack they're down in a BART station and someone just randomly stabs someone else just because they can.  And I think the problem with that is twofold one is like a verse of millitude problem.  Are actually let's call it threefold one's a verse of millitude problem because generally we're pretty good to each other.  You know Rebecca Solnit's history of disasters paradise built in hell very closely researched history of just people being really kind to each other and really stepping up during disasters.  And of the countervailing force which is not humanity's cruelty but rather what she calls elite panic that the conviction on the part of wealthy people that when the lights go out the pores are coming for them.  And so this preemptive strike you know you may remember like Blackwater mercenaries shooting people in New Orleans after the hurricane that sort of preemptive reaction you know getting getting your revenge in first is really what turns crises into catastrophes.  And so it's wrong it's also the wrong intuition pump that you know when when crisis strikes and we have to make a very quick decision about what's going to go on.  We lean on the things that are most easy to imagine and if every time you have seen a story about a disaster you've been primed to believe that this is the time when your neighbor is coming over with a shotgun gun.  You would be an idiot to like take the thawing food in your freezer make a stew and go over to your neighbor's house with a covered dish.  But if you think that they're coming over the cover dish then everybody's good right everybody shares and that's how you get started because of course the answer to a disaster is not a total war of all against all right.  The answer to a disaster is like getting the sanitation running again and how to distribute masks.

Start time: 681.22
End time: 684.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It kind of feels like we're in that crux right now where we could go either way.

Start time: 685.50
End time: 842.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It sure feels like it it really does and so and then that's the last part is that it's bad art because you know there are lots of ways that people of goodwill can disagree with each other in ways that are irreconcilable.  And that can make for stories that are really tense and really good really plot driven but that are truer to our human nature which is that you know for the most part people are good and want to help.  But they may have a genuinely irreconcilable difference about what that help amounts to so you know attack surface is a book about this young woman Masha who lives through the terrorist attack that is the inciting incident and little brother and rather than becoming an opponent of the DHS becomes a helper of the DHS to try and catch the terrorists.  She then ends up in the second book working in a forward operations base in Iraq as a as a like a beltway bandit hunting jihadis and when we meet her in the third book she's just gone full on cyber mercenary and she's working for a company much like Palantir or the NSO group helping post-soviet dictators crush pro-democracy movements.  And she has to tell herself a story about why this is all okay and that story is slowly collapsing and she has to do more and more extreme things and eventually the story collapses she ends up back in San Francisco no longer employed doing this and she discovers to her horror that her childhood best friend who's now an activist in a successor movement of the movement for black lives is being targeted with the same cyber weapons that she spent her career developing and she has to like work out what it means to tell a story in which she's a good person when she can see the truth.  And she's going to see the blowback and what she's going to do next to redeem herself and you know I think that that's a much chewier more interesting higher stakes story a story in which you in which winning may involve permanently alienating yourself from people you like and who you want to be on the same side of but there's no way that both of you can have it your way and the issue matters so much that neither of you can give on it.  That's a really tense important great pulpy story and it's and it's a story that I'm I'm you know much more interested in reading these days not least because it primes us to understand what it is our neighbors are doing when crisis hits and they have a different idea to our ideas about what we should do about it because we're in the we're in you know the path of many crises to come you know and so we really do need to figure out what our intuition around our neighbors is.  During crisis should be otherwise it could go you know much worse than than even the negative projections that I think keep all of us at night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go ahead Amy what I was going to say I'd love to pick up on the thread about dystopian futures and just just as a sort of reminder that we tend to go throughout history that the pendulum swings and rarely does it fall in the center where we just have what we're we're satisfied with pragmatism.  So in a sense it's not strange to me that we've spent so long telling each other stories about utter you know horror stories on zombie apocalypse is you know the dystopia somehow is getting darker and darker I've been watching the boys second season.  I'm not going to spoil well you know I got through that whatever second episode and it was I remember I did not get to this kind of a strange name for a feminist character you know now.  So I was momentarily going to bed that night feeling like somewhat vindicated and then obviously things take a real turn.  Here's the point though I think we arrived in in this place not just in the stories that we tell but the actual real world problems that we have because it began with you know a total utopian outlook a utopian thinking certainly the Internet and technology we really thought this was going to make the world a better place.  That's right and the problem with I think anchoring ourselves in optimism or utopia is that we then fail to recognize that there are negative there can be also negative next order impacts when either you're not planning for real world issues real world problems that could result.  Or you think that somehow everything will be okay and I don't mean the sort of Norman Vincent Peale.  Power positive thinking but I do think back to wells and at the turn of the century you know a lot of those early very very very early science fiction writers were writing about utopia they were writing about science and evidence based utopia where everything would be amazing and part of why everything was so amazing was because of eugenics.  So so I agree that maybe we don't need to continue we need a better balance but my concern is I watch us sort of go back and forth and people who are writing about science and they're writing sci fi or they're working in futures in the area futures it seems to be.  Zero some and if we swing totally in the other direction I think we wind up to some extent 20 years from now back at where we started.

Start time: 1043.94
End time: 1260.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah I I I have a complicated relationship with technological utopian ism because it's it's it's a criticism that's often leveled at the sort of what you might call the digital rights community that that you know back in the old days we thought if we could just connect everybody it would be fine and then we fail to understand that it would end up like it did.  And I do think that the digital rights community made some missteps but I don't think that they were in failing to understand the potential risks of technology right remember that organizations like the electronic frontier foundation of the free software foundation have their grounding not merely in aspirations for the kinds of self realization and self actualization and community that we could get with technology but also in fear for what it would mean to have a technology that could be used in a way that would be useful to us.  A technological society without them right what it would mean to have ubiquitous networks but no cryptography so that universal surveillance would become a kind of commonplace of the future.  That is what animates those movements and if you think that the future will take care of itself the technology is going to is going to sort out all the problems you don't start an organization like electronic frontier foundation you just you know go off and start up do a startup or something because it's all going to take care of itself.  It's you know the this idea that Michael Weinberger had when he wrote this paper for public knowledge on 3D printing which is it will all be so great if we don't screw it up I really feel like that's the animating ideology of at least the digital rights world but I do think that we did get one thing wrong which is that we fail to understand that.  That we had passed the heroic age of anti monopoly enforcement and we didn't understand exactly what that would mean after all if you got your first computer around the time of the IBM PC you were enjoying a computer ecosystem in which the largest tech company in the history of the world.  Was too frightened to bundle its own operating system with its flagship computer because it might attract anti trust attention they just gone through a 12 year anti trust enforcement action in which they had outspent the entire DOJ's budget for anti trust for all DOJ cases in that one case every year IBM spent that much.  And in which IBM had exercised forbearance when Tom Jennings the brilliant computer engineer who also started Fido net reverse engineered the ROM and the PC for Phoenix computers so that they could sell it to Dell and Gateway and all those other companies to make their own computers.  I think if you grew up with computers in that era you quite naturally might have assumed that if a company became a monopolist that prevented the kind of dynamic turnover that was common in an era where one day Alta Vista was on top and the next day was Yahoo the next day was Google that the DOJ might exercise some enforcement against them and instead you know after Microsoft petered out I still think the Microsoft case did some good but after Microsoft petered out that was it we just let companies out of the game.  And so I think that companies do the most nakedly anti competitive stuff you know by their competitors merge with major competitors create vertical monopolies and end up in a world where you know the web is five giant websites full of screenshots from the other four and surveillance is ubiquitous not least because states rely on private companies to gather the data that they then plunder for state surveillance and so there there's you know no hope of states curbing this surveillance impulse of tech companies for  so long as they're a prime beneficiary of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Corey I totally agree with you however when I hear the same argument being made it is with reference to the current investigations at least the ones being levied in the United States where the calls tend to be let's break up these companies.  The challenge of course is that again are the mechanisms that we have for regulation were developed in a time when company structures were different and the IP that companies were producing weren't so deeply embedded into all of the rest of their operations.  You know the United States as a lot of companies or countries you know the US doesn't have its own cloud the federal government runs on AWS.  The United States has stopped heavily investing in R&D and quite frankly not just within tech but in science as well.  Everybody carries everybody cares much much more about the D than the R so with basic with funding for basic science and research being stripped the question that we have to ask ourselves is if we don't want these monopolies which I think everybody at this point generally agrees that we do not because today we're talking about tech tomorrow it will be the frontiers of synthetic biology and other types of other types of technologies.  You know the question is how do we keep the research moving forward when we've essentially outsourced it to the private sector and engineer the future so that it looks different and I think the problem is that we don't have the right we're not engaged in the right conversation so it can't be as simple as we screwed up over the past 40 years.  The way we're going to fix it is that the way we fixed it before which is through the traditional antitrust and anti competitiveness regulatory frameworks because I just don't think they're going to I think what's going to happen is we're going to wind up in court for a whole bunch of years and I don't know that we will have solved the problems waiting for us on the other side of the horizon.

Transcript:  The government we don't have so I've been fighting hard and lobbying for an office of what I call it a national office of strategic foresight. There was something called the Office of Technology Assessment which Gingrich to funded in the 90s on with his contract on America and the challenge is that that left a significant void and you know Ajit Pai.  Suddenly toying around with section 230 Lord I was just I was actually has no legal basis to do I might add now he and I were in a meeting on Thursday and Wednesday and in the green room of the FCC.

Start time: 1435.49

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, did you confront him.

Start time: 1437.76
End time: 1476.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, so he and I were were speaking on a panel and we were in the green room before that and you know listen he's this is the fundamental problem that we have is that these are all political appointees.  These are political appointments and we don't have a lot of we don't have for I mean we technically have some frameworks and how long people have to stay in office before they can swing back into the private sector but it never works out that way and what I think we need is some type of strategic office in place where people are in that space.  They are highly educated and their job is to fill you know.

Start time: 1477.32
End time: 1488.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, then they're not accountable the whole point of political appointees in theory is that they're accountable ultimately to the voters right if you have some sort of strategic office that is that is just in there for life.

Start time: 1488.88
End time: 1515.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who are they accountable to not not for life but for very long terms. We don't do long term planning in the US and so the reason I brought this up was because we're not going to we're not going to solve the current.  We're not going to solve the past monopoly problem using our current situation in a way that makes sense for the future.  Even the House report called for a call for new monopoly rules.

Start time: 1516.34
End time: 1856.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So can I can I I think that that's true but incomplete because I do think that there's a lot of space for our traditional antitrust remedies in existing competition problems and one of the reasons I think that is when you look at the way the companies grew you don't see the kind of exotic growth that that is care that is often spoken of when we hear about the tech companies and we're told that they're large because of their network effects or their first mover advantage or something to do with you know longitudinal data.  Sets or what have you instead when you look at these companies you find companies that by and large have grown through unlawful means means that are unlawful under the plain language of the Sherman Act and the Clayton and like competitive acquisitions and leveraging their monopoly power in one market and another and that kind of thing.  100% I mean Google is a company that has made depending on how you count one or two and a half successful products right they made a great search engine a good hotmail clone maybe Android is something that was in a house because it was a camera OS when they bought it and then they fixed it and maybe Google photos but of course it comes bundled with all of their devices so can we really like if you have a billion devices and you pre-install Google photos on it is that a success right but everything else that they've done that's successful was in a  house or rather was was bought in rather and everything they've done in house crash and burnt right wave and plus and orchid and all of those other things and so at to at least a first approximation I think that it wouldn't hurt to try not least because the using existing rules to attempt at least to enforce them.  Yeah yeah not least because we see concentration in other industries and we when you pick at the concentration it came it got there the same way that's how pro wrestling became one league it's how beer became two companies it's how movie studios became for it's how we ended up with one movie theater chain it's how we ended up with three record labels I mean it's five publishers all of this stuff that they all have the same growth pattern and so there would be an enormous social benefit.  Irrespective of the the the specifics of the tech industry to restoring a vigorous presumption that predatory acquisitions mergers to monopoly and vertical monopoly should not be permitted and even the very muscular DOJ framework of the 30 glorious years the post war years where if there was a like a five year period in which the structure of an industry remains static where the company on top stayed on top they would presumptively open.  An investigation into that company because if you manage to stay number one for five years you are probably up to no good right so that that's like a good like start and I agree with Amy that this will produce long difficult lawsuits but they are a feature and not a bug because what they do is they terrorize executives right that Bill Gates being humiliated on the stand and having that go viral really changed the calculus within Microsoft and Microsoft insiders and chroniclers of Microsoft and even Bill Gates.  Bill Gates own account suggests that the reason that the tech industry grew without the kind of stuff that Microsoft had done to Netscape in the years after the antitrust suit was in large part because they had lost their predatory instincts because whenever someone in the boardroom said hey let's go do something bad the other people in the boardroom said didn't you see what happened to build the last time they put him on the stand go wash your mouth that was so and you know Bill Gates told Kerr Swisher last year.  He didn't buy Android because he was distracted by the antitrust but that was seven years after the antitrust what he meant was that seven years later he still had PTSD he couldn't bring himself to do it but there is something about tech that is sui generis that's unique where we could bring remedies in which is interoperability.  And we have in the history of tech so many stories where tech giants were forced to reckon with competition and were forced to up their game or found themselves relegated to the trash heap of history because a new market entrant would come along they had the seven dwarfs used to interoperate with.  With 18 teased servers you had Microsoft doing the same to IBM you had Apple cloning the I work suite you had Google impersonating a browser and asking every web server in the world for a copy of every page it had right all of that interoperability where you where one thing plugs into an existing thing irrespective of the wishes the people who made it and even if it goes their ox and what we've seen in the years since monopolization is that the companies that relied on this.  Have have stripped future competitors of the same tools they use to grow whether that's Facebook suing over enforceable terms of service after violating my spaces terms of service or Apple arguing for the enforceability of DRM laws so that no one can reverse engineer iTunes after they reverse engineered Microsoft flagship project products to make an interoperable version and so on.  Every one of these companies you know has gone up the ladder and kicked it away and just stripping them of their legal power to block interoperators would go a long way I think to restoring some of the vigor that we used to get and force them to devote more energy to R&D because Amy's totally right.  You know these companies with trillion dollar valuations if you add up all their capital and then you add up their R&D you still get something like 15 to 20% of their total market cap the other 80% is the expectation of the market they will extract monopoly rents that's what the intangibles are right and so you know we really do need to change that balance.

Transcript:  Is your concern Amy that the political arm can't really effectively act because of politics you know we have conservatives and on the one hand saying well the problem with big tech is they're censoring our speech.  So they wouldn't sign off on the Democrats proposals to break up these companies the politics get in the way of a sensible solution so is that why you prefer this kind of strategic planning committee?

Transcript:  Right I mean I listen I'm a systems level thinker so I tend to naturally think through many orders of you know so I think in terms of sort of many next steps in advance right so the challenge that I am seeing is if we continue down the path trying to break up you know with the rallying cry to break up big tech the question is how do you reverse engineer an outcome that  is desirable but that doesn't set us again on the wrong path.  Instead of solving the problem you just create a bunch more monolithic that's correct or you right you wind up in court as we do with the baby bells in effect interoperability right and well but let's stop and think for a moment you know at that point we were talking about telephony and what was then complicated but not that sophisticated  Telecommunications infrastructure compared to now right you know when you look at a company like Amazon which everybody has missed what I think is the most compelling story and the most compelling story for Amazon has to do with the future of our health data that that you know.

Transcript:  Right I don't think I listen I dropped out of law school just before I was supposed to start so I never went to law school I'm totally unqualified to give my legal assessment on this for my outsiders vantage point you know it strikes me that they have done an incredibly good job not overtaking any other market segment on their own in at least the health and medical and wearables data space.  Which means that if you try to go to court or regulate them they're going to be able to prove that there are plenty of other competitors challenges when you zoom out and you see the constellation of how everything fits together at that point you know yes that is very scary to me.  But we don't have a legal mechanism to deal with something like that I don't think that's the shiny in this direction my concern is that 10 years from now you know all of our I've been writing and talking about what I see is the the all of our PII is sort of morphing into sync to a single data record which I call a PDR personal data record.  We saw clear about a week ago two weeks ago make an announcement that it was going to be the arbiter of your data.

Transcript:  Right so it is concerning to me that we don't have it is pretty clear why Google and Amazon are rushing in that direction.  So this is what I'm concerned about I'm concerned that we get down in the weeds arguing about these other things when when there are much bigger fish to fry.  And when Elizabeth Warren entered the race and was talking so much about breaking up big tech you know again I I understand why this is important but it becomes politicized and then the people who depending on their politics are talking about these things you know the whole conversation becomes toxic.  So I somehow we have to be able to decouple right the future you know we have to decouple these things so that we can solve the the issues that are coming we have to address we have to like figure out these future problems that we're trying to solve and reverse engineer them so that we're so we're on the right path going.

But we don't have a central mechanism to do this this type of long term planning so that we have the ability to decouple the investigations and the regulatory frameworks and do some more forward thinking without politics intervening.

Now's the time for you to subvert the dominant paradigm would you agree?  Well in the sense that technologists today are in such demand depending on their discipline and specialty that there are some things that if they refuse to build them they won't get built right that's why the tech won't build it movement and stuff like that.

This goes right back to your protagonist and so I think that's the reason why we're so excited to be here.  Well you know the origin story of so many technologists is I wrote some code and a computer did the thing that I spent the last few days doing.  And I thought that they would definitely answer that question I think that's a very good point I think because you've set it up this last week you were on break and you serviced major chunks of companies and you versions of your own basic technology cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wrote some code and a computer did the thing that I said in my code perfectly.  And then I gave that code to someone else and they could do it too without having to know what I knew and so I could kind of project my will around the world and then I found a network and on that network I found people who shared my point of view of my interest in a kind of society of mine where I wasn't a weirdo and where I could make common cause with other people whether that's about my gender identity or my politics or what have you.  And the idea that all of those people who's inciting incidenters origin stories rests in the realization that technology could give them so much more self determination and pluralism where the power wasn't concentrated into a few hands but rather anyone who wanted it could could get enough power to do what it was that they needed to make themselves happy.  And then they've devoted their career to taking that away from other people is I think a fracture line that's under theorized and underexploited right that there is a natural constituency and we're seeing it we're seeing it for example in Amazon where you have workers who became energized around tech work issues around facial recognition or around the climate footprint of Amazon but who then found themselves in solidarity with Amazon warehouse workers and who said you know that that that these are actually elements of the  same rule and I think that we don't lack for legal tools to to address some of these concerns what we lack is political will that the plain language of the Sherman agree plain language of the Clayton Act they've never been repealed.  It's the same law that was used to break up AT&T and Standard Oil and you know to prevent so many mergers. What's changed is that Ronald Reagan's court sorcerer a guy named Robert Bork who is kind of a predecessor of Gingrich he was a Nixon I criminal who's denied a seat on the Supreme Court  because back in the 80s you couldn't get a seat on the Supreme Court if you were an illegitimate jerk unlike now and he had this ideology that we shouldn't pursue antitrust action unless you could show an immediate consumer harm resulting from anti-competitive conduct.  But the language of the act is pretty clear that the reason that we resist monopoly is because monopoly itself distorts our policy outcomes that that even with an office of technology assessment which I'm 100 percent for and you know Gingrich the long list of things that we should hate Gingrich for that's one of the ones near the top you know blinding the American Congress to its ability to understand technical issues at a moment in which those issues are very salient that that was that was an enormously short sighted and terrible wicked thing he did.  But even if you know what the policy should be making the policy happen is hard when there are monopolies who can exert pressure because they have they have monopoly rents right there these profits windfall profits and they have a small enough group of executives that they can agree on how to spend them that you know and there's only five companies you can all get together and decide on what your lobby.

I felt it was it was like I was in an era I felt like I was in a warehouse I was surrounded by people who were picking they were pickers you know shopping off of shelves it was eerily quiet it was I felt like I was an interloper.

You know consensus about what should be done or how it should be done.  It's that's amongst us we're fairly like minded people who have I guess a better understanding of technology than a lot of people and we can't agree.  Maybe you and Corey can agree let me take a break I want to there's no good place to interrupt so i'm gonna interrupt right now hold that thought Amy.  And we can pick up right where we left off, but I do have to take a break I knew it would this would be a challenge I didn't drink enough coffee this morning and I apologize i'm doing the best I can to keep up.  With two of the smartest people I know Amy Webb from the future today Institute she is a quantitative futurist whatever the hell that is and but we're so we just know she's smart and we're so thrilled as always to have her and the legitimately inspiring Corey Doctorow.  Who is not only a great novelist works at the electronic frontier foundation on competitive issues, so this is right up his alley and together they are easily the you know the highest IQ panel we've ever had and the.  The average i'm bringing it down and i'm apologize, but if you just take them take them and leave me out of it is pretty high here our show today brought to you by express.  vpn every day on the news there's a story about technology we're just doing it right now it's creeping into our private lives.  I don't like the idea of somebody paying attention to every place I go on the Internet of every place I surf.  You know we know that there's there's monitoring going on and i'm one of the really good uses of a vpn is to encrypt what you're doing.  Not just so that guy in the hoodie in the corner of the coffee shop can't see what you're doing that we're not in coffee shops that much anymore, but even so that your isp or your carrier can't see what you're doing.  This is why you want to use a good vpn now the thing everybody's going to.  Make a note of this, you should think about it that vpn now becomes a proxy for that carrier or that isp all the stuff that you put through your isp is now going.  past the isp to the vpn service, so you really need to pick well pick wisely that's why I use express vpn.  They secure everything my phone my computer my smart tv I even can put it on my router to protect my entire household that's.  A vpn that really works and yes, you can trust it third party independent audits of their privacy policy and their trusted server technology show that they do not log they do not track they do not know.  What you're doing when you're on an express vpn server you're running in ram and their trusted server technology sandbox so it can't write to the disk it can't log your activity and as soon as you log out poof.  it's gone it's gone and that means there is no way express vpn can keep track of what you're doing, which means there's no way anyone else can it's easy to use to fire up the APP tap the button you're protected.  In fact, it's the number one rated vpn provider on the market if you just search you'll see everywhere express vpn is very highly rated because it is.  A good vpn provider that really protects your privacy it's also really fast they put the money into having many, many servers in almost 100 countries.  So you can watch HD video on express vpn and a lot of times people say I don't want to use a vpn it's going to slow me down not express vpn.  So much so that you can use it to watch video from other countries watch your netflix in the UK and get all those doctor who series or get your anime fix your manga fix by watching netflix Japan.  Just by pointing your express vpn server to those locales it's really kind of amazing we've got a lot of people that are watching this and they're going to be like.  Kind of amazing we've got a deal for you now look you shouldn't be using free vpn it's expensive to run a vpn if they aren't charging you there's another way they're making money.  But express vpn is very affordable less than seven bucks a month take advantage of our best deal offer which is a year of express vpn plus an extra three months free go to express vpn.com slash.  And if everything I haven't told you is in a hundred percent true you have a 30 day money back guarantee for three extra months free with a one year package express vpn.com slash.  To it protect yourself online with express vpn.com slash to it we go back to the ring for round three.

Bear considerable amount of responsibility and we and we should encourage them to to let their conscience be the guy but who else where else should this conversation happen is it the eff boardroom.

And I think that that that you know if the critique starts with look at these geniuses then who have who have done this remarkable thing instead of this commonplace thing right this the.  The monopolization that was undertaken using tactics that are not so different from the tactics that Vince McMahon used to turn 30 wrestling leagues into one and no one's going to call him a genius.  Then what you're left with is oh look at these greedy mediocrities whose self rationalization allowed them to take the digital nervous system of the 21st century and turn it into this brittle.

Right so I think part of what's happening that that was what I meant when I was talking about a willful ignorance I think that we don't want to be confronted.  With our lack of understanding and listen especially if you feel as though your age means that technology and therefore the world are passing you by.  You're not going to want to have an informed conversation and so the easier thing to do is either to ignore it.  Or to join in a chorus which feels right because you're politically aligned with whoever's idea ideology is shouting the things.  Yep.

Start time: 3249.66
End time: 3416.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep so let me let me let me try framing this around a different policy dysfunction.  Let's talk about lead in the water in Flint.  OK OK.  So as far as I know no one in Congress is a public health expert or a chemist or a biologist.  I'm sure no one on the Flint Council is and no one in the Michigan State House pretty pretty unlikely if anyone in the Michigan State House had that background.  And yet for most of Flint's history they didn't have lead in their water and most other cities in America don't have lead in their water.  And the question of whether and how much lead you should have is an intensely technical question.  And yet it's one that they were able to answer without mastering the chemistry or the biology.  It was one they they they managed to have by adopting an adjudication process a truth seeking process by which people with rival ideas would go before a neutral adjudicator present their evidence.  And the adjudicator would make some empirical findings and then ask some political questions about how they should be interpreted.  So like in the UK when David Nutt was the drug czar he had a panel of experts rate all of the drugs that that had been scheduled as as dangerous or not dangerous according to how dangerous they were to the person who used them to their family and to society.  And then he came up with different models to see which which ones of those drugs changed in their ranking as to how dangerous they were depending on your political priorities.  Some of them were always going to be very high on the list of danger some would always be very low but some would move depending on your political priorities.  And then he went to parliament and he said I have an empirical basis to answer your political question.  If you have a political consensus that we want to protect society rather than users or families then I'll tell you where these drugs go.  And if you have a different political consensus then I'll tell you where the drugs go on the basis of that.  And so we can merge both the political and the empirical but it requires that we have an honest process.  And David Nutt was fired because he refused to say that cannabis was more dangerous than alcohol.  And the alcohol industry in the UK by its own reckoning is only profitable because of binge drinking unsafe binge drinking.  If unsafe binge drinking were eliminated that that's where the profit margin is.  And the drinks industry operates its own anti binge drinking education program which is very unsuccessful.  Yeah.  They say it's unsuccessful because they can't fix it.  And yet he created one that did fix it.  He created a rival one.  And when people were inoculated with this they did less binge drinking.  And in the in the background of that where you have this very powerful industry that is very profitable and highly concentrated the evidence was secondary to their ability to distort political outcomes.  And that's why I think monopolies should be at the front of this discourse.

Transcript:  Well OK retaining long term data retention has has no good evidentiary basis right.  I mean knowing that I clicked a link 10 years ago gives you nothing except for compromise unless it's like you're hoping to sell me a roof and the link was to a link to replace my 30 years ago.  So the only reason to hold that is because hard drives are cheap and there's no statutory damages for breaches.  So we know that like data that is collected tends to leak.  We know that leaks have unquantifiable risks and that you should you should do like I have a policy of data minimization and retention minimization.  But that policy is not operated by any of the firms.  Quite the opposite happens.  You know or or like whether people like being surveilled for advertising.  We know they don't.  So I make a bill.

Transcript:  We are going to have a enormous problem in the United States.  The more that our homes produce data and devices produce data and the more federated these privacy laws are.  And I'll give you a clear example.  So Walmart has a product that it's been researching.  It is not in market but it is a connected shopping cart.  There's a patent that they've won.  Basically you put your hands on the shopping cart.  Yeah.  You go into a store.  It is looking for a bio.  It takes a biometric baseline and then as you shop throughout the store checks for anomalies.  So if your pulse is racing you're sweating a little bit more.  The shopping cart knows the shopping cart pings the store associate to hopefully help you have a better time shopping throughout Walmart.  There are some tangible use cases that might make sense if you understand how those data are being collected and mined and  refined and what that ultimately means for you.  However the fact remains that a shopping cart may not be able to cross state lines.  A shopping cart may be more scary and illegal than a bottle of alcohol.  And the challenge is that there are myriad devices coming to market that do the same thing.  And we just don't have a clear understanding of what those data how those data can be collected by whom and for what purpose.  And the EU has been debating this.  I was at a couple of high level meetings over the past 18 months or so and there are lots of global leaders and organizations with  enforcement powers who are trying to define data ownership.  But again this this to me diverges from the great story about lead in water and and you know big big alcohol and big I guess tiny  cannabis.  The challenge is that when it comes to questions about technology where we where we have to have conversations regarding data and  we the people who are having those conversations don't they can't explain or understand what it is they're talking about.  You know that to me is fundamentally mentally different from having conversations about lead in water or blood alcohol levels.  I mean you don't have to be a doctor to have a basic understanding of a toxin in your body.  I don't think we can have a modicum of.

Transcript:  I just feel like I don't know.  I think you guys you guys have got that you're engaging in the sin of a subject that is not you're assuming that the subject that's  not your discipline has relatively clear cut lines and little debate within it.  I guarantee you that within addiction research there are enormous.  I'm sure debates about what amount of alcohol is safe what what frequency of alcohol use is safe what the danger signs are and so  on.  These are in fact hotly contested issues all around as is the question of like how much lead can be.  I mean there is going to be trace amounts of lead in your diet right.  That's that's a fact.  So how much lead is too much lead and what steps do we take and what's the cost benefit.  All of those are contested.

Transcript:  Can we find a common ground then between the three of us and what we should do about big tech.  I like data minimization.  I think that's good.  Oh I know we agree.  I agree with.  Let's get the framework.

Transcript:  What I'm saying is my I think we need to to project much further out into the future because we don't we do not tend to create policy or  regulatory frameworks.  This doesn't work on norms and standards.  We don't have processes in place until there's a problem.  And at that point we're trying to fix or levy punitive.  It would be much better if there was a way to incent the different parties which in this case are big tech also the market.  So investors also everyday people and the government to come together and collaborate.  I know that sounds pretty naive but I do think that that's I think that pursuing something that incents tech companies to put  their work to reframe their work as a public good or at least a lot of that work.  It doesn't potentially it doesn't lead to the loss of revenue necessarily.  And it does allow us all to plan for the further future.  I think.

Transcript:  Yeah yeah I mean some of this is just corporate reform altogether.  You know Amy mentioned the fiduciary principle which you know traces back to this this Milton Friedman editorial.  And the problem with the fiduciary rule for corporate governance is that it has no empirical benchmark.  Right.  So like I could say it was my duty to put lead in the water of Flint because I we only paid a one billion dollar fine and we made one billion and one dollars in profits.  Right. Or I could say it was my duty to engage in a string of predatory mergers without regard to what might happen in the future.  Or I could say I had to exercise forbearance and not engage in any predatory mergers.  Last five years down the line this provokes so much anger among regulators that they broke up the company in a way that cost us more than we would have made.  Right. I had to hire that person because doing so created new efficiencies that could have led to new business.  I had to lay that person off because the cost savings could go to my shareholders.  There is no course of action that cannot be framed as beneficial to shareholders if you get to name the time frame and and assign your own weights to hypotheticals.  And so I think that the shareholder rule has has always been a sociopath's charter.  Right. Just a thing that lets you do greedy things and insist that it's your legal responsibility to do them.  And that a stakeholder rule which is closer to like the German proposition the stuff Verr Focus is pushing these days is is a lot closer where at least what you say is OK well there are competing priorities.  There is no one empirical answer. We tend to rely on multi-stakeholderism as a way of resolving them rather than saying OK well we'll just trust bosses to have their workers best interests.  We put the workers in the room too so that at least they have to come up with a thing that where they can swing enough votes or find a compromise to govern the company in a way that accounts for both of their interests.  So you know the stakeholder model has environmental regulators consumers workers bosses and investors all in the room all with a seat at the table all with what amounts to board votes.  And it produces an outcome that at least gets a look in from other people's priorities.  I don't think that it's necessarily good but I think that is a necessary precondition for something being good that you'll never get something that's good for all of those stakeholders if one of them doesn't get a seat at the table.

Transcript:  I think that that is largely correct and I would also just add that I think companies it's my observation that companies are a little.  Shy little gun shy I hate using that word now a little concerned.  About doing risk modeling and incorporating more voices because they're concerned about the future of legal action and there's a very large company.  That has some smart people working with it that I talked to a couple months ago that wanted to do some longer term risk modeling to figure out how could they mitigate some you know problems that they were likely causing having to do with the environment.  And we were all positioned to do that work together and their legal department shut it down.  And they shut it down because in the United States if word ever got out that this company was engaging in work to fix the future.  They were so they were doing a lot of what Corey just explained their legal department was concerned that that would open them up for some kind of big tobacco style lawsuit at some point you knew and so you knew they were.  From their from their vantage point it was less of a problem to simply do the bad stuff and deal with it later on.  Than to have sorted out how to fix the problems that plausibly were being caused in advance mitigate that risk and then.  Sure do things a little differently and I the very fact that we are so litigious and that this is this.  The fact that somebody is concerned about being sued 10 years from now is going to prevent them from doing the risk modeling that would create a better outcome for everybody and to me that is absolutely.

Transcript:  Okay so don't take notes let me let me frame that slightly differently and say what if the countervailing force was not to deprive people who've been harmed by companies of their right to legal redress.  But rather to make the penalty for not taking action to address your pollution so dire that the risk of litigation 10 years on because you show that you had actual knowledge and didn't take action on it.  I mean frankly I think that's an overblown risk right we have exxon's memos right exxon knew 30 years ago that they were going to render the entire planet uninhabitable for the human species.  And took no action on it in fact the only action they took was a disinformation campaign to bury the facts that they knew that their own scientists had told them.  That they're in litigation but they're it's not like that litigation has hope of going anywhere unless there's some real shifts and how we proceed.  So you know like when I started at EFF our legal director is now our executive director Cindy Cohen was engaged in a lawsuit called Boa.  That she brought with her from her old firm when she came to EFF and she was representing Larry Boa who was the sole survivor of a massacre in Nigeria by nurse by mercenaries hired by Chevron.  And she was suing Chevron in a US court on his behalf civilly and its its directors and officers.  The case collapsed when all of her key witnesses were assassinated it didn't it didn't moderate Chevron's conduct right like so I just I guess.  I would be more sympathetic to the plight of companies who are risk averse because the risk of of litigation if the Sacklers weren't saying to their.  A farmer wraps you know go find me the pill doctors and give them and and and reward them for pushing pills on people in ways that are dangerous but but increases our profits I.  There are so many firms sure sure go ahead.

Transcript:  Now I just before you move on I just wanted to and I don't mean to interrupt but I think there's an important point to be made right now, and that is.  In industries where there has been tremendous consolidation of power and bad things happening.  I just want to note that that they're they're very different so the Sacklers pushing you know highly knowingly pushing high and highly addictive medications on people, I think, is different.  From some and again i'm not defending Chevron some of the things that have happened with Chevron, but I would also say that.  The those those big oil and petroleum companies tend to work with local regional offices.  it's very it's unlike anyhow.

Start time: 4194.08
End time: 4218.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would just say that there is a direct parallel between the Sacklers pushing addictive narcotics on physicians for prescriptions is not so very different from say YouTube pushing addictive.  algorithms to keep you watching more YouTube videos or Facebook adjusting its newsfeed to keep you stuck to Facebook there right there is a certain similarity between the two.

Start time: 4219.74
End time: 4234.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right so Corey made a really good point that I loved, which was can't we can't can't the punitive measure for not doing something in advance to to to mitigate the risk yeah the can't that be a more compelling outcome.

Start time: 4236.12
End time: 4249.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Then, then the opposite and I think that's doing the right thing how about that as a motivation, you know, well, I know I know we're exposing ourselves to potential lawsuit in 10 years, but you know this is doing the right thing, maybe we should just do that.

Transcript:  it's hopeless if you're going to use government incentives to get people to do the right thing it's hopeless because those go look at the tax code that's government incentives trying to get people to do the quote right thing.  Depending on who would power parties in power and what legislators are writing the laws that's hopeless if people aren't going to do the right thing because they're not legally incentive was headed we have real problems we have a moral we have a moral.  Moral.

Start time: 4301.24
End time: 4325.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's true, but also you know think about the think about the micro economics of a room in which decision makers have gathered and they have different priorities and different urgencies about how much they need the money and how much they care about different priorities.  You can make a moral pitch compelling if it comes with an instrumental pitch right if it's both you know this is an argument that comes out in the torture debate yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Carrot and the stick yeah I mean this comes up in the torture debate right on the one hand torture generally gives us bad Intel but you know when I raised this with Bart Gelman.  Who's you know one of the Snowden journalists he said well torture gives you bad Intel but if I've got like a safe and I need to open it and I can tie you to a chair and go after you with a pair of tin snips I'm going to get into that safe so there's another reason we don't torture it's not just because it gives us bad Intel because it's wrong.  And both of those things being true bad Intel and it's wrong is more powerful than either of them on their own.  And so you know I think in in respect of of the boardroom you know look at the Americans with disability act I think it's a really good example of how you can blend both moral case.  For accommodating people of varying abilities and you know as my friend was Henry says we are all of us only temporarily able bodied.  And so you know that you're really only benefiting yourself when you when you create that norm but also we created a regime with stiff damages and loser pays no win.  And so we created a system that invited the no win no fee bar to show up and say like were you discriminated against I will sue them the deeper their pockets are the harder I will sue them because the more legal fees I'll get back and I will pray that they drag out the case and try to bankrupt you because that's just more fees for me.  And so it created a different equilibrium.

Transcript:  So probably should eliminate the the incentives to misbehave for sure.  Let's eliminate sure let's eliminate those if we can if we can track those down let's get those out of the legal code.  But I don't know I'm starting to sound like a preacher here.  We really have to have a moral compass.  All right maybe you can.  Who's.

Transcript:  Right now we have an amoral situation where corporations are not incentive incented in any way to act morally at all.  They're acted their entire organization is to maximize profits regardless of whatever ethical considerations there would be.  And I don't know if you can teach Sundar Pichai or Satya Nadella.  I would guess Sundar Pichai and Satya Nadella and maybe even Jeff Bezos have some sort of moral code.  But maybe that is the problem is that the incentives are all there to make money.  You know to your fiduciary responsibility your shareholders stakeholders overwhelms whatever moral code you have.  I don't know is that the problem.

Transcript:  What I'm saying is.  We.  It evolves.  I understand it changes and evolves.  Yeah.  And so if we're talking about the strategic direction of an organization whose products and services ultimately rely on our data that to me that's what all of this comes down to is data.  The fact that Apple has launched a financial instrument where the traditional ways of making money on that instrument i.e.  a credit card is not through the transaction.  In fact they make no money on that transaction which tells us what that the data are more valuable to this organization than that than the transaction.  Isn't that fascinating.  Yeah right.  So so we have to ask so therefore the question that we have to ask is.  You know do.  Who should have the right to those data under what circumstances.  And the answers to those questions I think are a little challenge.

Start time: 4646.80

Transcript:  So let's start there.  Let's we both seem to we all seem to agree that's a good starting place.  It may not be 100 percent of the problem but this issue of the data our data seems to be there seems to be consensus right that this is this is one of the big problems.  Big tech is imposing on us.  Let me take a break and then we'll come back and discuss this and I want now Corey you're a California voter Amy you're not.  I don't know how well I'm a Canadian so I'm.

Transcript:  So well you can tell it a month ago.  I did I did this week but there is a proposition on the ballot.  California has a very aggressive privacy law but they are the guy who wrote this originally.  It's a complicated story had made it the Alastair McTaggart a good Scots name had apparently made a deal with the California legislature that if you pass this law I won't put my proposition on the ballot.  So they did he has now come back and it is back on the ballot proposition 24.  I don't know if you've read up on it I'm just I'm just curious if this is this consumer personal information law and agency initiative is a step in the direction that you two can agree we need to make.  Or if GDP are is or if the current California privacy legislation is I actually have a lot of people asking me about prop 24 and what I think they should do.  I can tell you I voted for it but there are but it is just like lead in the water and and binge drinking there is a definite there can be a definite diversity of opinion on this thing so.  I would love to talk about that and it maybe we can narrow it down to let's talk about the data what do we do I mean there's a Tim Berners Lee has an initiative is it interrupt to.  To have somehow contain our data and and control it so that we can then sell it off if we wish to or not.  Somehow my mind our own data and for our benefit instead of for the benefit of these big tech companies maybe that's a solution let's talk about solutions.  When we come back right now, though I want to talk about our sponsor extra hop the new it reality.  Pretty obvious remote access on a massive scale of course we're seeing rapid cloud and even multi cloud adoption and as all on top of a steady increase of Internet of things devices and rife cyber crime.  It's an interesting environment if you're managing a cloud enterprise it is it is an interesting place to be doing business in this post compromised world it's more important than ever that organizations can see.  Everything going on in their environment from the cloud to the data center all the way down to the customer.  But in order to prevent an incident from becoming a full scale data breach you need more than just the information more than unified visibility you need.  Context for your detections and then intelligent response workflow, so you can act quickly teams can collaborate you can get the job done and that's what extra hop is all about extra hop.  stops breaches 70% faster extra help eliminates blind spots in your business and detects threats other tools missed to keep you secure and available.  With sass based cloud native network detection and response they really were originally all about performance monitoring, but they realize hey you know what we're monitoring the performance we can also monitor threats.  And that's when they that's when things really clicked threat detection and response in the cloud on the network tool consolidation, so you get the information you need and you can act on it.  Here's some examples, Wizards of the coast uses AWS cloud and they use it with extra hop.  Their chief architect and information security officer Dan McDaniel said, and this is the quote there's no other company that aligns to supporting our DevOps model.  The speed and the lack of friction than extra hop.  ultra beauty you've probably seen them in the mall they use extra hop to secure their Google cloud.  As well as to keep networking and security teams closely aligned so engineers have more time to focus on innovation their senior it engineer john crease said quote before extra hop.  We had limited visibility to what was going on in the cloud, but now we can quickly identify vulnerabilities and exploits and understand how our applications are performing in the cloud.  You've got to see the demo it's on the site extra hop.com slash tweet to get a sense of what extra hop can do for you and look at all the companies that use extra hop.  The ability to see what's going on to see the threats to respond coherently effectively in a timely way to whatever is happening on your network.  This is the key extra hop.com slash tweet you'll find out how extra hop stops breaches 70% faster there's a free trial there and a complete demo so you can see the extra hop dashboard at work.  extra hop.com slash tweet This is a tool you want to use this is a tool you want to know about if you are managing.  A complex multi cloud environment if you've got customers out there if you've got data in here you got to have extra hop extra hop.com slash.  tweet all right I figured I give you a minute or two to read prop 24.  word for word and and give us I already voted so you can influence me Corey what do you think I know you're a Canadian you don't you don't have to worry about this stuff.

Transcript:  Well there's I guess there's two different parts to it and I and i'd be interested in what you're more interested in the first is like the.  The part pluses and minuses of 24 which, like you have had a lot of people ask me about and then the other one is this idea of whether putting prices on data will solve the data issue, but I mean I can answer either or both but you tell me what you're more interested.

Transcript:  You know the controversy over 24.  Well, one of the things mctaggart the reason mctaggart came back to the proposition and we have it's kind of a broken system.  In California that really comes from a legislature that prefers to stand back and let democracy take control it's fairly easy to get these propositions on the ballot you only need to collect a.  Small number of signatures which can easily done if you've got the money to do it, so we get all sorts of kind of oddball conflicting propositions but even.  kind of disingenuously worded proposition so poor voters in California and this might be true in other states now have really got a challenge ahead of them to read these to understand what they do we have a very good.  California consumer privacy act but it did apparently cut out you know some carve outs for.  Some companies on the other hand, people have complained that Facebook had a hand in writing this ballot proposition, so this was this was their way of saying yeah yeah.  Oh look see we've we're protecting you.  So I don't I just it's impossible it's really impossible for the average person to figure this out and you know, given the amount of time we have and number of propositions, we have to vote on.  I often wonder if this is a system that's that's got any hope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But which would you like to know about would you like my views on 24 start with 24 start with 24 we'll get to interrupt next alright so 24.  So 24 the history of this is that the first time around ccpa was passed, it was passed in somewhat in haste it had a few defects.  They were really trying to get the initial proposition off the ballot two years ago sure that's right and then what I think from the it's backers perspective was more disturbing.  Was that it then became the target of just an endless slew of reform bills that would have made it worse not better.  That were heavily financially backed and I think that they were just made at the thought that they were just going to have to spend the rest of their lives babysitting this bill and staving off this kind of attack and so the ballot initiative, the new one.  Creates a requirement that the bill not be amended except in furtherance of its purpose which on its face sounds like a good way to avoid that kind of skirmishing but the people I so I've been in the middle of people who I respect who are really ferociously disagreeing with each other about this were normally on the same side.  That's what I saw I have been taking these arguments right the person who tells me well you know the furtherance of the original purpose solves that problem to people who are skeptical of it and they say well except that the way the bill is worded is it says to promote the competitiveness of Californians and the privacy of Californian people and the growth of California's economy and fundamental equities.  So everything fits.  So like what is in the purpose right well I mean there are lots of bad faith answers to that but the question is how much time do you want to spend litigating so rather than spending all your time in Sacramento lobbying over it you might spend all your time in the 9th circuit litigating over it and it's like it's 6 of one half dozen the other and they're the idea that you make legislation that is bulletproof and that no one can come along and amend.

Transcript:  Well it's a lovely idea if you support the legislations yes and but it's not it's not it seems a recipe for disaster.  It is it's it's wishful thinking right and so I think that 24 had make some compromises that I wouldn't make in particular there's there's two things that I'm concerned about the first is that it doesn't have a private right of action and that means that if your rights are violated you have to convince like an attorney general to bring a case on your behalf.  And the thinking was that there was no way that a California Chamber of Commerce and other big business lobbies would allow this to pass unless private right of action were stripped from it because once there's a private right of action they're worried about so-called nuisance suits.  And you know so I think that that's a that's a pretty grave defect and then the other grave defect for me is the.  Sorry I just blew my buffer and what the other great defect.

Transcript:  I don't want to say I don't want to counsel you to vote against it because I am thoroughly on the fence about it.  And I remember what the other thing was which is that it there was the thinking of the backers is that if it had a default to privacy where you had to opt in to have your data collected instead of opting out to not have your data collected that this wouldn't pass First Amendment muster.  And there are some litigators I know who say that's wrong and there are people with a good track record of litigating difficult tech related First Amendment questions and so I'm not a lawyer.  I'm not a First Amendment lawyer and I'm not a litigator and so I'm left with these people normally the way that I resolve these issues is like you I find a technical expert and I who I trust and I ask them for their judgment and generally the pool of technical experts I rely on agree in the main and this is an area where they're very split right and I'm you know it's why the by the way why I don't get a vote that's why I asked you Corey.  I understand you have not helped me I had a local I had a local candidate for our city council asked me this morning how how he should I just want you to know I supported your candidate for the Texas Railroad Commission good she's amazing I sent her some money me too.

Transcript:  This Amy in case you weren't familiar with this I can't remember I think you might have mentioned this or maybe I read something that you wrote this old lawyer yeah.  T. Boone Pickens lawyer that's who she is that's funny because weirdly in Texas it's the Railroad Commission that decides whether oil wells can.  Burn off the natural gas you've seen it all the time in movies these flares coming off of the oil wells which of course is a huge pollutant a major contributor to greenhouse gases.  And it's the Railroad Commission that decides whether you can do that or not and she could turn the entire Texas Railroad Commission.

Amazing it's it's this amazing race yeah I'll be watching that race you wouldn't think I'd be watching the Texas Railroad Commission race come November 3rd but I'm interested in what Amy has to say about prop 24.

Transcript:  Yes so and you're not a voter in California Amy but and probably haven't been following it that closely the reason it's important is as California goes so goes the nation it's a big enough economy.  That if California has these strong privacy laws just as GDP PR really influenced everybody in the world it would very much influence United States countries companies especially those who operate in California so it's it's of importance not just to those of us in California but to everybody.

What here's why I we we continue to have these listen or maybe we should just make up our mind you can't do it state by state you're saying you need a federal law.  All I can tell you is Amazon has a wristband out called the halo which listens to you all the time and you know it's not quite a fit that it's not quite an apple watch this does some of the same things but it also scrapes your biometric data to make inferences like are you feeling hopeful right now and are you exhausted things like that you know there's ambient noise that gets picked up on the other side.

Transcript:  Great cool thing everybody wants to talk about all the government leaders are talking about data ownership as though that makes sense but but what would it take for there to be data ownership anyhow so here's what I have been mulling.  What I've been mulling is for a while so Alaska has the state of Alaska if you live in Alaska and if you are a resident.  I think you have to have been born there Norway does something similar you get sort of a basic universal basic income dividend check from oil and my thinking was we have a social safety net in the United States that's going to collapse.  And it was that was true pre covid and we have long term medical the medical needs of people who are aging are not going to be met.  Also true before covid so is there some way that we can solve some of those problems while also solving the problems of data and when I where I came back to was.  If it's the case that all of our PIs are at this point increasingly being consolidated by just a few countries companies.  Wouldn't there be a way to consolidate not all of them but a lot of them such that they were anonymized but available and permissions could be given as needed so I was thinking is there.

Start time: 5701.40
End time: 5714.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's some kind of that's interrupt so now we've moved to the second part of Corey's question which is all right and I agree with you maybe the clever way is I don't know how you would enforce that though Amy how would you make that work.

Start time: 5715.62
End time: 5794.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right because if my my thought was that with every so with every.  Let's let's call it a packet transfer for just for the sake of conversation that there anytime that anybody's data were monetized that there would be some way some fraction of a cent.  That would go back to the individual and the individual would have the ability to determine how those data were were being used and again there's there's this is a thorny challenging issue, because there are so many how would you define data at that point but.  So anyhow my idea was that this does a couple of things one it forces more data literacy and more technological literacy.  Which I think is a good thing to it helps solve some of these future social safety net issues which are coming and we are not prepared for.  And three it potentially in sense the big tech companies to do better because it avoids regular it avoids what they're currently facing.  And forces them to give up a little bit and forces the market to give up a little bit but not in a way that's going to.  Cause anything to crash so that was the idea that I had been playing with and it seemed as though a deal T distributed ledger.  Which would give everybody the ability to make some of those decisions would also force them to have to to come to grips with what data are being collected in one way.

Start time: 5801.94
End time: 6022.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well hang on I think you're getting ahead of the ahead of the game here by by starting with let's go ahead with it I I'm.  I'm I'm skeptical of the I think maybe we found the area where Amy and I disagree.  With all due respect tonight and and I understand where I hope I understand where you're coming from but I think that there are a couple of pretty important flaws in that proposal.  The first one is the idea that we can have clear title to personal identifying information most of the most valuable PII is in relation to other people so the fact that you are your mother's son.  Is a fact that in in theory both of you own right and that let the same time your father probably has some claim over as well.  And that I might know as an unrelated third party and so the idea that we could have a market.  In which we either arbitrarily assign clear title to one of those people which you could imagine incredible dysfunctions right what if what if your mother owns the fact that you're her son.  And that means that you can post on Facebook about how she abused you as a child right or your your former boss.  Has clear title to the fact that she's your former boss or he's your former boss and you can't warn other people about the workplace conditions because they own that fact right.  So this is the first promise we had this this blended ownership that doesn't lend itself to market transactions to begin with.  And the second problem is that if we acknowledge that privacy abuses are themselves harmful we do not want to make some social good contingent on their expansion.  Right it's like it's like funding cancer research with tobacco sales the best thing for cancer would be for tobacco sales to be eliminated we do not want the cancer research industry.  In some way reliant on increases in tobacco sales we want to decouple those things we were talking before about incentives I think this is a very powerful poor incentive.  And Ed Felton who used to be the CTO or deputy CTO of the Federal Trade Commission it was in the White House Office of tech policy is later Princeton.  He talked about this once in an article where he talked about interests and and about how when we talk about human life, for example.  We don't create property rights to regulate it and in fact creating property rights in human life is kind of the mark of sociopathy right murder is not theft of life.  Murder is a crime unto itself we have a whole language of describing it.  And for that reason we also have a language of describing our relationship to one another that's not grounded in exclusive rights.  My daughter and I have a relationship to one another in which I have an interest in her and she has an interest in herself and her school has an interest in her grandparents.  My wife who is her mother her friends and many other people all have varying degrees about legal and ethical claim to her because she is sui generis she's a human.  And in no way like a thing that we make markets in and I think information person identifying information is much the same.  And that's so much of the dysfunction that we have arises from the fact that PII is not amenable to propertization.  And then finally I worry that although it would be great to have more information literacy that you would mostly get information fatigue that having to understand.  All of the different transactions that you opted into just by moving through time and space would create a kind of nihilism and that you would end up with privacy is a luxury good where the wealthy could afford the professional class.  Who would help them navigate that and everybody else would just be opted into adhesion contracts where all of their data was harvested non consensually with the pretense of consent and abused without effectively without limit.

Start time: 6024.14
End time: 6220.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right so privacy is currently a luxury good I don't think we should kid ourselves or try to convince ourselves otherwise it's it's those people who both have knowledge and the financial wherewithal to.  Use tools and systems to prevent others from tracking them.  You know it is it is that group of people it is the wealthy who have the ability to be anonymous.  Or to be private as they need so I think that that I think that that's an addressable issue, but I don't think that that.  Is so meaningful right with this argument now.  In terms of all the PII.  I don't think that we are and Corey rightfully.  Explained I don't I don't think that tracking every single piece of this makes you know feasible or logistical sense that being said.  I you know my favorite parlor trick is having people go to Google and open up their locations and the number of people who have absolutely no idea about.  The number of people who have absolutely no idea just how.  Just how much they're being tracked all the time to me.  Means that we are creating future problems for ourselves so.  Out of ignorance.  Out of.  You know I listen my husband is not my husband.  Smart really successful guy yeah I remember sitting on the couch with him just after our daughter was born 10 years ago.  He had something open and I was like hey you want me to show you everywhere you've been for the past whatever and I pulled that open and he was we didn't speak for two days.  What he was.  He was I mean there was nothing wrong I think it was just this.  Sense of having not known that.  And this is a highly educated person so I think we need to decouple the education and understanding of how technology and most importantly our data work.  From the business of sorting out who owns and has access to those data and and how they can be used and while I totally agree we can't incent the companies.  To force us to create more data in order to.  Earn more revenue if that's the direct if that becomes a feasible UBI because then we all game the system and then the whole thing collapses.  My point was I think that we are moving in this direction anyway I believe that PII are quickly morphing into what again I call a PDR which is personal data record which is sort of one stop shopping for all your stuff.  I know that sales force has started to lay the groundwork when it comes to health and education I know we all know what you know Google Apple.  And Amazon are doing some of the same things you know wouldn't you rather have a non commercial entity.  Housing your data in a way that is less icky and I think the answer to that is yes and if we are doing you know because because to me this seems to be an inevitability and again.  Why I think we ought to address some of these that the future plausible problems that we're going to be facing at the same time that we deal with the current issues around monopolies that we face today.

Getting a consensus on what privacy is what companies should be allowed to do honest to God most people would rather we were talking about the iPhone 12.  This because.  It feels hopeless.

Transcript:  I know I don't think we do get people to care I lived in Japan for a really long time and the way that you say the word privacy in Japanese is put I was she there there was no word for privacy.  I'm not making this up privacy is a fairly modern concept.  Well it's a it's a very modern concept because of modern technology and they never had to talk about it before and you know I just I guess what I'm trying to say is I just don't think this fascination that this fetus you know we almost fetishize I think privacy at this point when we talk about it but we just.  Our behaviors don't don't mirror the conversations and I don't think the everyday person I'm on the IRG right now or the the the IRC channel and you know some of the some of the same questions are being asked there I don't think the every everyday person cares so much about how they're being tracked or if they do the conveniences of the systems that they're using.

Start time: 6325.00
End time: 6359.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are so so overwhelmingly positive that they are happy to give up that privacy in exchange for the convenience of having access to all that they may be faced with that crux even in Japan because Japan India and the five eyes governments which include the US and the UK have all called at the five eyes meeting.  For back doors in encryption.  It's it's it's essentially the US the UK Canada Australia New Zealand Japan and India agreeing that end to end encryption is a threat to national security national security yeah well.

Transcript:  That's a very good right I don't know if that's about privacy as much Corey as I just don't want to be slowed down I don't want to see the ads I bet you that's the reason.

Start time: 6391.56
End time: 6422.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well I mean it's hard to disentangle but there's certainly an awful lot of it and one of the things that we know from the GDPR experiment which is gotten us some facts and evidence is that if you serve first party context ads instead of third party behavioral ads.  More of your ads get through the blockers that users choose about twice as many so users are choosing the kind of blocker that blocks third party behavioral ads but not first party context ads and those are the privacy invasive versus non privacy invasive ads.

Start time: 6422.94
End time: 6433.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well I only do first party contextual as you know right but I have to say that's probably more because it's easier technologically to block third party ads and it is to block but you also get.

Start time: 6434.46
End time: 6554.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know about that but you also get twice as much money because you don't have to give a big to the ad broker when you're when you're doing first party ads the other thing is is that the most successful challengers.  To social networks have been privacy forward right so snap for example was the most successful challenger to Facebook they were only able to defeat it ironically by spying on users with a deceptive fake battery monitor called a novel.  That's spied on how people were using snap and replicated snaps functionality and insta snaps pitch was we're like Facebook except your data doesn't hang around ironically Facebook's pitch for its first 10 years was we're like my space except we don't like Google index it or third party see it it's private.  Right right Facebook built its its its fortune on being the privacy forward network so I think that.  It's true that people tend to underweight the future costs of privacy disclosures because it's hard to understand the connection between a privacy disclosure and a future harm but people retrospectively regret privacy disclosures.  When those times arise yes and so you could say that people like smoking because we have a lot of expensively sown doubt about the relationship between tobacco and cancer and the only people who who are angry about tobacco or dying of lung cancer.  And now it's too late right but but it actually turned out that the that when we prohibited firms from lying about the harms of their products and when we instituted vigorous public education about those harms.  That the public's consciousness shifted the same is true of climate right there that you know the revealed preferences of Americans is we want trucks bigger than God and we want to we don't care how much dinosaurs we have to pour in the gas tank.  But when you ask Americans how do you feel about your red sky the hurricane the invasive mosquitoes the refugee crisis none of them are going to say that that was a good bargain for their SUV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right so so this is that this is the why I think you see journalists and activists who are ahead of the public consensus because what they're trying to do is reach the point of peak indifference before the point of no return.  Yes and you know if peak indifference only arises after you've got a lung full of tumors then you might as well keep smoking and enjoy it for the years you got left right.  And if that by the time you care about crashing animal populations is when there's only one rhino left we might as well find out what he tastes like because he's not coming back.

I mean it's just another way of presenting the argument.  Yeah.  You know Orwell gave us 50 years of being able to head off all like abstract policy  discussions about surveillance by saying stopping so Orwellian you know.

And futurists I imagine futurists have a little bit a little bit of that going on to  our show today brought to you by or Sabi not the green stuff on your sushi although delicious as that might be.  I'm talking about wasabi hot cloud storage.  It's the perfect solution.  If you're a company buying more hard drives all the time more local storage.  What are you doing.  What are you nuts.  If you know we need another terabyte this week next week and every week or a petabyte a month or whatever it is.  You should be going to the cloud.  You should be going to wasabi.  First of all you might say well wait a minute what about those other guys.  No wasabi is a fifth the cost of Amazon S3.  It is significantly faster.  It's so affordable it actually will cost you less than the maintenance fees of the on prem storage you're looking at buying less than just the maintenance fees.  And I would argue it's more secure it's more reliable than anything on premises.  Eleven nine is a durability.  Eleven nine.  I don't think you get more than that.  They're hosted in premier tier four data centers highly secure.  They're fully redundant.  That's good because wasabi has active integrity checking every object stored on wasabi is check for integrity every 90 days if one bit goes missing no problem.  These are redundant data centers.  Remember we can get the data back.  You're never going to lose not even one bit.  It's secure by default.  Even if you don't request it all data is stored encrypted at rest.  They follow every industry best practice for security models and design.  They have things like access control mechanisms bucket policies ACLs.  My favorite thing is your data is immutable.  You can say I don't want this data to be erased or altered by anyone bad guys malware even me.  Obviously you could turn that off but the malware can't.  That is a great feature.  That's why I say wasabi is better than on prem storage not just less expensive but actually better HIPAA compliant FINRA compliant CJIS compliant and it's a flat rate.  There's no weird tiering system like on S3.  It's just basic a basic flat five ninety nine per terabyte per month.  But but they've even got a better way to save.  They call it reserved capacity storage.  If you are in the situation where you just know I know I need a certain amount every month you can buy ahead.  You can reserve capacity ahead purchase storage in one three or five year increments.  You'll save more for great you know more storage and for a longer term.  And it's a great way to get that price even lower wasabi is not just highly secure disruptive technology that's turning the industry on its ear its storage.  That's 80 percent less expensive and six times faster than Amazon's S3.  Oh did I mention no charge for egress.  It always gets me with S3.  Oh it's cheap to store it here.  Until you want it back then they're going to charge you no charge with the Sabe egress is free.  So is API access and their API is 100 percent compatible with Amazon's S3.  You're going to love wasabi just calculate the savings for yourself.  Just go to wasabi dot com get a free trial of storage for a month.  Use our offer code tweet if you will let them know you saw it here.  Join the movement migrate your data to the cloud with confidence.  Go to wasabi dot com.  And again don't forget the offer code tweet.  And thank you wasabi for supporting this week in tech.  Thank you for supporting the show by using that tweet offer code that'll let them know you saw it here.

In fact if I had the lights on in my office and turn the camera and you'd see the mountain of boxes of books that I am signing fulfilling for the authors.  So the four that remain there's Bruce Sterling and Chris Brown talking about cyberpunk cyberpunk on Monday.  Oh I'd love to know it's in Ken Liu on Tuesday.  Tochi Onyabuchi and Bethany Seymour talking about young adults and revolutions on Wednesday.  And then we finish with Runa Sanvik from the tour project who used to be the front line defender for the New York Times newsroom and Windows Snyder who's a security expert.  She was a very senior cryptographer at Apple for many years started at Loft Heavy Industry was in Cult of the Dead Cow.  And the two of them are talking about practical personal cybersecurity.  Now are you there too.  So you know it's me and them and they all come with signed copies of the book.  If you want to go to more than one of them and you don't want two copies of the books if you go to CrapHound.com you'll see a list of bookstores or rather of libraries and prisons and halfway houses and universities that will take your copies.  So you just put their address down instead of yours and all sign it to them and mail it to them instead.

Transcript:  One of the things, though, that the Jewish faith really embraces is  intellectualism.  And one of the things I was thinking when Corey was talking is  actually both of you is what we need is something that we used to have  in the United States, they still have in Europe, is this notion of a public  intellectual, public intellectuals who bring up these issues,  who talk at this more lofty level and really kind of can can frame  the political conversation.  And right now, what we have is just lots of yelling  and conflict and nobody rising above the fray.  I feel like that's something that is kind of missing from our discourse

Transcript:  Let me let me just say this.  My. The thing that.  So my family came to the United States, they are  they were escaping like everybody.  And I grew up around people that had numbers on their arms from concentration camps.  The thing that I learned that every or a lot of people that I know  learn from a very early age is that when they come for your  they can come and take your things,  but they can never take away your education.  And so education matters more than almost anything else.  Education and hard work.  And if you are if you know if you have learned things  and you are willing to work harder than everybody else around you,  then no matter what happens, you'll be you'll be OK.  So I think that.  I think those are good values.  We certainly that I live by those values.  Education is more important than anything else, or, you know,  we make sure our daughter knows stuff.  But the there is a little bit of a line with the sort of intellectual,  you know, it's it's a it's a the Jewish intellectual  trope is real prevalent and in propaganda all around the world.  So it's a it's a it's a bad thing.

We have a president in office who is unabashedly racist  and anti-Semitic, anti a lot.  It's.  Plausible that he won that election because of those views,  and there is no question that there's a rise in.  You know, there's a rise in  in public displays of anti-Semitism and racism  and anti-ism.  And I guess we're kind of circling back to where we began,  which was Corey's, I think, admonishment  of just awful dystopian futures and dystopian fiction  because it reinforces some of those beliefs.  And I guess I kind of agree with that.  I'm changing my mind.  Yeah, from where we started.

Transcript:  I just wanted to say, you know, my my father came to Canada on a DP boat.  And when he got to Canada, he was racialized.  He was spoken of as someone who was of a race that was not white.  Right. And and he was he was from Russia.  He was a Russian.  He was his father was was Polish and Belarusian.  His mom was Russian. OK.  And and he was born in Azerbaijan.  And he by the time I was born,  we had become white, right, in terms of the way that we appear in the discourse.  And I I look around at family members and friends of mine  who, like Amy, experienced firsthand the horrors of violent industrial scale  racism and who, upon attaining whiteness,  decided that their allegiance lay with the system  that divides us into white and not white and not with opposing racism everywhere.  And I feel like what we're learning now in 2020 is what we should have  intuited, which is the last people who get pulled into the whiteness  boat of the first ones pushed over the gunnels when the seas get stormy.  And that our allegiance as people who are descended from  and part of a culture that was shaped by this horrific,  violent racism is to be aligned with anti-racism, especially  anti especially opposing anti-black racism and the xenophobia  that is directed at people from Central and South America.  And, you know, I'm proud to the extent that I see  Jews remembering that in their history and making that their lesson.  And I just made to the extent that it isn't as universal as I would hope it would be.

Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I don't want I think it would be a mistake for us to deprecate  intellectualism. I think we have done that.  Going back to Adlai Stevenson, who was declared an egghead and not elected  president, that's we have a long history of that in the United States.  But I think maybe we need smart people more than we did ever before.  And we need people who are willing to think big thoughts and  be public about that and talk about that.  And both of you are my models for this.  You're both so eloquent and so smart.  And you're and Amy, the forward was right.  You're willing to step out and talk about it.  And I thank you for doing that, especially on your birthday.  Amy Webb, Future Today Institute, the big nine.  Can't wait for the new book.  Can't wait till you come back and be on the show with us.

I have to say some of the smoking gun emails  that came from the House Judiciary Investigation, the Antitrust Subcommittee,  were pretty damning of Apple.

Transcript:  Those days long gone for me.  Thank God. That was a nightmare.  We do Twitter every Sunday, about 2.30 Pacific, 5.30 Eastern, 21.30 UTC.  If you want to watch or listen live, we do have streams at twit.tv slash live.  But honestly, there's no reason for you to disrupt your Sunday evening.  You can easily just get the on demand versions, which are available on our website.  twit.tv. There's a YouTube channel you can watch or listen there.  Best thing to do would be get a podcast application and subscribe.  That way you get the every episode.  The minute it's available of a Sunday evening.  Thank you all so much for being here.  My brain is swelling.  I'm going to have to go get a cold compress and think about what we've learned today.  Another twit.
