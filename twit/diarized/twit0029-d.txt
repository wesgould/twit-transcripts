Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The pixel core crew are doing all the video and the audio and putting it together great. We could not do this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Without them and they do it all they're all volunteers. We could do it. It would just look awful  Wouldn't be the same and it saved me  You know quite a few late nights I have to say I'm really happy about that so thank you pixel core  Big story of the week and it's just making me hop and mad we covered it on security now with Steve Gibson  In detail, I actually did an early security now because it was such a big story  It first came to light last month, but nobody paid much attention to it  They have secure people said Sony is putting a root kit on Windows systems when you run Sony BMG audio CDs  Hey, hey, nobody paid any attention  until  The fellow from sis internals who makes a rootkit revealer program called rootkit revealer  mentioned it in his blog and  The world came tumbling down that was earlier this week  So here's the deal if you if if you have a Sony BMG disc they've been doing this since last spring that says  content enhanced and  Protected copy there's many titles or how many albums really, you know, it's not clear. I don't nobody's ever said Sony's not saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  CDs two years ago, but if you look at it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You'll know because the CD will say content enhanced if you play it on a Windows machine  You'll get a you'll you'll get a license agreement that pops up and says is it okay to install some software it?  Mistscribes the software including it implies that you can remove it easily or disable it easily and so most people are just saying yeah  Okay, I just want to listen to my music  What it's installing is effectively a rootkit which a rootkit of course is a hacker tool that hides  Allows software to hide on your computer files to hide on your computer hide so well because by patching the kernel that no program  Not even the operating system can see these files. They're just invisible. In fact, the way that sis internals  Rootkit revealer does it is by actually writing its own operating system code and comparing what it gets with a directory listing to what the operating  System's saying and if there's a discrepancy if rootkit revealers finding files that the operating system doesn't know about it says you've got a rootkit

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So but you don't need to you can install after the fact you don't need to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, the sis internals rootkit revealer is great. There's also one called blacklight from f secure  They basically both work the same same way  But Mark Grosinovich who's at sis internals was the guy on Monday who said this is this Sony that's rootkit on here

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So wait is this because Sony decided to license?  a  Protection like some kind of DRM from a British company were they naive and like the company that made this yeah  I doubt your technology. No, but did the company that made the DRM technology?  Decide hey, let's put this on here and make it really sloppily and Sony just said okay. This is probably good stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We'll put it on you've got two basic options either Sony went wow this looks like an incredibly  You know robust system for protecting our content and preserving our revenue stream or Sony knew exactly what it was doing  It was like yeah, I choose the latter I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  someone who used to work for Sony a  long time  Hey, I left I left okay  He's he's long before a decade ago before the BMG thing before the video button thing, but I yeah  I wasn't there. I wasn't part of the decision maker, but I would actually go I would actually  Suggest that they may not have you know  There's a lot of decisions. There's a lot of decisions that they that they make that you know some executive

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nobody sat down with the executive and said we're gonna use a rootkit

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like the executive doesn't know how to check his email great. What's a rootkit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they said the executive is no don't worry. No one will know it's there  No, I'll be able to see it it hides itself in fact  There was possible to remove it and they patched it just a few months ago to prevent removal and and so  What I think Sony is culpable for is is that much is somebody said to them oh, yeah, you cannot install it  They said whoa we don't want that to happen now  This thing is so badly written that it scans your disk like eight times a minute  It does it double scans it but worse  And I think the real serious thing is it it means that any file that begins with dollar sign sy s dollar sign any file  Will disappear is immediately root root kitted  So I in fact mark recidivich who discovered this took notepad dot exe and renamed it to dollar sign sys dollar sign notepad dot exe

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it disappeared it quote-unquote third-party hacker could just take advantage of knowing that they could hide stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You should mention that because there's a world of warcraft hack. It's been built around the root kids. Oh really

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So so somebody's got a hack that they put on your system no not an arson

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Used to cheat in the game yeah, and they use that to hide it essentially

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Any idiot 12 year old who knows enough to rename a file dollar sign sys dollar sign can't anything you want  They want on your system. Yeah, so not I mean Sony can say well look you know  I mean there's rootkit technology used in Kaspersky antivirus and Norton  The trash protect they could say look this is legitimate other companies use this but what they can't say is  What what what really a problem is that they're opening this huge security hole on every Windows system  It's installed now. Here's the latest that just came out today from marker Sinovich as we tape this came out on Friday  He said it's also phoning home every time you play a Sony disc  It's calling Sony and saying what songs you're listening to see the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Market people at Sony's going hey  This is you know we're trying to figure out how many people are actually listening to our audio and computers isn't this great you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think there's like this weird like mismatch because somebody started out as a hardware company  And then they decided to get into the content business  So they're kind of like I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My impression is is they got into the content business because they needed they had they lost on the hardware business because they didn't have  enough content they got beta maxed ones and they were like we're always we're gonna be self-sufficient  You know you know and that's the same way that Apple  You know had trouble and now they have lots of their own software  You know you know and that's the same approach in certain ways

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Really if they knew what they were talking about they would be even more  Cuppable because this thing is so badly written so appalling for instance if you pull it out if you do on it if you manage  To uninstall it yeah, it breaks your CD. You can no longer see your CD driver because it's patched

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's another good reason not to buy any more CDs no more Sony CDs

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Certainly

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All the time just it's going that way and go into the Apple Store is not the best option because the audio quality isn't as high  As it could or should be it isn't well. I would certainly say

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stop playing CDs on your computer in fact don't play DVDs on your computer too because there's a similar thing happens with this  Interactual player there's a much. There's a much better lesson here buy a Mac  That's a good question does it I mean we don't know because there's no rootkit revealer for the Mac

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe I don't think it's actually if you buy music from Sony that has this it's possible on any system in fact the original

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Rootkits were designed for UNIX systems  It is absolutely possible all it is is back matching the kernel has to ask you because Apple every time it goes into that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's gonna Apple's gonna keep on asking you are you sure you want to do this and and do you have but once you've patched

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The kernel all bets are off  It doesn't matter because they can patch the kernel to stop asking you they can do anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But if you take any of these discs and just pop it in your system and have it and have say iTunes  You know rip it you're good. You're fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it was no purpose is to hide the CD this is to keep it from being ripped yeah  I mean so the it now I don't know if this works on these areas not extend the CD

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not a digital it's an analog thing and by the way they're trying to plug the analog  I'm gonna get to that in a little bit too. That's a huge story

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is a bit is a bad week for people for civil libertarians

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a bad week for American citizens. I agree whether they respect their rights or not

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I agree so in the past remember holding down the shift key would prevent this  Software from running because it prevents auto run so if you want to listen to his contact  Content enhanced CD hold the shift key down, but I still wouldn't put it on my computer  Right and I presume if you say no to the EULA the license agreement nothing will happen

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We can only hope but I just it's just probably just spit your CD back out

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There is a patch Sony the the company that wrote this xpc or Aurora is offering a service pack one

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because they found a better way to hide it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I will take that one out. I don't trust them, but that's it. They say it makes it so that you can remove  It's 3.5. Megabytes. It's a huge download

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Service pack for a root kid yeah a service pack

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We'll put links to mark rosenovich's blog postings because those are really the most complete and I urge people also to listen to  Security now because Steve and I talked about quite a bit

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  somebody else went out to went to a record store with a list of the name of the CDs that  Had this on them was like I understand there's supposed to be a you like and read according to Sony's website  And then people in the store like huh you know I mean it's not printed on the label it's so I hope there's serious

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Reprocussions for Sony for this because this is just bad be bad corporate behavior  Okay, that's it no well. I'm certainly wouldn't buy any more Sony music

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm gonna think about selling my sony psb because there's no games worth playing on it somebody will write another game

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why because a movie player well?  You're asking developers to create games for the psb right as the xbox 360 comes up and right as the ps3 comes around the corner  No, but no, but the development kits are out there, and they are coding so you're asking companies with with limited resources  So I can either kind of report and rehash a ps2 game over to the PSP  Or I can actually devote the time and money to something that actually sell  So I mean I mean most of the instant the PSP has been selling very poorly compared to it  So nobody's developing for the PSP  No, there are no games, but there are games coming out, but everyone's attention  I'm for in my opinion seems to be kind of taken by the next generation. It's a great disappointment to me

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean I bought a PSP, and I was looking for it's a good gaming platform. Nice piece of hardware

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have one too, and I if you want mobile gaming get a DS. I bought one and I when I first  Thought it was I was kind of like Jesus kind of big plastic piece that you know what yeah, you know what it's actually  Oh the game even my game the games are fun. I play like I play one to you doing this finger and it's awesome  It's like you you would think it's like the most like when you first hear about everyone's calling the next you know virtual boy  The next failure and then here it is you know it's selling more games more titled rolling down

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just envisioned a view with nintendogs

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, I don't have nintendogs. I do have  What's the what's the I should know this because I edited the review for this, but it's a surgery game  It's you know where you basically operation kind of you like do you do?  You do little sutures and stuff on the skin is probably it's actually pretty fun, and then there's a ace right

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that's the problem with an intent oh, yes, it's a kid. It's a kid thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what there's a I know I know a lot of adults with them  I've yet to see a child with one in their hands

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a lot of really cool. I mean there's electro plankton which some will debate is whether or not electro plankton  Yes, is your job to use it's a musical game where you actually create music hitting

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You don't use your bailing to sieve through the krill and try to find the yeah, but krill is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think krill is counted as plankton even zoe plankton  This is why this is why I love Roger

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A lot of unique games because of the fact that they've got this weird

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do with me you know it's cheap in the games are a lot cheaper than the $50

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was an EA who was it that said that the revolution controller is gonna spawn a slew of crappy games  I think was a yay that said I think they might have a lot of interesting game

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Were they just jealous they have a lot of they have a lot invested in certain

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think what I think is so what I think is so frustrating about the PSP is is how  Find myself is how much they've how hard they've made it because they want to sell movies to the PSP  How hard they make it to put content on it how hard I mean they got they have Wi-Fi  That's what this doesn't have you know that my iPod video does your iPod really need the Wi-Fi

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, cuz then you could you could download you could watch we could download content at one six the speed

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What I'm more interested in is that I could add I chat people and I would use my phone about half of what I use it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why am I the only person who doesn't see Wi-Fi everywhere in North America?  I've run it somebody was in my cure like he kind of do a story on the Wi-Fi phones that are coming out  They're gonna bury bury wireless, and it's like where I live in San Francisco  It's must be the most wired city in the country after Seattle  You couldn't even get on in here where there's Wi-Fi flying

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nintendo's actually doing a deal with McDonald's to have they did you could play do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, why I get a DS grow fat play nintendogs eat fries actually it's funny because the there it's way more  That it's way report in the state sir

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hotspot provider in Canada get a happy meal kind of deal with it. That'd be kind of cool alright game time's over

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's talk about the the broadcast flag in the analog hole

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You were starting to say about the Wi-Fi

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's just that there's so much that you could do with Wi-Fi  I mean being able to get content get like news or get something you know get live  Footage or just be able to buy movies while I'm sitting around. I don't have to write  You know I don't have to go somewhere. I can just sit there and pay my $1.99  Yeah, Sony could be doing what Apple's doing with the eye with the iTunes music store if  They created something that I don't even have to blow the Sony does Sony if you go to connect.com

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They've got exclusive content for the PSP  Don't you think there's a root kid on your PSP none of our viewers most of our viewers sure go to connect.com because they're probably using  Firefox and connect comm isn't doesn't it only works with IE 55

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anywhere I don't want to go to a website. I want to just be sitting there on my and go right. I really buy

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I really want this right why max would be great if why max would actually be you know why max mobile and actually have the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In a usable manner well there is a patch hack patch for the PSP that will be out soon that will  Override all of those firmware  Fixes that Sony's put out to turn off piracy and it's amazing  They will allow you to play divx and x-fitt and all the other must controls a platform Alex via Sony

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you know it's it's interesting that all the way to the bottom of the sea

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's interesting because the PSP is is the moon is geek porn people want it so badly  That they're gonna hack this sucker, and it doesn't matter what Sony does it just shows you what a losing proposition is he 32

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's that it's it's actually a  The thing in South Korea is that they're so nationalistic and they're so  Kind of they have a they have a certain issue with Japan, so they block a lot of  Japanese imports including video game consoles  Oh, really one of the few places in Asia's where you see a lot of PC gaming you can't because you can't get a Nintendo in  No, you can't just you know you have to import is just you know go to import so I get very high prices

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But also because they have a lot of broadband we're gonna import black market

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  PSP's into Korea well

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a company that actually makes it's it's it's a it's it's a it's a basically a handheld video game unit  But it's completely open source they give you the SDK is for it GP GP 32  And you basically there's this entire cottage you know kind of hacker but development group made of you know open source users  Who's quick who've created emulators your own games?  You know moving the watching utilities mp3 players is Korea  It's you can it's gonna be sold  Excuse me in the u.s.. Either late this year or next Walmart's gonna have it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How much the rocker the the razor razor how much money is how much remember what's Motorola?  What's the deal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cuz like motor or make if you buy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's 200 bucks on a yeah by 200 million of anything you can get it for half off

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that was like I remember with the funds are not that expensive to make it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's there's companies that say they they insure you can insure your cell phone and the deductible apparently the deductible  No, the deductible has been more money than the cell phone value is of the replacement phone. They give you here about that  Well, I'm not buying their insurance some class-action lawsuit. That's not good insurance

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cell phone costs are really strange because it's hard to that's why it's cool to see some of the sites where they actually give you  A total of the value of the parts inside a cell phone or it's all subsidized though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, you know, it doesn't really matter what it costs cuz well, it's hard to tell right because if you buy one outright

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like $500 and if you buy one with a two-year contract, it's $250  And if it's a Wednesday under a full moon, there's a $75 off on top of that  That's what somebody's like I'm getting the new and they inserted the name of this like  $700 PDA cell phone. I'm like you're 15. You don't have a calendar to organize  Why do you need this summer off on it's like well I can get it for 50 bucks. Okay, I'm like  Buddy works at the cell phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you saying that basically these cell phones are a lot lot cheaper than

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Your shirt left the factory at a dollar fifty, you know, it's amazing. I think he paid a dollar ninety nine

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the same thing, you know, just go tell my mother she wastes her money then

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mr. Rogers is on the phone. He wants his shirt. Actually. This is for my friend who's about six four. So it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the same thing. I mean we just these incredibly absorbent in prices. There's lots of margin and that's what makes it all work Marge

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Margerine the house. Did you know that there was a house subcommittee on courts the Internet and intellectual property?  Absolutely the s rate reading H SCI IP  Skip  But why the courts the Internet and intellectual property?  I mean what is what are those two have to do with the RIA a the MPA rewriting federal?  Coast in New York City hearings are going on right now in front of this subcommittee debating  They have there's actually three laws one Corey talked about my doctor  Oh when he was here a little while ago to revive the broadcast flag. They couldn't get the FCC to do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Gentlemen we must protect the content developers

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the broadcast flag it prevents copying on it basically means every digital device that can play digital video has copy protection  But there's a good screen. That's my personal favorite. There's an analog hole. It turns out if you have an analog device  Who's stopping you from copying?  so there what what they want is all analog devices like VCRs to start recording digitally and  Then put copy restrictions on it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean isn't that one of the reasons why they were pushing so hard for?  HG content because the belief was if you make the bandwidth of the content so incredibly huge  No one in their right mind or you know this side short of a million dollars

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You'd be able to actually copy or do anything other they were wrong about that. They didn't know about BitTorrent Dan Glickman  Dan Glickman is the CEA CEO of the MPAA following in the footsteps of the late great Jack Valente  It was not dead yet. No

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  former neither dead nor far from our hearts

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Glickman characterized the broadcast flag as necessary to quote keep the free marketplace from turning into a black marketplace  And the lovely Rick Boucher  Responded that he thought the MPAAs proposals were unduly restrictive  Oh say that again unduly restrictive who said that Rick Boucher correct? Yeah, he's coming around  So Lofgren who is from Silicon Valley? She's a Democrat from California said that Congress should do what it can to keep content owners from being ripped off  But not at the expense of limiting consumers rights or killing off technological development

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So just something the RIA and the MPAA are working furiously  Care about

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I don't you know  I don't know what the status is of these but clearly this is one where you should go to action.eff.org

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm personally rooting for it. Are you and why would that be?  You know they screw up the more the more they screw up. They just keep on pushing that thing down  You know look what Sony's done, so if they get if I roots out of a whole generation  So you know what we'll do is we'll make we'll make everybody break the law, right?  I mean so so we will have no regard for it  You know so out of that or we'll tighten it so much that we open up a huge chasm for other content  You know because we're gonna hang on to it  We're gonna you know it's you can't touch it  And you can't have it unless you pay us every time you think about our content  You know and and the and the thing is is if we if they keep on going down that path  They really are gonna open up a whole  Horde of other content that will run them over you know it is a typical so your role mentality

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like the people who vote for  Vote for the other guys in the election hoping the whole system will come tumbling down

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I it's it's I don't know just I'm mark. I'm a little facetious. I have to say I think it's a bad idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I vote yes  the mark Hawkman over at extreme DRM wrote a bunch of articles about this and  Got a little more technical and other people and you want to read some stuff where somebody's just utterly  Dismayed and pissed off about what's going on  It's because it's I mean I understand like part of me understands people want to get paid for content, right?  But rather than exploring ways of doing that micro payments content tracking better distribution systems better quality on distribution  You know I mean it's like it's it's always about locking it down and more importantly having a legal recourse  You know the digital and the other thing is like the the digital money and Copyright Act is is you know strange?  At best right, but it's been well

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's an example this mark Rosinovich in order to figure out what the Sony DRM was doing  Yeah on this root kit had to violate the DMCA because he had to reverse engineer  The root kit right so in order to protect us  He had to break the law

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's a you know it's everywhere and the other thing is a lot of companies cite the word setting remember when it's you know  The DMCA first came out companies were citing left and right you know we're gonna sue you under the DMCA and it's like  This was there is no digital. There's no copy protection on this. How can you cite the DMCA?  It's a big scary four-letter word. It's like it works it works

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, that's that's always that yeah collapse. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is not even a feature  But the thing that I like about the Google Maps so so much that I use all the time is the fact that you can  Do a hybrid view so it shows satellite view it and for some reason like there's there's features in the new  The new Yahoo one. It's really neat  Especially like you can it'll show the area you zoomed in on by a little gray a little grayed out here  And then you can look in that and you can use the scroll bar to zoom in and zoom out. It's using Java

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's maps.yahoo.com slash beta. It's not the full one

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's somebody said they were using flash and I was like what no

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's Java because as I remember when I first did it it loaded a Java window

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm pretty sure it is. Yeah, but it's kind of cool. It's really  Similar to Google because you can move around, you know actively and I did find that the browse by category  Actually works a little bit better than Google. It's just a little easier to find. I love it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the more these guys are at each other's throats trying to best each other the better for us features

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely, it's a bit competition. Do we know if you if is the Yahoo Maps are they?  Is it gonna be open source the same way I mean not open source well, that's something Google did that was really smart

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There is a Yahoo developer network says build your own map  Yahoo Maps API application gallery  So they what they're doing is they're looking at what was worked for Google and they're saying good we can do that  we could do that just as well as you can do that and  I think it's great and you know  It means there's more jobs for  Gearheads, it means there's a more cool web services for us at Microsoft clearly is feeling the breath hot breath of Yahoo and Google  They they did you go to the big web services announcement? No, I saw a poster  It's like a rock show that they what do they call this? They was in San Francisco  And the idea is they're gonna do web  versions of Windows in office

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's one of the questions of yeah, it's it's it's it's it's so I don't understand really Ajax

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, the idea is it's web services  You can use your office online. You can use Windows on watch out people soft  It's kind of a Google kind of MSN a lot of MSN

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Says they're gonna be putting out a bunch of software for that. I think marriage of fully was like it's hailstorm 2.0  Oh joy. Oh, yeah, and you see that Microsoft is a tried to tried to appeal a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Something to the Supreme Court about let's talk about the yellow thing in second  But I want to finish this web services thing  It's hard though if you think about for Microsoft to do anything  The people are gonna jump up and down about because no matter what Microsoft does they're gonna say. Oh, yeah, that's  Hailstorm 2.0. Yeah, that's MSN 2.0 because they've done everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  well  They've also got a habit of doing the same thing and it's not working and then they change the name on it and they

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Re-release it and then they you know, it's it's time for them just pass the baton and say look, you know  We're gonna I think they should just stick with what they do applications operating systems web services. It's a new generation

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's young people billions of dollars in the bank  You know their pocket was a pocket PC 5 or what's the what's the latest?  Handheld OSA actually pretty cool. You like it. I don't I  Would probably buy one if I didn't have so many other toys to play with

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't have to worry about it until version 3 then it takes over everything until they tell everyone you have to you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, that's gonna be the next the next what do you think people said though when Windows 1.0 came out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Probably yeah, well, it was kind of funny  It was like when the ie1 came when the first version of ie came out it wasn't too bad  It had issues but it wasn't too bad and by version 3 it was like the classic, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it was over for Netscape. Yeah, in fact, I'll never forget I was I did a  Editorial on the site on MSNBC saying that when an Internet Explorer 3 came out  I said it's you know  It starts shutting turn off the lights Netscape because here is Microsoft's here to you know, and it's all over and apparently Marc Andreessen  saw it and just was  Furious he wouldn't talk to me for a long time after that  Very just recently and by the way, I was right Netscape was sold to AOL just a year later

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But well the whole browser thing was the precursor to Microsoft's troubles with the DOJ  Really? It was bundling the darn browser with the OS which I think you should be able to do quite honestly

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's part of the OS Apple does it Linux does it everybody does it?  Right, that's why everybody did it after after Microsoft after Microsoft  So let's talk about this EOLA's patent. They tried to get the Supreme Court to review it  The Supreme Court said no, so the trial goes on this is really a big deal. I think because this is a patent  Another one of these, you know companies formed to enforce a patent

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like the one-click thing like I need to put something that a plug-in in my browser so I can run flash

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Things on it. Well, essentially it means that embedded objects on a web page are  Patented and Microsoft's unwilling to pay the royalties the huge royalties that the OLS is asking so they're gonna have to  Change the way Internet Explorer works and I guess all other browsers will too  And what it means is it's just bad news for consumers because it used to be  It still is right now seamless, you know  You go to a site that has some flash or a site that has some Java just like Google Yahoo Maps  It just loads and it doesn't who is the OLS. I think they're a holding company. I don't know. That's a good point  I don't know, you know, we should find out

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was a Microsoft let's see  It's a web browser called viola with a V V I O L a created by a computer program an artist named Peewee or pay way  So they bought it probably right before the University of California filed for its patent the University of California

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's right. You see is involved in this. That's right. That's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They changed it to e O L a so

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Eola's  Did they buy the rights to this or they were granted a patent in November of 1998, which is not that long ago  so you see  licensed this patent and  So you see I guess is involved in the lawsuit. I'm not sure but any event  This is bad news Microsoft has continually lost all along and the fact that the Supreme Court is not going to review it  Is bad news  It means that either Microsoft will have to pay this company a lot of money and pay you see a lot of money or they're  Going to have to take out and they've already by the way  They did this already and Apple also has figured out how to do this where it's an extra click basically  It's just a pain though. You go to maps dot, you know, yahoo.com slash beta and instead of it  Just loading you'll have to don't say okay in order for me to load this Java  You have to click a button

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think the only thing that's happened is they they wanted the Supreme Court to have a final decision on all it does  Now it's back to a district court. So that's someone can start my decision  It could end up going back to the appeal to the Supreme Court again to go on forever. That's it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think I mean this is when someone's gonna have to start really looking at I mean the patent  Whole patent copyright everything is just everybody  You see the world now have a story. Yeah, but the other story storyline. Yeah, did you see this plot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can I patent the upside-down pyramid and then go sue the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal in the LA

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the problem with these patents is it you know, I mean supposedly prior  I'm gonna copyright it and then it's you know, supposedly prior art is supposed to overturn these things  But I mean 1998 they patented embedded objects and web pages. Don't you think there's prior art there?  Well, maybe they will still win but the right now Microsoft Ozzy Ola's 569 million dollars

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's a yeah, but in Microsoft money chicken feed  Billion take the you know, take the patent and then go take over the web or something exactly

They're they're saying because traditionally they've they've you know  They've kind of turned a blind eye to using the USB cable with the cell phone  But apparently there is an official system for it now, but they are being more hardcore about
