And as we are wont to do  on this  second week in April,  I thought we'd go back and talk to some of the pioneers of the technology  industry. Sometimes we call it our  gray-haired TWiT.  Starting with this fellow here, I don't know what's going on with your camera Jerry,  it looks like you are coming to us from the Isle of Man space program, Jerry  Pornell.  Of course, the great columnist for Byte Magazine.  We hope to see you in the new Byte.  I've been talking to Gina Smith, the new editor in chief of Byte Magazine, she really wants  Chaos Manor back.  I hope we can get that.  It's good to have you Jerry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, more than that, we're hoping to do their podcast, we want to call it Bytecast  and have the Byte editors round table on  our network as soon as we get a round table. We're going to buy a round table just for it.

Transcript:  Oh terrific, but  it's going to have to be done remotely. I'm not coming up to Petaluma, I haven't that  much interest in arm wrestling.  I'd like to come see you sometime, but that's a long trip.

Start time: 174.46
End time: 191.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll explain, yeah, absolutely, you can do it from right there in your library.  By the way, Jerry, if you're watching the video, it's in his library in his home in  Southern California. It's always a great shot to see all those books. I just love it.  It's like a museum.  The Dead Tree edition.  Yeah.

Start time: 193.60
End time: 206.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That seeks to be the way it is.  But I like Dead Trees because you can see their titles.  Well, Jocks Barzan once described it as a scholar in his office being assaulted by

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and we also know that you'll be able to read them even decades from now,  whereas with all of this electronic format stuff, we don't really have any  guarantees that they'll be readable at some arbitrary point in the future.

End time: 278.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that voice, that other voice you hear is somebody you probably will recognize as  the host of our Security Now podcast and my dear old friend Steve Gibson, who has  also been doing podcasts with us since the very beginning.  And another writer.  Did you ever write for Byte? I know you're in InfoWorld.  Oh, just InfoWorld.  Yeah. And Steve's column.  What was it called?  Tech Talk.  Tech Talk column for many years I read.  In InfoWorld magazine and sitting right next to him on the back page of InfoWorld  magazine, that's this guy, John C.  Dvorak.  Inside Track column.  Inside Track.  He still does the Inside Track.  It's PC Mag still publishes it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that online thing.  That it's just a flash.  I've heard about it.  Yeah.

Start time: 288.46
End time: 319.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, everybody's probably forgotten, but I had the back page column in Byte after, I  mean, in InfoWorld after Dvorak left, it turned out that McGraw-Hill had not properly  drawn up its contract to make it exclusive against InfoWorld.  So they, I think that John's, I took over what John had been doing as the lead or trailing  columnist for a year and a half, two years.

Transcript:  Is that considered, was that considered Prime Real Estate, the back page of a magazine?

Start time: 323.92
End time: 336.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess it was.  Oh, I think that was the best spot in the magazine was the inside back by the, it's  facing to the actual, but you open the magazine from behind and it's what you look at.  That's what John had for.

Start time: 337.07
End time: 348.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  You know, the reason that was considered Prime Real Estate is because it was only for the  writers, because what it amounted to was that people could go to a newsstand, flip open  the back page, read your stuff real quick and put the thing back.  Skip the rest.

Start time: 350.80
End time: 353.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's easy to skip the body of the magazine.

Start time: 353.34
End time: 357.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't know how prom that was.  My job is to be able to buy a magazine.

Start time: 358.22
End time: 370.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was, I was on the other side of this guys.  I was the guy who subscribed to InfoWorld and Byte Magazine and absolutely flipped right  to the back page of InfoWorld every single week.  Steve, with all due respect, it was inside track right away.

Start time: 370.84
End time: 388.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I know.  Boy.  I am.  And my column was the next page in.  Yeah.  So it's easy.  Yeah.  And, and you know, that advertisers are charged extra premium for the inside front and  inside back covers.  So it must be that it gets extra attention and, and you know, it's understood.  In front of book, back of book, all of that.

Start time: 389.16
End time: 434.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  My, my, my job in the old bite was carrying the back of the book.  They put me in on page 240 is where my column started and they'd have it one column  wide and about a half a page deep and I wound through every dang page in the back of  the book, the end, every end.  And people would say, why don't you, why don't they put you up front in the feature  position?  And I had to point out to them that I got paid more for being back at the back because  I carried all those pages of ads for God's sakes.  That was, that was why they were so dang long and rambling.  Yes.  Not to get, that's when computer magazines had 236 pages in them.

Transcript:  You know, it was the beginning of the end when you got the computer shopper and it  must have been 10 pounds and you could make furniture out of this.  If you had a years with a computer shopper, you had a night nightstand ready made.  I built a house.  Yeah.  No kidding.

End time: 478.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  John, what were you going to say before?  I was going to say that the, the, the, probably the best example of that sort of  thinking that Jerry was expressing is the cartoons in the back of the New Yorker.  They're only there to keep you flipping through those pages.  So there's ads can get some attention.

Transcript:  Yeah.  No, you're right.  Hey, just a word.  This is the last episode of the fifth year of the Twitter network.  Our very first Twitter was April 17th, 2005.  We begin our sixth year next Sunday, and we're going to bring back as best we can  the hosts on episode one, Kevin Rose, Patrick Norton, Robert Heron.  I think John, David Prager will join us.  John, you weren't a part of Twitter until maybe five or six episodes in.

Transcript:  You know, Leo, it'd be really neat if it were possible to do a sort of a time  capsule that way and talk about how the internet has changed in these five years.

Start time: 521.76
End time: 558.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cause those guys were all part of it.  Well, the big story this week is the house of representatives on Friday  overturning the FCC's internet regulations, their net neutrality regulations.  Senate will have to vote on this.  President Obama has already said that he will veto the bill should the Senate pass  it, the Senate is expected to pass it.  And of course, this is always that big fight is should the government be  involved in net neutrality?  And if so, what is Obama right to veto this?  Let me start with you, Jerry.  I know you have a pretty strong anti-government bias.

Start time: 559.46
End time: 585.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not so much anti-government is that I think I'm not one of those people in  the anarchist.  I'm not one of those people who thinks there ought not be a government.  I just think it ought to mind its own business.  And I don't think this is the government's business.  I haven't seen any abuses.  John was telling me that we were going to have 200 bought accounts because of  this, but I haven't seen it happen yet.

Start time: 586.04
End time: 589.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does it scare you, John, that the net neutrality regulations are overturned?

Start time: 591.86
End time: 609.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, but I do agree with Jerry that I don't like the idea of the FCC all of a sudden.  My thinking is the following.  Once the government starts getting involved with net neutrality, then they're  going to get involved with regulation because it's like they can't back off.  They just get bigger and bigger and bigger.  I work for the government.  I've seen this in action.

Start time: 609.54
End time: 652.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, we talked about this before, but let me throw in the opposing point of view  and then let you tell me why I'm wrong.  I think this, I agree with you.  I mean, the last thing I want to see is the government involved in the internet, but  I think this is a mess government created.  In fact, the FCC created when they allowed the duopoly of the cable companies and  the phone companies to control the internet.  If there were true internet competitiveness, if I could go to 10 different ISPs, I  wouldn't be so worried about net neutrality.  But Comcast says 250 gigabyte cap AT&T just announced 150 gigabyte cap.  That's a form of network discrimination.  Isn't this the FCC fixing the problem that they created in the first place?  Don't we need this because we don't have true competition.

Start time: 652.98
End time: 667.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is that situation where, you know, you create a problem, then you fix it and  mess something else up and then fix that and fix the next thing that you screw up.  And then you keep tracing it back.  And then next thing you know, and I'm telling you, this is what's  where it's headed.  You're going to have to be licensed to do this show.

Start time: 668.24
End time: 673.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If that happens, I'm going to the Isle of Man.  Now, I can easily see it.

Start time: 673.10
End time: 686.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have about 10 terabytes of live broadcast every hour.  And so maybe you need more than 150 gigabytes, but I don't know very many people  who need that kind of bandwidth.

Start time: 687.00
End time: 711.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's the argument AT&T gives it.  Oh, 99% of our customers don't use that much.  This is to prevent bandwidth hogs.  But I disagree, Jerry.  I think what they're doing is a preemptive strike against the day soon to come when  we're watching Netflix, when we're downloading movies from iTunes and Amazon.  This is to protect their phone business.  This is a protect you verse their television business.  They're worried about me and everybody else taking over.

Start time: 711.80
End time: 734.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and remember, they're also protecting the MPAA and the RIAA.  We're now seeing the government blacklisting web domains and arbitrarily  deciding that, OK, these guys are copyright infringers.  And suddenly we can't access those domains because they're taken out of DNS.  So, I mean, the government is definitely creeping into our Internet.  I just think it is.

Start time: 734.52
End time: 750.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I don't think let the FCC have at it with the I mean, you know,  Prenel's iron law bureaucracy says that bureaucracies exist to fortify themselves  and expand their own capabilities, not to do what you think you set them up.

Start time: 750.94
End time: 754.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's all right. But that's dogma, Jerry.  What do we do if you don't have the government?

Start time: 755.20
End time: 757.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's observation. OK.

Start time: 757.52
End time: 777.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But what do you do about this particular problem?  How do you solve this?  You know, we've got this situation where really the cable companies  and the phone companies have an iron grip on our Internet access.  And if they choose to, as they seem to be,  acting in their own business interests, not in the interests of the nation  and the people of the nation, then what do we do?  How do we prevent that?

Start time: 778.16
End time: 784.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Set up another set of channels.  You do you you compete with them, of course.  Well, who who's going to do that?

Start time: 785.22
End time: 804.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, Century Tell's got their own system out there.  Verizon's got one sprint.  Now it has got the, you know, that wireless thing going on.  The WiMAX, you can subscribe to in many parts of the country.  It's not a complete monopoly.  No, no, it's a duopoly or.  Now that's a triapole in some places.  But it's beside the point these other guys couldn't compete.

Start time: 804.90
End time: 816.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're all colluding with each other.  You don't you don't you believe in technology?  I do. I wish I.  But the problem is there's already a mess made.  You know, when in the dial up era, you had many choices.

Start time: 816.36
End time: 823.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But as soon as it became hurt by the by the situation so far,  because you're probably the one guy who could be around here.

Start time: 824.40
End time: 859.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is so far no problem.  However, I do fear when I see these bandwidth caps put on, there are.  I'll tell you, I've been hurt outside the US in countries like Canada  and Australia, where they have much lower bandwidth caps.  People, many of our viewers in Australia can't watch the video  because it would use up their bandwidth cap.  And I fear that that time is rapidly coming to the United States.  And it's and it's by the way, it's not an interest  of protecting their constrained resources because and John and I,  you've had this fight many times with me over the cost of bits.  I don't think it's that I think it's to protect their entrenched businesses,  their their cable premium.

Start time: 860.02
End time: 899.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that could be Leo, but let's take another look at this.  What has the government done about all these antitrust deals every time  an opportunity comes for them to say no to something like this AT&T  upcoming buyout, right?  They don't say no, they just they encourage it.  So what is the government going to do if you put the FCC in charge?  They're going to encourage more of this.  And then who's going to get the thing is there?  I don't see that they're doing, but anybody any good now.  The net neutralities are red herring.  And it's all boiling down to the point where you're going to have to buy  a license to do the show you're doing right now.  That's the only way it's where it's headed.  They they haven't done anything any good for anybody.  They're not stopping this AT&T merger, which is a disaster with T-Mobile.  I don't want that. Nobody does.

Start time: 899.84
End time: 918.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, so what do we do? Do we?  I mean, it's one thing to say, start a ISP, Jerry,  but I don't know if that's a doable thing.  If you know, there's a lot of copper in the ground and I can't start an ISP  without the cooperation of the incumbent local carrier,  the phone company or the cable company.  And in fact, the cable company is not even required to sell their access.  They're the only one.

Start time: 919.70
End time: 963.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, my problem for years was I couldn't get high speed access.  I was three miles from the switch, so I couldn't get copper.  And the cable, my local cable company didn't at that time do it.  And I but for a while there was, in fact, an Internet  outfit that did it.  It went down when the cables began to provide cheap high speed bandwidth.  But it worked for a while as a wireless.  I built a little Linux box.  I set it there and I set it up and I had pretty good speed.  Then when that went away, EarthLink has satellites.  I was for a while getting my high speed access from a satellite.

Start time: 963.52
End time: 965.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was terrible. That, Jerry, you got to agree.

Start time: 965.88
End time: 984.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it wasn't terrible.  It was very fast throughput.  It was slow response time because of the delay between here and there.  So websites that were designed to have eight million  calls to other places took forever to load.  But a movie didn't take any time.

Start time: 984.82
End time: 1027.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How about this? How about this?  What if what if the government finally released the restrictions on  access to the cable and let Internet service providers  other than Comcast, say, use the Comcast cable to provide a new service,  as they've done over the phone lines?  If they promoted true competition over the phone lines.  You know, right now, if AT&T doesn't want an independent Internet  service provider to use their their copper, they really can make it pretty difficult.  I've talked to a lot of independent ISPs who say, hey, it's this is tough.  What if they put some teeth in these regulations really required  access, then maybe we would have some competition.  Admittedly, we only have two big pipes into the house,  but at least we could have many service providers over those pipes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That then I then I think the Google Verizon deal,  which basically said, well, we'll have net neutrality on wired,  but let's not let's not stifle the brand new wireless business  really kind of is even more scary now.

Steve Gibson, John C.  Dvorak, if you're in the chat room, I'd love to get some questions for these guys.  I know you'd probably like to talk to them.  It's kind of fun to have some of the great legends of the tech journalism  business on with us right now.  Before we go, though, back to our conversation, let me mention our friends at Citrix.  I know these guys know Citrix, Ed Yacobucci and his team.  Ed worked at IBM, came over to Microsoft to work on Windows NT.  And as a result, he was still working at IBM, but he just helped out Microsoft  with it as NT.  As a result, nobody knew the inside guts of Windows better than Ed Yacobucci.  And Citrix was the result, a great company that does enterprise desktop  sharing. And of course, they have some great consumer products.  We talk about them a lot, including GoToMyPC.  I don't know if you've ever tried GoToMyPC.  I know there are a lot of choices when it comes to  remote access to your desktop.  But I got to tell you, GoToMyPC is the fastest, the easiest to use.  You'll set it up in minutes.  You don't need the IT department to do any port forwarding.  It's 128-bit SSL encrypted.  It's got NAT traversal, which I wouldn't know what that means,  except for Mr. Gibson's explained it all to me in great detail.  GoToMyPC and now on the iPad, too.  So here's the deal.

Start time: 1234.02
End time: 1305.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Isle of Man has a very high tech promotion.  I think they're trying to be a sort of Silicon Valley  in the in the middle of the United Kingdom.  They are part of the United Kingdom.  The Queen is the sovereign, but they are not part of the outfit  that's run by the parliament at Westminster.  They have their own parliament.  In fact, I think they claim it's the oldest parliament in Europe or something of the sort.  I thought the Icelandic owl thing was.  But anyway, they seem to want to promote some of my old  pro-technology lectures that I made back in the 70s in the doom period  when everybody was saying that, you know, by the year  2005, we're going to have all starved to death.  And there's going to be this mass die off of people.  And I basically said that isn't the case.  So they're trying to set me up to do my old  lectures that I used to go around doing at colleges.  And I'm actually looking for trying to set up a technology  situation, of course, we got the new bike coming.

Well, it can be very profitable.  The moon is made of a lot of things and we now know there's water there.  So there is nothing.  You don't have to import much in order to be able to live there.

Wow.

I don't know how to do it in the sense that if an engineering project  building a lunar colony is engineering, not science, we know how to do that.  Yeah, but then you get into Mars is science.  I don't know how to keep people alive for two years,  which is about to pass or a year and a half or a year or even nine months.  And in space transit because of solar flares and various other things,  the space radiation environment is pretty bad.  Yeah. And the one thing we're absolutely certain of  is that between if you have something like if you had 33 inches of  of water between you and or.  If you have fourteen point seven pounds per square inch  worth of worth of of medium Z materials,  between you and the space environment, you can survive.  How do we know? Because that's what we have.  That's what for what Earth has.  We've got the atmosphere between us and the and the space environment.  And that has taken care of the solar flares and all the rest of it.  But we don't know. I don't know how to get people to Mars.  That doesn't mean that we won't learn how, but that science and not just engineering.  But I do know how to put three and a half meters of lunar regolith  between you and and the space environment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we know there are some very strange things at very deep depths  because sometimes they they get washed up.  And of course, they pretty well explode because they come up too fast.  You do understand that the whole thing about surviving  in that kind of environment is the pressure inside and the pressure outside  have to be the same.  And when you change it, that change has to be fairly gradual.  That's why if you scuba dive at 400 feet, as I have,  it takes longer to come up than you got to spend down there while you were there.  You just have one of the nice dives is off Jamaica  because there's a mountain that comes up in it and you go down  to the bottom and you spiral your way back up it,  which is really kind of a nice dive  because you have to come up slow.  If you come up fast, you'll explode.  That's probably not good for you.

Start time: 1919.26
End time: 1942.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And and of course, when you have that big a window,  there's a lot of square inches on that.  So when you're talking about 36000 pounds per square inch of pressure,  that's multiply that by the number of square inches on that window.  And you don't want much pressure differential between you and the outside.  The outside have to be balanced at all times.

End time: 2095.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And the FBI dot gov web website is going to show you that  that the Air Force picked up a whole bunch of junk  at the crash site because what crash was a mogul. Oh.  And mogul was a day.  You remember, if you know anything about the Roswell case,  they they the big thing they make about it is this substance that was hard to tear  and flexible and metallic.  It was mylar, aluminized mylar, which nobody had in those days.  But a balloon that was made of it crashed outside of Roswell.  It was a it was the mogul project, which was an acoustic.  It basically flew balloons over the Soviet Union and listened to what  it could hear on the way by.  And nobody wanted that to happen.  My first impression when when I heard about the Roswell thing  is I thought the bombardment group had laid an egg.  That is, they'd lost a nuclear weapon out there.  And the secrecy stuff came in real hard.  It didn't turn out to be that it turned out to be the mogul crash.  Ever since then, Roswell made a hell of a good living  the entire city out of out of aliens and the Roswell story.  But in fact, there is not much to the story.  It's been a good 40 year.  Oh, who was a real my friend.  Clara Flock was a real true believer.  He really believed in UFOs.  He would move on and all these other things.  He got a grant to go write the Roswell story and he dug into it  and he dug up everything and he discovered that it was all explainable.  Poor guy. It damn near broke his heart.  But it did. Yeah.

But we do a bunch of them at once.  So you can watch a whole bunch of it's really short.  Yeah, they're kind of short.  But you can watch as many as you want because we do like 10 every time we do them.  Now, the thing that's changed is the same kind of the same set.  But I've changed my thinking about having guests  because I find it was annoying to book guests.  Yeah, it's too much.  It's just a lot of work. And I didn't feel like doing that.  So I like the idea of a fixed group of guests.  So I got Andrew Eisner, who's a really smart guy and he knows everything.  And he works for Retrievo and he used to be an editor for one of the big magazines.  And Joe Ingo, who's a super nerdy tech,  you know, Apple oriented character, who knows all kinds of weird stuff  I never knew about.  And, you know, he's a DNS guy.  And so we just have just our group of three and we take news stories  and we discuss them and everybody and everybody's I don't have to worry  about people that don't know what they're talking about and all the rest of it.

End time: 2306.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ham Nation sounds like something.  It sounds like a food show.  Ham Nation.  So, no, the thing is, I picked up this paranoid attitude some time ago  about the fact that if everything goes, especially during Katrina,  that if everything goes down, you know, the guys who saved the day  were the ham operators because they were on the air while nobody was no power.  Anyplace else you can have your own.  You have a battery. You can start broadcasting.  And I came to the conclusion at some point, you know,  it's probably a good skill to own in a neighborhood.  And I think a lot of younger people aren't exploring it.  And I would say right now to anybody out there listening to this,  if you know the basic stuff about computer technology  and how to build a machine, for example,  you know about half of the ham license answers already for the for the initial  license, the technician's license.  And you can go you can go, you know, it takes probably very little study.  There's all kinds of online help and lesson plans and testing you can do.  You can test over and over again till you get it and then you go take a test.  It's not that difficult.  And I think more people should do it.  And it also prevents guys like that,  get Peter King in Congress who wants to steal all the amateur bands  and then use them for some commercial crap that's probably not going to do  anybody any good when the hams, like I said, had saved the day at Katrina  because the government wasn't doing anything.  So I think this is important.  Well, if there's a disaster moving in with you. Well,

Start time: 2307.32
End time: 2352.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  John's absolutely right.  The one of the worst things that ever happened to this country was when we  abolished the old Civil Defense Network and set up a federal  Emergency Management Agency.  Civil defense was all local organized, local, local people,  ham radio operators, retired firemen, retired military, retired cops.  And it was all voluntary.  And each one was sort of dedicated to the disaster you're likely to have  rather than having an agency in Washington.  It's supposed to be expert on hurricanes, oil well explosions,  earthquakes. And you see what I'm getting at. It's just stupid.  There is no way to federalize emergency management.

First of all,  they have announced that they're going to sink $100 million into creating  original programming. This is kind of like Netflix.  Netflix has started to buy programming and it's intimated.  They're going to start creating shows as well.

I don't, I don't need to tell the sophisticated,  intelligent discerning audience that listens to this show that if you don't have  your own website, you're kind of really don't exist these days on the internet.  You need a website. You probably already have one.  So I'm not going to bother you,  but think of all your family and friends and maybe coworkers,  maybe your favorite restaurant. They don't have a website.  And you're wondering why not? Well, here's a great way to get them started.  Go to squarespace.com slash twit and click that big green, try it for free button.

Transcript:  I started learning programming on an IBM 650 in the 50s.  And what was that? Was that COBOL?  IBM 50 was used... No, it had a binary language.  The language was 10 bits. I mean, 10 bytes.  OK. The first two bytes were an opcode which told it what to do,  like load accumulator, add to this, subtract from that, divide, that type of thing.  OK. The next four bits were the address of the data.  And the last four bits were the address of the next instruction,  because there wasn't any program counter in the thing.  Wow. And the memory was on a drum.  Didn't have a stack. Didn't have...  It was a drum. No, there are no stacks.  There was none of that. And it had a drum.  I had to invert a matrix on a thing like that.  It was incredible. It took hours.  There weren't no forks around.  John McCarthy was trying to write a list for it at the time.  I was trying to invert matrices for it.  So, wow. John went on to be a computer scientist.  I stayed in aerospace.

Start time: 3124.36

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and back then, when you had drum as the as the main memory,  the challenge was optimizing it for speed.  You would literally set your instructions  so that they were at the right place in the drums rotation.  So that the computer could access it at the right time.

Start time: 3142.10
End time: 3172.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somebody wrote an optimizer for it after a while.  But yeah, for a while, that was you.  You had to figure out where.  Otherwise, it would have just missed where it should have got the next data  and the drum would have to do another rotation.  It had 50,000 words.  A word was 10 bytes in those days.  It had 50,000 words of in memory on that drum.  That was the memory.  The actual memory and machine memory was like 10 words.  Wow. Right.

And it wasn't until you could have it on your desk, however small, you know,  and have a personal computer that it was of any interest at all to me.  But that was a PDP.

He's the guy who wrote Java, created Java and consider, I think,  one of the premier computer scientists out there.  Google's kind of it's interesting.  Google's starting to look like a mature industry, a mature business  these days compared to its young scrappy days.  Larry Page, though, is back running it.  He Eric Schmidt left this week.  And Larry Page, the founder of Google, is back in charge.  And already he's reorganized, put together a committee of six  to run the company missing out on Marissa Meyer.  I don't know if this is a  a snub to Marissa or an oversight or maybe she's just busy.  But she was on the big committee that ran Google.  Now, she's no longer in this in this new, newly reformed office.  I don't know if it's the office of the chairman or what, but  she is still in charge, as far as I can tell, of Google mobile.  But mobile is not one of the big six categories.  And I think that's one of the ways you can tell what this new Google is all about  is looking at who these executives are and what they're in charge of.  You can also say and I'll give you that list in a second,  but you can also say that there's some indicator by the fact that Google's  announced that bonuses this year for all Google employees  will be directly tied to Google's success in social.

And they set aside what was it?  One hundred twenty five million dollar fund for orphan works.  And she said, no, you didn't you didn't include all the stakeholders in this.  As of course, the other stakeholders, the people who are anxious about this  are Microsoft and Amazon, who don't want Google to undermine their book business.

Start time: 3509.30

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 3520.04
End time: 3526.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 3526.64
End time: 3595.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not true that nobody cares is that nobody knows whether they care or not.  I'll give you an example.  I've got some older anthologies that I edited  and they contain some works by people.  Some of them are old enough that the people who who contributed  to the stories have vanished.  I don't know where they are.  They're dead.  I don't know who owns the copyright.  I don't know what.  And I suspect that the copyright holder doesn't know they have anything worth anything.  It isn't going to be worth much.  But if I put one of those books like War World up on Amazon,  we might make enough money that each contributor would get a thousand dollars.  But the contributors, heirs don't even know that this  30 year old story is worth a nickel.  They probably don't know they own it.  Well, so how do you solve that?  Well, the the settlement said that I would pay the money  in the essentially an escrow account and it would sit there until somebody came  or I'd get it back after a certain amount of time.

Start time: 3595.50

Start time: 3597.84
End time: 3609.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the big objection to the settlement was a bunch of authors said,  but they scanned my work without my permission, because you understand  Google didn't know which were orphans and which weren't.  So they scanned everything.

Transcript:  You can't ask permission from the people who don't know they own something.  And so they scanned everything.  And then they offered to pay essentially about forty dollars per  scanned work to the copyright holders for the insult.  Basically, they scanned about 40 of my books and they offered me something like  books and articles and things.  And they offered me something like three hundred dollars for the insult.

End time: 3730.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They weren't selling it.  And that's the point.  There are a lot of others who scan my work without permission.  And my view is, yeah, but they have offered to pay me for the insult.  They didn't cost me anything.  They didn't cost me anything that they scanned it.  They haven't made it available to the world.  It's just in a search index. They want to.  Now, the one of the things is they unless you opt out,  which is to say, I don't want you to be my agent and offer this for sale on the Internet,  then they retain the right to do that.  And a lot of people know it's going to be opt in.  Well, but opt in doesn't solve the problem of the orphan work  because nobody knows who's in.  Far as I'm concerned, it was a perfectly good compromise.  They're going to pay me for the insult and they allow me to say, no,  I'll handle my own rights. Thank you. You don't need to.  That's really all I needed out of it.  And I probably have a bigger stake in it than the one who's really unhappy  is Ursula Le Guin, and she has about as big a stake as me.  And she and I are in absolute disagreement on whether it was a good idea or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She says they shouldn't have done it.  They should erase all those things they scanned without permission and start over.  Now, I think that's going a bit far myself, but I understand her point of view,  which is that this was my work.  I didn't give you permission to do that.  And if I have not given you permission to do it, you should not have done it.  And I don't accept the insult money you have offered me.

Transcript:  I think so. Ursula doesn't.  And it's interesting because Earth is basically left wing in politics.  And you're a conservative.  I'm a conservative.  I'm somewhat more conservative than libertarian, I guess,  but somewhere in that in that nexus of libertarian and conservative.  So I guess I think the social benefits are important in it.  I think that keeping Google's  goal was to keep alive everything ever written. Right.  I think that's a noble ambition. Yeah.

Transcript:  Now, you know, I've been told that the whole notion of copyright was created.  I remember from the get go and we started talking about this stuff.  It was it was always, oh, you know, it's you know, when the computer game began,  it was all one of the great things that happened.  All the works of all mankind will be digitized and safe forever.  And we got to digitize the Library of Congress and everything should be digitized.  And then nobody did anything. The government wouldn't do it.  The light. Nobody would do any digitization.  So Google says, OK, we'll do it.  Actually, Microsoft did it for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. I'm with you, John.  I don't understand what all the shouting's about.  I think that Google did something good.  I think their their their their goal was noble.  And I think the method that they used to accomplish it was reasonable.  And, you know, with me, it's three, four hundred dollars at stake,  which is not money. So. Right.  My view is that this was a good thing,  and they ought to be encouraged to do it, but it does not seem to be the case.  The judge didn't agree anyway.

It's an interesting play for Google.  But in the past, YouTube's just been you give us your you know, in fact,  they've been trying to do deals with all the content creators.  You give us your stuff, we'll air it, we'll put ads on it, we'll all benefit.  Now they said, no, we're going to make our own.

Transcript:  I think it makes much more sense for them to function the way  the existing cable companies do, where they they see shows and buy shows  that are being made by existing producers.  To me, that just seems way more sane.  Unless they want to do something that's like, you know, very different,  like super techie tutorials or something.

Transcript:  And I say something here. Yeah.  This is not a trivial thing that any bonehead on the street  or some guy sitting over there at the Googleplex can do. Exactly.  There are plenty of companies that went out of business coming and going,  trying to do this.  I mean, this is not not an easy thing for people in Hollywood to do.  Pick and choose, you know, what's a winner and what's not.  I think it's a I think it's a fool's.  I think the guys are just throwing their going to throw their money away  and a bunch of crap.

Transcript:  That's really if you lie down with dogs, you get up with fleas.  If you get into the Hollywood game, you're going to come out  looking like Hollywood because like Yahoo,  Hollywood is successful because it does things a certain way.  The way it does them.  I live in this town.  What goes on behind the scenes in this town is not very pretty.  And if Google wants to get in that game, they're going to find themselves  in a milieu that they don't understand.  And it's really it may eat them alive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, here's what I think Google's doing.  I mean, Facebook, of course, is social and what Google's  I think this is the newest paradigm of search.  Remember, we went through we've been through a couple of search paradigms.  Yahoo started with a human index.  Google quickly eclipsed Yahoo by saying, no, it's too big.  We're going to do a an algorithmic index of the Internet.  But that's starting to fall apart.  Everybody knows who uses Google or even any other algorithmic search engine.  It's just it's it's gameable.  So what they I think what they look at, they're eyeing Facebook.  And they're saying, look, at Facebook's got all of this information  based on who your friends are and what your friends like.  That's what the like button is all about.  And you lay that on top of search results instead of getting search results  that are completely algorithmically designed.  You get the best of both worlds.  You get a human gloss from your friends, from your social graph, as they call it,  on top of algorithmic search results.  And that's going to beat Google every time.  And I think they're terrified that that's exactly what Facebook's going to do.  So that's what it sounds like to me is Google says,  I think you nailed it, Leo.  So what does Google do? Is it too late for them?  Is it already is this is this is the business cycle now move at light speed  in Silicon Valley? Is it already over for Google?  Ten years down the line?

Start time: 4077.90
End time: 4087.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Start time: 4132.14
End time: 4148.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'm sure they're working on improving search.  You know, Matt Cutts, who's responsible for killing search spam.  That's really pretty much the main problem here, of course,  is people getting spammy results into search.  Even he admitted, well, we're using some human editorial.

Start time: 4149.14
End time: 4169.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, don't they have Chrome sending feedback back to them  from from the things that the users do?  So, for example, if we're looking at a page of Google search results,  they can tell what it is that we filter from their results  and what links we click on.  And that's very important and powerful information for them to have.

Start time: 4169.64
End time: 4183.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They got to be careful.  I think that they there is a toolbar they've introduced  and they're asking people to use this to rate search results and to watch you.  So I think they're careful not to build it into the generic Chrome,  because they don't they know people are sensitive to being watched.

Start time: 4184.22
End time: 4266.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me on the chance, the very good chance  that there is a Google executive watching this right now.  Let me give you an example of something evil they're doing, which they  they probably don't even know they're doing it.  My daughter did a a  a sequel to The Moten God's Eye, which is a very  well known book that Niven and I did 35, 40 years ago  and which still sells to this day.  One of my favorite books of all time.  Yeah. Well, she did a sequel called Outies, which with our permission  and encouragement, and it's her book, we didn't write it  and put it up on Kindle and she sold  eight or ten thousand copies, something like that now,  which is pretty dang good, you know.  And she's actually brought in more money than she would have got  if she'd gone to a legitimate to a standard publisher and got in advance  and had them publish it.  But in the search engines, as soon as she took the  digital rights management off of the thing, the next day,  Google was showing free copies way above hers.  When you look for for her book, outies, you'd look at by the name,  you'd see up at the top, you'd see the first listing would be some torrent.  I think they have fixed that.

Start time: 4266.60
End time: 4269.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 4270.10
End time: 4278.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

End time: 4312.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think ethically they should.  I don't I didn't say this, by the way,  I am not looking for an FCC regulation.  Oh, no. But by the way, I'm not trying to get the government involved.  I am trying to get Google to live up to its practice of don't be evil.

Start time: 4312.72
End time: 4326.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is exactly why Google wants to do social,  because Google doesn't want to get in that business.  But what they're hoping is if they overlay some curation,  not from them, but from your buddies, that they'll avoid this problem,

Start time: 4326.84
End time: 4334.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

We are selling more copies of Lucifer's Hammer on Kindle now  than the last paper edition sold when when when there was it was still in print  and paper. No kidding.  It probably still is in print and paper.  It's been through 45 editions and I presume there's one still out there.  But the paper, the the Kindle sales of Lucifer's Hammer are quite high.  Larry and I are making decent money out of out of Kindle.  Just just the awesome. That's fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's mine. The rights are reverted and Niven and I are our agent put it up.  So she's getting really we could have put it up without her.  But since she sold the book in the first place, that that didn't seem like a good thing to do.

You and he were talking when he was talking about  what a sort of a stealth mover Amazon has been.  Man, that Amazon is sort of quietly doing major things.  And because we all think of them sort of as, oh, well, that's Amazon.  And they sell books.  But they're doing I mean, they've they've they've reached out  and branched out into so many other areas where they're really making an impact.  And we sort of don't pay attention to it.  But Paul's point was, if any other company just did one of these things,  it would be big news.  But somehow the fact that it sort of gets hidden underneath Amazon's,  you know, what we're used to thinking of Amazon as,  we're really not paying attention to it.  But Amazon is a serious mover.

An English girl, Madeleine McCann, went missing four years ago.  And her family has just announced that they are going to do an email,  a viral email campaign that they say they hope will reach 80 percent  of the world's inboxes.  They're trying to find her. I don't blame her.  She was four years old. She's eight years old now.  They were in Portugal at the time.  You might remember the story.  Yeah. But I don't know.  Is this a good use of email?

That's a bad idea.  Here's another bad idea.  Maybe I don't know. OK, I know you guys are fan.  I know, Steve, at least you're a fan of the iPad, too,  as am I. But a main school has just bought iPad 2s  for every one of its kindergartners.  582 iPad 2s.  What do you think of that?

Well, her program is systematic.  I don't know what programs there are for the iPad.  What she teaches is systematic phonics and it works.  Far as we know, every time, as long as  as long as it as long as you're dealing with normal people, obviously there.  I don't know what to what's the proper word you can use for, let us say.

And I asked her, did any kids ever leave first grade  who couldn't read in your classes?  And she said, yeah, that'd be every year or so.  There'd be one or two who didn't learn to read,  but they didn't learn anything else either. Yeah.  If you're dealing with the normal population, there is no reason why 70  intensive lessons won't teach phonics reading of English.  And that's reading.  If you're reading vocabulary and you're speaking vocabulary, they're in the same.  That's all on my website.  My wife will send you the program and, you know, 70 lessons and your kid can read.

I don't know why.  I would love to have her put it on the iPad.  I think it's a natural for the iPad.  The iPad is more than powerful enough to do it.

And I just think I look at the technology we have,  the power we have on these devices, the connectivity have with the Internet.  And although it would be hugely an upfront huge investment,  there is an incredible teaching machine and an incredible opportunity for  for for delivering knowledge and in the form of education on on tablets.

Transcript:  What about this?  This French law, Google and Facebook are challenging.  Steve seems to have an opinion on this.  The the French government.  Obliged this this was a regulation passed some time ago,  says that e-commerce sites, video music services, even web email providers  must have a data retention.  I don't know what the length of time is, but that now for some time  of of their customers, personal information, including names,  mailing addresses, not email, but physical mailing addresses,  telephone numbers and get this passwords.

Start time: 5245.80
End time: 5349.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, so for for the listeners who aren't regular listeners to security now,  I should explain that the state of the art technology  for handling logins is that companies do not store your password.  Instead, they store a hash of your password.  The idea is that you can take a password, you run it through a so-called  cryptographic hash and you get this this blob, a fixed size,  sort of a token that that represents the password.  The beauty of doing that is if you should ever lose control  of your database and it happens a lot these days daily, daily,  then then you're not you're not divulging your users passwords.  You're divulging this thing.  And the beauty of a cryptographic hash is that there's no way  that knowing even what the output of the hash is,  there's no way of reversing the process.  And for example, getting data that would then allow you  to impersonate the person and log in as them.  But if you if you if you take what this French law  is apparently saying literally, that is that they could demand  that companies like Google and Facebook and so forth  are able are are upon demand, able to turn over the passwords.  Then what that says is those companies have to save something  that for the security and the privacy of their own users,  they're deliberately not saving.  That is, they're not saving the password, they're saving the hash.  And so this has caused a great deal of tweeting in my direction.

Start time: 5350.00
End time: 5369.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, and Google and Facebook are fighting this.  A lot of companies are fighting.  eBay doesn't want to do this.  And I think let me tell you, it's also a little scary.  The notion that you could subpoena not just my personal information,  but my password, which gives you access to my continued information  until I know about it and change it.

Start time: 5369.88
End time: 5381.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Until you know about it and erase it or whatever.  It's very scary.  Yeah, it you do understand that anything you put in the cloud  is probably going to be available to somebody you didn't want to have it.

Start time: 5382.80
End time: 5399.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What? You know, that's really not the case in the case of passwords.  It's not well, or stuff that you encrypt before it leaves your computer.  Right. If you do it right, if you really encrypt stuff before it leaves,  then it's just pseudo random noise.

Start time: 5400.26
End time: 5404.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the pseudo random noise.  How many people are going to do that? Steve, how many people? Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, if that's as I said, anything you put up in the cloud  is going to be available to somebody you didn't want to have it.  Now, in the case of if it's encrypted, the you  you didn't want them to have it is not a very powerful emotion.  But if it's your story of your last affair with somebody, not your partner,  you probably did not want somebody to know that.  It anything you put up in the cloud  is eventually going to be available to somebody you did not want to have have it.

Start time: 5450.48

Start time: 5455.40
End time: 5477.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wonder what it is that they're trying to get at.  That is, do they actually want the ability to impersonate users  or do they just want the ability to have access to their accounts?  Because that that could be done without the divulging of this information  or without actually needing the providers to store the passwords.
