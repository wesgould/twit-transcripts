Transcript:  So thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you for being here, Phil, and also thank you for leaving your feedback in the Q&A session.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That will make our professional helicopters feel really better.  Ladies and gentlemen, Twitt has convened and John C. Dvorak has decided that he's going  to be, he's going to play the bad kid in the back of the class during spit wads throughout  the show today.  Oh, maybe.  I just wanted to warn you, he's got his sound effects and he's not afraid to use them.  Dvorak.org slash blog, am I correct?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's one place you can find me and you can find that.  It's a nexus for all the other places I'm here and there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you getting more sensationalistic on that blog?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, not really.  It's always been kind of sensationalistic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the headlines from the recent few posts.  Idiots at Oregon DMV find common Dutch name offensive.  Is 802-11, now that's all right, that's all right.  Let's see, Bin Laden condemned by Manta, that's all right.  Maybe I was wrong.  Oh, here's one.  Was John Paul II euthanized?  That's good.  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, he was taken to a farm where you can play and run and you can visit him anytime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's in donkey heaven.  This is Andy Anadko from the colossal waste of bandwidth and of course the Chicago Sun  Times.  Not the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not the same thing.  One is a simulation of mirror image.  You can tell that the CWOB has a goatee whereas the suntimes.com does not.  I will leave it to you to guess which one is evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Easy to tell the difference.  Is the new blog also at CWOB or do you have a new URL for that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The new blog is having some secret testing done at the Minnesota salt flats.  If you take a guess as to what the URL might be, you might be able to guess what it is  but basically it's a testbed so I can teach myself WordPress.  Right now it is ugly but it's getting better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to guess it's delicious.com, am I right?  It's actually Google.  I bought Google last week.  With one O.  You know him from Buzz Out Loud.  He was also for many years executive editor of the tech TV website and he is a published  author.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He is self-published, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Published author.  You don't have to say the self.  That's deprecating.  Self-deprecating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey Tom, are you in a bucket?  He's not in a bucket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He sounds like he's in a bucket.  Come out of the bucket.  How did you know?  There's a hole in the bucket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dear Liza.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just downloaded, not downloaded, purchased your book on Amazon.com.  It's Boiling Point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What book is this?  Boiling Point.  You're a brave, brave man.  It's good.  You used Lulu to publish that.  I did, yes.  So how much money are you going to lose on per book?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't lose any money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm actually broke even because the way Lulu works, every time you publish, the person  who's buying the book pays for the publishing.  You don't have to outlay anything unless you want to get an ISBN.  You pay 50 bucks to get an ISBN and I've sold enough to pay for the ISBN.  So even.  Is that the ISBN?  You sold it for 50 bucks worth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that what you're saying?  Yeah.  To me alone.  I looked at those Lulu terms.  I thought they stunk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, Lulu, no, no.  Lulu's been on demand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You get to keep all the intellectual property and you don't pay anything out front.  You don't get any royalty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They take like a piece of the action and they do this and they do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They put a minimum price on how much it is to print one book and then you can set your  price on top of that as far as you want.  So you can make your royalty whatever you wish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're thinking of something else, John.  Lulu is not.  I was looking at Lulu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When you get, when you set, yeah, you can set your price to 100 bucks, but then the  more you set your price, the more they have like a commission that they take out of that  instead of just taking a flat fee.  So they're taking, you know, a piece of that action under all circumstances.  Is that true, Tom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought it was just a flat fee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought it was just a flat fee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  No.  That's why I picked them.  No.  Are you sure, John?  I know.  I know.  I know when you do an I know, you maybe think of the ISBN because when you go through, when  you go to try to get into books and print.  No, no, I'm not.  No, no.  I'm not very sure.  I mean, there's a variable rate there, but I think in the, when you're just setting your  price, you're setting your price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll look it up while we're doing this.  But the last time I looked, they took a piece of that, of that price action.  So if you started jacking your price up there, we're getting like 20% of it or something  like that.  It was, it just didn't seem right to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like Lulu.  This is Michael Rogers.  You haven't done a book with Lulu.  No, I haven't.  It's not Michael Rogers.  Isn't it Michael Rogers?  No, no, it's not Michael Rogers.  It's.  What's his name from Red Hat?  Red Hat guy.  That's, I confused the two.  Red Hat.  MP3.com.  They're both, you know, guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We spent the past six minutes just poking holes in your boat.  I'm sure it's a great book.  I'm sure you can have a good time publishing it.  You're a wonderful, wonderful person.  It's a good book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm enjoying it.  It's really well-read.  Anyway.  Are you really enjoying it?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're not really poking holes in his book at all.  We're poking holes in Lulu.  Not the book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Poking holes in Lulu.  The boat.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Metaphorically.  You're the screen door in his submarine.  But don't forget, Tom's the guy in the bucket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, let's see.  In a second sense, Tom just published a book, even though he did it on Lulu.  Let's find out what this book is about.  Even though he did it.  By talking to Tom about it.  Stinking as though Kinko's wasn't involved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a PDF file.  I'm a published author.  I deserve to be at this conference.  It's an amazing...  It spiraled out at everything.  What's the book?  The book is called Boiling Point.  It's about the breakup of the United States into separate countries, sort of inspired

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's different people.  I've heard enough.  That's fine.  I'm not going to say anything.  I'm just going to say that.  I'm going to say that.  I'm going to say that.  I'm going to say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You bored John in the first sentence.  Let's move on to tech news.  What do you say?  By the way, that's one of the stories.  Delicious...  Mike Harrington broke this, I think, in TechCrunch.  Delicious now has a new look, or will have a new look soon.  Yahoo is finally asserting itself on the Delicious meme.  And this is going to break some old timers' hearts.  It's going to be delicious.com.  No more D-E-L.I-C-I-O.U-S.  Why?  I don't know.  It's too hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's idiotic that they would change something after building a brand like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what the numbers are in Delicious?  It's a huge number of people use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So why are they changing it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because it's Yahoo.  There's that intelligence test of being able to figure out how to type delicious D-E-L.I-C-I-O.U-S.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And see, as an elitist, I like the idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh yeah, me too.  I think the problem is that the shareholders were pissed off that they were directing so  many of those false click links to all those link farms.  That's traffic that should be going to Yahoo every time someone types D-E.L-I-C-E.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've done that a few times.  Now I don't know if they're going to retire D-E-L.I-C-I-O.U-S.  I would imagine they would keep it.  Three million registered users, 100 million unique URLs bookmarked there.  We use it all the time.  If you want to know what we're going to talk about on Twitter, you can go to D-E-L.I-C-I-O.U-S  slash Twitter slash show number.  In this case, 114.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't even have to do that.  You just have to have slash twit and you'll get because it's in order.  It's in order.  Sure, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We use it for Buzz Out Loud too.  Do you?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're very good about Buzz Out Loud.  Having done Buzz Out Loud, in fact, I think I'm doing it this Tuesday.  You send out an email that tells everybody what the show is going to be about.  All the stuff I don't do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and I'm doing it with people who are like right next door to me, not even like  all across the country.  I'm just so anal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I need somebody like that.  No, that didn't come out right.  Let's move on.  You need somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think that came out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  John just figured out why it didn't come out.  Go to Craig's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's a lot of people who are interested in trying to know about you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did anybody read David Pogue?  I thought this was very good.  Actually, I should have gotten David Pogue on the show.  I thought I wrote a really good article about ringtones in which he really skewers Apple  a little bit, not as much as they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Way after the fact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, he should have skewered them a little harder.  He points out that they're charging less than anybody else, blah, blah, blah, blah.  But he does say, I think really the key fact, which is why do you have to pay for ringtones  at all?  You're just playing the song you already own.  You're triggering it with a different button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's ridiculous.  I use a NeoNode N2 for my phone and essentially any WAV or MP3 file can be a ringtone and  you can set them up for every caller.  So if I have 25 people that are on my address book, each one can have an individual ringtone  that I just simply download and it doesn't cost anything.  I just don't get what these guys are up to by making people pay for something that should  be free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Will Shipley makes a very similar point in another excellent blog post on this subject  in which he's saying Apple's turning into the new Microsoft, the new monopolist, the  new greedy...  Turning?  Huh.  Yeah, maybe.  Well, they just didn't have the market cloud to do it before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they've always been a monopoly.  It's just no one noticed until they've gotten big enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They had actually become a monopoly.  Is Apple monopoly now in terms of the iPod?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's certainly an end...  They want to be an end-to-end provider with you not using anyone else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They want to be a monopoly, don't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, they taste like a monopoly, but the thing is that their monopolistic behavior  in by and large helps out the user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How does having to pay for ringtones...  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hello?  I'm working on that one.  He said, how does helping...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, go ahead.  Well, hence the use of the phrase by and large.  The fact that they're the one company that, in my case, is creating the operating system,  the hardware, the iTunes software, the management software, the store software, and the hardware  that I play it on means that up until this latest rash of iPhones, which had an unbroken  record of being the one music player that would always just install and work as opposed  to every single Windows media player device, which has always been just an ungodly ordeal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's the secret of their success.  It's easy.  And isn't that what customers want?  Ease of use?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That has to be considered a feature.  Plus, if you want to put your own ringtones on an iPhone, you can do it.  There's commercial software for it.  There's freeware software that'll do it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I use the AppTap jailbreak program from Mel River.  Isn't that great?  And then Erica Sedoon's mail...  Is it Mail Song or something like that?  Okay, you guys are making me sick here.  What is the name of your phone again, John?  What kind of weird phone do you have again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I use the Swedish NeoNode N2 just came out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Does that have buttons?  No, there's no buttons on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's totally gesture based.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're kidding.  You think he's joking?  He's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look it up, folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  NeoNode.  I think monopoly might be the wrong word here.  I mean, I think what we're talking about is like closed platform.  Because as long as there's Microsoft and a few other manufacturers of PCs, none of them  are monopolies.  I mean, you can buy several...  They're not technical monopolies.  You can switch over to something else.  But the idea is like they want this closed playground where once you're inside it, you  can only play in that playground.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're using the term in some broad sense.  It's not in a technical sense.  By definition, you're absolutely correct.  It's not a pure monopoly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's still...  It's who it would like to be.  Yeah, well that's the point.  Yeah.  It's still sort of like the theater model.  Once we get you inside, you're not allowed to bring any food in and we're going to charge  you, overcharge you for the popcorn.  You know, everybody...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the other thing is, I don't think there's anything...  I mean, I think everybody in the world wants to be a monopoly.  So what's the big deal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the goal of being...  And Rant has no problems with monopolies.  Successful business.  Well, that's my point is that the user gets sucked into this because of ease of use, but  ultimately loses choice in the long run.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course that's how monopolies work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  Well, I mean, you get all the choice in the world if you build your own hardware, build  your own software, and somehow build your own drivers to make them all interface to  each other.  Well, but that's the extreme case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The point is, if Apple creates this great end-to-end solution, which consumers like,  and all monopolists, that's the point is we might want to make this great system that's  easy to use.  Oh, and by the way, as soon as we do, we're going to jack the prices up because we've  got you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We own you.  Well, when have they really done that though?  I think if you look at the iPhone.  It's based on not jacking up price.  So basically saying goodbye to PC because they don't want to jack up their prices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think they jacked up the price on the iPhone and then when they had to stop selling it,  they jacked it back down.  What are you throwing out?  John, what is that?  Okay.  That's not me.  John's throwing something out.  What was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My notes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're starting over, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Anyway, yeah.  I think the big deal is that this is sort of like everybody suddenly realizing that  no, Apple Computer is not a bunch of hippies that are all out for peace, love, and the  betterment of humanity.  They're a company that likes to make money.  And up to now, they've been making money in ways that, again, generally tend to benefit  the user.  But now that they're, it's sort of like the first time you see your dad just a little  bit drunk, not dangerous, not just, you're like, oh my God, he's human.  I think that we're seeing so many things happening in 2007 that a lot of people are shocked to  find out that, again, Apple Computer collectively is not on a hillside singing, I'd like to  teach the world to sing.  They're saying, here's a market, we're going to pull it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This phone is cool, by the way.  I just want to say, John, this is a nice phone.  I'm looking at this.  Neonode?  Wet phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This neonode.  It looks like a bar of dial.  It looks like, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had, I actually did a Cranky Geeks and had Adam Curry on it, and he accused the phone  of looking like one of those emergency things when you fall down and you can't get up.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's very cool looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's very cool.  When you see it, I'll bring it by.  You can take a look at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You'll probably get a kick out of it.  Anyway, I'm sorry, Tom.  You were saying something actually intelligent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have no idea.  You can't have that.  No, I was going to say, I think, and I don't know if it was intelligent or not, but it's  It's the Steve Jobs sort of philosophy that people are coming up against here.  This kind of became apparent to me when I was at the Digibarne talking to that Bruce  Dahmer guy.  That's such a cool place.  Who runs it.  It's an excellent place.  Go to Digibarne.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How about explaining to us, to the newbies out there, what the Digibarne is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go to Digibarne.com and take a look at it.  It's Bruce Dahmer and Alan Lundell have put together a collection of every computer that's  ever existed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Up in the hills above Santa Cruz.  It's kind of remote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He has an Apple II GS sitting right next to the original Mac.  He's explaining how Waz had come with the Apple II GS and made it fully open.  You could crack it apart.  You could swap the cards in and out.  It was all about being able to mod it and open access to it.  At the same time, Jobs had pushed forth the first new Mac with the idea of all this openness  was killing him.  They made it that one hard shell that you had to get a pair of special tools to actually  pop it open if you wanted to get inside it.  Jobs' vision is what won.  That's still sort of metaphorically guiding everything.  He wants this sort of closed system that you play inside of and you don't move out of because  it drives him nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's Will Shipley's point in his blog post.  He's the programmer behind Delicious Monster, which is a brilliant Mac programming firm.  He says that they want Apple.  Steve Jobs loves closed systems because you control it entirely end to end.  There is an advantage.  Look at the problems.  Microsoft faces trying to get Windows to work on this completely heterogeneous environment.  Who knows what's running on that machine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's excellent for casual users.  You don't want the iPhone to be too complicated for the casual user.  You want it to do what it does and never break.  That's the thing.  If you put app tap on it and start messing around and using it as a Unix machine, an  extremely powerful machine, it'll break sometimes.  It'll crash.  You have to restart it.  He doesn't want that to happen to the casual user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let the sophisticated users do what they want, which seems what Apple lets people do with  the Apple TV, for instance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As long as he doesn't fight the people who are doing jailbreak, then yeah, I think it's  great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apparently, Apple's been a little bit cagey about this, but we talked about this last  week.  Greg Joswiak-Jaws says, go ahead, put some apps on it.  We don't condone unlocking it, but put some apps on it if you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why don't they just unlock it?  Hey, there's other things to talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know there are.  How about Pirate Bay?  We talked last week about the fact that Media Defender had its email database stolen.  Of course, in the intervening week, all of the pirate sites and the hackers and the DRM  rights, DMM advocates and so forth have been combing through it and have found lots of  smoking guns.  Pirate Bay now says, we've got the proof we've been expecting for a long time.  The big record of movie labels are paying professional hackers, saboteurs and DDoSers  to destroy Pirate Bay's trackers.  He says, while browsing through the email, we identified the companies that are also  active in Sweden and we've reported these incidents to the police.  The Pirate Bay fires back.  The charges are infrastructural sabotage, denial of service attacks, hacking and spamming.  They're reporting Sony, Ubisoft, Activision, Atari, Paramount, Universal, EMI and 20th  Century Fox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they should throw the book at them.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We'll see what happens.  But after all of the prosecutions they've been facing from Swedish police at the behest  of the movie industry, I think it's nice that the Pirate Bay's got a smoking gun and they're  firing back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Throw the book at them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They'll never win.  But it's, I think that's good.  It'll be fun to watch.  Fun to watch.  But it gives Pirate Bay, you know, they seem to enjoy this kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah, they're laughing the whole way to the Hall of Justice.  Timers vs. Swedish police.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That sounds like a great movie for Showtime or Cinemax at 1am.  I would stay up and watch that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does Pirate Bay make any money?  They don't have ads.  I think they're just, how do they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They have ads.  Pirates.  I'm looking at cursor mania ad right now.  Alright, there you go.  They must make some money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  On their blog.  I'm sure they drive a lot of traffic.  According to the Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic, the DRM, copy  protection technologies, violate Canadian privacy laws because they gather IP addresses  and other personal information.  Canada's got a very specific privacy law that prevents that.  I don't know if there'll be any repercussions but I love seeing that.  Throw the book at them.  Throw the book at them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Self-publish it and throw it at them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just don't do it through Lulu.  I think there's a theme here.  Let me see if I can find another throw the book at them.  Did you know that it was One Web Day yesterday?  We didn't celebrate.  Throw the book.  Oh wait.  Did you know that?  This is the second annual One Web Day.  I knew John would enjoy this.  The mission of One Web Day is simple.  To create, maintain, advance, and promote a global day to celebrate online life.  Oh brother.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I choose to celebrate it every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know they've got big names and big players behind this.  They're workshops, speakers all around the world.  I don't know how we missed this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who are these corn balls?  Come on.  Give me some names.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's adorable that there are people out there who still think that the web is  a community as opposed to just everybody.  Or new.  The community of computer users.  Yes.  It's all of us.  We'll teach you how to store recipes on your desktop home computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's being celebrated around the world and in a few cities in the US.  Not a whole lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All the guys at my BBS were enjoying it.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where is it being celebrated?  Do we have any photos?  It's online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tim Berners-Lee made a video just for One Web Day.  You want to hear it?  You can't make a video at the drop of a hat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sir, may I say Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web.  And if I could get the tubes unclogged, I'd play this for you here.  Here it comes, ladies and gentlemen.  Tim, I give you Sir Tim Berners-Lee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hello everybody.  This is Tim Berners-Lee with a message for everybody involved in One Web Day.  Throw the fuck at him.  One Web Day.  I think it's a wonderful idea.  All kinds of wonderful things happened last year and I'm sure...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Even he can't think of anything interesting to say about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, give him the hook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a wonderful idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm actually surprised that it doesn't go like this.  I'm Tim Berners-Lee and I'd like to congratulate everyone from One Web Day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In honor of what the web has become, I'm going to show you a picture of my cat with a lime  on his head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There you go.  I can has cheeseburger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love that lime picture.  I'm in your web enjoying your Web Day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am enjoying your Web Day.  Big security flaw.  Acrobat Reader this time.  Not Microsoft's fault.  Acrobat Reader software can compromise Windows PCs.  Just send him a malicious PDF file.  Windows XP, Windows 2003, Windows Vista is unaffected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hooray.  May I say don't open attachments now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, there you go.  Don't open attachments.  But you know, you don't have to open attachments the way most computers are configured.  If you go to a site with a PDF.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's true if you're using your browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It just opens up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's nasty.  I hate that.  We all hate that.  If you're using Foxit Reader, does it work?  Or do you have to be using Adobe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a good question.  You'd have to use Adobe Reader.  So if you don't have Adobe Reader 8.1 installed, it would be fine.  You could use another program to read your PDF.  So the flaw is with the reader.  And it's at least version 8.1.  He didn't test other versions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can we try to stoke some sort of PDF reader war like there are in the browser wars?  We get the Foxit people against the Adobe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's get Adobe.  Is Foxit free?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's get Adobe out of this business.  I always get, you know, on a Mac you've got preview.  You can read any PDF file.  I always get annoyed that somehow Adobe Acrobat gets its, I guess Photoshop installs it.  It always seems to get installed.  I never want it, but it always seems to get installed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, you know what bugs me even more than that?  No, what John?  Well, let me tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What bugs you John C. Dvorak.org slash blog?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, when you have an older version of Adobe and they want you to ask if you want an upgrade.  So you ask to upgrade at least with the, and it says, oh yeah, here we can upgrade and  you get the Yahoo toolbar.  That pisses me off.  Oh yeah.  And then you can't say no to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know.  I agree with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What are they in bed together?  I mean, what's the deal with the Yahoo?  I don't want the Yahoo toolbar.  Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yahoo's got to be very aggressive about partnerships.  I look at what happened to Flock.  I used to love Flock as a browser, but now it's become the Yahoo browser.  It's kind of unfortunate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm getting a dislike Yahoo over time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is Yahoo worse than Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  As long as they own Flickr, they can never do anything bad for anybody.  I have my sunshine and light for any company that has Flickr on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You got to talk to Thomas Hawk about that.  He's mad about Flickr censorship.  In fact, now Flickr has said you can't post pictures of children smoking cigarettes on  Flickr.  Apparently there's a big category.  There's a big demand for it.  Thomas Hawk, who by the way, I should point out, is the CTO for Zoomer, a Flickr competitor.  But by the way, one of the most amazing photographers I've ever seen.  You're on Pounce, aren't you, Tom?  Yeah.  I subscribe to Thomas Hawk's feeds on Pounce because he puts a new photograph there every  few hours.  It's some of the most beautiful photography I've ever seen.  All of it linked to Zoomer, of course.  He puts a picture up of a kid smoking a cigarette that's a famous picture from the 60s.  In fact, I think it's on an album, Green Dinosaurs, something like that.  It's an album cover.  Waiting for Flickr to get mad at him and take it down.  Flickr apparently decides not to.  I don't know.  Google, 64% of all searches in the US.  My question, who are these other 36%?  What are they using?  MSN?  They're really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're using their ISP's homepage, which is defaulting to something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're using Flock.  Google is up to 64% from this time last year where it was 60%.  Yahoo 23%.  MSN 8%.  Coming on strong around the courthouse turn, it's Ask.com with 3.5%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  You know what?  Ask got...  I think I use MSN search by mistake every once in a while.  How does that happen?  I think it's if I happen to have Internet Explorer open, there's a way where you can  just accidentally come up with an MSN search.  You're like, what?  How did that?  No, that's not what I wanted.  What is this?  What is this MSN?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I actually want to speak in favor of some of the alternatives.  Some of the alternatives are really very good.  What do you like?  Believe it or not, I like Ask.com.  It's not going to be my default search engine, but when I'm looking for a search that kind  of fails a little bit in Google because it's a little bit too vague, I'll just click instead  of using my Google food to try to trim it down a little bit.  I'll go to Ask.com and boom, number three link is what I'm looking for.  Or right there in the sidebar, it says, okay, we think you might be going in one of seven  different directions.  Two of them are forwarded.  We've removed them because you said you don't want to use that.  But here's, you know, it's a much more articulate search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think some people like Ask because they have a data hiding feature too.  You can explicitly say save no search information.  John has thrown his notes away.  I can do that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm disappointed in Google that they, you know, Gmail has been around for years.  Google search has been around for years, but we haven't seen a real change in the user  interface.  I think so.  Don't you use Google most of the time?  It all ended in 1998, my friend.  Nothing good's happened since then.  Not the second, but the first one.  I'm not sure if that's the right word.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Bleh.  Bleh.  Bleh.  Bleh.  Bleh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bleh.  And I basically I said forget it.  Google's got it.  It's got what?  12 and a half million funding.  Google's R&D budget is $2.2 billion.  Do the math.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How are you going to compete against Google?  I mean, I'm not saying Google's a be all end all.  In fact, I think there's some serious concerns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well that's true.  Good point.  I mean, there's room for improvement.  There's room for alternative ideas.  And again, whenever I see a product that hasn't changed in years, I'm thinking that these  are some people who don't care about improvements.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We need a zoom killer.  I think Google is constantly improving.  I'm surprised to hear you say that, Andy.  For instance, two years ago and a year ago, these all these link farms were just polluting  Google's results.  They've cleaned that up completely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  But again, do you do it?  And again, I'm not saying they've never changed anything.  Just today, I was at my mom's house and she wanted to know how many cups were in a pint  or something.  And I'm like, you know, wooden sailing ships were applying the Atlantic the last time that  I, you know, the last time anybody really used this stuff.  But of course, I had my laptop in front of me.  So OK, you Google cups pint, right?  One pint in cups and it answered that too.  OK, cool.  Excellent.  But again, is I'm just asking the question, is this main search page where you enter search  terms and you get one plain list ordered by whatever secret mojo they're using to decide  what's important and what's not?  Is that the end all of the idea of Internet search?  Is the interface or I'm talking about the search box?  No, the results.  I'm talking about the way it organizes its results and the way that presents them to  you.  Ask.com and Yahoo and the rest have some interesting types to it where they're saying, well, are  you interested in the medical version of this?  Are you looking in the geographic version of this?  Oh, and incidentally, if you are interested in the geographic version of it, there are  a bunch of other places in the world that tend to be very, very closely linked to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.  I keep trying these other ones.  You know, I changed my default search in Firefox to Yahoo or Ask.  I do it for a few days and it's always back to Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they've got something that works well presentation wise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, again, it's a good basic search.  I'm just curious to know why they never ever add anything to the basic look of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because the number one result is almost always the result you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh no, that's not for me.  And plus, again, you can say the same thing about Windows, but how many people in this  group think that Windows is the best operating system out there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do.  Tech crunch.  Yeah, but you talk into a far scope.  I'm just kidding.  I'm kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I kid.  I kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're a kidder.  Everybody knows that John C. Dvorak is a Solaris fan.  Tech Crunch 40.  Other stories from that big event in San Francisco this week.  The number one, I guess they won the $50,000 Tech Crunch prize, a site that I fell for  for five minutes and then terrifiedly begged to cancel my account.  Mint.com.  Anybody play with this at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's check it out.  MINT.com.  We are refreshing money management.  They won the Tech Crunch 40, $50,000 prize.  The free automatic online way to manage your money.  So what do you do?  You sign up.  You stay away.  You stay well away.  I was, I don't know what I was thinking.  You know what?  That smooth, minty, fresh web 2.0 interface seduced me.  You enter in your logins to all your financial services.  Oh, I would never do that.  Oh, I did.  And, you know, your bank accounts, your credit cards, and then it creates a nice page of  money on and they promise to help you save money.  All I've ever got was a discover a card.  It'll save you a hundred bucks by, you know, I mean, clearly they're making money on this.  They've got some funding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sure they're very trustworthy people, but I am extremely paranoid about my financial  information.  I would never want to give it to an online company like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know what I was thinking.  And I read the privacy and security and they have, I mean, they're really good about all  that.  They're trustee certified.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And he says, you know, the one thing about all those licenses, those ULAs or whatever  you want to call them, those things that are online, the terms of service, you know, they  all, every one of them says it can be changed at any point without notification.  And already they've got all my information.  Right.  They can, I'm sorry, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I'm just going to say what you're going to say.  So you should probably say it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What I was going to say is that if you have, if you allow that to happen, then it, you  know, like, yeah, you always get the situation, which is the reason you do contracts, by the  way, is that you have somebody who's your best buddy and he's going to do all this stuff  for you.  But what happens when he sells the company to some corrupt guy, which happens all the  time?  These companies are traded like playing cards.  It's like, you know, what's, what can happen after that?  Because they've got all this information and they can change the terms of service at the  drop of a hat until that kind of thing ends.  I wouldn't trust any of these websites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's why, by the way, all of our Twitter agreements are handshake based.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Terms of service can be changed at any moment.  At any moment.  The terms of service are just such a leaky sieve anyway.  Nobody knows if they're really valid or not.  So a company could just go off and start selling your financial information and then you'd  have to find it out in court.  Forget it.  I don't know what I was thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And by the way, the Chronicle picked this up.  This was a huge story.  A lot of people obviously looked at this and said, oh, cool.  And I also should point out that you can do the exact same thing with Quicken or money  on your own computer with your own logins securely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  With an encrypted file on a removable flash drive that you keep in a safe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know why I was.  I don't. I got sucked in by.  Thank you, Mike Arrington.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway, it was the minty cool green, though it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look at it. It's a Web 2.0 seducer.  Look at it. So shiny.  It's like the way it's dressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It has a little bit of a kind of a too slick, a little too, you know, raw, raw.  I'm not I don't like the look of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's probably run by the Motion Picture Association of America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, if anyone wants a good laugh, go to the Dvorak.org slash blog and read my  terms of service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I could just imagine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's legal, by the way.  Oh, you had a lawyer write it.  I took it from a boilerplate.  Yeah.  But I modified it a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Slightly. Google is also.  Now, I don't know if this is a true story or not, because it comes to us from the  Guardian, always a guardian of truth and justice and the British way.  But apparently the British government is thinking of doing a U.S.  style spectrum auction of the 900 megahertz frequencies, just as we are  auctioning off the 700 megahertz frequencies in January.  And according to the Guardian, Google's already looking to bid.  Probably with the same notion.  That's the idea that I would make up if I were writing this story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I mean, how do we know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  According to the Guardian, Google is considering a move into the UK wireless market.  Well, they're laying transatlantic cable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're definitely into the 700 megahertz auction in some way.  They did get.  What would they do with it?  If they're, you know, if they're going after all this bandwidth to get into that,  they're going to organize the world's information.  To make a Google phone, to do Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What would you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there is that Google phone that we think is probably going to come out that HTC has  been working on. That's the big rumor.  Based on and it would be a 700 megahertz or a 900 megahertz phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it could be down the line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, they get into the business of partnering up to make phones and then they  start making devices that run their software on it.  And then they provide you the bandwidth.  I mean, you want to talk about monopolies.  There's a serious monopoly in the offing there.  Yeah.  Yep. And how about this for an idea from Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Premium services.  They don't have anything like that, do they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tiered Internet.  High speed, premium, dedicated services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'd buy it.  Because I trust Google.  I'll give them my bank account number.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This just bothers me sort of fundamentally, because I remember, I remember a day back  in ought 87 when it was actually legal to just tune into cell phone conversations  because that was never illegal.  Yes, it was.  The third party group was affected.  Yes, it was.  You could go into any store and buy them.  And with premium services, you could go to any store and buy them.  And it was perfectly legal.  There was a change made in the mid 90s when cell phone suddenly became popular.  That's when they started locking down the frequencies.  Well, I do remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, go ahead.  But I do remember listing in myself.  Okay, but because...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why does Neac used to love to do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was one of Steve's favorite games.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I had my Bearcat, because I remember specifically, because I had my Bearcat scanner that was  being sold in all 50 states.  And then I needed to upgrade to the next one.  But then that was the time I had to rush out, rush out, rush out and get the phone.  And get the ones with the right serial numbers, because the ones that were manufactured before  a certain date were illegal.  The ones manufactured after had a certain diode added to it.  You'd have to actually mist out by found plants where you could snip the diode using very,  very tiny little pliers and get that band back.  But I mean, there used to be a principle that said that if you're broadcasting something  over the air, then by definition, this must be for the public good.  And of course, there was sort of like loose implementation of that.  But that was always a principle, this idea of saying, well, we're going to give you these  frequencies to Google to basically do whatever they want with it just to Google subscribers.  That just seems kind of nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I would hope they wouldn't do that.  And Google was pretty clear they wanted open access to these frequencies.  They wanted to force wholesaling and so forth in their proposed rules for the US auction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's certainly one of the better ways to fight the tiered internet is for Google to go out  there and just buy up a bunch of bandwidth.  Make your own internet.  Make it available at a competitive price.  Build your own internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's that time of year again, the time of year when the billionaires fall from the trees.  The Forbes richest people in America list is out.  And my fingers crossed.  You got to have one point three billion to get on the list.  What's the comic books last year?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Farther behind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Number one, once again, Bill Gates.  But he has 59 billion.  He'd have more 102 billion if he hadn't given all that money away to charity.  Charity.  Fool.  Dope.  Fool.  Anyway, 59 billion still makes him the richest man in the world right ahead of Warren Buffett,  who's got 52 billion dollars.  Buffet.  Sheldon Adelson is number one.  Yeah, isn't that amazing?  How did he get, how did Shelley get up there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  He sure made his move.  He did some great business in those casinos and he's got a big, big one opening up in  Macau or I guess it's open already.  I'm not sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sheldon was famous for starting for Comdex.  In fact, he was the heart and soul of Comdex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He was a sharper operator than any of us imagined.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He sold Comdex to Softbank.  There was a good move in 95 for $862 million.  Wow.  And what's it worth now?  Nothing.  That doesn't exist.  Doesn't exist.  He bought the Sands with the money for 128 million, demolished it, built the Venetian,  and it's been nothing but big bucks ever since.  28 billion for Shelley.  He's too old to enjoy it though.  Larry Ellison, number four, the king of Oracle.  So, so far its tech is in there.  Sergi Bryn, the Google guy, is number five.  $18.5 billion, his partner Larry Page, same amount of money.  All the good that does us.  Have you been following this brouhaha about them parking the corporate jet at NASA?  Oh yeah, that, the three jets, they have three jets.  The party jet though is the one where the 767?  The big one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have a big 767 and they got a couple of either Challengers or G5s or whatever the  heck they got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And NASA, the NASA, it was right across the street, well across the highway from Google,  they've got that.  Yeah, you can walk over.  You can walk over to your jet.  Saves energy.  They've never ever leased that space to anybody.  $1.8 million a year they gave it to Google and I guess they said in return for consideration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well Google supposedly is going to put some instruments on their plane to do some analysis  of, you know, when they're flying around, they can download some data that NASA can  use for whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They'll put weather balloons on the segues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the big deal?  I don't understand why people were so, this is such a gossipy story.  They're incensed about it.  So it's an airstrip and they have a plane and they wanted to park there and they said  yes, what's the big deal?  Why do I care?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they're paying $1.8 million to the guy.  Yeah, they're paying for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll tell you what the deal is.  It's never been allowed by anybody else to use it.  No one has been allowed to use it.  People have been begging to use this thing because it's right in the middle of Mountain  View and the public around it doesn't want it to turn into a commercial operation.  So they've said no to everybody but now all of a sudden Google shows up and they say yes  to them.  That's the reason it's a scandal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No one says no to Google.  And the irony is that Forbes is also declaring that these guys are the greenest billionaires.  They're very green because they drive Priuses.  They don't mention how much fuel the 767 has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The party jet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to drive a Prius over to my party jet.  Is that a hybrid party jet?  I don't think so.  They're pumping millions into the development of a hybrid car that can go 100 miles on a  gallon of fuel.  They're going to fly the party jet right over there.  Let's see, other tech billionaires.  There's a whole bunch of them on the list.  Michael Dell is in the top 10.  Good for him.  He's number eight.  Where's Paul Allen?  Paul Allen used to be in the top, was number three, wasn't he?  He's not even in the top 10 now.  Yeah, he used to be.  He used to be right up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What happened?  He sold Tech TV.  Yeah, that's what killed him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, you think he's got $16.8 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You'd think he'd get his teeth whitened.  Number 11 on the list, Paul Allen.  That's getting, that's a little ad hominem.  Bubbling under.  He's bubbling under.  He was number three.  His fortune, his fortune since he sold Tech TV is down 53%.  Gates, it used to be what Gates, Ellison and Allen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  All three at the top.  Yeah.  No, I think and then Berkshire Hathaway kind of zipped in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Hathaway.  Yeah.  Anyone who owns his own space fleet, I'm not willing to make fun of him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think he's doing something right in his life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think in terms of, you know, your actual life experience, the difference between having  36 billion and 16 billion is probably negligible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's kind of like, isn't it usual?  Anybody in this conversation, were you the valedictor in your high school?  No.  Good.  Okay.  Because in my experience, and this is, I've discussed this with other people.  Usually the difference between being number one in your class and say number 10 to 15 in your class in terms of what college you get into is a negligible thing.  But there are some people who cannot live unless they get that number one spot.  That's what it's like for people who pay attention to this billionaire's list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.  It makes a difference if you're down 53% in your personal wealth.  600 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, my robots will have to be made out of gold instead of diamond.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I might confess to a small bit of Schadenfreude in this at all.  I mean, it's not, it's just a little bitter.  It's not the list.  It's Paul Allen.  That's I'll tell you the truth.  The Walton family occupies 73 of the top 100.  Wow.  Well, I don't know what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, the funny story about Paul Allen since we're on the topic is, you know, he did own Tech TV for a while and he's pretty much the one who shut it down or sold it off.  During the era of Tech TV, we had one show that was the absolute, even though I think screen service was a good show, but the absolute slickest show we had, I think, was Internet Tonight.  Absolutely.  Which was extremely well produced.  I worked on it once and it's like, wow, this is like being on a big network.  Yeah, they're actually television people.  Paul, out of the blue, regardless of how many people were watching it or were not watching it, took a dislike to the show, I think because he disliked one of the hosts and just killed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, it's funny, I was told always that he hated the screensavers too, but the ratings for the screensavers were, it was the only, it was the best ratings on the network, so he could never kill that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't see why he'd hate the screensavers.  He hated that show, I was told.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'm not sure he liked any of the shows, frankly.  I mean, he wanted a Mac show and he wanted like 14 hours of news programming.  It was the only thing I ever heard he wanted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And of course, one week after he started the 14 hours of news programming, he decided he didn't want it, which that's another story for another day.  Yeah.  Let's not, I will go back down memory lane, but it's kind of, I mean, it's just people are still interested in it.  Twitter wouldn't exist if Tech TV hadn't existed, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People keep touting this or that as the next Tech TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, you know what, maybe the next Tech TV, as I look at what they're doing over at Revision 3, I have to say almost everybody's over there except you and me, Tom.  I know.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm not over there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, John's not over there either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John, you and me and Tom, but look they've got.  And Roger Chang.  And Roger Chang and Robert Heron, they're kind of holdouts, they're still at ZD.  But now they've just announced there's going to be a new show called Techzilla, that's Patrick Norton's new show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's just a DLTV show, come on.  No, no, wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's co-host Jessica Corbin.  And if you listen to the description, it's the screensavers that could take calls on the show.  They're going to have, I mean.  Oh, so they stole your show.  They didn't steal it.  They borrowed it.  Anyway, I'm not bitter.  I'm glad, I'm happy, I'm thrilled.  I think it's wonderful.  Why would you be happy and thrilled?  Because they're, you're goading me now, John.  It won't work.  Because they're trying to rebuild Tech TV.  It's very clear what Revision 3 is up to.  They're even building a studio that's capable of live broadcasting.  They're building a big TV studio.  They're spending that venture funding.  It's pretty clear what they're up to.  How much money do they get in venture funding?  What was it?  Seven million or eight million?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Seven or eight million, yeah.  But I think one of the interesting things too is that.  Greylock.  I don't know where it came from.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Greylock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the people who invested in DIG as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  Well, I think one of the interesting things is that there is room now with the way things are to do.  You bet.  A lot more than Tech TV ever could have done with technology programming in all kinds of different ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and there's frankly no room on network television for tech programming.  It's just dead.  They don't want it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nobody wants that anymore.  Revision 3 is one way of doing it.  CNET's one way of doing it.  Twitch's one way of doing it.  ZD is doing it in similar ways.  I mean, and there's room.  There's people with the appetite to watch it.  And because it's on the internet, it's a niche market.  And you can actually advertise it a little easier.  So the technology has gone past what Tech TV ever was.  And you can have it widely spread from a lot of different people in a lot of different ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, what did Tech TV charge for a commercial?  Does anybody know?  I don't know.  Wasn't much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There wasn't much and they didn't know what they were doing.  I have another story if you want to hear it.  Yes.  So I go to New York where they have their head sales office and someone says to me,  Oh, you got to meet this woman.  She's the head of sales of the whole operation.  And I forgot what her name was.  But anyway, she wasn't there.  So I started to leave and she goes by me and I say, Oh, you must be so and so.  And she says, Yes, I am.  And who are you?  And I said, Well, I'm John Dvorak.  And she's, Oh, that's interesting.  What do you do?  Oh, dear.  And I said, I work at Tech TV.  Oh, then she's pausing and goes, doing what?  And I said, I have a daily show that's been on for two and a half years.  And she skulks off.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Must have forgotten that.  She probably knew that but forgot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How about maybe these idiots that were working there?  How about if they maybe watch the network?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They didn't know televisions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I would be willing to bet though that advertising dollar wise CNET, DLTV,  Revision 3 and certainly Twitter make 10 times more money per spot than Tech TV ever did.  You talk about CPMs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sure.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, not even you don't even have to talk about raw numbers because we have a larger audience than Tech TV ever had.  Yeah, there's more reach.  There's more reach.  In fact, unfortunately, we don't count international listeners on Twitter because all the agencies are US only.  So we don't get monetized for that.  But that's one thing Tech TV never had was an international audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's not, no, there was Tech TV International was actually the only profitable arm of business.  Oh really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's because they sold shows to networks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They sold shows and they also had networks.  They had a whole network in China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What am I saying?  Of course, Tech TV Canada is where I work now.  Which is still around.  It was profitable and it's still profitable.  Yeah, that's a good point.  So I take that back.  But I think we do have a larger, more than 20% of our audience is outside the US.  For Twitter anyway, and I think that's probably true for most podcasts.  Anyway, let me take a break and to mention audible.com.  They're actually launching something pretty exciting and I want to talk about it because we are they're launching on the 25th.  But we are the first to talk about it on this show.  And it is it is pretty exciting.  You know that audible.com is a sponsor of the Twitter network.  A U D I B L E dot com slash twit.  You can subscribe to audible and get a coupon for a free book.  Credit towards a free book.  No obligation.  You don't have to stick around.  But now there's something else you might want to do at audible.  There's an event coming up.  It's going to start on the 25th.  But if you go to audible.com slash twit now, you can download the first chapter.  I think this is kind of an interesting audible.  This is the first time audible's done a book just for audible.  It's called the Chopin manuscript.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a Chopin manuscript in here.  It's believed to be part of a stash.  The Nazis squirreled away in a church in Kosovo.  Believed.  It's a forgery.  It's not in Chopin's hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's been folded, mistreated and 15 thriller writers are going to collaborate on this one chapter after another.  You just heard Alfred Molina, who's the narrator, is one of the one of the best actors at audible.com.  And they're going to give you a free chapter.  Jeffrey Dever wrote the first chapter.  All you got to do is go to audible.com slash twit to claim your chapter.  And I think this is actually a very exciting promotion that we are really thrilled to be a part of.  Because even if you've already signed up and you're already a subscriber, you can get a copy of that chapter now for free.  Just audible.com slash twit is the place to go.  We do thank audible for their support.  I'm going to be listening to some really some of the biggest names.  Jeffrey Dever, David Huston, James Grady.  It's kind of an intro.  I don't know how it's going to work.  They're each writing a different chapter, one after the other.  It's kind of an interesting collaboration.  And then Dever starts it, but Dever gets to write the last two chapters.  I guess he gets to he gets to wrap it all up.  The Chopin manuscript.  They call it the most diabolical game of pass it on ever conceived with today's top thriller writers picking up the story where another one left off.  Audible.com slash twit.  We thank them for their support.  See, Tom, you could have done that with boiling point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They just started the first chapters are passing it around.  Yeah.  Maybe I'll do that with John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's an interesting way to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You want to take chapter two?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no problem.  Let's do it.  I need 10 other guys.  Fun.  What you imagine that most of the book would be you trying to make up for somebody else's screw up and what you think it should be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But yeah, and us trying to turn it up for the person you pass it on to like, let's see him write their way out of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to do that.  But the other one was that you follow up and you go, but it was just a dream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then you got out of the shower.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See, now that's you have to cooperate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Really interesting TV show we just saw.  But now let's take a look at this brand new case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have to cooperate.  You can't be fighting each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Writers cooperate.  That's an interesting concept.  Let me write that down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is.  It's an interesting idea.  You know, I'm looking forward to listening to it anyway.  And it's a chapter by chapter.  You can listen for free audible dot com slash tweet.  You had a book that you wanted to talk about to Andy.  I don't want to co-opt your book recommendation.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I tend to.  I mean, I'm a big fan of this sort of stuff, so I tend to recommend lots of stuff.  I don't want to dominate everything.  I did have a book picked out for the last time.  I didn't get to do.  Tell us what's fun.  Which is by Ellis Peters.  It's a mystery series featuring a Benedictine monk in medieval times.  Oh, Brother Catephel.  Oh, yeah, that's wonderful.  It's one of those premises that as soon as I heard about it and I heard about it through a promo on PBS for a mystery series actually did based on the books, it was oh, my God, that's so totally a mystery I could get into.  You think about how they would investigate crimes in medieval times, especially what if a religious man were investigating a murder or theft case.  All kinds of malfeasance that's taking place during a time of great civil war.  Brother Catephel came to the order, became a monk in his 40s after a whole career of being a soldier, fighting wars throughout Europe and the Middle East.  As he's fond of saying, he came late when called, but he was indeed called.  So but for that reason, the other monks in the order don't really trust him that much as much as they would someone who grew up, who was a man of the cloth to begin with.  But nonetheless, he has knowledge of the outside world and what people are really, really like.  He also has knowledge of science and medicine that a cloistered monk really doesn't have.  And so partly at their behest and partly on his own, he winds up being the person they go to to figure out, well, look, all these sacred relics were stolen out of the abbey and there's a dead guy on the front lawn.  Okay, let's call in Catephel and using just the techniques that would be available to him at that time, being not just a man of science, but also a man of faith.  It really is interesting to see how just to see just to see how you could you could have a character even behave in that sort of situation, particularly in this day and age when every murder is about, okay, let's bring out the green lasers and some and some weird lighting.  Fourteen more computers.  Oh, are we going to think about like the sort of personality?  Oh, we need more green lasers.  That'll solve the problem.  More green lasers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've actually never heard that dialogue, but did you ever read Umberto Echos?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Name of the Rose.  Similar idea.  Mystery Monk 1327.  I love that book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Excellent.  So we have any more tech news?  Yeah, we have lots more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just I just we love talking about books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can't help it on audible.com, which is recorded as a system of ones and zeros.  John also known as binary.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This, by the way, is also available on audible.com read by Theodore Bacal, which must be great.  I'd have to listen to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I also want to the greatest Colombo murders ever.  Speaking of murder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Colombo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One of the greatest.  Theodore Bacal was one of the bad guys.  Oh, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I IQ murder case.  One of the best six episodes of Colombo ever.  Oh, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there you go.  He's the king of trivia there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I wish you'd do a Sulu voice instead.  By the way, I gave you the wrong address.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's audible.com slash twit.  That's the free book offer offer author offer.  But you can all if you want to get the free chapter, it's audible.com slash free chapter audible.com slash free chapter.  And that's teach people to stop listening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There you go.  And yeah, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you can download it, which others can listen to it streaming, but it's only at that URL.  And it's only being mentioned on the twit podcast.  So I guess they're probably doing this to see if we're effective audible.com slash twit.  It's only effective audible.com slash free chapter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think more if we want to get back to the news, we have to get to the story about breast is repressed on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, we actually did we talk about that last week?  No, we talked about it on one of the show.  I do too many shows now.  It's a woman.  She's a she's a lactivist.  You know what a lactivist is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a anti formula person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, she's a lactation activist.  I think we did talk about this last week.  And you have a baby and there's a repriezing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a picture of her rising as it were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Picture of her breastfeeding.  You can't see anything.  But for some reason, Facebook decided to pull that picture off.  Now, this actually reminds me of the Thomas Hawke story as well.  These are private sites.  It's not censorship when a private site says, look, we don't want that kind of picture on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're allowed to do that.  Flickr is not a public resource, nor is Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're taking the side of the sensors.  Yes.  You're taking the side of the sensors.  Yes.  Come on, Andy, get him.  Leo, I guess that didn't go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, no, I'm just I'm I'm just saying that he's swinging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's getting his cricket bat and he's just winding it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's like, you know, as more time goes by on the Internet, I realize that it just just like getting getting a dial up connection is always that first screech before the actual data comes in.  And that's always been the case when these controversies arise.  I agree.  There are people who want to complain because, oh, well, I'm going to I'm I'm the champion, the standard fair truth and justice.  And I'm going to stick it to these corporate behemoths.  And then a week later, OK, let's thank you.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I guess the guys, the guys, the guys who want to say, don't tase me, bro.  I'm being tased now.  YouTube dot slash dot one one four eight.  Everybody is going to be seeing this on Flickr, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then a week later, you find out what it's really about.  Then you find out that both sides actually had something rational and reasonable to say.  I mean, on the one side, yeah, Flickr is a private concern, but also they have sort of a covenant with their users to at least give the appearance of being an open forum for people to post anything they want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, what they do with these what they do with these forbidden pictures is I think they move them to an area of maybe I'm wrong.  I don't think they delete them.  I think they move them to an area of, you know, possibly offensive.  They flag them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I was hoping for a better response than that.  Tom, go get him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The question is not about censorship.  The question is about, you know, what do they have?  They have the right to do whatever they want.  We don't have we don't have to keep going to their site and using their service.  So it's all about, you know, is this something we want to put up with?  And from the beginning of the first time I ever deleted someone's post from my own message board in 1996 and they claim censorship, I've hated this idea of like, no, it's the Internet.  Everything is free.  It's like, no, it's my site.  I can delete you if I want.  But you don't have to come to my site.  And that's the thing with Facebook.  If this really upsets you, then don't go there anymore.  Take your account away.  Go to Lacksivist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just the other day I was designing the page of my blog that people will see when they're posting stuff when they're posting responses.  And the first thing I did was design a logo that said, remember, here on the blank blank dot com, the First Amendment only applies to me.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See, he's not going to beat me, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  None of them are.  You got a bunch.  You got a bunch of yes, been working for you tonight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The smiley face turned 25 this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hate the smiley face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, it's it's there's there's a it's up for debate.  We're not absolutely sure this story is true.  The professor claims it.  This guy claimed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, to his credit, Scott Fallman, who's a professor at CMU, has the posting where he proposed it.  He says, I've never seen any hard evidence that it was in use before the post.  I've never run in anybody who claims to invent it before I did, but it's always possible, I'm quoting him, that someone else had the same idea.  It is a simple and obvious idea after all.  This is we're talking about the sideways smiley face, not the happy face that started in the 70s, but the colon dash right paren.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but his original one was a colon.  Yeah, right.  Colon dash right paren, which is deteriorated to just colon paren.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't like that because that looks like it's a squished happy face.  Why do people do that?  That's squished.  I do. It's what I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's easier.  Save bandwidth, exactly.  Save bandwidth.  Yep, exactly. Andy's right.  You save 30%, over 30% of bandwidth by taking that dash out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you're using the dash, you're costing the company you work for money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's like the time when Iron Man had a nose molded into his mask. It just didn't look right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is always a comic book reference. I just got to point that out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sometimes it's a comic book reference, sometimes it's relevant, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The smiley face, though, doesn't have a nose.  The original 70s smiley face. Maybe it's more accurate not to put the nose.  It just seems like they're smooshed together.  Do any of you use the raspberry face where you do the colon dash or no dash p?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've tried very hard throughout my entire lifetime never to use emoticons.  You don't use any?  I can't say I've never used one because I have.  You have to use it.  Now it's time for my emoticon lecture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm really trying not to.  Oh good, I'll be back in five minutes.  It's not that long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's hear it.  Emoticons serve a useful purpose.  I remember when they first appeared on the scene probably because of this guy and some others.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know, you don't have emotions in a written communication, is that it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, there's all these writers like yourself and all these professors.  You should be able to express yourself without using stupid symbols.  The fact of the matter is the email and electronic communication has some other effect on people.  They always take offense to things so easily that you needed to come up with some new model.  This model has got emoticons in it so I don't have a problem with them.  I actually use it for that reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It seems to be so lame to say, but if you're offended, I put a colon and a closed parenthesis.  Not so much that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's some language that can be ambiguous if you don't have gestures associated with it.  I do use them sometimes, but you always do that last read of an email before you click send.  You're like, oh god, that could really set the world on coating gasoline and strike a match if they don't think I'm being serious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's true if you're a good writer, though.  You could craft it subtly to convey the exact nuance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Read your email in a British accent out loud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm so sorry, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then fix it.  It works every time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do believe you are an ignorant slut.  You know, I have to confess to using it.  It's a form of laziness because it's a way of saying, you know, this is meant in jest.  No, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a form of efficiency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Efficiency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why not just put LOL or ha or he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I don't do LOL.  I do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dvorak, you will put ROTFL in an email?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, not necessarily ROTFL because I've never because I will only put the truth.  So I actually have to be rolling on the floor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So many people are lying when they write ROTFL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This speaks to Palo Alto with a single lamp looking for an honest man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I believe that most people are indeed lying when they put ROTFL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm 100% behind you there, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Couple of quick stories.  A recent study says video games do in fact hurt your GPA.  First year students whose roommates brought a video game player to college studied 40 minutes less each day on average, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research.  That translates into first semester grades that were .241 points lower on the 4.0 grade scale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know how important those 40 minutes were going to be?  That was the 40 minutes I was going to turn it all around for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You shouldn't have brought a deck of cards to college when I was a kid.  How many people wasted away their time playing bridge poker and hearts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was going to say, did they take the games away and see if the GPA went back up?  Or is this just the type of people who bring games or the type of people who weren't going to study anyway?  Losers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're right, Tom.  They're all losers.  I had a double blind study.  It's a bogus report just to ruin the gamers.  I'm not buying it.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, then you probably don't like the idea of who is this?  The guy Thomas Thompson?  Not Fred Thompson, the other guy in Florida who wants to keep Halo 3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jack Thompson?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jack Thompson wants to keep Halo 3 out of Florida.  What kind of an idiot is he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's a crackpot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I understand some shaggy haired outsider with a Volkswagen just moved into town.  He's going to have a town meeting against this.  He's bought a warehouse just outside the town limits where they're going to play a tournament network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jack Thompson thinks that he's being made fun of in GTA.  GTA, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He says there's a Second Amendment lawyer who looks just like me.  He wishes.  Also, according to another study, text messages boosts young voter turnout.  Researchers ran their test in the November 2006 election.  Text reminders were sent to 4,000 young voters.  And apparently, the study showed that voter turnout rates rose by 4% among the young voters who were texted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not even statistically valid, is it, at that level?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  Although it does make sense.  I mean, qualitatively.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, send them a text message and vote.  And by the way, it's a lot cheaper than door-to-door canvassing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm sure this wasn't American Idol voting, because I could see how that would really have dramatic effect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because you're already right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know Obama and Clinton are both going to use text messaging.  You know they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If we could actually vote via text message for the president, I think voter turnout would be huge.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Press 1 to vote for Clinton.  Press 2 for Obama.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I am C-crest talking to Hillary Clinton and John McCain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ladies and gentlemen, I think we've done enough for one day.  I want to thank our guests, our panelists.  I should say they're really not guests.  They're paid to play.  Tom Merritt, the author of Boiling Point, available at Amazon.com right now.  And who cares how much Lulu gets?  Tom gets some of it.  You can also catch him on CNET TV at CNETtv.com and every single weekday on Buzz Out Loud with the wonderful Molly Wood.  So you're coming Tuesday?  I'm coming Tuesday.  All right.  Be there Tuesday 10 a.m.  That's right.  I won't miss it.  And I just hope you have some better news than I had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Boy, there's not much news this week, was there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, it's funny.  Tech news really is cyclic.  And there are a lot of weeks there's no good news.  Don't you find that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, definitely.  There are weeks where you're just like, wow, maybe I'll just read the user-friendly cartoons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I'd love to take those weeks off.  But our audience demands that we produce new podcasts every week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, there was plenty of news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And there was good.  I think this actually was a good a good week for us.  But that's just because we had such a great panel.  Andy and Natko also.  Thank you so much.  His new site will be coming soon to a browser near you.  But meanwhile, CWOB.com and of course, the Chicago Sun-Times.  And we see him every week on Mac Break Weekly on Tuesdays.  Yes, quite awesome.  Thank you, Andrew.  And finally, last but not least, the star of our show, Mr. John C. Dvorak, who played not one sound effect during the entire show.  I'm stunned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The man of the future is the man who controls the infinite strength of the spirit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There you go.  Dvorak.org slash blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
