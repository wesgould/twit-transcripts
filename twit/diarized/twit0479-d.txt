It was just kind of  really basic couldn't read into  it. Did you have to. Well we knew  it was an iPhone right you're  right. But this time and even  though I would say most people  say oh yeah this is their  opportunity to do this. I think  they're going to say oh yeah this  is their October. I pad event  their invitation. Was very  cryptic. And of course this is  great marketing because what

Start time: 355.00
End time: 356.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  can't. I'm in with Patrick. Oh yeah.

Start time: 357.74
End time: 376.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's been way too long. It says that  right there. Yeah. That is that is a  challenge. They're throwing down the  gauntlet. Saying oh what do you  think. So look. Obviously Neely  knows. So we'll just ask Neely. What  is that. I think we're going to we're

Start time: 377.00
End time: 497.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  going to see a lot of emphasis on the  Mac at this one. Really not the iPad. I  think the iPad of course but the iPad  is on a yearly cadence. So you will I  think there will almost certainly be a  new iPad. I think it will get bigger. I  think that they they have to do  something with the iPad to goose  growth. The iPad sales have been flat  for a long time. So I think a bigger  iPad that's more enterprise gear that  can do multiple apps. All that stuff  will happen. I think that's it's pretty  expected. But I think way too long is  actually reference to the Macintosh. I  think Yosemite is about to come out. I  think that it'll almost certainly happen  at this event. And then you will see  here here are my guesses and they are  just guesses. I think a retina iMac and  a retina MacBook Air probably the 12  inch size. And I think those will be  actually enormous sellers. And I think  the fact that those two products will be  enormous sellers against the incredible  growth of the iPhone is the reason that  the iPad needs to be changed in some way  because the sales have been flat. I think  people who have iPads know what they can  do. They're they're understood products.  There's nothing surprising about a new  iPad for people. Whereas with a new Mac  it's time to upgrade a Mac. You know what  you'll get out of a new Mac. The way that  you don't necessarily know what you'll  get out of upgrading from an iPad 4.0  to an iPad Air besides it's thinner. And  so I think you'll see new Macs will be  exciting. People will be excited about  them. They'll buy a lot of them. But the  real question mark is how do you  differentiate the iPad in a world where  you are selling lots and lots of MacBook  Airs. Apple's now the fifth biggest PC  vendor in the world according to IDC. And  you are selling a gigantic iPhone that I  have and I love the 6 Plus which is  really creeping in on that iPad mini  territory. So that the question mark is  really I think it's been way too long  is all about the Mac. They're going to  come at the Mac with a lot of innovation  a lot of I mean they are Apple's very  excited about how well the Mac is doing  right now. So I think they're going to come at that  really hard. The question is really the  iPad and how do you start differentiating

Start time: 498.12
End time: 505.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  the iPad against these other two products.  I think the main thing they're going to do  here is they're going to roll out some  touchscreen iMac touchscreen Air. That's

Start time: 506.08
End time: 513.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the mushy thing. I have to say until you  said that I didn't I didn't I thought it  was an Apple. Foolish me. It does know  when you say it it looks a little bit like

Start time: 514.00
End time: 517.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  something squishing in. I think I make a big deal  out of it as though they invented it and the next thing you know

Start time: 518.00
End time: 521.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  they're going to sell a lot. Alright I'm going to tell you all  what it is but first let's have Patrick guess.

Start time: 522.91
End time: 531.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm down with it. I want to see the  iPad in the form factor that the iPhone  6's are in. I want to see  anything that looks like a decent  performance improvement and more memory on the

Start time: 532.61
End time: 546.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mac. Especially the smaller 6's.  It's really elegant.  And they will do touch ID right?  They'll do a fingerprint reader. Yes because  Apple. I guess. Another thing they'll talk  a lot about I think on this event is Apple Pay  which rolls out later this month. I was going to say well they do

Start time: 546.18
End time: 551.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Apple Pay on the on the tablets.  Is that part of the differentiator? You can't do it  without the touch ID right? Yeah. So

Start time: 552.14
End time: 566.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Dieter Bohn the executive editor of  The Verge he also recently got a promotion.  His big theory is that  the iPad will have Apple Pay  but as a register. So you  like small businesses  use Apple Pay as their cash register. Yeah because you're not

Start time: 566.08
End time: 570.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  going to carry around an iPad like you would an iPhone  and try to pace for stuff with that. That doesn't make sense. I mean people

Start time: 570.10
End time: 591.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  do they use them as cameras.  I know. But I think  that's really interesting. I think the idea of the  iPad going into many many  more enterprise environments is really  interesting. But John I absolutely  do not think they will put touch on a Mac  for a long time. That is  so far away from  what they have said previously.  I'd agree with you Neelai but

Start time: 592.00
End time: 595.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  they also said they'd never do a 5.5 inch  phone. Who would have thought? Yeah.

Start time: 596.00
End time: 611.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They've said a lot of things that they wouldn't do but I think  this one actually makes sense because as soon as you  I don't want touch like  this. I don't know. Yeah.  I don't see that coming. I'm with Neelai on that one.  I can completely see them putting Apple Pay on the tablets  because I see people carrying their tablets everywhere.  Right. And ignoring their phones. And I like

Start time: 612.12
End time: 632.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  as a point of sale system I think that's a good idea.  One of the advantages Apple Pay has  is privacy and this is what Apple is really  now doubling down on.  This is their distinguishing factor.  Tim Cook has said oh Google doesn't  care about you.  I know but I think they're conveniently  ignoring the fappening and they're  just going moving ahead. What else are they going to do?

Start time: 632.02
End time: 651.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well okay but that's part of my issue with  the iPad moving in enterprise  spaces is because they completely walked  away from all of their enterprise services  and all of their enterprise back end stuff  and anybody who was running that is still pissed off  about that. Right. They walked  away from their service and their server  their service on all the enterprise stuff  was atrocious in the last couple years.

Start time: 652.57
End time: 729.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well I think we will see new iPads.  I think they'll have Touch ID. There may be a 12.9 inch  iPad and iPad Pro. That's been  strongly rumored.  I think Apple Pay and  Yosemite, the next version of OS X  both will feature prominently.  But I think you've all missed the thing  that they're talking about and I say it's way too long.  The Apple TV. It has  been. In fact if you look at MacRumors Buyer Guide  where they tell you how long it's been  since there's an update. It's been 949  days since the last Apple TV.  That's the longest any Apple product.  What are they going to add to it? HomeKit.  And  I believe apps. Now they may not do apps  right away but I think apps are  the thing I've always thought they should add to Apple TV  as they get closer and closer  to this Apple TV  being a central  more than just a television set. Right now  when the Apple TV came out as Steve Jobs famously  said it was a hobby. And it really  was just a way to put internet access in a TV.  Every TV has internet access now. So that's  not a product anymore. Right. But  Apple TV could be a gateway  into the living room for a lot of  Apple stuff including I think  HomeKit. HomeKit is their home automation solution.  That's just the right size  for a base unit  that does home automation. It's already internet  connected. I'm going to  go out on a limb and by the way I'm always wrong so  it's a safe bet to bet against me.

Start time: 731.37
End time: 788.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I will  absolutely bet against you Leo. Really? You don't think  so? Here's why.  I think the reason they made the watch is because they couldn't  figure out the TV.  I think basically  the world's ultimate troll  the number one troll in the world  today is Steve Jobs telling Walter  Isaacson that he figured out  the TV. That he'd cracked it.  You might be right. And he trolled  literally he trolled the world's most  valuable company into chasing their  tail around the TV.  They couldn't do it. And their  issue was that  they needed to find another growth market.  And so the iPhone is  going to grow really fast. The iPad is  stalling out. And investors and  the public were constantly asking where's your  next growth market coming from? And  they chased after TV a lot. I've  heard about it forever. They're trying  to get the deals. Because to make a TV is not  hard. Samsung will tell you that it's not  hard. Vizio will tell you that it's not hard.  I don't mean to say they're going to make a television set.

Start time: 788.55
End time: 793.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No you're saying they're going to  uplay the little box. But they're going to make Apple TV much  more capable. But this other thing that you're talking

Start time: 794.22
End time: 888.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  about which is basically you're saying  home kit. Home automation.  But what the rest of the industry will tell you is called  the Internet of Things. Right. Because what  you're really talking about is connected light switches.  And a smart microwave. And  door locks. Apple can't make  that stuff right now.  That market is totally nascent. So for them  to bet that the Apple TV  will be what August connects  to. And Nest connects to. And  Schlage locks  connect to. And Lutron  who has a massive business  in smart light switches connects  to. Is they  have to go get those deals. And the problem  with the TV and the reason I bring up the  TV in the context of deals is  everything about connected  home and smart TV  completely depends on how  well Eddie Kue and Tim  Cook can go get deals.  That means you'll hear about it.  You'll definitely hear about Tim Cook flying  to every lock manufacturer and being like  hey be our partner for the smart home.  And we haven't heard that have we?  And then you see the watch and the watch has  no partners. Right. Except for the  pre-existing maybe iOS app partners  who Apple can say hey  come build an app for a watch. Don't tell anybody because if  you screw us we'll kick you out of the app store.  So you see where Apple's  using their leverage. And so that  smart home piece is really interesting.  It will happen someday.  But I guarantee you that the next version of the Apple  TV will be very simple. And it will continue  being simple until Apple  figures out how it can get leverage and  use leverage to acquire the deals  it needs across all of the devices it  needs to control. Right. You know I don't understand why

Start time: 888.00
End time: 896.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have to put out with HealthKit they're doing the same thing as  with HomeKit which is making an  end point but not making any of the  peripherals and not reaching out

Start time: 896.08
End time: 921.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  to make the peripherals. I don't understand why Apple  doesn't do a real TV. They got  those stores everywhere.  There's all kinds of room to put up a real TV  and sell it to people for a slight premium.  And if you've been to the Costco recently  they've rolled in three or four models  of four  4K TVs  and they're gorgeous. The LG one is  really dynamite. And they're running  4K content on it.  And 4K content is really pretty.

Start time: 922.00
End time: 925.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way that would be something an Apple TV  could deliver is 4K.

Start time: 926.06
End time: 928.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah I think a lot of people would buy one.

Start time: 928.22
End time: 932.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's no 4K content.  There is no margin on televisions right now.

Start time: 932.42
End time: 947.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There is 4K content because all movies  are 4K now. But nobody's been  figuring out a way to deliver it. In fact  there's a new Blu-ray player that will do 4K  that's coming someday soon. But that's physical  media. If you could master  4K content delivery  and I think nobody better positioned to do that.

Start time: 948.00
End time: 956.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  YouTube has been doing 4K content delivery.  Netflix can do 4K content delivery.  Everything looks crappy on YouTube. That's a YouTube issue.  But one of the things Apple does is they have their own

Start time: 956.14
End time: 959.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  CDNs. Even when you're using Netflix  on an Apple TV you're actually getting it from Apple.

Start time: 960.02
End time: 985.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you're talking about even if you have extraordinary  compression you're still talking about something that can easily  be 3 to 4 times the size of a 1080p  file. So it's expensive.  It's expensive online delivery. It's huge  streaming. It's basically huge sustained  streams nobody wants to pay with. But more importantly  even if they do an extraordinary  job it's going to be enormously difficult for Apple  to pull out any kind of margin that makes  it justify and go into the television market.  Nobody's making any money on televisions right now.  They need to put something in these stores.

Start time: 986.02
End time: 987.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact it's bankrupting these companies. It's bankrupting Samsung.

Start time: 988.16
End time: 991.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Samsung's damn near out of business I understand.  I don't know about that.

Start time: 993.21
End time: 999.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Here I'll guarantee you  that Apple doesn't make a TV for the next decade.  Yeah I think a TV set I think you're right.  By the way Mark Gurman would agree with you

Start time: 1000.28
End time: 1043.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Neelay Patel. He tweeted  so the Apple logo, this is interesting, I didn't  realize this, but that Apple logo from the  invite if you look at it is just  a clip from the 30th, the  Mac 30th anniversary  logo.  Yeah Johnny Ad's getting lazy.  These don't happen by accident.  So I think maybe  Mark Gurman who's very knowledgeable from 9 to 5  Mac and he's about 12 years old but I'm not  going to hold that against him.  He's a smart kid. He is amazing.  So he agrees with you Neelay.  He thinks new Macs. I feel like  Macs are not important to Apple  at all. It's been very clear they  don't really care about the Macintosh.  They see mobile, they see phones,  they see iPads. Well that's a shame.  Well I agree. I'm a Mac fan.

Start time: 1044.53
End time: 1135.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think Macs are more important  to Apple in the sense of  their identity than maybe  how they market it to the outside.  They're very proud of the Macintosh.  They're very proud of how well it's performing.  They're very proud of beating Windows PC makers.  They talk to us about it when we  cover Macs. They are  extraordinarily proud of how successful the  Air is against every PC.  They hate the fact that the Air is so copied.  But the thing about TVs  and I just want to focus on this,  they're not going to make a TV for a  decade. And the  reason is very simple.  It will take a decade for the  primary delivery mechanism  of television, TV shows,  to go from cable and  satellite to the internet.  And until you get the primary delivery mechanism  to switch mediums, Apple  can't control the user interface.  So they can make a great TV, and  it can have Netflix and Apple  movie rentals and all that crap on it.  But you'll switch back to input two  to run your Time Warner cable box.  And until that stops being  reality, Apple won't make a TV.  And they just don't have the horsepower  to beat Comcast at that game right now.  Because Comcast, if you  walk through an airport lately,  I laugh every time I walk through an airport.  Because Comcast has giant billboards in every airport  in America right now. It says,  the Comcast X1 operating system.  And it's a picture of an iPad running an app.  Comcast has gotten to the point  that their hubris has reached a level  where they believe their iPad app  represents an operating system.  That's hubris is right.

Start time: 1136.14
End time: 1145.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're crazy.  I have an X1 by the way, and the thing is  well, it's the right idea,  but the implementation is ineffective.  It doesn't work.

Start time: 1146.51

If Steve Jobs was here,  he could maybe go to Comcast  and maybe go to Time Warner, maybe go to  RCN, and have that  conversation, say, look, your business is going  to die. My customers are  cutting the cord in favor of Apple TV  rentals. Come put  your shows on my platform.  I don't think any of these other guys have that  horsepower. And I think that you just  won't see them build a TV until they can  guarantee that the number  one thing you do on that TV is use Apple  services. And they cannot do that  right now. And I will tell you, I don't think  they can do it for a decade. Well, we'll find out

And this time they have to do it  right. And I imagine  heads rolled after the last event.  And new heads will prevail.  Yeah.  We're going to take a break.  I do want to talk a little about Apple Pay.  I want to talk about the sad story  of a little sapphire  company that listened and believed  to Apple  until the world changed out from under  them.

Transcript:  Our show today  brought to you by Stamps.com. You do not want to  go to... Did he say this? You do not want to go to  the post office anymore.  Nothing wrong with it. I like the  post office. He likes the post office.  Who doesn't? I mean the post office brings us cool  stuff. But  going to the post office to buy stamps  or bringing an armload of packages  is not exactly professional.  In fact, if you're selling stuff on eBay  or Etsy, if you're mailing brochures  or bills, you want to look  a little more professional.  You're looking stamped and gluing them onto the front of it.  Putting a couple extra just so you don't get  postage returned. Stamps.com  gives you 24 hours access to the  post office right from your computer.  You can buy  and print U.S. postage. You don't  need a postage meter or any special link  or anything. Just your computer, your printer.  You can print U.S. postage  for any letter, any package.  There's no guesswork because you get a digital  scale automatically calculates the exact  postage you need. It even suggests  the class of postage you might want to use  to save money.  It prints the postage directly onto the envelope  even. So with your logo  return address, it'll pull  the sender's address from a QuickBooks  or your address book. If you sell  on Amazon, eBay, Etsy, PayPal,  that kind of place, it will automatically pull  that information in. You'll no longer have  to fill out forms, even customs forms. It does  it all with one click. Plus you get  discounts, package discounts,  postage discounts that you just can't  get at the post office, including  discounted package insurance all with one  click of the mouse.  I love Stamps.com. I know you love it  too. If you do any mailing, if it's  part of your business,  simplify your life. Go to  Stamps.com and we've got a special offer.  Click the microphone in the upper right hand  corner and  sign up for our no risk trial. Just use the offer  code TWIT.  It's a $110 bonus offer  including a digital scale, $55  in free postage.  Really a great deal. And of course a month at  Stamps.com. Stamps.com, click the microphone,  use the offer code TWIT, and  stop  going to the post office.  I think Apple Pay is an intriguing  play. We've heard now that Walgreens,  according to an internal memo,  is planning to launch  Apple Pay October 18th.  That's this Saturday.  We  know that  because of the  new laws, chip and pin  or pin and signature  will be required sometime next year.  Visa and MasterCard both say  by October of next year will be  all chip and pin. Chip and pin.  That means stores have to buy a new  thing for the pin. Chip and pin.  So when they're buying it, they're  going to obviously, they're going to say, well, does it do Apple  Pay? Does it do, and I hope they'll say,  does it do Google Wallet? Because I want to see more than just that.

Transcript:  the Congress thought about that because one  of the things that's in this bill says  that regarding fraud,  you know, right  now, I guess the, who's responsible  for fraud? Not the consumer, the bank.  Essentially the credit card issue. The credit card  issue. Everything over. So they've changed  that so that whoever has the least  technology pays. And  really, this is the banking industry going to the congressman  because what that means is if  the merchant doesn't upgrade  to modern chip and pin technology,  they're liable for losses  incurred. If you stick with the  signature, which is, I think if you're  a small business, that's a bit of a

Can you hand me your credit card and I wander  off and I do dupes in the back or I write  the information down in the code. Although that happens.  It happens. But I don't, I'm  not particularly worried about, you know,  the waiter, you know,  at the restaurant grabbing my credit  card. What I'm irritated by at this  point is that I'm basically going to go through  a second credit card replacement in six  months because Tarjay got hacked  and now Home Depot has been hacked.  Well, that's a big cost to them. Well, it's a big cost.

Start time: 1612.02
End time: 1629.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  they don't actually even get a credit card  or even information about who you are. They just get  a token that says we as Visa  guarantee this payment. And that's  nice. The merchant doesn't hold your stuff.  And with all these breaches at Target  and Home Depot,  that's a good, that sounds like a good  thing to consumers, I would guess.

Transcript:  I think with Apple, it's  Apple's very good at designing systems.  They're very good at knowing the right thing to  do and the right way to build  things and  knowing that they have to depend on other people  to build the right parts of things. So they've gone to Visa,  they've gone to Chase, they've done  all the right things in the back end.  The problem with Apple right now  is that they seem to be not  very good at writing software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's fair. It's 40,000 people.  But, you know, a small percentage.  At this point, the question  with Apple is can they launch  a software product at this scale  without screwing it up?  And it's actually kind of a fair question to ask in a way  that has never been true of Apple  in the past. And I think that will be the thing  about Apple Pay. If they do it right,  what they've got is  a lot of people who excitedly  upgraded to a new iPhone.  I will say I think iPhone 6 and  6 Plus sales will be off the charts.  Because changing the form factor, giving people  a bigger screen, it was very exciting.  Everybody I know has an iPhone 6 now.  There's been no pause.  A lot of 6s,  a handful of 6 Pluss,  I personally think the 6 Plus  is the one true iPhone.  That's me.

Transcript:  It's Apple.  But I think this is what Apple bought  was this level of cool  and this level being plugged into the culture.  Whereas Apple used to be the company  that sort of defined a broad,  what's on your iPod kind of culture.  But what they're plugged into now is actually  technology is literally on this guy's head.  He's a superstar. He's an athlete.  He's living this life.  And he's wearing this stuff on his head.  And Apple's now part of that conversation  in a way that they weren't previously before.

We don't understand as people who talk about  consumer technology because what we're actually  talking about is fashion and personal expression.  And those things are...  They work on different levels in how we assume.  What you are saying is,  I hate people who wear baggy jeans.  What you're saying is, I hate people who wear  NFL t-shirts to the bar.

Transcript:  it's very interesting to watch companies,  and Apple really is at the forefront of this,  technology companies, realize that marketing  is a very different business in  the 2010s.  And that it isn't really about  speeds and feeds, bits and bites.  It's about style and fashion.  And something that really has nothing to do with technology.  Is that what you're saying, Neely?

Jennifer Lawrence is not going like,  boy, I can't wait to use Ipay.  No, that's right.  There's a whole lot of people that are looking at Apple  and being like, okay, I downloaded  iOS 8. My phone stopped.

Transcript:  Really, that's the thing  that style insulates you from  is broken, bad technology.  I mean, nobody's asserted that Beats headphones  are great headphones.  You wear them because they are Beats.  So it insulates...  That's the advantage of this,  is it insulates you a little bit from crappy technology.

Transcript:  Nobody ever bought a pair of Beats.  And then two days later,  we're not able to make a phone call  because they updated the firmware up their Beats.  Nobody took a bunch of selfies  and then found out their selfies were selling up on 4chan.  Nobody's looking at Beats  and thinking, gosh, can I trust my credit card here?  And maybe nobody who bought an iPhone 6  is thinking that, but I suspect a lot of people are.  If your technology fails in a way  that cuts you off from your friends,  your family, your business,  then it becomes...  May not be speeds and feeds, but it's bad for the fashion.  Nobody wants to buy a pair of...

Without question, they are light years better than that.  Do you know what they also do?  They prove that you have money to spend on  a fashionable, well-marketed,  and quite frankly,  like, cool-looking brand.  They look cool to a lot of people  and they mean something to a lot of people.  But here's one thing I would bet.

Transcript:  What I'm saying about...  The privacy issues of iCloud  and cloud services and Apple versus Google  are...  They are deep. They are way deep  into how people...  They're not too technical.  Let me put it to you this way.  I run a big website.  31 million people a month read my website  every single month.  We do not put specs in our reviews.  We don't put charts of performance  in our reviews.  We tell people what it's like to own this stuff  and to be alive and to live in a culture  of rapid technological change.  That's all we do.  That's our thesis at The Verge.  And everybody likes it.  And our site is growing.  And all that means is that  we have to understand technology  not as speeds and feeds and privacy issues  and very granular issues  about how we're coding the stuff  and where our passwords are going.  We have to understand it  as part of everyone's lifestyle.  And to understand technology as part of a lifestyle  means that we have to start accepting  other people's choices  in technology as not being objective  but as being very, very objective.

And a lot of the people that are watching The Verge,  The Verge is creating an audience for people who are hungry  for technology but are not looking for  what Engadget or Gizmodo or Boy Genius  or a lot of the traditional sites were.  It's like they're going to talk about  okay, how many milliamp hours is on this?  Is it going to last that long?  What they are saying is, hey, we took this product,  but it's dead.

Transcript:  No, but wait a minute, I think Neelai's saying something  very apt.  And it's not Neelai's fault,  but the world has moved on from this notion  that it even matters.  It's more about the feeling,  the emotional connection  you have to technology,  and it even works, which is of course  to you and me, Patrick, and to John.  It's stunning because we spent  our entire careers talking about  does this better than that? Does this work better than that?  And I think, Neelai,  I think you probably got your finger on the pulse  of people as opposed to  just, you know, I mean, I noticed the Verge has gotten  very much, no, it's very much more of a lifestyle  brand than a technology brand, is it not?

Start time: 2774.26
End time: 2853.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think you will see us move very  hard towards being a lifestyle brand.  And the reason you will see that  the thesis of our site, and it has been  the thesis since we launched, is that  we spent four years at Engadget,  the core senior team that launched the site,  we spent four years there  covering the explosion of mobile.  What's the screen going to look like? Are we going to do  resistive or capacitive for touch?  Are we going to do IPS LCD?  Or are we going to do TFT LCD?  Are we going to do LTE?  Or are we going to keep upgrading 4G?  I have been in those arguments.  I've had, at every level  of depth with those conversations when we ran Engadget,  and we arrived at a number  of conclusions, and now all  of us have a supercomputer in our pocket  that's going to do a broadband network.  And what is more interesting  to think about is what happens  now. Like, how will the world  change around the fact that all of us  have a supercomputer in our pocket, and  not so much what is the best  supercomputer. And the people  who focus deeply on what is the next  supercomputer, or how big should  the screen be, or what  should the touch technology look like,  they're going to fall behind. And they will  always fall behind. And that is the conversation  about should you wear Bose  nose-canceling headphones or Beats?  Because what you're really seeing is what people want  to wear is good headphones that  look cool. And I

Start time: 2854.08
End time: 2887.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  completely understand that. I agree with you. I've had the same  conversation with myself. We  are not going to change. We're going to continue to  do speeds and feeds, and  which technology is better. That's fine.  We've never aimed for a mass  audience. And for the audience  that wants that kind of stuff, I think it's appropriate that such a  thing exists. You are  probably going to, you're already doing  ten times better, you'll do a thousand times better  by targeting lifestyle.  I'm not arguing with that.  I think that's a sensible thing. If I  were a business, I would be doing  that. But I'm not. This is what I want to do.  It's too shallow.

Start time: 2888.65

Transcript:  stuff. Of course we are. That was like one of the most  popular things we've ever done.  Well, that just shows you people still want tech.  They love tech. What people love  is their lives.  What the people love is us connecting  their lives to the bigger story of  the world, and that's all we have to do.  So here's this keyboard that you've sat in front of  for 10 years at your data entry job  in Kansas. I've got a whole  story about that to tell you, and I've got a whole  culture to connect you to. Yeah, people are  into that. What they're not into  is here's us going to  Qualcomm's factory to talk  to one engineer about  the next generation of LTE Modem.  That's okay, because we'll do that. You don't have to do that.  And you'll do that. There'll always be somebody

Start time: 2970.36

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to do that, and you know what? Just like  Hi-Fi Magazine got  dwindled down to a very small group of  people who were interested in that, and  Rolling Stone took off because it wasn't anymore  about RMS wattage.  It was about  content. That's exactly what happened. When was Rolling Stone ever

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's not, because what happens, the Hi-Fi  magazines, which were very popular  you're old enough to remember the 50s.  I remember the 50s? They were very  popular. People cared about that.  The RMS wattage of your  amplifier was more important than what you were listening  to on it. And then, of course,  content. In the same way that  the computer industry has matured,  the audio industry matured, nobody cared  anymore. Nobody knows what  wattage their amplifier supports.  It's not important. That may not be true. But what they listen  to, well, there are still some. And you know what?  We're that magazine. If you go to  Costco, they tell you. And I'm going to go down  swinging.

Start time: 3050.00

Speaker: SPEAKER_09

And here are these people who are  deep in the edge of  processor speeds and RAM  sizes and how much storage  iPhones should have now in 2014.  Apple, what are you doing  at 8 gigs?  We understand those parts of it.  But what we're really going to tell you about  is how your life will change when you  spend $500 on a new iPhone.  And that, to us,  has been validated by  data. Like the actual data  of our readership has been validated  by the fact that we tell people about  experiences and not about  raw, granular information about technology.  Because what people want to know  is how is my life changing?  And the chaos underneath it of the  industry is non-stop,  rapid technological change.  Which is super exciting  and worth understanding on a granular  level. And so that means people will always  watch your show. People will always  read NGadget. They will always read CNET.  They will always read  Giz or Anintech or whatever.  And everyone should read Anintech because it's brilliant.

I think people love looking at graphics  or benchmarks or graphs or numbers  or raw numbers. But most people want to know  is my game going to play better if I buy a $200 card?  Is my game going to play better if I buy a $500 card?  Oh, I really want to buy a $3,000 gaming system.  Great.  Why don't you spend more money on a monitor first  because your $3,000 gaming system  isn't going to do anything on your 1080p monitor  that a $1,000 gaming system isn't going to do.

Not just you, Neelay Patel,  but everybody covered this crazy  Microsoft keyboard for Android Wear.  And I think it's a great way to get people to use it.  The keyboard for Android Wear.  This to me shows that  Microsoft, to me,  that Microsoft doesn't get it.  Really? Why is that?  Because who the hell wants to type on their wristwatch?

This is the week where they write Android keyboards  and next week they'll be like surfers  and the week after that they'll be really into the cure  and the week after that they're going to dye their hair blue.  Are they getting emo on us?  Yeah, like Microsoft is learning what it  wants to be when it grows up.

Start time: 3496.04
End time: 3523.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The funny thing is just the day before this I was down at Adobe Max  and he was up there on the stage  with the head of Adobe  and they were...  Every time I've seen Nadella  he just does not look presentable.  He's like a CEO  where he's got these...  Here we go again.  Mediocre looking jeans and a kind of a black...  Is he sag?  No, they don't sag that I know of.  I didn't see his... I wasn't looking at his butt.  So he was being

Start time: 3532.02
End time: 3544.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When asked about his advice to women  who are uncomfortable requesting a raise,  he says it's not really about asking for the raise  but knowing and having faith  that the system will actually give you the right raises  as you go along.  Yeah.

Start time: 3546.26

Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Transcript:  Here's the thing about Nadella in that quote.  I am not...  He is a moron for saying that  and thinking that and believing that.

Start time: 3566.18
End time: 3571.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  His tweet response was  inarticulate, Ray, how women should ask for a raise.  Our industry must close gender pay gap.

Start time: 3572.00
End time: 3591.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, and he was wrong. And the person who asked the question  very clear, right? Like, she's on the board of Microsoft.  If there's one person that you don't  deliver the wrong answer to there,  it's one of your board members.  So he screwed up, like, in a terrible way.  He's wrong. And if you want to raise  whoever you are, you should ask for one.  You should get paid what you think you're worth.  He sent an email out to Microsoft employees

Start time: 3592.57
End time: 3607.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  saying he'd answered the question completely wrong.  I believe men and women should get equal pay for equal work.  When it comes to career advice and getting a raise,  when you think it's deserved,  Maria's advice was the right advice.  If you think you...  And Neil eyes now. If you think you deserve a raise,  you should just ask.

Start time: 3608.00
End time: 3633.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right. But here's what I think that's reflective of.  And I think it's actually really important  for all of us to understand this.  Nadella's a Microsoft guy, right?  He has worked at Microsoft forever.  And he is raised in the Microsoft system.  And so he believes that the way  Microsoft is built and the way it works  and what he now presides over is fair  and just and accurate because, of course,  it is because they've probably been arguing about it  for a long time. So, you know, Microsoft  famously has stack rankings where

Start time: 3634.69
End time: 3637.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  all the... Right? They have all these  performance... It's been discontinued, by the way.

Start time: 3638.00
End time: 3639.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He stopped it. As soon as he came in, he stopped it.

Start time: 3640.00
End time: 3678.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right. Because he thought... So obviously he thinks his decisions  about performance measurement  are better than the ones that came previously.  So he believes Microsoft has some system  in place that actually measures  performance and rewards people appropriately.  And those systems inherently  reflect the structural biases  of the people who built them.  So if you are a smart man, they're going to  reflect how smart men ask  for promotions and raises. If you're  a smart woman, they might reflect how smart women ask  for that stuff. But historically, in this  world, smart men are the people  who get to build these systems.  And I think understanding that  explains why he would be so stupid  to say such a thing like this. It was a stupid

Start time: 3678.00
End time: 3697.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  thing to say. It's wrong. But I also  feel like it's a little bit of a gotcha journalism thing.  Unless you feel like... No, there's no...  This is a bigger story than that because he's going to get...  Unless you feel like it reflects a deep  seated misogyny  on his part or  a structural institutional misogyny  on Microsoft's part. If you feel that it does represent  that, then it's a worthy subject. It absolutely

Start time: 3698.53
End time: 3708.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  reflects a deep seated  misogynistic structural bias on the  part of our society, on the part of  our industry, and a part of our...  on Microsoft. Then it's appropriate to bring...  Well, I'm not even...

Start time: 3710.51
End time: 3723.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, let me just say this one thing. There's going to be  lawsuits resulting from this,  from past problems that have  happened for 30 years.  Anyone who worked under this guy  is going to be in court. This is going to be  a huge problem for Microsoft.

Start time: 3724.00
End time: 3726.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That might be a good point. So in that case, it was really

Start time: 3726.16
End time: 3729.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  dumb. Anyway, go on.  I'm sorry, Patrick. No, I was going to say the

Start time: 3730.10
End time: 3756.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Kara Swisher, the follow-up  quote to the quote to  Maria Klaue was, that might be one of their  initials, one of the initial superpowers  that, quite frankly, women who don't ask for a raise have.  It's good karma. It will come back. It was just  compounding that. It's like, well, it's probably  not... And I get  where he might have been thinking, or  where he might have been thinking in stack ranking, but  oh, ow.  Yeah.  It's wrong on like every  level.

Start time: 3758.97
End time: 3775.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's a belief in the meritocracy  that exists, particularly in the tech industry,  that does not recognize  that our ability  to value merit tends to reflect  who we are. And if who we are  is mostly men, we will  understand merit in the context of being men  instead of the context of being people.

Start time: 3776.02
End time: 3780.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is particularly tone deaf to say that at the Grace  Hopper celebration. I know, that's the irony

Start time: 3780.24

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  that I just love that.

Start time: 3782.06
End time: 3797.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So at best,  you could say, he spoke  without thinking he was tone deaf and perhaps  reflected in institutional bias  against women. At worst, you could say,  this guy's a jerk.  And this is the guy  running Microsoft.

Start time: 3798.06
End time: 3819.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think he doesn't get invited to that  conference if we believe  in at worst. I  think he made a legitimate mistake  that reflects a belief  that we're all going to be valued equally.  And that we all talk to each other  on Twitter and IM and email  instead of talking to each other as people in real life.  And that is a difficult  thing for all of us to contend with.

Start time: 3820.40

Transcript:  I just think the thing's hilarious.  Because it's going to be a little drama  for a while with Microsoft involved.  It's going to be quite funny to watch.  As the CEO. So it'll be very interesting.  It's a good point.  He's not just some guy.  I mean, there's a number of instances  of situations.  Have there been any lawsuits since?

Start time: 3842.00
End time: 3900.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're right. I mean, there's got to be some phones ringing.  There's phones ringing.  There'll be something happening.  Microsoft, we found out,  gets a billion dollars a year  on Android phones.  Something between three and five dollars a year.  This is a result of litigation.  Microsoft sued  Samsung saying  you owe us  interest. What was it? Three and a half million dollars in  interest. No. Three and a half  billion? Three point four billion?  That's how much it makes. But it hadn't paid its interest.  So they were suing over interest.  But in the revelations,  we found out that in fact,  yeah, three and a half billion dollars  from Samsung  alone a year  because Microsoft,  we think, asserts a patent  on Linux.  Oh, this again.  Well, that's what this is. It's not clear.  They never bring out these patents to show  anyone. Yeah, they always stop before that happens.

Start time: 3902.10
End time: 3960.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, they bring them out when they actually  sue each other. Microsoft has  been very good at signing  these deals over time. And I think  what you're seeing, the number, the reason  the number is so high with Samsung  is that Samsung sells so many phones.  Right. Right. So the  real number is  three percent of total phone sales  or some minor percentage  of phone sales. It's still a good business. It's not a  bad business. But everybody runs this business.  That's what I'm saying. What you don't know  is how much Microsoft is paying Samsung.  That's good. That's true.  You may be a net zero.  We don't know. What you don't know is how  much Apple and Microsoft pay each other because  they have a patent licensing deal that they just  renewed. So what  you're really looking for in all these Android  patent battles is you're looking for  Apple and Google to settle against each other,  which may or may not ever happen.  And so what you're seeing is all  of these side deals,  basically, against who's going to pay  who to get out of that main Apple

Start time: 3960.22
End time: 3990.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google fight. I love this, though.  Microsoft apparently has three hundred  and ten patents that it asserts  are infringed by Android  and that's why it licenses these to companies like  Samsung. But Florian  Mueller, who is the  blogger at Foss Patents, says if we  look at it in terms of Microsoft patents that are  presently, after four years of litigation  enforceable against Android devices,  there is one. And that  covers the scheduling of  meetings from a mobile device.  We own that. That's weak, weak, weak.

Start time: 3990.93
End time: 4012.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  You know, Microsoft  and Motorola sued each other for a long time.  These patent battles are  happening over basically  it's the people who own the software technology  versus the people who make the money.  And the only reason that  it all feels so lopsided in favor of Microsoft  is because Microsoft makes no money  on mobile devices. Right. So we know

Start time: 4012.91
End time: 4023.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  what they're getting is  from patents.  I did see, though, that the  number of patent lawsuits  is dropping.  Is that right? I think that's good news.

Start time: 4024.61
End time: 4107.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. The number  of software patents granted is dropping  precipitously because of  Alice v. CLS Bank,  which was a Supreme Court case  that said some things about how software patents  should be litigated and how they should be  enforced. The business method patents  are also not being approved  at the same rate. So what you're  seeing is the pendulum  is swinging, right? After all of this noise,  after all this bullsh** with Apple,  you're seeing the pendulum start to  swing and the patent office begin to  understand and the courts begin to understand  what shouldn't should be patentable. So  Is it the end of software patents?  No.  I don't think that there should be an end to software.  If you really think about what we're talking about with software  patents is  not slide to unlock or  something like should you be  able to send a meeting request from your calendar  app. But you're really talking about  is like image handling algorithms.  What you're really talking about is things like  how to do compression  of video. And those  things are really difficult problems  to solve. And the companies that invest  tons and tons of money against  solving those problems in software should be  rewarded by being able to sell  that stuff and not having it be copied. And  somewhere in the middle of that is a balance.  And what you're seeing right now is a pendulum  swing all the way to the other side. And it  will probably swing again. And we'll just  hopefully it'll settle. But it will take many  years for it to settle. The patent

Start time: 4108.32
End time: 4128.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  involved in CLS Bank versus  Alice, the one that this summer  kind of started to  shake the apple cart was a business  process patent.  Holding money in escrow to  prevent either company to  either party to a deal from backing out.  And then implementing that on a computer.  I think that's probably fair to throw that one out.  Yeah, it should be.

Start time: 4130.04
End time: 4133.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Illitigate these things no matter what you think.  And so when we talk about software patents

Start time: 4134.00
End time: 4134.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  we're talking about a big pie.

Start time: 4136.16
End time: 4168.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We're saying is it everything in software  or is it just the hardest things in software?  And then the question of what is hard  is really complicated  and should probably be taken up at the patent office  by people who are not really  experienced in software.  So it should probably be taken up at the patent office  by people who understand how to make software.  The problem with people who understand how to make  software is that Apple and Google  and Facebook and Microsoft tend to pay  them a lot of money to come make software.  So it's literally  an understanding problem.  So it will take some time for it to all settle out.

Transcript:  Samsung, we were talking about  how well Samsung is  doing in TV. They may be doing well in TV but  they told  analysts that their profit is going to drop  60% as  sales slow. Most of their profit comes  from mobile devices.  They warn investors  that sales are  tumbling on Samsung phones.

No. I think that the IOS is  well, besides the fact how buggy  iOS 8 is, and I've had all sorts of trouble with  third party keyboards and all sorts of things.  But I just feel like it's kind of an antiquated  operating system. I like the way  Android uses the screen real estate.  I don't have to launch apps to find out what time  it is or, you know,  what my emails are, my voicemails are.  And I just feel like that's a better way of doing things.

There's another  article, I can't think of the name of the company that did it, where they  looked at, say, flashlight applications  and what they were asking for on Android.  And some of them are free and some are $20.  No, no, no, no. What I say what they're asking for is  the permissions they're asking for.

Transcript:  All those pictures, I will tell you,  I'm looking at them, you were outside  in the daylight. Right, right light.  You can't go wrong. The second you  go inside with that camera, it turns to garbage.  The thing about the iPhone is that it's good  in low light. Which, the reason I say it's  revelatory, it's the first small  camera or phone camera I've had  that is as good in low light  as one of my four thirds, Micro Four Thirds  cameras, or one of my DSLRs.  And that, to me, is going to change the game.  It's a big deal.

I won't tell you which phone.  There's two. These are all  taken exactly the same time.  And this is  a fairly low light situation.  That's the OnePlus One. I think that one's  pretty garbagey. Although OnePlus One  is doing an update that'll give you raw.  That picture I can tell you is bad.  What are the others? This is the Moto X.  Now, both were set  for auto HDR, but the Moto X decided to use  HDR, the iPhone 6 did not.  Is that the first one?  That's the iPhone 6. This is the Moto X.  I think this is over HDR, and you can  tell in the skyline. But  nevertheless, I feel like  look, I don't think there's such a huge difference  anymore that it's worth saying, oh, I'm  never going to buy a new iPhone.

For most people, they're already using  iOS, so the 6 and the 6 Plus,  they are  improvements to iOS, improvements to hardware,  and they get this free great camera.  I think for somebody who's using a Moto G,  it almost is good enough.  It's almost enough of an upgrade  for Patrick to switch to iOS,  because it's so much better.

And I think the real question for Apple, again, like we talked about at the top of the show,  is what are they going to do to the iPad  to make me want to use it again?  And that is a big question.

End time: 5090.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I agree, but that's the big one.  You put in a clause there  that I think I could debate,  which is verging on being a standard.  There is all messaging apps are equal.  They all do the same thing.  Right?

Start time: 5092.71
End time: 5115.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They're built on the network effect, right?  They're only as valuable as how big their audience  and their platform is.  And WhatsApp has an audience  that you and I don't see because we live in America.  No, I understand. I know I understand that.  So that rest of the world.  So my family that wants to communicate with people in India,  they've all had to use WhatsApp.  And I use WhatsApp and I look at it and I think it's garbage  because it looks like garbage.  And the UI is ridiculous.

So if I'm Facebook,  either I can run around launching Facebook Paper  and Facebook Poke  and Facebook whatever Snapchat competitor they're going to launch in a minute,  or I can pay the money on the success.  Because you can either spend a billion dollars launching poke and marketing poke,  or you can spend 22 X that on buying the winner.  And I think the value of being on the winning team for Facebook right now is very high.  I agree if we're the winning team.  Here's my  They have shown no ability.  I would say this. Facebook has shown no ability  to be able to do that.  And I think that's the only way to do it.

Transcript:  So here's  I can't remember where I read this article  Was it the New York Times?  Somebody's talking about  I think we all take it as written, the network effect.  Everybody uses it. So you've got to use it.  The woman who wrote this article pointed out  that when you use a messaging app, you're really  it's a small group of people.  What is it? 8, 10 people.  There's not that much  to keep that group, that small group  if we're in a larger group, maybe.  But to keep that small group from saying,  Hey, guess what? I like Facebook Messenger.  Let's all go there.  It takes no time.  So I'm not convinced that there is this  kind of rock solid network effect  that's keeping people loyal to apps.  I think any messaging app is equal to  any other messaging app. And there is nothing  that makes Facebook any better.

Transcript:  The bet you're making is that people will leave Facebook  for LO. Right?  That I know is not going to happen.  But the reason you know it's going to happen  is because you watch these things  The bet you're making is people will leave Twitter for apps.net.  Right?  It's 8 people, sure, for you.  But all of those 8 people  have 8 more people. So now we're talking about  64 people.  Or 128 people. Or 256 people.  And now the network effect is real.  And until Facebook can find a way  to either capture that  or one of Facebook's competitors  can find a way to bring everybody at once,  it will be very hard to leave Facebook.  It will be very hard to leave WhatsApp.  I don't think you could start an Instagram  competitor today.  I don't. I think it would be impossible.  And the reason is because people are tied  into their networks on Instagram  that have nothing to do with their friends.

And I think it's easy  in the short run to say, oh, WhatsApp,  they're going to be an incumbent for a good  how many years you think, Neelay?  10, 20, 30?  I think WhatsApp will be, yeah, 30.  30 years. 30 years from now  that you never hear of them. And they're making a buck a year per sub.  But it's not about  how much you're going to make or lose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right. But that's like  it's a hard thing to look  at. Right. I mean, because  WhatsApp isn't a country, first of all.  Second, it operates. I understand  apples to oranges. Right. But like  WhatsApp operates in like a hundred  countries. So you're  looking at the discretionary  income of millions  of people across multiple environments.  And the reason  that the valuation seems insane to  us is because  we don't use it.  We're literally not  using WhatsApp the way people  in Asia use it,  the way people in Europe use  it, the way people in India use it.  And so that like every time we talk  about WhatsApp, I check myself  and think I think this app is stupid  and garbage and I use Hangouts instead.  But everyone else I know uses  this thing.

Whatever. They got her phone,  and they took pictures off her phone.  Some of them, you know, not  risky, and they said,  hey, let's create a  fake Facebook account and invite a bunch  of felons to follow it.  And  she's a little upset. She's doing  she said, wait.

I am not an objective source of GamerGate  information because my  staff and my reporters are being attacked  and harassed. I've  been attacked and harassed. And  so screw those guys.

Start time: 6056.34

Transcript:  This is by GamerGate  or people who claim to be gamers  who initially were upset  about what they felt was unfair  biases and  conflict of interest  in the gaming press.

Start time: 6070.24
End time: 6172.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So, but let me tell you where that came from.  I think this is really important.  So, what happened in  gaming over the past, I would say,  two to three years  is that many more people started  playing video games. And because many  more people started playing video games,  many more people started writing and thinking about  video games, and many more people started  making video games. And when  you start expanding the category  of people who are thinking about  an art form, necessarily  you'll start making different kinds of games  and people will start criticizing the things that have  come before. And what  happened, and this is where the ethical  argument comes in, is that  people started criticizing big AAA  games for being  sexist, which many of them are,  for not thinking about any audience  other than 18 or 35 year old, like  young men, which is a  fair criticism, and for  in particular  being made by only one group of people.  Right? Which is why  Sony gets criticized in the Verge Rain article about this  maybe a year ago. Sony  gets criticized for only having men on stage  at E3 events and things like this.  So that is, there's a base of criticism  that's starting to happen  in video games journalism.  Next to that is the historical  reality of video games journalism,  which is deeply corrupt.  The fact, right?  Video games journalism is built on access.  So the first popular video games publication  in the world was Nintendo  Power magazine, published  by Nintendo.  And if you think about that cycle  of access and consumerism  and just basic  graft, what you get is  a press that basically sucks up to  AAA video game publishers and  console makers.

Start time: 6174.04
End time: 6182.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This happens, by the way, in belt  wearing journalism, in cars,  in stereos. Trade press in  particular tends to be in that situation.

Start time: 6182.22
End time: 6195.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hold on a second. I don't consider  it graft. When  you're a company and you  do a trade journal, a trade magazine,  and all you do is promote. What's your company?  This magazine was owned by Nintendo.  But that's where it started.

Start time: 6196.00
End time: 6313.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Let me finish.  So there is that, right? There is  this deep video  game corruption in the  historical  magazines. Then you have a new  crop of sites like Joystick  and Kotaku and Polygon. And  Disclosure Polygon is owned  by Vox Media, which is a company I work for. My friends  work there. It's a great site.  It's good. I think they do a terrific  job. You have  the new sites, which are starting  to talk about criticism on a deep level.  And they are engaging with  video game developers, some of whom who work at  the big studios, some of whom who work  at Microsoft and Sony and Nintendo,  and some of whom are independent developers.  And this is just  reality. Independent developers are much  less constrained  by the corporations they work for when they talk.  Right? Because they don't have a boss.  So they are more open. They're more honest. They  go out for drinks. They're like in the mix  with reporters in a different way.  Which is great because for  reporters you get better stories out of it.  And what's happening in  Gamergate is a conflation of  gamers, like original  hardcore gamers,  who see that as their identity,  being mad at the criticism  leveled at games  for being  sexist and too violent and not including  women and being targeted at white men.  Being mad at that criticism.  And then targeting their anger at that  criticism towards the older  problem of  graft and corruption in gaming.  Because the reality, and this is true,  the reality is, if I wanted to be  corrupt about an independent  games developer, like  honestly I would make no money.  Right? Like it would not be worth it  to me to stake my publication's  credibility on that. It wouldn't be,  and I know that Polygon again, my sister  published my publication, I know the people who work there,  not worth it to Chris Grant, the editor in chief  of Polygon, to stake his credibility,  his career, his publication  on pushing forward depression quest.

Start time: 6330.71

Transcript:  Or being alive,  are somehow complicit in massive  conspiracy to shut down  any number of  crazy arguments.  And most of those arguments have to do with things  like men's rights. Most of those arguments  have to do with things like  where, like  it basically  boils down, like  let me just give you a small sample of things  that we dealt with this week at The Verge.  We dealt with  our writers being harassed on Twitter.  We dealt with a Nazi site.  Literally, and I'm not kidding, a Neo-Nazi site  writing about one of our writers  haircuts and saying her father should  have beaten her with the back of her hand  until her hair grew out.  This did not have anything to do with video games.  It just has to do with what they thought about  her, right? And some things she'd written  about race and Ebola.  What we are dealing with is basically  the idea that  people on the internet should not  have standards about how they talk to other  people. And what they're  doing now is Gamergate  is a movement, has decided  that the way that they will  further their goals  is by attacking our advertisers.  Which is fair, because if you attack  my economic interests, maybe I'll  change my mind. But if your argument  is that we don't have journalistic  ethics, right?  Maybe. But if your argument is that I don't have  journalistic ethics, and then your  strategy is to attack my  advertisers until I do what they want,  then you have completely  obviated your argument.

I feel sorry for  Brianna Wu, a game developer  who has literally been chased from her house  with horrific  threats.  The police are investigating, and I suspect  that the nature of these threats gives  the police a foothold in pursuing  it. Almost always it's coming from  Twitter, and I have to point out that Twitter  has become a true cesspool.  And one of the problems that's  happening is that Twitter has  to continue its 25% monthly  growth, or  the stock market price will tumble,  the whole house of cards will collapse.  So they have zero incentive  to take care of this stuff by  banning IP addresses, looking  up the names. Oh, I'm not buying that.

Transcript:  really, I think DiCostolo  is a nice guy, blah, blah, blah.  But I think Twitter and its board  are at this point really culpable  because they will not shut these  accounts down. They don't make it harder. They shut down accounts all the time.  Why don't they shut these down? Yeah, but it's so easy to create a new account.  Well, that's the point. You can create a new  account. And they don't  shut it down effectively, which they could technologically,  but they have no desire to do.  In fact, they want people to create new accounts because  that shows their growth. But I would say,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Twitter, I agree with you, Leo,  I think Twitter is deeply culpable. I think  all these platforms by which  people can harass other people, we have  to take a hard look in the mirror and decide,  okay, well the internet is  interwoven into our lives. Like, how  should we treat each other and how should we  punish people for treating each other badly  or deal with people that  treat each other badly on these platforms?

You can stop it on  Google+. You can stop it on Facebook. You cannot  stop it on Twitter. That's where it lives.  And I have to say that  the quality of conversation  in the  general internet world has really deteriorated.  It's always been crap.  I agree. It's never been  great, but it's gotten worse and worse.  And the ugly voices. How bad can you get?  For a long time, I really thought that  the publicity would  promote  civility, that the ugly voices would get pushed out.  And it's going in the other direction at this point.

Transcript:  Let me answer John's question.  Where it came from is  basically  two people and two things,  two pieces of content of media  that were created. One is Anita  Sarkeesian's Trips vs. Women  on YouTube, where she literally  just analyzed video games,  mass-market video games, from  a feminist perspective, which is her  perspective, and pointed out  that women in games are often used as  sex objects or the male gaze,  which is when the author  of a piece of work tends to look at women  the way a man would look, is prevalent  in video games. And you can watch these things and you can  disagree with them, and I disagree with some of them  in the same way that I read Jezebel every day  and I disagree with Jezebel sometimes, right?  They are worth,  they are topics worth discussing.  And she presents them in a particularly strong way,  which I think is great. So that  is a thing that exists. The next thing  is Zoe Quinn, the variety of  games she's made, that have nothing  to do with being video games,  right? They have everything to do with telling stories  in an interactive way. And  the Games Press took both of  these things and thought they were interesting.  And the Games Press, I think  over the past few years,  and again, because I work at a company  that  runs Polygon, I  think Polygon's mission  is to take video games and talk about  them as their art, right? Like, the whole  business model for Polygon is,  everybody plays video games now.  Let's run a site for everybody.  And so, if you look at the way  they talk about video games, they talk about them in a broad  encompassing way, and I think that's great.  Again, I'm biased, right? They're my friends.

Transcript:  No, I just, I think  it's gone so far beyond gaming  and the gaming press. I think it's  crazy. It is an eruption of  trolling that is appalling.  Let me finish this. What you were seeing

Start time: 6772.02
End time: 6908.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  is that stuff  compounded in the gaming press started  to threaten an identity.  An identity of being a gamer. An identity  of being a young person  who maybe felt that they existed in  this other subculture. And identity  politics is something that our  culture understands, right?  It's something that's easy to attack other people  for not understanding your identity.  It's easy to attack  other people for being outside your identity.  And what has  actually happened in Gamergate is  that the language  and the tactics of the  culture war and the  identity politics that are toxic  to our society have been foisted  onto video games. So now  what we're talking about is feminism.  Now what we're talking about  is straight up, like  are you a gamer? Do you believe  in what I believe in? And so the  angry tweets I get are about things  like you're just supplicating yourself  to the feminist agenda.  When really what The Verge is talking about is  should women be better represented in  video games? And so  you can have these arguments. They are  worth having. What should our  art look like? Should our art include  the category of things we traditionally call  video games? I would argue  that they should. But if you want to disagree  with Roger Ebert, if you want to win the  argument that video games  should be considered art, you necessarily  have to let other artists  into the mix. You necessarily have  to let other kinds of criticism into the  mix. So when feminists  critique Michael Bay movies,  you don't get Gamergate. What you  get is people being like, ah, it's happening  again. And then lots of people watching Michael Bay  movies. When feminists critique Grand Theft Auto  V, what you get is Gamergate.  And that is actually the  problem. That's the whole circle  of the problem is that the people who  believe that this is their identity and these  publications belong to them  are refusing to understand  and they're refusing to accept that that  circle should get wider. And again,  I feel very strongly  about this because it has been personally  affecting to me over these past few  weeks and for my friends who work in video  game journalism for the past three months.  But I will tell you that this  is the right side of the argument. And there  is a wrong side and the wrong side is being  addicted to people on the internet. I agree.
