Everybody's been working from home  I'm the only guy coming into the studio  All of our other hosts Micah Sargent Jason Howell  Anthony Pruitt they're all staying home to stay safe as I hope you are as well  But we've managed to still put together.

Transcript:  That's fair. I haven't been in eight years  And I one of the reasons I didn't go for so long  Partly is it's just a nightmare  In fact a lot of you know  Last week I asked my panel how many of you are going to see as none of them are going because they're all  Senior enough in tech journalists. They don't have to go right nobody imposes on themselves like we did and right that's nuts  Or like you guys do all of you could have recused yourselves  There's something fun about it though. I liken it  To a football game  If you go to an nfl game you go for the atmosphere for the fun not to see the game  You could see it much better at home on your tv  Then you can and you know, even if you have good seats because it's distant and it's people running around and it's  And ces is like that. You can only get it's like the uh, the the the elephant and the blind men  You can only get it's four thousand five hundred booths. That means, you know more than you know, 12 000 products  It's you only have so much time. It's impossible in four days  To even scratch the surface, right?  So you know, you'd be better off if you care about ces to let everybody else go read all the coverage  But if you want to get the so once in a while, I think it's fun to go  Get the atmosphere all of you go all the time, right? I go for the swag. Yeah

No, I don't want to go back. I hate it  Because and I was like really but after going  Two two times or so I could see why  You would feel that way because it is a grind. It's hard.

I think I went to north central and south halls. I went to the sands expo center  I went to the venetian.

In fact the company that created that and won the award and then lost the award  Was smart and went out did press releases went on a tour  They got more coverage than they would have otherwise and I think the cea said oops  That was a mistake because we've allowed, you know, they used to have adult  Corner where they'd have adult videotapes in there, right? Eventually they had ex-exiled that across the hall  But uh, it was very sexist that they said well, you can't have women's health products, but you can have men's

Would you want someone walking around tracking you if you could see them?  You know snooping into your bathroom looking at what you're doing what you're surfing around you'd say stop doing that you'd close your blinds  There's a few of us maybe that'd be like yay into that most people would say no stop following me around  Stop it

Transcript:  The best part of this conversation is like two minutes ago  It was like I don't want law enforcement to be able to track us everywhere  And the reality is through third-party marketing tools if they can identify your phone  Which is not that hard to do the level of of mapping and tracking they can do now without using any official tools  Is kind of terrifying?

End time: 843.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or or it's actually turned out a lot of a lot of apps sell the tracking information to third-party services  Which are then you know people can walk up with a you know  credit card number and get information that you would freak out if it was made available directly from  You know, uh from from google or from apple  Um, yeah, or for example the car the amount of information the car's track is utterly terrifying at this point like  You know, I may never buy a new car again based on the amount of information that's being pulled out of the oh man

Start time: 843.44
End time: 860.27

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  It's all those other apps what you know, you know, I i've got you know, i've got  android 10 on on my pixel 3 now  And you know they added the same thing in there so that now in all the apps you can go in and set your location  Preferences by app, you know to always allow, you know allow when in use or never allow and I was shocked  You know after upgrading to 10, you know some of these apps that were coming up and asking, you know for location permission that  They had I mean, you know games and stuff that had no business knowing where I was. I don't mind, you know, google maps  You know having my location. I mean that's why you have to do it. It's not gonna work  Yeah, you know and you know things things like, you know lift or uber  Clearly they need to know where I am when i'm using them  But there is no reason for a ride hailing app to know where I am when i'm not using the app  Yeah, anytime that i'm not using the app. It's off  And I think the only app I have set to always allow is google maps because like you leo  I do like the timeline. It's I find it useful

Start time: 958.28
End time: 963.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Plus I want to help law enforcement when there's a robbery. Yeah, they want to know everybody who was in 500 feet of the robbery

End time: 998.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_22
Transcript:  A gold jacket and a gold heart that was at this location look at your cameras. You can't miss me  I think it's a better transparency though. It's that you don't really know  What they're going to be doing with it and who they're going to be selling it to  And what they're going to be using it for there are no regulations to make sure that they're really being honest and it's legible  No one reads the privacy like I have every once in a while  It's terrifying and then I always don't you know, if I really want the app  I won't read it because then I will say no, but no one reads it. It's illegible. So

Start time: 999.72
End time: 1011.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a big problem actually i'll be honest I almost always  Click select only when using app because that seems reasonable to me  And if it's an app that shouldn't have location information if it's fortnight or something, then I say no

Start time: 1012.58
End time: 1118.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Remember the flashlight app that some nefarious company bought and then it was basically it went from being like you can turn on the light  For your camera when you're not actually using your camera and then they did an update and it was looking for information  It was basically accessing all possible information on your phone your photos your contact information everything it was  It was kind of fascinating to watch because you know  The the the millions of downloads for this was before they integrated this stuff into the operating system  People kept downloading it installing it and presumably saying okay  That's how badly they wanted a flashlight app  But there's a there's an article the new york times did back in the middle of december 12 million phones one data set zero privacy  where  somebody turned over  A a data set which was  50 billion pings quote 50 billion pings from the phones of more than 12 million americans as they moved through several major cities  including washington new york san francisco and los angeles  And uh, you know basically because apps that that would track you and then report the information  Um  You know it also meant that these  Unregulated, you know third party app data collection  centers could allow anyway with that information to you know track the location of  You know people who probably shouldn't be tracked or don't want to be tracked  Whether they are celebrities or you know exes or you know abused it'll be it's it's it's kind of  Amazing how much information is out there and just it's  You know the the william gitson line is my favorite the street finds its own uses for things  Um, you know the street's going to find its own use for this information and it might be creepy as hell  That's actually a really important point

Start time: 1118.92
End time: 1415.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is that you can invent a technology and have an idea about how it's going to be used law enforcement can have an idea  But you know well with kieskro will only will only use the ring of power for good not evil  But the street finds its own uses is a really good thing to keep in mind. I like that patrick  Yeah  Um, thank william gitson. Yeah  It just that's the nature of technology  It flows like water  This year the ipad celebrated its 10th anniversary. We're going to take a look back  To the ipad 10 years ago in just a minute, but before we do  I'd like to thank our sponsor  Uh, it's very nice to have sponsors on our best of shows and zendesk is a great sponsor customer service  Is i'm something I really believe in I think a good company  Can get to great by doing great customer service and that's where zendesk comes in  Whether you're buying stuff online or or calling your bank or using an app to get a ride to an airport  I think you know  Which companies do it right and which companies don't?  Sometimes even great teams can struggle to make their customers feel taken care of  That's why zendesk is so great their award-winning support sales and customer engagement software  Help businesses go to the next level by offering personal service at scale  So your team can create conversational experiences that keep customers happy  And you know customers are very quick if something goes wrong on a phone call to a bank  Who hasn't had a frustrating experience calling a company?  That word goes out people tweet about it  They tell their friends on the other hand  And I want to encourage everybody to do this when you have a great customer experience  You remember it don't you and you go back  I try only to deal with companies that give me that feeling that they care about  Me as a customer a great customer experience. It's so important and i'm betting most of the companies that I really like  Are using zendesk you can communicate seamlessly across every channel email phone chat messenger community forums  Help centers social media zendesk uses a term. I think it's a really good one called they call it a conversational experience  What makes it conversational? Well, it's connected. It's ongoing. Most importantly, it's genuine. It's a natural  customer interaction  And if you can create that feeling that it's a one-to-one experience  You're gonna have a customer for life  That's what zendesk enables with a complete customer profile a unified set of tools that give you the context you need  To deliver great service in every conversation  Now most software support software requires expensive consultants  Months of setup not zendesk. It just takes hours for you to get it up and running  It's easy to implement. It's fast  And and even so they scale  To meet changing needs, you know when you're a small business good customer service isn't so hard as you get bigger  It gets harder and harder  Zendesk is with you every step of the way  They give organizations the flexibility to move quickly to focus on innovation to adapt to growth  And I think the proof is in the pudding 150 000 paid customer accounts over a decade of experience  Zendesk is I would say pretty good. Well, let's say darn good at customer experience themselves  No matter what your business needs zendesk products are flexible enough to pave the path that's best for your organization  See for yourself why the best customer experiences are built with zendesk get started at zendesk  Dot com slash twit. That's z-e-n-d-e-s-k dot com  slash t-w-i-t  Thank you zendesk for your support. It's really great to have you on our best of episode  And thank you dear viewer dear listener for supporting us by visiting zendesk.com  Twit that's very important. Uh now we go on with the show  uh  I guess one of the big stories, uh of 10 years ago  Was the ipad  And we celebrated its 10th anniversary this year. We took a look back watch  So this last week was the 10th anniversary of the ipad I thought the ipad was a pretty good thing  I like my ipad apparently i'm, uh, i'm a loser  everybody agrees  the ipad  Ben thompson the headline on strategicery the tragic ipad  uh  john gruber  It's a disappointment even in this, uh, even in this uh thing davinder that you and everybody else got to do  But I wasn't invited to the jason stel does the uh, apple report card you what he gave in the ipad the d plus or something  I thought the ipad was pretty good. What's wrong with the ipad?

End time: 1474.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  What'd you give it what'd you give it davinder I didn't I I forget you don't remember it in the in the report card, but  It does seem like we should at least give the ipad credit for being the lab the tablet that survived  You know was the thing that inspired everybody to make tablets and now like  There there there are certainly very few android tablets. I think are worth buying  um  Microsoft took the strategy of like trying to turn windows into the tablet thing so  Convertible pcs technically are tablet like but I still don't like the way windows handles tablet stuff  So, you know the ipad is the only successful tablet and that makes a lot of sense  It's been doing good business for them. I think where apple falters is in terms of like supporting  Multitasking they were slow to that they were slow to like turning the ipad into a usable computing platform, but as a tablet  um, you know, I think they deserve credit for at least being successful and  You know trying to push things forward. I will tell you what you said

Transcript:  B plus sounds about right and certainly like as of last year or two years ago when the base ipad was like 230 bucks  It's like yeah, you should have one. I have one. Yeah, like it's uh, everybody should have one  That was the first ipad I bought myself too and I bought it specifically so my parents can facetime my baby daughter  And it's been perfect for that. So every night at dinner time hit a button  You know go straight to my mom's phone or my dad's phone and they get to see  Sophia every single night and that is far easier than most other solutions out there

Transcript:  one thing a lot of people agreed on including ben thompson and john gruber is the  Multitasking the split screen in the slide over  They they they seem to agree that that's very poorly implemented  Um, I think everybody on macbreak weekly said yeah, they should just dump the multitasking  Because it doesn't work very well and this they're they blame this not on steve jobs whose original conception  They think was right on I would agree  but on subsequent  Software developers over the years  I think how we could blame sorry we can we can blame  Who's who's who's the scapegoat everybody apple blames for everything wrong with apple? He was fired. I can't remember his name  Oh, we got rid of him. He's johnny. I know maybe you could blame johnny now. We blame johnny. I for a lot. Yeah

It's all scott's fault  Uh ipad pro though great hardware like we've loved the hardware. It's been well reviewed  Uh, you know since they launched that thing and certainly in the most recent years like it's beautiful  But the software has always been slow to catch up to that hardware  So apple they've been lagging on mac os software and ios too like they they have a lot of software innovation  They really need to focus on but the ipad as a computer replacement  I think a lot of people I talk to even tech journalists some people use that for all they do, you know for image editing for reporting  I personally couldn't live that way  But it certainly it would be great for like a weekend way to go and just write a long thing and not have to worry too

So expensive if like all of us  Somebody's buying you  This stuff, uh, you can have an iphone an apple  uh  Macbook a windows machine an ipad  And then it kind of all is a continuum of stuff and you use the right thing for the right time  But if you had to only choose one probably wouldn't be the ipad  Right and that and normal people have to choose one.

So they all had old eyes and young faces, which was very weird  And then the other thing it was very hard to do and I guess they brought in movement coaches  But you don't move the same when you're in your 80s as you did when you were in your 40s  So there's there's one scene where robert de niro is taking a handgun and throwing it in the bay as one does  Uh to get rid of the evidence and he has to go over these rocks  And you just want to leap out and say careful grandpa  He's just a little he's just you just can tell he's not a 40 year old guy

Well, yeah, it's it's because it's really dustin  His 30s wearing a lot of makeup  Too bad makeup doesn't work the other way. Yeah, you can't d you can't de-age people. What can you maybe you can

It would it would look like a bigger swing than it actually was  How long like you know deniro had such a great performance in godfather 2 as a young mario  Right, so it's like that to me is like I I point to that every time people go wow de-aging and i'm like

It was like they were very non-specific lines and you could tell  If if you're in production, you could really tell that they rode around a lot of that. Okay  But but they did one sequence that de-aged her and mark hamill  To the events of shortly after return of the jedi. Was it believable?  It was okay, it wasn't great, um, but it was also kind of like it was quick enough that it was like, okay  That was fine. But if they had used it the way that they did with, uh,  Grand moff tarken in rogue one.

I think it's different in films  because there's a there are other elements of illusion of play there but with  Um with with politics in particular not to go back to uh the start of the show again  Um, I think that's where it gets particularly worrying because then they don't have to be absolutely perfect for somebody who wants to believe  What they're seeing is true to believe that it is true and then to spread it as if it was  Um, and for that it doesn't need perfection  And that's why I think we're kind of already there and why it's already scary.

I don't know  Maybe the biggest story in tech this year  Was covid of course, but the effect covid had on a little company very few people had heard of  That suddenly became a generic term for video conferencing. I'm talking about  zoom  The world has changed  It's very in so many unusual and interesting ways  Of course a lot of people who weren't using zoom all of a sudden are using zoom which is  I would guess the number one  video conferencing technology  Zoom says they went from 10 million daily active users in december to 200 million last month  And of course as a result, we're seeing all sorts of problems

Transcript:  well, uh, here's an interesting  story zoom bombing is now a federal offense  that could result in  Imprisonment. I don't know if that's reduced the number of zoom bombs federal prosecutors are saying  That if it was posted as a press release to the department of justice website of the u.s attorney's office  For this for the eastern district  uh of um, I don't know what state of some state  With support from the state attorney general and the fbi probably new york. I would guess that that the most aggressive in something like this  Um zoom bombing is a big problem for schools for churches  Uh, I have a friend in a 12-step program recovery program and of course they can't meet in person anymore  They do their meetings as zooms and meetings and because they're public of necessity  Uh, anybody can come in and people are doing horrific  offensive triggering things  Not just pornography not just racial epithets, but intentionally going after alcoholics things like that  It's it's just appalling and it's my understanding that a lot of the organizing is going on  I'm sure it's happening at four chan nine chan  Discourses being used. There's a discourse channel for zoom bombing where they share  public  Ids for zoom events so that they can all have so much fun. It's just shocking really how awful some people can be

Maybe I don't want to bother with it at all  And so I like sent her like a detailed thing  I took the time to take the screenshots and go through the process  I was like this is how you can join from your web browser. Just that's going to be your best bet  You know, don't sign up for an account. Don't do the other things  But I was really proud of her a for reading and keeping up on it and be like asking  Okay, what's the best way for me to do this? It's all over the place

Should I be using this and like part of me wants to be like no don't use this at all  And another part of me is like yeah, but I don't want you to miss out on being able to connect with people  You know, that's that's to me  I think the hard thing about having the advice to just be don't use this product if you're an enterprise or a school  Or something. I think that's one thing where maybe you should appeal to the higher authorities who make those decisions to say  Have you actually vetted this but if the decision's already been made and this is what your school is using or your bible study or your  you know, um  You know a a meeting or something else. That's what they're choosing to do  It's a really I think not fair thing to say to regular people. We'll just opt out of this  Just don't use this this communications. It's the same thing when people say oh, well just don't be on facebook  You know where it's like, okay, that's that's really that comes from a really privileged position to be able to make that point

Transcript:  Yeah, totally. Yeah, and the thing about zoom look, there's still lots of great things about zoom  It's funny. We used to have up until the last couple years  I've even been saying really until the last like 18 to 24 months when zoom has kind of gotten much more popular  We used to have this joke  for the last uh  Four or five years of you know, we've got now we've got self-driving cars  But we still can't get a video call to work and we still can't get a powerpoint, you know  And zoom really has kind of solved that um, it has gotten to where  Uh, it's made these things easy enough that you can get a lot of people connected  um, I agree with christina it used people shouldn't be too freaked out about it, obviously  The nsa shouldn't be using it for uh, you know, uh, and and some companies that are doing corporate secrets, you know, you saw  SpaceX say that they're um, you know, they banned it. Well, that makes sense. They're dealing with highly proprietary  and sensitive information, right that that deals with their core business, so  That makes perfect sense for the average people, you know stuff. I I had a friend that yesterday  Did their uh on their zoom?  they did a their sister's baby shower and it was amazing and she talked about the fact that  What it's enabling them to do and I did one this wonderful organization called interfaith paths to peace because a lot of  Um, uh, you know a lot of religious organizations, they don't really have tech departments  And so this organization has helped sort of provide a platform using zoom where people of different faiths can come together and  You know have fellowship and be able to worship together and get inspiration  So there's great things that are going on with zoom the thing where the the onus is is  The people who are hosting these meetings, they just need to implement a few good things  brian mentioned the  Password thing which now zoom is kind of imposing  You can still send somebody a zoom link with that password essentially embedded in that link  And so it makes it easy for them to just click and join  But if somebody's doing that random looking, you know typing in random zoom numbers or finding, you know random  zoom  Rooms to jump into they can't get in if they don't have the password and even then if you set up a waiting room  The host of a zoom can help kind of screen people and if they see people that are jumping in and are being  Impropriate you can hit the remove or you know jump them back to the waiting room if for some reason it's somebody you  Don't recognize so there's plenty of ways to mitigate this for most people that are using zoom  It's just that the people who are using it and we're considering using it to do very proprietary things  They obviously need to to think twice about it  But by the same token, it's still better than like we used to do these calls  Where you know you have your just your number you dial into an 800 number and then you put in your corporate sort of  Nine-digit id well, the thing is we never knew who was on those calls with zoom  At least you can see who is on there  And so it is generally even more secure even as insecure it is right now the problems it has with encryption  And those kinds of things it's still a step up from the average conference call

Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's a great question and  I actually disagree  I I disagree with zoom zoom says that they were an enterprise product that is now being used by consumers  I I will I will say I think that's patently false and I think they're being misleading when they say that  They may have had some specific enterprise, you know implementations like apparently they have one for HIPAA  But the vast majority of the the times that I was using zoom was either for small teams things  I saw a lot of startups using it individuals kind of wanting an easy way to set up conferencing systems  Um or or hobbyists, you know, so I think that really most of their users before this were  Small businesses startups maybe medium-sized business places that don't have cios and ctos

Transcript:  Yeah, so I I don't think it was yeah exactly  It's very much like slack in that sense and a lot of people use slack and zoom together  And so I actually reject their statement that it was enterprise because I don't think it was if it was enterprise  To your point brian, we wouldn't have seen some of these things because that would have been a complete like, you know breaker  What I think has happened though is that as there were companies even big companies that might not have had solutions  That worked for this number of people like one of the big frankly like this secret soft of zoom  Not just its ease of use but also its quality and its its relative ease for having very large groups of video chat working together  In a way that web acts and some of the other solutions just can't do  And and to my to my knowledge  There's still the only you know solution where you can see kind of everyone's video at once  In that kind of style and I know that some other products are working at bringing that type of feature  Up but but they're the only one who does it. There's a great actually there's a great open source solution

Transcript:  Depends on bandwidth that you have available to it. It can use it can do 100 people easily in fact  I've seen bandwidth tests with jitsi. It's very light on the cpu usage. It's really about bandwidth  The thing to remember with any service is for a video service to work  In the especially in the way you want where you have the the grid of people  You have to have it unencrypted at the server  side and so when  Zoom says it's end-to-end encrypted that's not in the same way we understand end-to-end which means no one can see it except the participants  Zoom can see it jitsi is the same way you you can your it's it's encrypted  But but at some point the server needs to coordinate so it needs to be unencrypted  But the beauty is jitsi is it's open source. You can run your own server. I am and then it is fully private  There's no one can see it. It has it, you know  It has some of the same problems zoom would have you still have to set up a password if you want to protect it  And that's the big problem for churches for schools  Maybe not so much schools, but certainly for churches and and recovery groups and groups that want to be public  You can set up a waiting room  You can do all sorts of things  But ultimately you can't lock it down because you want anybody who be able  You know who wants to come to the meeting come to the meeting and so that's the problem people are having  And that would be the same problem with I think any service  And I think what happened though, I first hated zoom in  months ago  When they had that problem and a security researcher warned them about this with malware they installed  on the mac a web server  A hidden web server that would run all the time on your mac  Their their idea was of course you should be able to just click a link and zoom would launch  But this hidden web server did not go away when you uninstalled zoom it stayed there  Again, so that even if you uninstalled zoom you click a link zoom behind the scenes does what it needs to do to get  Get a thing going  And and hackers discovered it and started using it to inject malware into macintoshes  Zoom had been warned about this dragged their feet fixing it apple finally had to push out a fix on their own  Apple actually had to push out a malware fix on macintoshes because zoom wouldn't fix it that now zoom says  You know in their credit, I guess that they're going to stop they said this this week  They're going to stop working on new features  Everybody on the zoom team is going to work on privacy and security features  So I guess the proof will be in the pudding  But I I lost faith in zoom when they claimed end-to-end encryption when that wasn't the case  And when they didn't fix the server problem, and of course then there've been other reported issues the ios  Version sent data to facebook because they used a facebook sdk zoom stopped doing that  But they only seem to stop this stuff after they get caught they were routing calls through a china call center  They said oops, we did that because we were so loaded up. Oops. Well, we won't do that anymore  I don't know. I'm not against zoom. I and i've tried by the way, we use it for all our sales calls  I've tried to get lisa. I said, you know, there's I have this great jitsi server  You could use this it even has our brand in the name because I set up a domain for it  So now zoom everybody knows zoom everybody knows zoom and it's hard to get people to use something else  So i'm hoping zoom will step up there. There's an opportunity here for them to step up

Transcript:  I'm hoping they are too  But i'll i'm with you look when the thing happened last summer with them installing the web server and honestly  It was their response to that that really bothered me more than it was even the act itself that initially they they barred the the security researcher  They wouldn't communicate they tried to kind of sweep it under the rug say that it wasn't a big deal  And then once they were properly chastened they had a belated apology and the whole thing put a bad taste in my mouth  And it was very facebooky

Transcript:  And our team had been using zoom and after that we were like we're done. We're not using this anymore  And so I was done with it then but again if someone else wants to use it for something i'm not going to be like  Zellotus about like oh I refuse to to use the system you want to do what bothers me now though  And and this is the thing that bothers me from  All the different issues they've had is that a I think that one of the reasons that we're seeing this is because they've gone  From 10 million to 200 million users. So they're getting an outsized, you know amount of attention  And I think if you put this attention on any sort of service you would see  You would also be able to find flaws, right?  But but the thing that bothers me is that they have this amazing  Differentiator in in the irc right now  We're kind of all talking about how the system hasn't changed in 22 years and they're all terrible and that's basically true  Zoom has been the first thing that works really well. It's easy to set up  I think the reason you saw businesses enterprises who maybe normally would have gone through a stronger vetting process  Not go through that process is they suddenly had to be remote for the first time  And needed to support a large number of people and just started with it  Right, so I think that's another reason why it's had so much adoption, but they have this huge differentiator  They are easy to use. It's well done. It has good features. It's high quality  That's something that is a massive differentiator and rather than using that as the selling point and rather than using that  As what they want to focus on everything that they've done  It seems like has been in you know  Search of like sort of growth hacking and and kind of cutting corners  And it makes me question a lot of fundamental things about the company. I love the product but i'm not  To be totally honest, i'm not convinced by even that the latest blog post that the ceo put out  I I don't really feel like I believe anything  I don't feel like they have proven themselves to be trustworthy, which is so disappointing because this is  Genuinely a product that is head and shoulders of bed of the competition  And I feel like they're squandering a lot of this by honestly going after ways to growth hack a lot of the things that make zoom

It does let's encrypt automatically  You're done. It was so easy for me to set up. It was trivial  I agree many businesses aren't going to want to do that, but you don't have to do that  I could set up watch i'll just i'll send you a link right now. You can try it go to twitter

Transcript:  Yeah, no, I think that the the the comparison to early facebook is especially  I think poignant because of they were it was it was very much like you say move fast break things innovate  Create a great product and you apologize later when we make some mistakes  Not a great business model. I think oh, you know facebook is  Is finally feeling the pain of that from a user standpoint and and it's likely to although there has been  some  Indication that more some of the people who've left facebook are going back during this time  But also people have a ton of time on their hands.

We know what's wrong with it. We know in great detail  What's wrong with it?  And yet I mean I had a we had a family  Meeting on friday and I tried to use my server my jitsi and one one member couldn't get it working  So we we went back to zoom  For geeks, it's easy to say. Oh, yeah, here's all the reasons. But as you said christina, it's hard  And zoom just works  It's the other side of 5g's calling causing covid it's just don't even get it's just more noise

What is it that people are seeking in this and I think it comes back to certainty?  um five so again like  so they  There's a problem with having too much data  Sometimes too much data is bad and sometimes not enough data is bad too much information is sometimes bad  Not enough information is sometimes bad  That is the current situation that we are living in  And I think with 5g which is kind of like difficult to actually understand  um  You know  I think the problem is you have some people with too much of the wrong information and then a whole bunch of people  With no information. There's no  Center ground where cooler heads prevail

Yeah, remember in 1965  I'm old enough to remember going to the u.s  The new york world's fair and at&t had a video phone. They said, you know by  1970 we'll all be using video phones and I remember in 2001 in 1977 the two movie 2001  He's he's on the moon  He's talking to his daughter and his wife on earth via a video phone in a video phone booth  And it never took off all of a sudden  We're all making video calls. I think yeah this this might have been the impetus  To finally get us over the hump because we didn't want to I think people didn't want to but now they're making video calls  And I don't think we're going to stop.

Transcript:  uh  I was talking yesterday with johnny jett our travel guy  and his thesis was you're not going to see widespread air travel or cruise travel or  maybe even conferences until we have  fast universal testing so that you can  Go to the airport five minutes early  Get a swab or spit in a vial get tested if you pass you can board the plane if not you can't  It was hard to pick just one  But I think the weirdest story  This year about elon was the name he picked for his new  child  And how to pronounce it?  So let's see  I keep wondering if there's going to be any tech news  You know each week I go are we gonna have anything to talk about thank god elon musk exists  X a e a 12  Can't really be the name of the kid  Elon musk and grimes have had a baby. They had a son on monday  They elon tweeted out that strange name  Joe rogan asked him on thursday. How do you say the name?  Musk says the name's pretty much pronounced  x ash a 12 a e some speculated was actually ash. It's a uh,  a leaded a and e  Some languages have and it's often pronounced ash  He's musk said first of all grimes is the one that came up mostly came up with the name. It's just x the letter x  Grimes in her tweet said it's the unknown  x  A is pronounced ash. So obviously the kid's name is ash, right? You're gonna  Just the rest of it is extra and then a 12 elon said is my contribution the a 12 stands for the archangel 12  the precursor  to the sr 71 the blackbird  Which was uh, the phantom spy plane, right?  The coolest plane ever elon said  If you want to hear musk say it, uh, he says at 37 seconds  into joe's show elon did not toke up on the show though. I think right not this time  Holy cow learned his lesson learned his lesson  Anyway, thank you elon for giving us something to talk about that's twit for the week. Thank you everybody. Good. No  I think  And you know the timing is good because we got nothing else to do. This might be the most important week in computing  in  This century for sure  perhaps, uh  I don't know perhaps I don't I can't think of another time with even the mac transition to intel  I don't think was this important  Uh, and of course what i'm talking about is the worldwide developers conference kicked off on monday was going all week  I'm sure that's all you guys have been doing all week long, which is why you're here to fill me in  Uh, I did watch the keynote in the state of the union, which is the more techie kind of follow-up  They did on monday. We even streamed both of those with commentary  And then i've been reading incessantly ever since even to the point where I downloaded xcode  the xcode beta  Picked up, uh, you know the uh, I think I started the stanford cs193 course in ios development  and uh and started to dig into swift ui because I think  We are going to enter a new era of computing and here's here's my  And you tell me you guys could talk me down and say i'm full of it. But my thesis is  We certainly began a new era of computing in 2007 when the iphone came out  We didn't know it at the time but that was going to transform computing all of a sudden  The vast bulk of computing is now done on a thing that's in your pocket. It's always connected to the internet. It's omnipresent  social media facebook and twitter  Were began on the desktop, but really wouldn't be as powerful as they are without the smartphone  That transformed everything and apple became as a result the most valuable company in the history of the world  Now worth close to a hundred a million a trillion and a half dollars  They have hundreds of billions of dollars of cash  They're a behemoth a juggernaut  The ipad which had a lot of promise 10 years ago didn't really seem to take off  But what I think I didn't fully appreciate i'm sure you guys did  But what I didn't fully appreciate is that from day one of the iphone coming out apple was preparing for something different  As certainly once they realized how successful the ipad was apple started preparing with their own chips  They started moving to technologies like metal  They started to do a lot of things that's really accelerated over the last couple of years with things like catalyst to move into a new  world of computing an ecosystem they could utterly  dominate and that with the announcement that they were going to finally abandon  An architecture that's been around since the 70s  x86 1974 x86  And move to apple silicon. This was the for me the piece that would click and the whole thing  We're I seem to come clear to me. We're in a transformational moment. Am I nuts stan moran?

Speaker: SPEAKER_26
Transcript:  I know not at all. I think this is a big deal from the perspective because I mean  The iphone in the earliest days they were still sort of figuring out where it was  But once they started rolling out their own processors  I think it was only a matter of time and  Increasingly in the last several years as they put their own processors in like the apple tv and the home pod and the apple watch  You started to step back and say why isn't this in the mac?  Why is the mac now the only device they make that is running on somebody else's processor when they have done all this amazing work?  Because we would keep seeing when the phones came out, you know  They'd be benchmarking them and these things would be off the charts and you'd be comparing them against laptops  And you'd be like why this this chip in a phone is outpacing this laptop that costs twice as much and is supposedly like  This really powerful device they make why can't they bring that ability over to the mac side as well?  And I think apple has shown time after time that they love controlling the whole  Hardware the hardware the software everything the whole device because they can optimize it to do exactly what they needed to do  and I I think that it is  Fundamentally a huge change obviously for the mac  But it really only solidifies something that we've seen with the iphone and the ipad over the last decade or so and you know famously  I think they you know originally started out wanting to build something like the ipad and the iphone ended up being kind of a diversion  Along the way, which is you know, of course hilarious because it's a huge huge portion of their money now  But yeah, I I think that now that they're putting everything they run on their own custom silicon  I think we've just dipped our toe into what is going to be an enormous change for the mac and that's  Saying something for a platform that's undergone so many transitions in its history

Transcript:  I think it speaks a lot to not just the future of mac  but the future of computing in general because if apple is going to be doing if they're going to be  competing in this space in this processor chip space intel has to do something to to match that so that pc's can can build  You know into the future as well  and this could also really just be a huge improvement for microsoft and  You know all all the other chip makers all the other processor  manufacturers out there to like  Step up your game because now apple's in in the business too  So you don't get to just sit back and be the the kings of of this  Realm because somebody's coming to take your throne, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I I really do wonder about that. Um  You know, it's not necessarily a fait accompli that you know intel will need to step up its game  We've seen microsoft experimenting with windows on arm processors repeatedly. They're back there again now  and  you know, maybe  It's definitely possible if i was microsoft i'd be looking at this and thinking we I want to do what apple did  Maybe not, you know with qualcomm, let's say or something like that  Like why don't we redefine this and get away from intel because intel isn't doing  You know intel isn't working for us either  So I I do think it's really hard. This is you know, the lesson that steve jobs  Learned and then put in apple's culture from a very early point is don't rely on other people  For your critical business infrastructure and you know intel was a convenient  Tool for apple to get out of the power pc alliance and get computers that were actually running at decent speeds when the power pc  Alliance was lagging  But you know the iphone because it wasn't a computer they got to rewrite the rules  They ended up developing their own processors for it and you know, they've been thinking  All this time, you know, what if we could apply this to the mac?  What if we could get away entirely from being on you know?  Because I would wager that a lot of people's frustration with apple's release schedule for a lot of their max the last decade  Has been because apple was waiting for intel you bet and you intel has had a really bad decade  So this is like the logical I think conclusion of what apple learned from the iphone which is  You know, they built essentially the best chip design group in the world  And why would they not press their advantage?  And I I now suspect that the last two or three years of sort of static mac development is because apple's been too busy  Redesigning their next wave of max when they can control all of the parts

Transcript:  What what's happening here? No, they they um, it really seemed to be them repeatedly  Uh, this was the pattern the government will be talking about some emails  They'd have them dead to rights on some anti-competitive behavior something that was just completely indefensible and they'd be like  Oh gosh, I just don't know anything about that  I guess I think what we were trying to say is we're trying to empower users  And they just kept trying to flip it around like um, the other part of it that was so stunning is all four of them  Really kept talking about their companies like they're these nimble  Humble upstarts that just may have made a few mistakes. It's like  Y'all y'all just beat the like the market  Repeatedly because you're all effectively monopolies or duopolies like, you know, you're not this nimble like garage run company anymore  You're real entities and I just um, I I I really thought congress did a pretty good job all the grandstanding  you know

Transcript:  emails  That said from face that internal facebook emails that said, oh, we're really worried about instagram  It's a real threat right before they bought it  Confirming what everyone knows which is that they bought it as a defensive action  Jamie raskin got bezos to admit amazon is our  Priced below market  I mean, I always assumed that amazon probably figured we'll make it up in the  The the transactions it'll go through us as a result same thing with the fire tablets  Um, but I guess it's the problem is from an antitrust point of view  How do you compete with something that's priced below the cost to make it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Products are offered again something everybody has used it new  But it's good to get confirmation. It wasn't just your instinct  They accused amazon  Actually, this was the pop socket guy  And they brought this up who accused amazon of making  Duplicate products to his until he ponied up two million dollars in ad buys and then mysteriously the amazon version the pop sockets disappeared  Jeff bezo said well, I don't know anything about that if we did that was wrong

Transcript:  Actually, I will say one thing that I found astounding very interesting about this hearing is that it showed  Strangely that mark zuckerberg has been through a lot of these he understood how to play it  He understood how to phrase his answers and respond in situations where he wasn't quite sure versus say bezos  Who's never been in this position before floundered a lot? Yeah

Start time: 4907.66
End time: 5026.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I also, you know  Maybe this is just me, but i'm looking at the kind of message that's sent by the way  These by the backdrops these executives had the way they were shot bezos for instance  And right my skype room picked this up on twitter. He said get a ring light jeff  You've got them on sale right now at amazon.com  Jeff was  And I think this was quite intentional  He was so poorly lit that he kind of blended into the background and I think the intent was really to make him  Almost disappear, you know, he's managed to avoid these  Testimony up to now  It's just kind of the you know, and that's in a way that's in a nutshell jeff bezos's way of handling all this  Is he doesn't give interviews? He doesn't testify. He's just sits in the back  But he's definitely the puppet master. There's no question about that. He's he's pulling the strings there will be so the upshot of this  Uh, this is a big showpiece and and yeah members of congress used it to grandstand  But there was a point and the point is there will be a report  From the subcommittee a final report which will probably not come out before the election  Six hearings  385 hours of calls and meetings and most importantly 1.3 million documents from these companies  Lots of lots of legwork done before this testimony  And I think the point of this report is well, here's what we think should happen  things like I don't know what's on the table maybe that facebook should be required to  Divest instagram and whatsapp that i'm almost certain will be one of the things they'll talk about  They they did  Talk to sundar pachai ceo of alphabet and by extension google over a google email  Saying some websites were getting too much traffic. Did you get that email matt?

Start time: 5027.62
End time: 5086.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I I don't recall getting that email  it's interesting because like  I was there when the search team was like eight people around a ping pong table and  Uh, I always saw people acting with a lot of integrity and and trying to make sure that the you know, the results were fair  They were non-partisan if somebody typed in x they get information or an answer about x  But I could I yeah, I haven't seen that email  I'm wondering whether you know  It's also the case that if like eight out of the top 10 results are one site then somebody could send an email that's like oh  This site is dominating the search results in a way that's unfair  And then the shorthand might be this site is getting too much traffic  But I i've personally seen where investigators can ask questions about things that to a search engineer you're like, oh these results are interesting  and then they're like  Are they interesting because you are squashing a competitor and they're like no they're interesting because it's actually got more french results than we would have  Expected given that there aren't that many french queries, you know that sort of thing. That's what makes this so difficult

Start time: 5087.12
End time: 5159.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just the the phrase getting too much traffic doesn't it's not a smoking gun  it  Now the the imputation is it's this site was getting more traffic than our own sites  But it could absolutely just be a failure of oh the algorithms  Putting this result more than it ought to  Pachai's response was congressman just like other businesses. We try to understand trends from data  Which we can see and we can use it to improve our products for users  That was by the way the drumbeat from all of them  But especially for some of our Pachai's we want to improve our products for users  I have to say at the beginning when all four gave their statements  I want to stand up and wave the flag. I want to say yeah, god bless him. This is the engine  Of american the american economy. This is what's moving us forward  This is where innovation is happening that these companies are doing their best to make the best possible product  Uh, as tim cook said I I guess it's true. We aren't dominant in any field  That we participate in we are not even close to dominant. We just try to make the best products for users  And I think to some degree  To take the opposite side from you granite  That's what these companies do and I don't think they should be punished for doing it well

Start time: 5161.08
End time: 5198.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Well, I would actually agree. I thought tim cook  I I think if you wanted to rank who got master blasted in this hearing, I think amazon would be number one  Uh facebook would be number two. I thought google and apple got off relatively unscathed  I did hardly talk to tim actually. Yeah, I I listened to most of the hearing while I was working and uh, you know  The biggest moment with tim cook was him being asked about cancel culture for some asinine reason  So I I I found apple's answers generally  Compelling on this as well as google. So I think I agree with you leo

Start time: 5198.82
End time: 5241.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There'd be a risk for congress to be too aggressive in this  Because especially now  Uh in during covet we are really reliant on technology companies  Yeah, uh  Is it the case do you think may ask parents this is it the case?  That these companies are so big that we don't see the innovative ferment  We used to see I heard one of my colleagues say in the early days we had  We'd be there'd be hundreds of different products from hundreds of different companies  There was nobody one huge dominant player. We had so much to cover now. It's really we cover  Google amazon facebook and apple, you know  Um, do you feel like that's true paris?

Start time: 5242.14
End time: 5308.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_24
Transcript:  Is that fair? I mean  I feel like from a coverage perspective. Yes, just because it is there's so there are so many they're so large  each of them are a world in and of themselves essentially and um  There is a lot to cover within each company much less all of them combined  I mean do I think that translates directly to whether or not?  These companies are monopolies I it's not my position to say but  I think it's  interesting and perhaps  not  the right framework to  Apply here when you're thinking about like a coverage perspective  um, I think that a coverage perspective is always going to be focused on um, like  The biggest players in the room because there just isn't enough energy out there much less funding in media or  Even just from users to have your eyes on everything  but I think that also when you have companies that do  Get so large and do affect so many people  That that warrants criticism and warrants a careful eye

Transcript:  That's exactly what david chicholini. Who's the chair said he said because these companies are so central in our modern life. This was in his opening  Their business practices and decisions have an outsized effect on our economy and democracy  Any single action by any one of these companies can affect hundreds of millions of us in profound and lasting ways  Absolutely. Nobody nobody denies that's why we cover them we cover because they make they change our lives  That not inherently bad  Yeah  What do you think matt? I mean you have the best perspective on google having having worked there  And I would agree with you everybody I ever met from google had just like tim cook had the interest in making the best product  They could

Start time: 5351.80
End time: 5429.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I I think that's true. I also think way back, you know the first like ftc investigation  Like 2011 or whatever, you know the the thing that google would say is we understand that with size comes scrutiny  And I think given the size of all these companies it is perfectly appropriate to scrutinize them  And at the same time it was interesting to see how if you think about like an earlier zuckerberg hearing  The questions were not on point as seen by paris's hat for example  And and the questions like you could tell a bunch of research happened and for me  one of the most interesting things is  How do you get like the idea of lawmakers?  Passing laws to regulate technology when they might not  Perfectly understand some of the issues involved is a little bit scary  And so there's some interesting areas. There's this thing called tech congress, for example, they've got fellowship  Uh applications opening for the next three weeks  So they bring in technologists computer scientists engineers and they sit in the offices of like important members of congress  To help make sure that people understand technology and you can ask the right questions or you can get to the issues that matter  And I think getting more technologists talking to dc and vice versa is probably good for both worlds

Transcript:  One, I mean chicholini was kind of a bulldog  And he bared down on this google issue and this is the one I really want to ask you about matt  the the the the  Claim is that google favorites his own content over other sites content  Uh chicholini put it in I think a very nasty way. So why does google steal content from honest businesses?  And he was pointing at yelp, which maybe not the most honest business i've ever heard of  Um, I think honest business is an oxymoron generally, but they're all trying to and yelp, you know  I mean, let's face it a lot of this scrutiny comes from google competitors who are unhappy with google's success  And and whether in the eu or here and yelp's a good example go. Hey guys, you really ought to look at this. This is  Something terrible but google but it is the case that when you do a google search  Uh, and pachai said this is particularly in commerce when you're buying when you're looking to buy a product  That google's gonna surface shopping information. There's a lot of knowledge cards now  Used to be google search results were just search results now  There's the knowledge card and there's a lot more stuff and a lot of it does have youtube videos youtube, you know google shopping  Google's excuse is we're just giving we're trying to give people the information they're looking for we're trying to answer their  question  Right, man

Start time: 5516.44
End time: 5545.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, that's absolutely right  And I I think the people in the search team still believe that they've internalized that and uh, I also think there's there's  You know tension which is well deserved because as google moves up the value chain of delivering better and better answers  You know, there are some sites, you know from my old world with seo hat on where  You know, uh people would feel like you're taking a snippet from my site  And that's the thing that people really want to know like how high is this celebrity is so they never go to the site?

Start time: 5545.24

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Yeah, so I I do have to say um as someone that watched most of this hearing  We're not just talking about things that that show up in google site results  Like some of the most explosive moments we're talking about  For google's own lyrics that show up on android and they had one particular company that put that out there  They actually put fake records in their lyrics  And you know talked about that when it happened. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Google was caught using that so this isn't

Start time: 5613.14
End time: 5632.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, but google okay, so this is more complicated because google said well we we didn't scrape it from rap genius  We hired a company that's great  So it's not our fault it's that company's fault and I think  At least in google's defense. They stopped doing that but they did get caught red-handed

Start time: 5633.46
End time: 5652.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Sure. Sure. I i'm just saying I think it's a it's a wider pattern of behavior that I think could be  Constructed as anti-competitive and in my opinion if you're using a third-party person and they're  doing something that  Blatant I do think it I think your company should face sanctions in that case

Start time: 5652.28
End time: 5659.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So that's my opinion the problem is it's so hard to figure out. I mean, I think it's a good defense  Well, we're just trying to give people the answer that they expect

Start time: 5661.68
End time: 5704.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_24
Transcript:  Another thing that came up at the hearing which is based on a article written by a couple of my colleagues the information is  kind of the accusations that google  Has used its android platform and the amount of information it can kind of collect on how users using android use apps  in order to  Do research for its own applications. I think the situation that they  My colleagues discussed in their article was  In preparation for launching google's own possible like a tiktok competitor  They pulled data from android about how people use tiktok and android devices which seems  Kind of like a conflict of interest there

Transcript:  Yeah, but and amazon's accused of using retail data to figure out what products it should make  But I think every business in the world would do that does that right? We're trying to figure I guess amazon has a unique access to data  That it wouldn't normally have is that why it's wrong? I  I

Start time: 5730.12

Transcript:  I mean part of the issue is that if you listen to the complaints of  Small like first party sellers or third party sellers on amazon. They say oh  I have been making  This unicorn themed hairbrush for 10 years. Everybody loves my unicorn hairbrush  It's been doing so well. Then all of a sudden I see amazon brand unicorn hairbrush  Appears top of the search results is the amazon choice and nobody buys my unicorn hairbrush anymore  That's a good complaint in situations like that  It seems uh, I don't know to be a fairly concerning

Start time: 5764.96
End time: 5803.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Practice of true. This is the same problem. I have with google owning youtube and amazon selling stuff  Is it mixes the two things?  Together if google were just a search engine  It wouldn't be so much of a problem except that it controls one of the the number one  deliver of video content  So that kind of muddles the matter amazon  uh  If it's going to do what it's do shouldn't also be in the business of making these products  Because they have an unusual amount of information. I mean face it, you know, I  I bought this hygiene hand on kickstarter  Which which shows that i'm an idiot

I have the fancy one  It's just a piece of metal that you poke stuff with it's not it shouldn't be expensive  But but the point is they didn't need amazon data to do that that happens all the time  Yeah, uh, you know I bought  Well, okay  Don't judge me, but I bought led light up eyelashes

I have a problem with kickstarter as soon as it went on kickstarter  Um, this poor guy vietnamese guy, uh got undercut by 100 chinese companies  Selling, I mean they said well we can do that. What's there's nothing special about that  And so as a result, uh, I didn't get my f lashes  for months  But everybody else and at the party had them so I feel  Your lashes feel dark and unilluminated.

Transcript:  Do that quick. I I get your point. I I really do. It's complicated  It is complicated and in this particular case my husband does patent law and I would so we're coming to me with this particular business plan  I would say  What you have in front of you is not novel in a way that it can be patented according to our laws  And you should understand that this is a business threat  That's reasonable. I do think that's a slightly different situation than someone  than a company  Abusing their data to undercut competitors and threaten other companies, which is what came out in this hearing  So I I think I I really agree with you matt the the way forward is these are big companies  They deserve scrutiny and I think you can never say often enough, you know, who wasn't at this hearing today  It's microsoft. We brought that case against them in the 90s and they have  Been a pretty ethical company generally speaking in the two decades since three decades now, I guess three two and a half

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  What i've heard from my friends that work at microsoft over and over and over again is that that fundamentally changed the culture  Interesting and that there was more of an anything goes approach before then  And then they finally had a conversation where it had to go through legal  They had to have discussions if it was going to open them up to liability. So  My opinion is this is all checks and balances, right?  If if the not talking about trump but a generic president were to do something that was over the line congress checks them  That doesn't necessarily mean the presidency itself is corrupt. It's just a system meant to check each other  I I think until we see stronger anti-trust actions against um  Against tech companies. I think they're going to feel free to just keep pushing the line harder and harder  So I strongly support this line of investigation

That's a story that won't end for some time  Part of that story and it's a weird one  Is the president?  and tiktok  this is one  I don't know if we'll ever see the end of this watch  So the president has wanted to ban a tiktok  He couldn't figure out a way to do it  But I think he's might have found a way with executive order. He's going to prohibit  Americans from having any transactions with the parent company bite dance  starting september 20th  That means a tiktok can't pay influencers  Advertisers can't buy ads tiktok's response to that is we will help  Influencers move to another platform. We will pay it will make sure that everybody we owe money to gets paid before september 20th  the plan b  And it's very unclear because the president goes back and forth on this  Is to have some american company acquire  At least the american operations of tiktok microsoft's been negotiating to buy the australian american  canadian and i think uk writes  to tiktok

So apparently tiktok is now a national emergency  Uh, not covid 19 not russian efforts to influence the election  uh, sometimes I feel like maybe this is  I feel like there's a larger agenda from the white house. It has to do with the trade war  It has to do pay with pay no attention to russia  I'm not celebrating the chinese government. Uh, they're repressive what they've done. The wiggers is shocking and disappointing and  You know, it you know horrible  Um, and and there was some evidence that maybe tiktok was doing something to  Uh keep black creators down or to keep overweight people, although I see plenty of overweight people on tiktok now  So they clearly fixed that algorithm  um, I  I just don't see tiktok as that big of a threat  and I  I'm a little disappointed for the creators who found this incredible medium to make something  Really amazing  And I often even feel like maybe the president doesn't like the fact that he's being made fun of on tiktok and that  tiktokers bought uh registered for his tulsa  uh  Campaign rally didn't show up and it seems to be personal

You're on uk tiktok  Can we not see each other anymore? Can we but the data is stored somewhere else?

There are some serious threats that are being completely ignored from russia  on facebook and twitter that are just being  downplayed and ignored while while tiktok seems to be the poster child for problems and incidentally it won't stop with tiktok  This is really about  Chinese products and chinese apps and well, it's that is really challenging

I think australia and a couple other countries because ironically  They didn't trust necessarily chinese or u.s servers because they didn't feel like they had their best  Uh, you know everything good fisa warrants and things like that  They didn't feel like they had the best interests of their citizens  In mind, and I think we're still going to see an upswell of data repatriation laws

This is the fragmentation of the internet  This is what we've been talking about at twit for the last decade, which is you've got the great firewall of china  They're doing that in russia. They're doing that in saudi arabia. They're doing that in venezuela  we now have a  Administration that wants to do the same thing in the united states. I don't think it's right

That's where we're headed  Actually the reason we're here armed  Whoa  I didn't know the gun was loaded. The reason we're here armed a lot of americans say that yeah  Is uh, whoa is because uh, you can't play fortnite on ios anymore  Or android I get it's hard to hit the camera. Let me just see if I can really  See  We'll get there  Um  fortnite clearly  was itching for a fight  and decided to  Take this time  to modify the in-app purchases on its app both on ios and android  in order to get  pulled down on both  at which point  They released a video that oddly they had just ready to hand  called  1980 fortnite  That may remind you a little bit of a video  That we saw in 1984  People sitting watching a giant screen a young woman with well, it's not a sledgehammer. Actually, it's a unicorn hobby horse  And she's running away from the police she arrives and tosses it  Through the screen  Which smashes  And then epic games has defied  The app store monopoly in retaliation apple is blocking fortnite from one billion devices join the fight to stop 2020  from being  Free fortnite they were ready. They also went to court  Saw a an injunction  uh  They did the same thing to google. They didn't have a video ready for google. I don't know  Maybe they thought google wouldn't pay any attention. You may remember that tim sweney of epic  Didn't put fortnite on the google play store at first saying you should side load it because we don't want to pay the 30  30 eventually they gave in  Mike is there  legal merit  In what epic is doing will they prevail in court or can they?

Uh, that doesn't mean they you know that they won't win they might  But if I were taking odds on whether or not epic would prevail I would say  They are unlikely to prevail though. I was impressed. Not only did they have that 1984 video  They actually referenced 1984 in the complaint so that their marketing and legal team  Oh, they don't it's a 60 page complaint. I don't think they wrote that overnight. No, no, no  No, they had but but it's impressive. Not only did they have it ready but that they had worked out with the marketing

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  and I mean part of the the  The thing that's interesting about it, I guess is that you know, if you look at it from apple's perspective  They were going to be in trouble no matter which decision they made right if they sort of let fortnight get away with this  Then everybody else would be complaining that oh, you know  They're giving sort of special treatment to fortnight and then of course when they say well fortnight is violating the rules  So therefore we're gonna we're gonna hold them from the store then they have all these other issues  So no matter which way it was going to go like apple  You know didn't have any good choices and I guess google was picking sides and decided they were gonna  Realizing that if apple loses they're going to be in trouble, too.

Transcript:  apple of course is already  under the gun  in the eu over  app store  Monopoly in the united states tim cook was brought up in front of congress along with three other executives as you know a  couple of weeks ago and that was  You know one of the issues that congress was interested in the antitrust subcommittee  Will have a report probably not till the end of the year or early next year about this  But there's some concern the ftc is looking into it  That maybe apple is  Monopolistic on the on the other hand and i'll give this argument so you guys don't have to  a lot of  People I know say hey apple it's as if apple built  a great mall  And forever 21 moved in and said well, but we don't want to pay you any rent. We just want to be in your mall  They're they're they're freeloading epic's freeloading  On what apple has built with its platform and its store. Do you agree amy? Does that seem reasonable?

Start time: 6834.12
End time: 6873.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Yeah, so this is there's a there's a couple of things happening here one  We don't have a clear definition for  What the future of distribution would look like so  what's interesting about  I think it's interesting that epic is trying to initiate an antitrust  battle  because the the the hearing that happened a week ago or two weeks ago  um  reflects lawmakers sort of scrambling to  First of all group together companies that really are doing disparate things and second of all using  Policy that was written in 1890. So the sherman act was written

End time: 6912.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Right, but this is important because there's very little  substantive analogy to make  About the means for distribution  In a digital setting and the railroad system  um, so  That being said, um  This is an interesting this could be an interesting and possible possibly the only way to really crack  Um crack through and that's because this is a limited circumstance so apple charging 30 percent  If you look at other industries that percentage of roughshare is higher than than what you would see elsewhere

Start time: 6912.94
End time: 6937.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not though higher than  On the consoles sony microsoft and nintendo  charge the same  30 percent fee and have the same control this all dates back to the days when atari and nintendo were swapped by crappy games  And they learned very early on we got to keep tight control over what's on our console  Fortnite doesn't seem it doesn't seem to mind that 30 percent

Start time: 6938.72
End time: 6996.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  No, it's the it's the data on the other end  So the key difference here is that when you've got a console game with with heavy drm protections, you know  You're talking about a limited you're talking about limited use case now with a game being on a different type of device  one that hinges on the play store and and you know an apple store  There's a wealth of other data  there and so I think if they were  It depends it really depends if they try to define antitrust very narrowly  I think they have a shot. I think it could be more compelling for them to talk about  the future of all of this data that's being generated  And the fact that that that in and of itself is also, you know  But that has value  And they can't easily access those data  In addition to having to pay the the fees and you can't you know, there is no other way to play fortnight  You either have to jailbreak and I guess somehow

Transcript:  So I think I think google had I don't think I was as strong of a case against google, but the reality is that google  You know facebook amazon and apple are all facing some flavor of antitrust  and the blanket  Application we already know doesn't apply  So what's interesting here is epic could force the hand of apple and start to change parts of the industry

Start time: 7025.38
End time: 7053.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What is the so apple's response to this by the way, let me let me  paraphrase it is  This is disingenuous of epic they've had  Apps on our app store for 10 years. They've benefited from their presence on the app store for 10 years  Now apple says epic's business interests lead it to push for a special arrangement that would be unfair to other  developers  Whose reputation is more at risk here epics or apple's ian?

Start time: 7054.70
End time: 7086.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, honestly, I think this is a really interesting case because I mean, let's face it  You don't get fortnight because it's on the apple store you get fortnight because it's a really good game  And apple has said they run a closed ecosystem if you want apps on our phones or on our hardware  You have to go through us and that seems blatantly anti-competitive. I admit i'm a foreigner over here and but even so  I mean, what does that have anything to do with anything?

Transcript:  So there's an there's another copyright scholar colleague of larry's a guy named james boyle  Uh from duke university who has a really good riff about this which is that before the term ecology was coined  There were people who cared about like owls and people who cared about the ozone layer  And while they didn't like hate each other  They didn't really see themselves as fighting in the same fight  They were they were issue-based campaigners and the term ecology said that like yes, you're interested in owls and i'm interested in the ozone layer  But what we're both fighting for is ecology  And it it took you know, a thousand different issues and turned it into a movement with a thousand ways in  And movements get stuff done  And so in terms of monopoly and like it's opposite pluralism, which is why you know these days in the pluralistic dotnet  In terms of of monopoly  There are people who are really worried about monopoly even if they don't care about tech and they don't know it  But they're all on the same side  You know, I take off my glasses and it says made in italy because they're all over people's glasses and all over people's is  a subsidiary of a company called luxottica which has bought every single eyewear brand you've ever heard of as well as  lenscrafters target optical sears optical the major lens manufacturer and  Sunglass hut. Yeah, they own oakley. They own every versace. They own every brand you've ever heard of  They've raised prices a thousand percent in ten years if you need prescription glasses  You care about monopoly even if you don't know it yet  And then like, you know people who watch john hodl it is really like the frog in the boiling water because

Transcript:  But there's a lot of people who have more urgent causes right?  Like if you're a pro wrestling fan  Then you might have noticed in the last couple of years that all the wrestlers you love are begging on go fund me for money  To pay their medical bills so they can die with dignity in their 50s when they work related injuries  And it's because vince mcmahon bought all the other wrestling leagues there used to be 30 now. There's one  He's he's reframed all of his workers as contractors and he took away their health insurance  And so wrestling fans also have common cause and it's like it's like ozone layer and owls, right?  There were people who cared about the ozone layer. They didn't really understand what was going on with the owls  They knew that there was something really bad going on with the ozone layer when they heard about the owls  They're like that's really alarming, but i'm focused on the ozone layer and it wasn't until we got into ecology rather than issues  That people were able to say  We're all fighting for the same thing and like even though the way i'm fighting for it is by working on the ozone layer  I'm going to support the ecology movement per se and we are on the brink of people who worried about  You know concentration in meat packing all of a sudden that became pretty salient this year, right as they as slaughterhouses also became charnel houses  Where meat packers were dying and sickening due to a massive concentration in the sector that allows them to treat their workers really badly  Chicken farmers have some of the highest suicide rate in the country  It's because there's there's only three major chicken packers left  And there's a process that they use called chickenization for their labor force where the farmers are technically independent workers  But they have to buy the coop that the that purdue tells them to buy  They have to buy the feed they have to use the medicine  They have to put the chickens on the lighting schedule that purdue specifies and then purdue  Tells them how much they're going to pay at the very end and they get to calculate it  So it's just enough to keep them growing chickens, but not enough to let them go ahead  And if that sounds familiar, it's because it's the same thing that uber drivers have to deal with  So every sector is facing this kind of both monopoly and monopsony where you have a buyer who's concentrated all the power  Among their suppliers and you also have a seller who's concentrated all the power among the consumers  And and it's like an hourglass and there are these people who are manning the pinch between the two bulbs  And you know, we like to think that those of us on this side of the bulb have nothing to come with those of us  On that side of the bulb. It's not true. We're like we're all on the same side  We're on the side of people who want to get rid of the people in the middle running the pinch  And this is how we got trust busting, you know, a hundred years ago  This is how we got the new deal is that people woke up one day and they said  Standard oil is the same problem as the rail trust is the same problem as the electricity trust is the same problem as at&t  Is the same problem as a&p and they got together and they made common cause and you know  We're coming to that moment again, or at least that's how I think we can find our way out of it

It's the same thing with  Um hospitals right like the reason that hospitals are as brittle as they are  The reason our medical system is as brittle as it is is because private equity funds have been buying and merging hospitals  And making them more and more debt loaded laying off primary staff and hiring them back as contractors  Doing all the stuff they did that made toys or us into a failing business except  It's our entire health care system such as it is in this country

Nobody's for pollution, but you change it to climate change  Well now we can have a debate  and uh, so so there are all sorts of techniques  that the people in power use to keep  us from uh  Revolting against the chickenization of the world  Uh, very interesting stuff.

I can learn something too. I was taking notes  I got spellings to check up on after the show. So I got I got some work to do  Get myself together this episode  But um, I get a lot of emails from people after i'm on this show and uh,  Most of them are great. Some people yell at me and they have a problem with me  And I fully understand how they can seem that like i'm so angry or some people think i'm too happy  So I just want to tell you one experience of mine  So that you understand like the climate that we're in in the world when you see people get frustrated and they lash out. Okay  I'm doing pretty well for myself at a certain point in time. I say i'm gonna buy a big house  I buy a big house in a nice neighborhood  3000 square feet three car garage  It's only me and my daughter, but I feel like I deserve it  So I get it in the three years I lived there  I got pulled over 87 times in that neighborhood or generally around that area. I only got six tickets  So you do the math on how many times I was pulled over for no reason just because I had a nice car  And I look like I look and i'm in a nice area  Back when sandy hit a big storm people kind of know about it. The power went out of my house  I wanted to go stay at a friend's house in philadelphia. I come back home. My house is robbed  50 000 with equipment my computers my cameras all the stuff that I do and use to make a living for myself  We're all gone. They left the tv's on the wall because I guess they couldn't get them out  But everything else of electronic value was gone  Um, I didn't call the police out to my home. I went to the police station to file a report  The detective as he's taken down the report  He said well, why didn't you call us out to the house?  And I said i've seen videos of people calling police when their home has been invaded and they've been shot  And he looked at me and said fair point  Oh my god, I took down the police report  Took down the police report  I filed my insurance company  now  Sadly for me they did take my safe which had a lot of my receipts the paperwork receipts in there  And I had copies of them scanned in the cloud  But the insurance company kind of screwed me out of 60 000 of equipment because they said that I could falsify these documents that were scanned  Because I don't have the paper documentation  So I get really frustrated with my life. I think to myself i've been pulled over so many times in this nice beautiful home  It's too big for me. Anyway, i'm going to sell it take a loss and move  As i'm packing up to move with my daughter you have the door open. Have you ever moved out of a place?  I left the door open because i'm coming in and out  I come downstairs  There's 12 cops outside my house. She's 11 in the front. No 10 in the front two in the back  guns drawn  Sorry, do you have idea? What are you doing here? Blah blah blah blah. I said, whoa, what's going on?  Like oh we've had a lot of robberies on the street. I'm like, yeah, I know i'm one of the people  Well, I need your life's rest. What do you need my life? There's moving boxes here. I'm packing up with my child  Why do you why do I have to get you my id?  Now mind you all these people have guns in their hands and they're all very anxious and i'm just like dude  My detective's name is detective his actual name is michael jackson funny enough. His name is michael jackson  How would I know the detective like  I've had a gun pulled on me by cops four times in my lifetime the first time  I was 11 years old and it took another cop to come and grab that cop and say hey  This is a kid put your gun down  So I do know there's crazy people that shouldn't have guns and there's good people that have common sense working in that business  But I take it back to where I was living at in that time frame  Lost everything still got harassed  But you would know that I come on this show and I make jokes and I have fun and I just do what I got to  Do and i'm ranting and raving and josh josh jockeying because that's the way I have to live my life  And those are the things I have to do on a regular basis  So when you see things out in the world, you wonder why people get so upset  It's because i'm not the only person who gets pulled over all the time for no reason  I'm not the only person who gets harassed for no reason. I'm not the only person who's had a gun pulled on them  For literally no reason  But I have to go on about my day and be thankful and say sorry. Yes, sir. No, sir and tell the lie  And I say that to say tomorrow i'm putting up a video from two years ago from me and aunt that I've recorded  Because I got so depressed and all my stuff got stolen. I never posted it  But i'm trying to be in my chat week bozeman and tell you again to do better even though I built myself back up  I got all my cameras back got all my lenses back. I worked hard. I bought new stuff  I got a new insurance company  And i've got myself back on my feet  But you can do the same thing too. So if you're having a bad day you're down  I know somebody tweeted me earlier and said that seemed like i'm sad  I'm really sad about this bozeman thing because I really think to myself i'm fat i'm overweight and i'm living in a pandemic  I could die any day and I should be doing more so again I encourage you to do more and if you're still listening  I know you care enough to at least try for yourself  I'm your boy. I'm just gonna kill doctor another twits in the can. Gotcha. Uncle leo bless you doctor god. We love you

Finally started live streaming instead of you know  They'd put it up on youtube so the public could watch  Yeah, and so we wouldn't have to go to engage it to see uh, what's going on. Yeah, there's still some live blog  24 live blog.com real time infrastructure for today's newsroom  So there are still some businesses doing that  It's fun when you can get all of these  Segments together. It's really fun to see the breadth the depth the fascinating conversations the really great panelists  We have on twitter twitter is the one show  We do  All week long that has a rotating cast and the reason I do it that way is because  There are too many people I want to talk to every week  And they're too many shows I want to do so with twit i'm able to each week  Try a different bunch of people bring them together. We get great conversations sometimes bring in experts on the topics that  Everybody was talking about that week. Sometimes we just bring in somebody because it's time to have some  Fun but every week on twitter is I think  Well worth listening to I hope so. I feel that way. I hope you do too  Thank you for being with us all year. I look forward to a very interesting and let's hope  Uh, healthy  2021 have a wonderful holiday. It's been great so far.
