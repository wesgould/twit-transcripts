Nice to see you, Katie. I can't do what I do to Mark Millian  with Bloomberg View.  Bloomberg View doesn't lend itself to that, unfortunately.

Transcript:  I'll guarantee you that.  So I think it's appropriate to begin with the Ellen Pau decision.  Ellen Pau  sued Kleiner Perkins, one of the big venture capitalists,  probably one of the biggest, best-known venture capitalists in Silicon Valley,  claiming  discrimination,  a jury trial, which  she just lost. But I really  thought that Farhad, we hadn't really covered it that much, frankly. I  thought Farhad Manjoo in the New York Times  kind of nailed it. He wrote,  not only weeks of testimony revealed a collection of boorish,  unsavory, and at times unwittingly misogynistic attitudes  at one of the tech industry's most storied financial institutions,  the case has also come to stand for something bigger than itself.  It has blown open a conversation about the status of women  in an industry that, for all its talk of transparency  and progress,  has always been buttoned up about its shortcomings.  He says, thanks to Ms. Pau not withstanding the jury's verdict, the secrets  are suddenly out in  the open.  So not a victory for Ellen Pau, who by the way is interim CEO of Reddit right now.  But I think even she felt like there was somewhat of a moral victory.  Do you agree, Katie?

Start time: 265.84
End time: 301.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that one of the things that's been interesting at this trial is that  a lot of other incidents have happened in tech  where women have felt like they've been harassed or they've been discriminated against,  but most of them have settled, including a really  sort of horrible harassment case against a different venture firm called CMEA  that happened about a year and a half ago, and that was settled.  So because she decided to take this to trial,  it really, really forced people to look at something that they've been able to avoid  for years and years.  So I do think that there was a moral victory here or at least a sort of awakening  about how we should be treating one another in technology.

Transcript:  Frieda Kapoor-Kline, who is at the Kapoor Center for Social Impact, said  this trial would become a landmark case for women in the workplace  as important as Anita Hill's accusations, which also were fruitless against  Clarence Thomas in his hearings to join the Supreme Court.

Start time: 322.18
End time: 375.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I feel like one of the things I think is funny about this is when you get into  the specifics of what she was actually saying happened, it was stuff like  they literally didn't let her sit at the table.  I mean, that's just so ridiculous.  They made her sit in the back of the room instead of sitting at the board table  with everybody.  She was excluded from an event where everybody was going on a ski trip  and they just said, like, no, we can't have any women.  I think their excuse was like some of the men are bunking together,  so we wouldn't have a female roommate for you and therefore you can't come.  And then she had criticisms of her work and her performance that were really,  really vague. So it's I mean, it's such baloney stuff that's so clear and so obvious.  And I'm glad that it's getting some attention in the media.  And we should be paying attention to this.  I'm sad that, you know, nothing came out of it from the legal side,  but it's just really ridiculous stuff.

Start time: 376.12
End time: 389.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel like she was very brave because these are hard cases to prove.  I mean, one of the reasons there's such endemic discrimination in the workplace  for women, women don't make it the same amount as men and for the same job  is because it's so hard to prove. Right.

Start time: 390.34
End time: 464.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think that part of the reason it's hard to prove is because people don't  speak up and they don't talk about things as they're happening.  And if anything comes from this case, I think, you know, to Katie's point  and to Jill's point, too, you know, the fact that we're actually having  this conversation is a good thing regardless of the outcome.  And, you know, if she had more proof or had gone  maybe to people, you know, filed complaints earlier,  I'm not saying that it would have made a difference,  but I think that the more people speak up and the more people talk about things,  whether it's through lawsuits like this or just actually getting HR practices  to be on the ball, things like this can be better.  I mean, one of the things is really case really highlighted  was just how poor Kleiner Perkins HR strategy around any of this stuff was.  You know, they didn't have any anything to really address sexual harassment  or gender discrimination or anything.  And for a firm of its size and and, you know,  the amount of money people are making and the types of deals they're dealing with,  that's that's shocking that they didn't even have anything like that in place.  And so if anything comes from this, I hope that it's a women  feeling more comfortable speaking up and be feeling more comfortable  and speaking up earlier so that there can be documentation  for these sorts of things going forward so that it doesn't have to become a  he said she said sort of scenario.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and actually, while the trial was going on, we saw a lawsuit filed  against Facebook and then a lawsuit filed against Twitter,  which has the potential to become a class action lawsuit  if the plaintiff can find enough people.  And I think that this is exactly speaks to your point  that maybe people will be less afraid to come forward.  I think that we've seen in other industries, whether it was media  with Newsweek or Wall Street with Morgan Stanley.  Once you had these larger class action suits around racial discrimination  and gender discrimination, it was much harder for tech companies  to brush them aside or to say, well, this is just one woman.  And her story is problematic.  And, you know, it's easier to pick apart one person's complaint  than it is to pick apart the complaint of 40 people.

Start time: 504.26
End time: 535.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One of the things that's difficult in this is  men, and I'll include myself here, tend to kind of be a little myopic.  We don't we don't even see it.  And there's this kind of interesting disconnect between men and women  when we talk about this kind of thing, where men go, what do you talk?  I don't. And then women go, well, can't you?  It's so have you have you all experienced these kinds of things?  Was were the things Alan Powell talked about a surprise to you?  No, I feel like I'd expect Kleiner Perkins to be a place where good old boys.  It's a good old boy. It's the old boy network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It sounds like politics in the 60s, 70s, 80s and a little bit today.  You know, like you're literally not allowed in the room.  There's no accommodations made for you.  You don't have facilities and services for women available at all.  You know, and we have to push for change in this.  And it can't just be from women.  You know, one of the things that I don't like about gender  discrimination issues in the tech industry is we really focus on the women.  What do the women need? Why aren't they getting it?  Why aren't they more aggressive?  Why aren't we promoting them?  Kind of blame the victim.  Well, it should be right.  Exactly. It's it's it's like victim blaming.  And it needs to be more focused on the men.  What should men do? What should companies do?  What policies need to be in place?  I think it's in Sweden or Norway that they now have a law that says  half of all boards of a certain size company need to be female by a certain date.  So slowly and progressively, they're they're putting this law into play  that is is forcing companies to do business differently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. And I think that if you want to,  one thing you might want to read is go online and find a story,  an essay that Sue Decker, the former CEO of Yahoo wrote,  it was posted on Recode.  It's excellent. And she talks about the fact that she and pretty much  every woman in the industry she's ever known has dealt with some sort of sexual  harassment or discrimination.  But sometimes when you're working really hard, you're willing to put those  slights away and just set them aside because you don't really understand  how grave they are until you look back.  And with the benefit of hindsight, understand that taken all together,  that they were unfair.  And I think the headline is something like sometimes the fish are the last to  notice water. You're just swimming in it and you're working all the time.  And you don't really put it all together until years have gone by.  So it's a really interesting essay written by a woman who, I think,  by all accounts has achieved so much.  Nobody would ever say that she that she was not successful.  And even she is willing to admit that she faced discrimination.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What I do hope is that Ellen Powe doesn't now face discrimination.  I don't think she will.  I feel like that even though she lost the case,  people have a lot of respect for her courage in bringing it.  And all you have to do is read into it to see that there was from  certainly from her point of view, there was merit in the case.

Start time: 679.26
End time: 737.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And I think, too, you know, she's in it.  She's been in a good position at Reddit where she took over as interim CEO.  And I think they've kind of been waiting for this to get resolved,  to make that permanent and whatnot.  But by everyone that I've talked to who works at Reddit, who's involved there,  you know, they would very quickly from kind of a toxic situation with their last  CEO to a much better situation with her at the helm.  So, I mean, I think that that's that that's good, too.  She's had the support of of Reddit, which is good.  But no, I mean, I hope to your point, she's not discriminated against.  But at the same time, I think it would be hard for people to do that to her now  because she has proven that she is willing to be so public about it.  We know who she is.  And there's something to be said about when you put yourself out there,  you know, having a camera on things makes it uncomfortable.  But it also means that people have to be accountable.  So it's going to be much harder for people to treat her differently  and to do this sort of systemic thing that maybe happened in the past,  merely by the virtue of the fact that a lot more people know who she is now.

Start time: 738.22
End time: 761.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would be careful of the blowback issue, actually.  I mean, I think one of the problems that happens, you bring up a case,  you have the spotlight put on you and then you're seen as a troublemaker.  Nobody wants to take you on.  They won't explicitly say it's because you're a woman or it's because of past action.  But they don't want to get involved with you anymore.  And I think we have to admit that Ellen Powell is she knew  she would be taking this risk when she went short.

Start time: 762.06
End time: 821.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And she did. I mean, very brave. Yeah, it is very brave.  And I agree with you completely.  I do think that it's important, at least in her situation,  she already had her landing spot.  You know, she was already on the board of Reddit.  She already had this interim CEO stuff.  She had, you know, her compensation package, even when she was let go,  was considerably more than most of us.  She's without a doubt.  I'm not trying to say that she wasn't extremely brave to bring this forward.  But let's also acknowledge her great privilege in having the ability  to even bring this case forward.  And I think that actually says a lot right there that it took someone  with the means that she has and with the connections and with the stature.  To have to took someone of her stature to do this, because I don't know  if this issue would have gotten as much attention if it was a lesser person,  a lesser firm. I think that someone else would have just settled  for that very reason. You point out, Jill,  I think they would have been worried about the blowback.  She's at least in a position where it's going to be much harder  for her personally to face that blowback  because of the other things that she has going for her and because of,  you know, the things she's built up in the career that she's established for herself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there you go. She lost, but she won.  And I think some there are people comparing her to Rosa Parks,  especially because she was forced to sit in the back of the airplane,  that there's a certain similarity.  And so I think a lot of kudos, a lot of a lot of praise  to Ellen Powell for fighting that fight and whether win or lose.  I think it was very important.  We're to take a break. Come back when we talk about.  I want to talk about the FTC report on Google.  We had a great conversation on Wednesday on Twig.  The Wall Street Journal, through a Freedom of Information Act,  got a FTC report that was submitted,  but kind of ignored by FTC commissioners.  The commissioners two years ago decided not to go after Google.  This report from the FTC attorneys said you need to go after Google.  They are really acting monopolistically.  We'll talk about that and and a lot more.  And I guess we can also say we'll throw in a little Apple Watch News,  because why not? What else is there to do?  Are you so sick to death of the Apple Watch?  You just say, let's not talk about it until it comes out.  I think that's probably the sensible thing to do at this point.  Who's going to buy one? Oh, I am.

End time: 927.25

Start time: 928.34
End time: 935.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, completely.  The pricing, too, if you have if you have a model that's ten thousand dollars,  suddenly the three hundred fifty dollar model doesn't seem so expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Apple's trying to build a luxury fashion brand.  And this is what you need to do if your Bottega Veneta or if you are,  you know, any sort of high end retail name,  Stella McCartney, the idea is you create out of reach items  that are for select few and then you can sell a lot of more reasonably priced.  We have fifty dollar shoes.  So you have like a couple of two thousand dollar pairs or three  thousand dollar pairs of shoes.  And then you have a bunch that are like six hundred dollars  that by comparison feel really reasonable and they're luxury within reach.  And I am throwing out these numbers because I was just at Barney's the other day.  Right. Right. Not shopping for myself.  But it's just sort of this understanding that's the psychology of luxury fashion.  And so if Apple wants to play in that game, there's a reason why they hired  the women from Burberry to do this.  Like this is what you need to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't it? Isn't it funny?  Because that's exactly now that I know you mention it,  exactly the same words that people say when they look at  oak couture, when it's fashion week, who would wear who would pay  thirty thousand dollars for that dress? It's not about that dress.

Start time: 1001.90
End time: 1029.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's not. It's about what comes down the pipe afterwards.  And then exactly to Katie's point, you know, it's about getting from  that ten thousand dollar point to that three hundred and fifty or five hundred  fifty dollar point. And then on top of that, having the accessories,  having the bands, you know, my big thing, I'm definitely getting one.  And I know what band I want,  but I have to make sure that it'll look good on the three hundred  and fifty dollar sports watch.  If it looks like it'll clash, then unfortunately my ass is spending  seven hundred fifty dollars on the watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Should I not get it? No, it's not tacky.  It's just it's kind of manly.  And I want the light pink.  Right. So for you to be perfect.  I don't think I'll wear the light pink.  Yeah, exactly. So for me, I want the light pink.  And that's the band that I want.  And so it's just going to depend whether it clashes with the sport watch,  that metal or if I'm going to have to have the freaking stainless steel.  And everyone that I talk to just says, Christina, come on,  you know, you're just going to get the you know, you're spending  seven hundred and fifty dollars on a watch.  You know, this is what's happening.  And I'm like, you know, you're right.  And the way I'll justify it is I could go,  oh, well, you know, the same way I do when I'm at Tory Burch.  I'm like, well, it's not as much as this.  You know, it's the exact same philosophy.  He's dead on. That's exactly what they're doing to us.  And I am nothing if not a label whore and a consumer and a lover of tech.  And so I'm all about it.  So Christina's getting the ten thousand dollars.

Transcript:  Our guests today having a fun time and I don't  I didn't want to ghettoize you with the Ellen Powell stuff,  but I thought we haven't covered it.  We really should cover it at this point.  Jill Duffy from PC magazine, Katie Benner from Bloomberg View,  Christina Warren from Mashable.  More coming up in a second.

Tim Cook says he's giving away all his money, but don't get in line.  It's to charity.  Great Fortune article, Tim Cook Worth, they estimate seven hundred  eighty five million dollars.  Actually, it's a Reuters article that Fortune republished.  And he said he's going to keep a little bit of it to pay for his ten year old  nephew's college education and the rest goes to charity.  That's pretty sweet.

Transcript:  Very, very nice. Bill Gates is doing this.  He said, I'll give away all but five percent of my fortune.  In fact, Gates has joined with Warren Buffett for the giving pledge,  where billionaires, particularly in the tech industry, pledge to give away  at least half their worth in their lifetimes.  Mark Zuckerberg's agreed. Larry Ellison of Oracle's agreed.  Cook is not in that group, but he said, no, I plan to do it as well.  The real challenge actually is how to do it.  Correctly. It's so easy to just kind of throw money at things.  He told Fortune he started donating money to unspecified causes quietly,  but he is trying to develop a more systemic.  I'm sorry, systematic approach to philanthropy that goes beyond writing checks.  Silicon Valley has not been known for its philanthropy,  but I think now things are changing a little bit.  In fact, very famously, Steve Jobs was really kind of anti charity.

He came out not so long ago, tweeted  on Friday condemning the Indiana  religious freedom bill, that religious freedom bill  allows Indiana businesses to decline, to serve  gay and lesbian customers.

And it's been interesting to see the way that Benioff has been willing to wield that.  And to be honest, he's been one of the few tech CEOs who's come out and said,  I think that we should be doing more charitable giving.  People are very divided on Mark Benioff when it comes to his personality and his company.

Transcript:  So I want to say something a little bit controversial about this.  I agree with Salesforce.  I agree with Tim Cook.  I think that they are taking a stand for something that aligns with my values.  However, I know that businesses influences state and and U.S.  law all the time, but it's very disconcerting to me to think about all the times when it  doesn't align with my values.  So I'm kind of skeptical about what happens when businesses have so much influences  that they do change state and federal law.  So in this case, like I said, allowance with my values, of course, I'm very happy about  these companies pushing back, but it's a tricky topic, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, well, I mean, that's sort of that's sort of the rub, right?  I mean, it can go either way.  And I think we have to be aware of of what that that influence means.  I think Jill's point is great.  But I mean, I think it's kind of a balancing act.  We've seen it go that other way for so long.  It's at least refreshing to see it.  It goes something more progressive and see people speak out in that extent.  I think it's important to be aware of that and to to question what that authority  means. But at the same time, I guess maybe I'm just, you know, a bit cynical about it  where I figure it is what it is.  Things are going to be influenced regardless.  We might as well embrace it when things are actually working towards some more  progressive goals, especially in states that have a history of pushing back against  anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Boy, I'm really glad you made that point, Jill, because it's one thing for Tim Cook  to say something, to speak out.  That's appropriate.

He says retail stock will be limited if you walk in the store.  Don't count on getting that watch of your dreams.  They're saying you should probably April 10th the war.  You won't you'll be able to preorder April 10th online and in store.  Gurman saying it probably smart to order online if you can for April 24th delivery.  Just a tip, Christina, if you want, if you really want that.  But you want to try it on, don't you?

Start time: 1737.80
End time: 1763.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess. Well, that's the whole thing.  I mean, that's kind of the problem with this as opposed to some of their other launches  where it's you're you're usually fine with just preordering sight unseen.  But I do I want to try it on and I want to see, OK, could I get away with the cheaper  sport watch frame with the band that I want?  Or do I really need to do what everyone and their brother knows you want to do,  including my own mother, and spend the seven hundred and fifty dollars?  If my own mother is like Christina, what are you even talking about?  Of course, you're getting the Apple watch.

Start time: 1763.08

Transcript:  Well, that's it. Seven fifty, including the pink sport.  Or it would be three fifty for the basic watch with the with the leather band.  Rather be three fifty for the basic sport watch and then another two fifty  for the band on top of it.  But I need to make sure the band won't clash with the sport backing.  Otherwise, I'm just going full hog and spinning seven  hundred fifty dollars and getting the watch and the band.

Transcript:  I mean, this is a good point about about wearables in general and women  and women's needs. Right.  So we can do with some Internet shopping.  We can do with getting items sent to us and we try them on when they arrive.  Often we know the brands and how they fit.  But there is a concern that we want to try stuff on.  We want to make sure that a watch is not too big.  We want to make sure that the colors are right.  And I don't know what Apple's return policy is.  I don't know, Christina, if you could order the watch you want  and swap it out for something different.

Start time: 1823.40
End time: 1859.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sure they would let me do that.  I'm sure they would let me do that.  That'd be fine. But part of the whole thing with this is that they're supposed  to be setting up ways where you can try this on and look at the different bands  and look at the different materials.  And they're making it like going to Burberry and trying on, you know, rain jackets.  But we're going to Tory Burch and trying on shoes.  And so I mean, I think that it makes sense to have more limited stock,  but it's going to be slightly different for some of us than the typical Apple experience,  because if so much of this really is about the experiential part of this,  it doesn't lend itself quite as easily to buying online  like you would with with a Fitbit or something like that.

You can't try it as walk in, but there'll be limited accessibility.  You really should book ahead online  an appointment starting April 10th.  They say the watch edition appointments could last up to 30 minutes.  But it's one source is told Mark Gurman, it's not like we'll kick out  the sport and stainless steel customers if they're taking too long.  And I guarantee you, if you're looking at a $17,000 watch,  you could take all the time you want.  Yes, I'm going to order online for April 24th delivery.  There is not the in-store pickup that we've seen before with iPads and iPhones.  You will not be able to.

It's about the whole experience.  And they've been on this track for at least a decade.  And the Apple store is just a wonderful example of that.  So I think the Apple store, I was reading about it recently. It was,  it was modeled after very nicely designed hotels that have high end clientele.  And whenever you survey the high end clientele, they said,  we love the concierge.  Like that's the best experience of going to a great hotel.  You go up to this person, they take care of things for you. They're very quick.  They're very efficient. They're very knowledgeable.  And that's how Apple developed the genius bar. So it's taking, you know,  some idea that's already existed and sort of repurposing it into what we call  the tech world. But it's really the retail world. It's really the fashion world.  It's a number of things.

But also, I mean,  you could make the argument that you have a much better shot at changing the  world with something like an iPhone or an iPad than you do with, you know,  kind of a hobbyist computer kit. You know, I mean,  if you really think about how Apple has kind of changed the world,  a lot of times it's with these more mass products. Now,  that's not to say that a watch is going to change the world,  but I don't think that it has to be either or I think you can be both more  consumer and, and kind of, you know, um, I guess not consumer is the right word,  I guess more, um, commercial, commercially focused and also have an impact to  really change the way everything's going to work.

Transcript:  Pebble watch closed its Kickstarter campaign for the Pebble time on Friday.  They wanted, oh, maybe a half a million bucks. They got 20 million.  So good. 30 days. Pebble time, uh,  is color, uh, seven days battery life, a new interface.  And of course Pebble is the only watch that works on both iOS and Android,  $20 million, 78,000 backers.  But the thing I bothers me a little bit about this is it sort of turns  Kickstarter into a store. This was really about, Hey,  preorder not raise money so we can develop something cool.

Start time: 2433.90
End time: 2541.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's both right. Because I think that they're a special case.  They're kind of the exception that proves the role. You know,  they even were very upfront when I talked to them and they announced their  Kickstarter that they had the lines ready to go that this was more one of those  things to kind of go back to the community and let them get it,  get in on it early, be the first people to get the watch. Um, you know,  since they, they built their company truly on Kickstarter.  And I think they're one of the few companies that can say they genuinely like  VCs, turn them down. You know,  Eric was not able to get VCs interested in them and then they raised, you know,  almost $10 million in Kickstarter last time and,  and finally had people paying attention to them and they managed to ship our  products. So I think that, yeah, I mean, it kind of turns it into a store,  but at the same time,  I think that this is one of those few times where, you know,  people get mad about how Kickstarter is, is being kind of, you know, taken away,  taken over by, by the rich and the powerful. And I guess that's true, but, um,  I was interviewing people who were some of the first successful Kickstarter  people, you know, for, um, you know,  more than four years ago, who the ones that were really successful were people  who had connections already in manufacturing and who knew what they were doing  and who were basically using the platform as much for marketing as,  as for, for seed funding.  And it's really about being able to kind of do with the money what you want  without being beholden to other people. Um, so I mean, in this case,  it does kind of turn it into a store in a sense,  but I also feel like the community is okay with it because this is like the  ultimate Kickstarter success story. So why not, you know,  come back and, and double the amount of money they're doing and granted, you know,  they have funding and they're doing well,  but they're going up against humongous behemoths, you know,  known as Google, known as Apple.  So $20 million and 78,000 watches is fantastic.  Well, let's not pretend that that's going to even be a dent in what Apple's going  to do in their first hour of pre-orders.

Transcript:  Okay. So this is where I think these devices are going. Um,  part of what they do well is they allow us to have a generation one device in  our pockets or on our bodies.  That's collecting a lot of data from a lot of people that could effectively be  used in health and wellness. So there's kind of two angles to this.  One is the mass collection of data. Everybody's a little scared of that term,  but if you think about research trials for things in medicine and health studies,  we're often looking at like 1000,  2000 people over a very short amount of time,  like maybe a year or two if we're lucky.  So you start to have devices like these that are collecting actual data.  It's not self-reported.  You can have user groups that are in the tens of thousands rather than one or  2000. Suddenly you have a lot of data work with in research and medicine,  which we've never had before. So when,  when you look at devices like Fitbits and jawbone ups and things like this,  Misfit Shine, um, they're pretty limited in what they can do,  but we have to remember these are generation one devices.  So they're looking at our activity and our sleep, how much we walk,  how much we move, how fast we move, things like that. Well,  let's imagine now a generation two and generation three device that can see  exactly what we're eating and how many calories we're burning, our heart rate,  our respiratory rate, our heart rate variability.  Now we have a much richer data set that we can use to track people's health and  come up with really interesting correlations about health and wellness.  I think that's where it's eventually really, really going.  There's a couple of companies in the health sphere that are already doing this.  Um, there's a device called the health patch.  It started out as something being used in hospitals.  It's a little patch that you wear on your chest.  It measures the same kind of things that Fitbits do your how much you walk.  Uh, it has fall detection, which is just really emotion center sensor,  heart rate, breathing rate, things like that.  It also measures stress. So it takes some of the other data points that it has.  It puts them into a stress algorithm and it measures your stress.  So what it did was it allowed hospitals who had patients post surgery or  something like that. Um, they didn't really need to be in the hospital anymore.  The doctors wanted to send them out,  but the hospital really wanted to continue monitoring their vital signs.  So with a health patch, you stick this thing on a person,  you send them on their way and the doctors still get a notification.  If something changes that we need to have, um, some medical intervention.

Transcript:  Remember that this is generation one stuff. I mean,  this takes years and years and years to develop and get it right.  I think the tech industry has gone for it. Innovation, right?  Like the push to do things faster.  And anytime I've talked to companies who are working in health, they say like,  Oh, the FDA, they have really strict rules and regulations in the United States.  Yes, exactly. But they have to clear those hurdles.  They have to clear them well. And it's, I think in my lifetime,  we're definitely going to see some really wonderful things happening.  So the second point that I didn't really talk about.  So one is this mass collection of data. The second point is,  if we have lots of data about ourselves,  we can have what people are calling more personalized medicine and often it's  preventative. So let's say that in the last five years,  I've tracked pretty much everything I've eaten or at least a representative  amount of food that I've eaten to get a sense of what I have day by day,  the nutrition, the nutritional information that I, you know, consume,  how much I walk, how much I move, how fast I move, what kind of intervals I do,  what my heart rate does, how much sleep I get. And now based on that,  if I can get personalized information about what to do to say,  lower the chances that I'm going to develop arthritis in 20 years,  that's going to be really amazing.  So it's that preventative stuff that's very personalized because we have  specific data about you rather than data about 2000 people.  And we sort of know what happens with 2000 people who follow X, Y, and Z.  So I think again,  like I think that's why companies like Fitbit and Jawbone know that this is  going to go somewhere else.

Start time: 2839.18
End time: 2868.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree with you.  I think you nailed it because all currently all health advice is based on a  statistical model. Your chances are.  But once it becomes personalized in that way,  I think it could be so much more accurate.  We've talked about personal cancer drugs, for instance,  drugs that analyze the genome of your cancer.  And instead of kind of mass and very dangerous chemotherapy,  targeting that particular cancer with an appropriate drug.

Transcript:  Well, the Fitbits and Jawbones of the world survive, I guess, is my question.  You know what? I'm curious as to why these companies keep on putting,  you know, they put out products and they are.  Well, they're not going to give up and go home.  That's what you know.  So what is, what is their, you know, what is their plan going forward?  What do you think they should be doing at this point now that the Samsungs,  the Googles and the apples of the world are all encroaching on their space?  Should they be partnering or trying to get acquired?  I'm really genuinely curious because there are a lot of,  this is a crowded, crowded industry.

Transcript:  There may be some acquisitions, but I think they're also like,  some of the companies that are making smart watches are definitely learning from  the companies that are making the health and fitness devices and vice versa.  So that Garmin watch that I showed you earlier, it does smart notifications.  Like it works with iOS, it works with Android.  You can get whatever notifications you want from your phone onto your wrist.  So Garmin knows people want that. People are interested in it,  but Garmin has been doing this for a long, long time with runners watches.  So they're actually a very established company in the sense of knowing how to do  the technology for measuring, not usually step count.  That's something that's been newer to them,  but your pace and your speed and your mileage when you run or bicycle or do any  number of activities. I think right now we're still in the  point where it's seen as a hobby, right?  So when that starts to change,  I think that's when the market's really going to shake up with either acquisitions  or companies starting to partner with insurance companies and healthcare  companies and places like that.

Transcript:  I feel like to answer your question, Katie,  it's always foolish in technology to assume, oh, here comes Apple or Samsung or Google.  We might as well just give up.  You just don't know where the winner is going to come from.  It's true. And but you ask a very important question,  which is where should you focus to attempt to become that winner?  And I'm sure the fact that there's a diversity of choices.  I don't think it's going to come from a company, frankly, like Garmin,  because they've been around too long.  I think it's going to be an innovation out of nowhere.  But who knows? Right.  That's what's exciting about covering technology.  Garmin's doing an interesting thing because they're a GPS.  And this is where they have a disadvantage. See, they have it.  They have it. They're an incumbent. They have a business.  They're a GPS company. Well, we'll put the GPS on the watch.  And Apple says, well, why should we put the GPS on the watch?  You already have it in your phone. Right.  We need to tie the watch to the phone.

Transcript:  Well, and usually, you know, my Fitbit, I've got my phone with me anyway.  And so, you know, it's kind of doing that wireless sticking stuff anyway.  So, I mean, I wear a pedal and I like it.  It doesn't do all the health and fitness stuff I would want to do.  But if I can basically get everything in my Fitbit,  my Apple watch, I kind of don't know why I would bother wearing the Fitbit as well.  I mean, maybe if I was just doing a dedicated run and I didn't want to  have a phone with me. But otherwise, I think for a lot of people,  the activity tracker market disappears if you buy into the idea that most of us  will be wearing smartwatches. And that may or may not be true.  But I do wonder. I mean, but obviously, those those two worlds are blurring  so much that I think that outside of certain niches, it does become  a thing where they kind of overlap to the point that you don't need both.  And I wonder.

Transcript:  But wouldn't it be smart and would it preserve you if you perhaps worked with HealthKit?  And so now you're going to be a specific sensor  for a larger ecosystem of sensors.  Apple will get involved, but you still can survive as an individual.  Maybe that's the way.

Transcript:  Yeah, Apple Health is just not great.  Like, let's let's acknowledge that, first of all, it is not great.  It's very difficult to use. It's very confusing.  Fitbit does integrate with a lot of other devices and apps.  And I think that's part of right now for me anyway,  part of the decision factor about which device somebody might want to buy.  The other thing, of course, is price.  So if you already have a smartphone, which most people do,  you can spend 350 to $10,000 on an Apple watch.  Or maybe if all you really want is something that's going to track your runs,  track your walking every day, you can find a device for $99.  That's going to do that. That's a much more attractive option.  So I like having a lot of options.  And it kind of reminds me, actually, before the show started, Leo,  you were talking about Meerkat and like, oh, it doesn't have all the features.  You can't save your videos locally.  Well, I think what Meerkat is doing, which is kind of similar  to what we were just talking about, is they're offering one set of options.  So there are people who say, OK, the kind of live streaming that I'm doing,  I don't want to save those videos.  I see this as an ephemeral experience.  I see this as a here and now, quick and dirty sort of the thrill of the moment.  Right. So I don't want those other features.  And I like I like when the landscape of a particular tech device  or service plays out like that, where people have lots of options  and not everybody's offering the same exact feature package.

And that's exactly what he said.  He said, there are all these verticals.  We're in one vertical.  The stream, he had a name for it, but that that's just one of many.  And there will be many.  And he welcomed a variety of apps in this domain of live streaming  because there's many different ways to do it.  And you're right. Some people don't want it to be preserved.  Do watch that interview. It was great with Ben Rubin.  That'll be on tomorrow's triangulation.  All right. Talking Barbie coming up in just a second.  We're having a lot of fun.

Transcript:  So the reason I bring this up, New York Times article today  in the Sunday Times Toy Talk is creating a Barbie that will talk back to kids.  There's Orin Jacob right there. Fascinating.  What they're saying is that kids today, not high school kids, younger kids,  are used to talking to their gadgets and them talking back.  This is part of how they have grown up.  So for them, the idea of a Barbie that can have a conversation.  This is not a pull the string. Feed me, feed me, Barbie.  This is a Barbie that will have a conversation like Siri will.  It will analyze the speech and produce relevant responses.  Hello Barbie is a Wi-Fi enabled Barbie, which comes out this fall.  What do you think?

They talk to them and they have these conversations.  And they'd be able to have a toy and have this smart interactivity  where you can get intelligent things back.  I would have loved this as a kid. I think that's awesome.  The thing that concerns me, and I know this is a weird thing,  but in their privacy policy, basically because they record the data,  the parents have permission to go through and listen to everything  that the kid has told.

There's something creepy to me about the fact that if I'm a kid  and I'm talking to my toy, that my parents could be spying on me  and listening to what I'm saying.  I mean, on the one hand, I understand you want things for safety and precaution.  But on the other hand, like sometimes kids talk to their toys about things  they might not want to talk to their parents about.  And I don't know. I'm thinking back to me, if I were a little girl,  if I would have wanted my parents to know everything I did with my Barbie dolls,  to be perfectly honest, no, I wouldn't have wanted them to know.

I don't know if I would have wanted my parents to know  what I was doing at nine years old was, you know, making my Barbie dolls  have sex with each other and steal each other's boyfriends.  I don't know if I would want that to be.  I'm just being honest, I don't know if I would be comfortable with that.  Then they don't care now. But, you know, it's been at the time.  You know, I freaked out exactly.  And it was just like healthy expression of me, you know, living out my my goal  of being a TV writer or something.  And so I don't know. I love it.  But I am a little concerned with the privacy policy,  which I know they're doing for the right reasons.  But I'm kind of concerned with the idea that the parents can just kind of listen  to everything their kids are doing with their toys to me that kind of,  I don't know, that that's that's my only qualm.

We've had toys that have talked before.  And at the end of the day, for most kids,  the great thing about being a kid is your imagination is really rich.  And so you your playtime is much more interesting and exciting  with like inanimate stuffed animals and stuff.  That's actually very true.  Because my mom runs a daycare center.  So I've watched little kids a lot and the way they play.  And they'll play with a machine for a while, and it's great.  But the most interesting conversations they have  and the ones where you see them really engrossed is when they're using  their imaginations to make up scenarios that they control  and that they have fun with, whether it's alone or with friends or with toys.

Transcript:  So let me quote Natasha Singer's article in The New York Times.  A recent study conducted by researchers at Georgetown  compared two groups of toddlers,  one group played with plush toys that had been pre-programmed  to say the child's name and to say that they had the same favorite food  and song as the child.  The other played with plush toys that called each child pal.  Hey, Polly.  And they like different things with the same toy character on screen  presented math skills.  So they had the character then on screen  presenting math skills like arranging cups in order of size.  The first group of toddlers, the ones addressed by name,  performed better than those addressed as pal.

She figured out. Wait a minute.  He said the same thing last week. Right. Right. Right.  I was never under any illusions that it was not television.  But I did think Big Bird was a human because he slept in a bed.  So that was my thing is that, well, of course, if he's sleeping in a bed,  then he must be a real human.  But no, I mean, I think that there is something to be said  for having this personalization.  But I think Katie's point is great.  My mom's a child psychologist. She was retired now.  And yeah, the way kids play with things and I've had the  I've observed a little bit of that.  Yeah, they tend to be a lot more verbal and get a lot more of their  their playthings done when they can create the stories.  But when it comes to learning things, that's I think maybe where it's different.  If you can customize it and personalize it more, the kid might be more engaged  and more willing to go through the exercises and retain what's happening  if they feel like they're part of it rather than just hi, sonny.  Hi, pal.

A couple of weeks ago, the campaign for a commercial free childhood  and advocacy group in Boston asked Mattel to shelve talking Barbie,  saying the voice recordings amounted to eavesdropping  and could be used to exploit the intimate feelings of children.  Whatever the child says will be manipulated and used to insinuate these dolls  further into girls lives, said Susan Lynn, the group's director.  So anyway, what has technology wrought?  At least Barbie can be a computer engineer.  Oh, don't get us started.  That book was terrible.  I know, but it was fun to laugh at.  All right. Google says it's not giving up on Google Glass.

But I think that the idea that glass, the way that it's been presented,  will continue on that level.  I mean, I have to think that, I mean, you know, that Tony probably took  and I've only I've only talked to him a couple of times,  but I have to think he would take one look at the whole scenario and just go,  OK, we're starting over.  We're starting over from the drawing board because this doesn't work from,  you know, a perspective where people are not embracing this.  It doesn't look good.  It creeps people out.

Transcript:  Yeah. One of the things I'm interested in that I think Apple Watch  actually might be able to do is the sense of adding tactile experiences  into our smart devices.  So if your Apple Watch could through a series of like taps  and sort of suggestion motions give you directions  so that we're not relying only on our eyes or only on our ears.  I think that's the more interesting.  I think it's going to do that.  It's a little bit less invasive, too.  Like people don't want to wear glass on their face  and you don't want to be staring at a phone all the time  and you don't want to have, you know, headphones on all the time.  Like I think there are more ways to incorporate smart information  that we're just not quite taking advantage of yet.

And I think the glass actually, that was my favorite part of using glass  was for any of the direction things, kind of the overlay.  So we'll see.

And we have to talk about F8, Facebook's developer conference, which,  I don't know, felt like kind of a dud.  But maybe maybe you found some wonderful things, little gems in there.  Christina Warren from Mashables here, Katie Benner from Bloomberg View  and from PC magazine, Jill Duffy.  Great to have all three of you here today.  I have been playing with my little bits  and I've got to say it's fabulous.  So glad to see little bits again.  We were talking a lot about it during the holidays.  Perfect Christmas gift for people with kids.  And, you know, one of the things I think is so important  as consumers of electronics, as consumers of technology,  to kind of get kids turned on to the idea that they can do it too,  that they can be makers.  But sometimes, especially for little fingers, things like soldering,  that's a little scary.  Little bits is so cool.  It's taking electronics design and creation out of the hands of experts  and giving it to everyone, for kids, even for parents,  for kids at heart, for coders, hardware hackers.  With little bits, you could do anything.  Get your dog to send a text or make a robotic snack server.  And the nice thing is it's so simple.  There's no soldering involved.  This is a little bits kit.  We've made a few.  Last time we had them all, I actually made a little bits.  Oh, we got a good one this time.  Oh, look at all the little bits here.  These all snap together magnetically.  So there's no soldering involved.  There's components.  There's over 60 components to do a huge variety of projects.  The little bits kit will come, of course, with instructions and a project guide.  Connect battery and cable to the blue module.  Turn it on. Pink modules affect modules after them.  Green modules do something in the physical world  and then give you some great projects.  If you've been thinking, I want to get an electronic.  I remember Heath kit as you know, I'm an old guy.  I remember Heath kit.  And I just think teaching kids how this stuff works, put it together  to teach them the things about logic, about mechanical interaction is so great.  They enjoy it. It's better than a Lego.  A Rector said it's it's building something that really, really works.  There are a variety of little bits kits.  There's the base kit or the deluxe kit.  I think this is the this must be the deluxe kit.  This is so great here.  Great way to get started.  The space kit was developed in partnership with NASA.  So they've got Earth and space science.  There's an Arduino coding kit that lets you code the Arduino.  So if you want a child to get started in programming,  I'll tell you, programming is so abstract.  It's really great to have a physical output.  It is a great way to learn for the tinkerer.  The deluxe kit includes 18 modules  that snap together with billions of circuits possible.  No wiring, no soldering.  You can make it in seconds.  There's a synth kit if you're into music.  It's a modular analog.  Oh, I love this idea.  Modular analog synthesizer.  Oscillators, filter, envelope, keyboard, micro secret.  See, if you have a kid who's interested in music, as Henry is,  and he's used logic, but this is the best way to teach him  what this stuff is actually doing.  Little Bits is now offering customers $20 off your first kit.  Go to little bits, L I T T L E B I T S.  Little Bits, no cutesy spelling on this.  Dot com slash twit.  You'll get free shipping in the US as well.  And after you make something, send an Instagram off to Little Bits.  I know we'd love to see it.  Just at Mr. Underscore Laporte.  I'll pass it along.  I'd love to see your Little Bits creation.  Little Bits is so cool.  Don't you? I don't know.  You guys are young.  Maybe you had something like this when you were young.  I didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I love I love Parse.  And I think that was interesting, I think as a way to kind of extend that, I think.  What is Parse?  Parse is kind of their application, a kind of a services framework  that lets people automate a lot of web apps and take care of a lot of details  that they bought them a couple of years ago and tons of different applications  that aren't based on Facebook in any way use Parse.  Oh, interesting.  And stuff.  And so by adding into kind of this Internet of Things stuff,  it could kind of be a way to maybe help, you know, people build more IOT style  support into into their apps.  I think that was interesting.  But whether I don't know how they how they turn that into anything  of their core business, but it's certainly interesting.

Transcript:  That's true, that's true.  It was interesting to me kind of comparing this F8 to last F8,  like how much things they announced last year didn't work.  Like, remember App Links, we all thought that was right.  Or they they sold that like it was in a thousand apps.  I mean, so that's that was a complete fail.  I thought the new ad platform thing with  they're going to be doing for mobile apps could potentially be disruptive.  But yeah, I mean, there was it's kind of a  nothing that interesting, I guess, to regular consumers.

Start time: 4579.42

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And a lot of which is which is worse, announcing a bunch of stuff  that doesn't happen, doesn't work, doesn't go anywhere, or just kind of saying, well,  try first.  And it was like they didn't.  So one of the things they are changing, they're going to try to make Messenger.  I don't I think this is a total on starter Messenger, a platform.  They want developers to write apps that integrate with Facebook Messenger.  And they showed a couple of dumb apps  that allow you to do, you know, kind of weird things in Facebook Messenger.  Yeah, it's just doesn't doesn't it's not compelling to me.  And I wonder why anybody would even develop.  They do have 40 developers who have apps like they showed Jib Jab.  So you can make a little Jib Jab video and then send it in Messenger.  I it's like I can't imagine why anybody would spend any energy  building on Facebook's platform at this point.  And yet they're doing just fine.  It's not like Facebook's in trouble or anything.  Their stock price continues to go up.  Nothing. This is exactly my reaction to F8.  How about the Oculus Rift?  Is this is this in good hands?  Are they a good steward of virtual reality?

Start time: 4654.56
End time: 4701.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I think that they bought it with the understanding  that this is going to be a long term play and that they don't need to mean  they're still showing off the same Crescent Bay demo that they've been showing off  all year, you know, and just kind of talking about kind of future  scenarios and situations.  I mean, I feel like, yeah, they picked a good company, a company that,  at least for right now, doesn't have a whole lot of reason to really  get involved, to stop them from doing anything moving forward.  But I think that that we're just so early with all this VR stuff  that we don't really know what the what the scenario is going to be.  So, you know, I mean, we didn't really get any new Oculus news,  but I definitely feel like a year in Facebook has basically given them  the money they need and the resources maybe to continue doing  what they were already doing.  But other than that, they've stayed out of it.  And frankly, as a fan of Oculus, I think that's been the best case scenario.  So that's I mean, that's been good.

So this isn't something I'm going to do with my smartphone.  And it doesn't work with Oculus Rift.  It's like, I just sometimes I feel like they're just throwing stuff against the wall.  I don't, I don't really get it.  All right.  Although Instagram has a new app called Layout.  That does exactly what it does in apps before it have done frames,

Start time: 4737.54
End time: 4812.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  including one called Layout.  He's not happy.  And I'm like, are you not?  But I mean, I feel for the guy, but at the same time, like, are you new?  Yeah, this is Sherlock.  You know, yeah, precisely, precisely.  And you know, this is not unique to Facebook.  It's it's Sherlock is the perfect.  That's exactly what it is.  But yeah, I mean, I think the reason Facebook said that they did it,  though, was really interesting.  They said that something like one out of every six users uses a layout  tool app to make photo collages.  That's a huge amount of, you know, that that's a huge percentage.  And so, yeah, absolutely.  Facebook needed to completely like bring that in house and at least have an option,  because that many of your users are using a collage tool.  I'm actually kind of curious why they didn't just build it into the app itself  and made it a separate app.  I would kind of guess even though Facebook and Instagram are popular,  are fond of doing the separate app philosophy, I wouldn't be surprised if at some point  they just decided to merge the layout feature directly into Instagram itself,  because if that many of your users are first starting out with a collage tool,  to me, that indicates that's probably an area where you could slip that into the main app  and you wouldn't have people getting upset.  You might have even increased usage at that point.

It's just too it's too fussy.  Speaking of Oculus Rift, HTC has said we are going to invite people  to join our developer program and get a developer edition for free.  Rift was charging 300 bucks for its developer edition.  A lot of people saw Vive at Mobile World Congress and raved about it.  I guess the key at this point, you're in a race to get people  to create content for these things.

Start time: 4849.42
End time: 4886.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. And which is the hard thing, right?  Like that's that's going to be the challenge.  I think, you know, at this point, Oculus has sucked most of the energy out of the room.  So that's probably what HTC has to do to get people interested.  They need to give those things away to developers, because otherwise,  why would why would they want to bother when already the Oculus  ecosystem is sort of fragmented?  When you talk about the difference between Oculus Rift and then the  Samsung Oculus based platforms, which are different, you know, it's it's  it's already getting sort of fragmented.  So I'm not surprised at all that HTC and Steam are like, yes, please  sign up and we will give you one of these.

Sony has said it's interesting.  They told Polygon about a year ago.  We don't want people to think, how can I port this game to virtual reality or VR?  We want people to think, what unique thing can we do with this tech?  And to that end, we, you know, as I mentioned, we talked to Ben Rubin at  Meerkat and he didn't want to go into details, but he was very excited about.  This idea of live streaming virtual reality in a way, Meerkat kind of is  it takes you into somebody's life in an interesting way, but it's a very  constrained little little peephole into their life.  Wouldn't it be amazing if it could be a VR experience?  Yeah, I would I would go for that if I could.  If you know, so one of the things people do a lot with Meerkat, I've done it  quite a bit, is you Meerkat while you're driving and be so cool if you could, if  you could be in the passenger seat, looking around, talking to somebody  while they're Meerkatting, that would be interesting.  You'd look like a dork.  And you'd have to have a giant cameras.  I don't know what those camera rigs look like, but there's this analogy.

Start time: 4962.48
End time: 5042.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, this is sort of a larger issue, but there's an analogy about technology  development and the the rollout of electricity to different countries.  So in the United States, when electricity was first being brought into people's  houses, it was called like your light bill.  It was for powering lights.  And that's that's what we used it for.  And we made it very, very cheap and very accessible to get electricity  into people's homes and businesses.  So that allowed people to experiment with other ways we could use electricity.  And of course, I mean, you know, from there, the whole 20th century happened.  So the same analogy is being made with the Internet.  So countries that have fiber optic and really high speed, fast Internet  available to people's homes allows them to tinker and think about what can we do  with this access that maybe we're not imagining right now.  And there's a lot of critics in the United States who are saying, you know,  that the caps that we have on our Internet speed is just ridiculous and it's  preventing innovation from happening.  And so it just kind of reminds me when you're talking about like trying to think  and experiment with Oculus Rift in a new way, what else can we do with VR that we  haven't thought of yet? It's sort of similar to that is like we need to give  people unfettered mega access and let them play in a sandbox.

Instead, the chief scientist did a lot of optical illusions.  Everybody in the world has seen a hundred times.  But what they could have done and I would like to have seen is the camera.  What do you need?  Because forget the headset.  That's what you use to consume it.  What does it take to make it?  Because that's what you've got to get people doing is make doing innovative things  with making it. Is it a giant thing?  Is it a little thing? I don't have they talked about that.  If I could buy a little camera that I put right here that will allow you to be in  the studio with us, I would be very interested in doing that, for instance.  There it is. Is that it?

You need 12 GoPros, 12 GoPros.  I've got three. I can get you started anyway.  Yahoo and Microsoft are in a 10 year deal for Microsoft being to be the Yahoo  search engine. That deal is about to.  Let's see. The search partnership took place in 2010, but it did allow them to  renegotiate in 2015 after five years.  The negotiations are going on and haven't I don't know if they're going well.  They decided to extend them for another 30 days.  This is because both companies are publicly held, so they had to file with the SEC on  Friday. They mutually agreed to extend the deadline to a 60 day period following  February 23rd.  I'm not clear what's going on there.  I can't imagine Yahoo would abandon Bing.  They don't have anything to replace it.  All right. Actually, let's take a break and then we'll talk about the the FTC and  Google. Is Google a monopoly?  Should the should the FTC have pursued them for antitrust?  They decided not to, but some say after they've read these documents they should  have. We'll talk about it.  Our guests.

Transcript:  I'm going to put you on the spot then when we come back.  Sounds good. From this break.  All right. Our show today brought to you by my mattress.  Do you have the video of me and my mattress?  Me and my mattress.  Who would have thought you could buy a mattress online?  That seems like counterintuitive for so many reasons.  One, don't you want to lie on it before you buy it?  Two, they're going to ship a mattress.  Three, what the heck?  Well, Casper's convinced me.  First of all, I have, you know, and everybody has gone to a mattress showroom and lie.  What is it? Laying? Laid? Lied on a mattress.  And it's not five minutes on a mattress isn't going to do you any good.  So with Matt, with Casper, you get 100 days.  The shipping is free and the return is free.  If after 100 nights, I should say, sleeping on it for 100 nights.  If you don't like your love, your Casper mattress, they'll take it back.  No problem. No questions asked.  But they have done it so well.  First of all, it does come and that's a queen size mattress in a box.  I got one for my son because he lives up three stories and he wanted a queen size mattress.  There was no way they could get a queen size mattress.  There was no way they could get a regular mattress in that house.  He loves his Casper mattress.  They make them in the United States.  They're premium mattresses for a fraction of the cost.  They're really comfy.  I got to tell you, latex and memory foam.  So you get both sink and bounce.  You get firmness, but it's it conforms to you.  It is so soft and comfortable and it's completely risk free to try it.  Casper.com slash twit, C-A-S-P-E-R dot com slash twit.  Don't decide on something you're going to sleep on for the next 10 years.  Five minutes in a showroom. Even Ozzie loves our Casper by the way.  Go online, Casper.com and get a Casper mattress.  I guarantee you, you are going to love it.  Bring your money back.  Five hundred dollars for a twin, nine fifty for a king size.  Compare that to the price of the mattress store.  And I'm going to get you 50 bucks off as an audience member.  Just go to Casper.com slash twit and use the promo code twit.  Fifty dollars off.  Casper.  Such a this is the kind of thing I think the Internet really,  it's interesting to watch how it's changing these businesses that you never thought.  You never thought you'd be able to buy glasses online or buy mattresses online.  And they've solved this by shoes online.  I love it. Casper.com slash.  Twit. So.  The Wall Street Journal filed a Freedom of Information Act with the FTC.  And they were curious about the process the FTC had used in investigating the Google.  The FTC, I guess this is and I'm glad you've written on this, Katie, so you can tell me.  My sense is the FTC commissioners get reports from a variety of different staff groups,  read them all, and then the commissioners decide whether to go forward or not.  In this case, the commissioners declined to prosecute Google after a few minor changes to how Google does search.  But in this FOIA Act, the Wall Street Journal, and by the way, the FTC asked for it back.  And the journal said, no, we got it now.  No, went through this and pulled out some smoking guns.

Start time: 5604.96
End time: 5724.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That they did. That they did.  But it was clear that the commission, that there were certain staffers who believed that Google,  not just that Google had a monopoly because monopolies exist in all sorts of businesses,  but that they'd use that power to hurt other companies and or hurt consumer interests.  So that would be the antitrust part of the suit.  As you said, in the end, the commission chose not to sue.  And they worked with Google to preemptively change parts of the business so they wouldn't have to.  What I was writing about, what I found interesting is that the idea of a monopoly in technology  is really different from monopolies that exist in things like oil and gas and mining and sort of these big,  heavy industries, because it's very hard to disrupt Exxon Mobil.  It's really hard for a company to have the firepower to upend that business.  Whereas in technology, we see really big companies being upended all the time.  We've seen, in part because you have powerful, smart, quick startups coming in and finding pieces of the business that are weak.  And also because consumer trends change so fast in the tech world that what was interesting and great at one point just doesn't work anymore.  I think Microsoft is a great example of this.  Other people have written about this as well.  That as long as the PC was king, Microsoft was going to be king too.  But now that we're moving to mobile, suddenly the operating system and the software that Microsoft provides  and is known for have just kind of become irrelevant.  So that powerful monopoly that Microsoft wielded is not as scary anymore.  And it wasn't because the government broke up Microsoft and it wasn't because Microsoft changed its business practices.  It really was just because Microsoft didn't keep up with technology as quickly as it should have.  And I think people are already starting to wonder, is Google going to fall into that category as well?  Now that we're moving away from online search and so much as being done in mobile search and being done in apps, where is Google in all of this?  And then a couple of advantages they do have.  Android, for example, you have companies going in and creating forked versions of Android, even trying to dent that advantage as well.

Transcript:  What was the smoking gun?  Or was there anything in your opinion after reading through the report?  And the journal did a weird thing.  They only published every other page for some reason.  I don't really understand.

Start time: 5733.24
End time: 5799.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they didn't get the whole report.  So the complete report wasn't included in the FOIA request.  There were definitely some things in there that were that that were that would be deemed harmful to other competitors.  And this is why Amazon and Yelp and TripAdvisor have been so upset with the commission defined that Google suppresses other companies results in in their in Google's own search results.  So if information that would come up, you know, if Christina is shopping for something and she Googles in the item and she wants to buy it, maybe the best result would actually be from Amazon.  But Google is going to give her a Google shopping result, which may or you know, probably doesn't benefit the consumer in the long run.  So, yeah, that's true. But then there's the argument to be made.  Well, if we're searching on our phones, I'm probably not ever going to Google what I want to buy on my phone.  I'm going to go straight to my Amazon app, disintermediating, disintermediating Google and then making their monopoly a lot less powerful.  And even if they are abusing that monopoly, it doesn't matter because I'm not using them.

Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis, we had a long discussion on this in this week in Google.  And Jeff defended Google saying that really this is the Wall Street Journal continuing a vendetta.  It's Rupert Murdoch's Wall Street Journal, continuing a vendetta against Google.  And then Danny Sullivan's done a very interesting analysis on marketing land, his site, in which he said basically, well, here's one quote.  Then this comes from a sidebar to the main piece, how Google skewed search results.  According to the Journal, Google would automatically boost its own sites for certain specialized searches that would otherwise favor rivals.  Kind of kind of what you mentioned, Katie.  If a comparison shopping site was supposed to rank highly, Google shopping was placed above it.  When Yelp was deemed relevant to a user search query, Google Local would pop up on top.  Danny says that sounds terrible on the face of it, unless you understand that this is a practice that many search engines have done to present vertical.  And this is the key. These are vertical search results.  He says Google didn't want to give you search results as the result of a search.  And deemed that things like Yelp would basically you'd search for something and you get a search.  And so to some degree, that seems reasonable.  On the other hand, the Journal says Google had a focus group.  They call them the searchers who were very unhappy with the way Google was doing things.  Marissa Meyer, who was then a Google vice president, said Google didn't use click through rates to determine the rankings for its own specialized search results because they'd rank too low.

Start time: 5909.24
End time: 5995.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So right. Well, I mean, and that's kind of I don't know about you guys, but I found myself one of the reasons that I think Google suffers so much on mobile.  A as you said, Katie, you know, you don't we want to go to the app rather than going through a search box.  But part of the reason that's the case is because over time, I don't know about you guys, but I've noticed that my Google results have gotten less and less good.  And in a lot of times it's because they're customized now to everything they think that I want to like.  So it becomes kind of this weird, like circular notion where I'm I'm only seeing things that I've searched for before or sites have visited before.  But another case is because it takes so long to actually find the real results that I want versus what they used to do.  But they were so good at the reason they disrupted the industry was that Google was fantastic about showing the actual things you wanted and showing like the highest probably really kind of anticipating this is this is where you want to go.  So, I mean, on the one hand, I think this definitely I can understand why their competitors are upset.  On the other hand, I almost wonder, you know, by doing this and putting their own services above others, doesn't that in some ways potentially just make people want to use Google less because the results they're getting aren't actually matching what they're searching for.  They're getting siphoned off into these into Google Local and all these other things that probably don't even exist anymore.  Rather than going to Yelp or going to Amazon, which is kind of what you wanted to do to begin with.

Start time: 5996.68
End time: 6029.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Of course, and I think that the comparison with Microsoft here becomes really fascinating because, again, Microsoft did so much to enhance and protect a monopoly position that it took its eye off the ball in terms of innovation.  And then some of the things that it did do in order to stay so powerful made the experience just bad for users.  So the chance to go anywhere else, the minute there was a Google Docs or the minute like Apple software was even like kind of OK.  People started to people started finding other options.  Isn't that why this is an antitrust investigation?

Start time: 6029.14
End time: 6045.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because the hope it's not illegal to be a monopoly.  It's illegal to use your monopoly power to enter other markets.  And so the reason this is a legitimate, in my opinion, investigation is because Google used its near monopoly on search to get itself into other businesses.

Start time: 6047.04
End time: 6110.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think part of the problem is part of the problem is like, do do we have a clear and defined idea of what a search engine is?  Having only had search engines for what, maybe 20 years at this point.  So what I'm saying is Google service offers when you go to Google dot com, it offers you a lot of services when you use the Chrome Web app.  It offers you a lot of services.  So our web app, I'm sorry, browser, it offers you a lot of different services.  So when you Google a restaurant, for example, you're going to get a Google Maps results, you're going to get reviews of people who have entered it from their Google accounts.  You're going to get photos of the place from people who have uploaded them to Google.  You know, is that part of a search engine experience?  Is that something else? Is what Google offers now something different than a search engine?  I think it gets into this weird area where I almost see these things that Google is offering us as other services and features on top of its.

Start time: 6112.18
End time: 6125.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Site and I think the FTC thing really only dealt with traditional online search as you would think it didn't.  It didn't deal with all these other areas.  It really just dealt with opening up a web browser and typing something into the into the search bar.

Start time: 6127.18
End time: 6170.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I mean, that's exactly what Google is delivering you.  Right. Like that's the promise that Google makes is that we're going to follow what you do.  We're going to try to offer you tailored results and we're going to give you a complex, rich and in context experience for what is you're looking for.  So that's why you get the maps and the photos and the business listing.  And it's going to show you that business listing instead of Yelp's because it's Google and it wants to offer you that.  But it's I don't know.  It sounds kind of tricky to me because I I don't know if that is what a search engine offers or if that's something new.  Like, is that a feature on top of a search engine or does it does Google by offering those features now enter into a new category in a way?

Start time: 6170.54
End time: 6183.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's old fashioned to think of a search engine as merely something you type a phrase into and it gives you a list of sites that match the phrase.  That's kind of our old fashioned notion of what Google is.  And you're saying, I think quite rightly, that Google wants to be more useful than that.

Transcript:  I I've argued for this.  And of course, it's pie in the sky.  But I do wish there were a search.  It's part of the problem is Google is a monopoly.  It's not like you're going to go use something else.  Of course it is.  And I mean, I guess you could use Bing.  Not illegal.  I mean, but it's not elite.  Right.  And I kind of wish there were some holy priesthood search engine that didn't have all these side businesses didn't have YouTube and Google.  But but that uses Google's results.

So we cannot help our other businesses.  I would like that.  I would I would switch to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the problem is, though, is that that almost is like that.  That's the last, you know, technology that that's the old paradigm.  Right. That was kind of like the Web one point of Web two point of search paradigm.  Whereas where Google is actually, frankly, losing now and where search is going in the futures, that people are using their mobile devices.  And it becomes about being anticipatory, which is why Google needs to do more of these customized things.  And they need to learn more about us because they need to be able to know if you're in this area and I'm searching for a Starbucks, you should show me the Starbucks closest to where I am, not, you know, their website or something else.  You know, you should be showing me, you know, if I'm looking for an airline or time or something for takeoff and landing, you should be searching for that day, not for just just general information.  So I think that I am with you.  But I almost wonder if going that direction is going in the past and kind of away from how most of us are kind of going to be using search in the future.

Transcript:  No, I agree. Google now makes it much more useful.  And that's a very different beast than a pure search engine.  Google's response to this, by the way, one of the accusations from the Wall Street Journal was that, of course, this happened because since President Obama took off as employees of Google have visited the White House 230 times.  Oh, God, that was a comparison Comcast has only visited twice.

Start time: 6329.71
End time: 6348.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Varied way, way down in that story.  And this is why it's so important to read to the very end.  Yeah, the Journal does acknowledge that a lot of those visits were so that employees at Google could help set up President Obama's Q&A that went over Google Hangouts.  You know, these were not policy people.

What's interesting, obviously, I know this case was already decided, but what to me was more bothersome than even some of this, you know, monopolistic practice stuff, which obviously we know they have.  But the fact that they were, you know, the argument was, and there seemed to be proof of this, that they were kind of holding Amazon ransom to a certain extent, saying you have to pay us this amount of  money for ads if we're going to show your search results on our pages at all.  To me, that's actually a lot more bothersome than even in the other side, because then I'm thinking, OK, take away the sanctity of search out of it.  You're now basically saying to one of your pseudo competitors in some ways, but also one of your biggest customers, that the only way that you will continue to kind of show the results where they should be shown is if they continue to pay you.  I mean, that's the Microsoft stuff right there.  That's some pure Microsoft, like from the 90s sort of stuff right there.  So on the one hand, I'm like, OK, well, well played.

Radio Shack Radio Shack is, of course, going out of business in their bankruptcy sale.  They are offering tens of millions of email and home addresses to the highest bidder.  Do you ever join the Radio Shack Battery Club?  They remember when you bought something at Radio Shack, they'd ask you for their phone number.  Well, now you know where it's going.  Thirteen million email addresses, sixty five million customer names and physical addresses.  And they're trying to sell it off as part of their assets.

Transcript:  And not absolutely.  So this is one reason why I would refuse to give the Radio Shack people my name or my zip code or or sign up to buy the five dollar  insurance plan on my twenty five dollar ethernet to USB adapter.  And I would say, no, I'm not going to going to buy that.  And they they look at me funny.  And and and I think this is also one reason why I don't think any of us are upset that they're going out of business, because this is the first thing they do.

Transcript:  Wow. In the past, the FTC, again, has said that if something like this is happening during a liquidation,  data should be sold with a larger group of assets, not just parceled out to the highest bidder by themselves, that the privacy policy should be maintained and the buyer should be in the same general line of business.  But, you know, this is an example of why you might want to be a little careful about the information you give out.  We're out of time, but what a great time we had.  I want to thank you all three for being here.  Jill Duffy, PCMag.com.  Anything you want to plug?

I want it to be understandable for the people who don't really dig into their technology that much.  They're just ordinary people.  They want to use their phones.  They want them to work.  So I try to write simple, clear tips for people that everybody can understand.
