Transcript:  It's time for This Week in Tech. Great show. I'm excited.  Christina Warren from GitHub is here. From the register, Iain Thompson and brand new to Dread,  Rob Peguraro. He works with PC Magazine and Fast Company. Both Rob and Iain were at DefCon  and Black Hat. We're going to talk about what happened in Vegas. It does not stay in Vegas,  including satellite hacking, the new downfall flaw in Intel chips, and how AI is easily hackable.  Then we're going to talk about Mr. Beast. He's suing Mr. Beast's burger,  and they're suing him right back. All that and more coming up next on TWiT.

Oh,  I have assembled a wonderful panel because we are just coming off Black Hat and Def Con.  So I have brought together some people who are actually in the house, as it were, welcoming  somebody brand new to the show. But I think we're going to see a lot more of them because I already  like the cut of his jib. Rob Begarraro is here. You've seen him in PC Magazine on the Washington  Post fast company and he will not fix your computer, which is a really great call back.

Transcript:  but less interesting one. The corporate one. We'll get into the differences. I think that's a good  way to start. Iain's, of course, at the register and wrote a bunch of articles, really good articles.  I was following your coverage. Oh, thank you. You did a wonderful article on the Network Operations Center.

Transcript:   I was the only journalist that got inside it that year.  It was fascinating and geek heaven. Absolutely. They bring their own gear.  Manufacturers actually give them free gear to use for the show. So they bring their gear,

Start time: 196.56
End time: 211.12
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  but then anything they want, they just say, hey, Cisco, can we have that? Can we, you know,  we'd like that. And of course, manufacturers jump to do it. Yes. The best part of your story is when  they say, but some of this stuff really is crap. So we don't take it.

Speaker: Iain Thompson
Transcript:  Once we get it. I asked them for names as well. It's really annoying. I was deliberately asked by  Grifter not to name names on, you know, if anyone let slip and you, you've got to abide by that.  Yeah. But inside the center itself, it's just, you know, they've got films like Hackers and  Sneakers displayed on the wall with subtitles. There's music playing. It's nice and dark. So  everyone can read their screens, sofas, stickers everywhere. It's so good that the head of the  Paris Olympic Committee for their systems operations center has copied the design almost  to the letter. Wow. That's pretty impressive. Wow. Yeah. They had him over for the London Black Hat  or rather he asked to come to the London Black Hat and see how they did it. They're obviously  expecting massive stuff, but he was so impressed that they've set up pretty much a replica center

Transcript:  for the Paris Olympics. Wow. Neil Grifter Weiler is a global lead of active threat assessments at  the IBM X-Force. So he probably knows what he's doing. And a thoroughly nice bloke.  Fun. I highly recommend the article. Also with us, it's great to have her. She was not at Black  Hat or Def Con, but that's fine. Neither was I. It's great to have you. Christina Warren,  senior dev advocate. How many times have you seen Tay Tay's eras tour now?

Speaker: Christina Warren
Transcript:  I saw it three times. Three times. I saw it three times. Atlanta night one, no, night two,  yeah. Night one, Atlanta, night two, New Jersey, night two, Seattle. And I would like to say that  I'm done, but I, if I can get tickets in Paris, I will do that. Wouldn't that be awesome? Yeah.

Start time: 309.14
End time: 326.08
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  To see Taylor in Paris. Yeah. She was just down here in the Levi's Stadium and I guess  Mark Zuckerberg was there in the box. Elon Musk, a lot of Jason Howell, Jason Howell. You went,  you that's right. He brought his girls. Oh, that's awesome. I love that. That's amazing. I'm so glad

Transcript:  What is the Venn diagram of people who've seen Taylor Swift's eras concert three times and people  who've seen the Barbie movie three times? Is that a, it's, it's probably, it's probably just a

Start time: 341.40
End time: 356.24
Speaker: Christina Warren
Transcript:  complete, yeah, probably a complete overlap. Yeah. So it's a circle. Exactly. It's a circle.  How many times have you seen Barbie? I've only seen it once, but that's only because I only had  time to see it once, but I definitely like, as soon as copies are available, wink, wink, nudge,

Start time: 356.34
End time: 364.86
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  nudge, I will watch it multiple times. We were, I went to see Oppenheimer on Friday at the big  IMAX in San Francisco because I wanted to see the 70 millimeter. Oh, I wish I could have seen it in

Start time: 365.48
End time: 368.76
Speaker: Christina Warren
Transcript:  that way. Yeah. Cause I saw it in 70 millimeter. I didn't see it in IMAX. It's fun to go because

Start time: 370.68
End time: 376.56
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  there's all these people in pink who are obviously going to the other movie. Yeah. A lot of people in

Start time: 376.70
End time: 385.08
Speaker: Iain Thompson
Transcript:  pink ready for the Barbie movie. It's cute. What did you think of it? Cause we've got tickets to  go and see it, but three hours is a hell of a long time. I don't want to ruin it for you, but what is

Start time: 385.52
End time: 434.12
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  obviously the case, and this is both good and bad, is it no one can say no to Christopher Nolan at  this point. He's so powerful. So that's good because he could do a 70 millimeter IMAX movie  on film. That's three hours long. No one else could get away with that. In fact, if anybody's  going to continue to make these IMAX movies, I think there's a good case to be made that this  may be one of the last IMAX film movies out there. Cause it's ridiculous. It's expensive,  hard to shoot. They had to make a special platter because there's so much film. The platter is huge  and there are only 12 or 13 theaters in the U S that could show it. So there's really very  little incentive. There's no money to be made doing it. So there's really no incentive.  Most IMAX movies are digital. What you saw was digital, Christina. No, I saw it on 70 millimeter

Start time: 434.24
End time: 462.48
Speaker: Christina Warren
Transcript:  film, but we didn't have the full IMAX. It wasn't IMAX. So it was the film cut, but it was not the  height. So it's still different. So there were a few theaters that had 70 millimeter film, but only  12. Like you said, there was one in New York when my parents theater in Atlanta had it.  Interestingly, San Francisco, I could have gone to Vancouver, but I would have had to literally

End time: 466.48
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  leave. I'm going to save you some money and time. I don't think you need to.

Start time: 467.48
End time: 478.24
Speaker: Christina Warren
Transcript:  No, I would agree with that. When I saw it, like, I mean, I was, we're not going to spoil it,  but I don't think that the visuals were that imperative. No, and in fact, the way it's shot,

Start time: 479.30
End time: 543.46
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  there's a lot of closeups and I got to tell you a closeup of somebody on a screen that is the size  of a building is a little too close. Oversampling their face. Oh my God. These people,  I thought movie stars are good looking. Wow. What HD did to a lot of people's living.  This is worse than HD. They say that the film is the equivalent of 18K. So these are such giant  frames and I unfortunately there's limited seating. So we were in the fifth row. Oh,  that's the worst. Yeah. So the screen is, you know, a little bit below you and then a lot above you.  Ice train. And the very first shot is a closeup of Oppenheimer, Sillian Murphy and in very tight  closeup. And you just want to go, whoa, and everybody, I mean, they're all beautiful people,  but in closeup, sometimes you want to just reach out and pluck a hair, pop a zit. It's a little too,

Start time: 543.76
End time: 575.30
Speaker: Christina Warren
Transcript:  it's closer than real life. Oh no, it's ridiculous. Cause I saw at, in IMAX, another Christopher Nolan  film, I saw the dark night. I remember seeing that in IMAX, like the full presentation of one of the  few theaters. And I remember like absolutely no disrespect to Maggie Gyllenhaal, but it was one  of those things where I was like, man, I can really, like, I'm really upset about the recast  at this moment because of how big the closeup is right now. Like I was looking at Katie Holmes's

Start time: 575.44
End time: 598.82
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  face instead, honestly. I feel bad for poor Florence Pugh who had to do a nude scene at that size.  Oh God. Yeah. I mean, she's the eight, talking about an 80 foot tall woman. I mean, she's,  and anyway, so a couple of thoughts. So that's the good thing is that Nolan has enough clout to do  that. And I'm, I wanted to see it. I saw the dark night, same theater. That wasn't as good  because it switched back and forth. It was a little weird. Plus I think it was 3D, wasn't it?

Start time: 600.10
End time: 603.46
Speaker: Christina Warren
Transcript:  No, it wasn't 3D. It's just, there were most of the sequences where IMAX was not the whole thing.

Start time: 603.82
End time: 631.62
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. It was weird that way. There were a couple of 16 by nine shots for some reason in this,  in the Oppenheimer, but most of them were that weird, you know, whatever four by four  squarish IMAX ratio. So it was beautiful and the sound is incredible, but the movie is easily an  hour too long. I thought. What do you think? Yeah. I mean, Christina, did you? So, okay. So my thought

Start time: 631.76
End time: 640.20
Speaker: Christina Warren
Transcript:  was yes. So here was my thought actually, when I saw it, I was like the source material I've since  read about half the book. I hadn't read the book beforehand, but now I've read about half the book.

Start time: 640.42
End time: 643.34
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. I just ordered it. That's what everybody does is they get the book. American Prometheus.

Start time: 643.56
End time: 709.68
Speaker: Christina Warren
Transcript:  Totally. Yeah. And the book is, the audio version is 27 hours long. It's like 700 pages. So it's a  tomb. So he clearly cut a lot of stuff. So in my opinion, it either should have been, you know,  half an hour, 45 minutes shorter, or it should have just been like a mini-series.  HBO series. To be completely honest. Yeah. It would have been a great HBO series.  That was my thought. I was like, when I remember when Mike Nichols did the adaptation of Angels  in America and they did it as two, three hour parts. Right. And that was great. And I was also  thinking, you know, even Chernobyl, if you didn't want to, like, if you wanted to have four, there's  certain things in the film that you could do it before and after segment of, if you wanted to do  parts, you could also do it episodic. But yeah, I mean, my feeling I was, it felt like he cut a lot  out to even get to that three hours. It's very fast-paced, very fast editing, which again,  another thing on a giant IMAX screen is not pleasant. Yeah. That's the one thing I will say  for it is three hours, but it doesn't feel like three hours. The pacing is great. Here's where it  drags. But yeah, I feel like he should have either extended it, made it a mini-series or shortened

Start time: 709.74
End time: 771.92
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  it in my opinion. His spine of this, and I don't know about the book because I'm ready yet, but I  just ordered it. But the spine of it is this hearing later after everything where he was,  his clearance for the Atomic Energy Commission was revoked, a committee was revoked. And that's  the spine of it is the testimony. And that goes on and on and on. And I don't think it was a good  spine for a movie, to be honest. Flashbacks back to the hearing, flashbacks back to the hearing,  way too much of that. I love the black and white stuff because he made a special black and white  film stock just for Nolan, because they don't have black and white IMAX. So that was, and it was  beautiful. It was a really beautiful black and white. Technically it was worth seeing it there  that way. And I hesitate to review the movie because it's a very different experience. I don't  know if you saw The Dark Knight later, as I did on a regular screen. I did. It's a different  experience. It's like a different movie. Really? Okay. And I bet Oppenheimer's the same.

Start time: 773.00
End time: 778.00
Speaker: Christina Warren
Transcript:  So I think- Yeah, I would be interested to see that. I feel like-  See, now you're making me want to see it. Oh, you should definitely see it.

Start time: 778.06
End time: 792.24
Speaker: Rob Pegoraro
Transcript:  The last movie I saw was Dunkirk, which is so much shorter. And I have to admit,  I saw that on the proper screen for it on the back of a seat in economy class, where you can  realize your travel experience is not that bad, actually. I saw Dunkirk. No one's trying to kill

Start time: 792.70
End time: 819.44
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  you. It's one of those Cinerama domes in San Jose. And it was very, very wide. It's not as tall as  IMAX. That was an overwhelming movie, but good. Yeah. This one, I feel like-  Very tightly structured, too. Look, it's a great story. It's an important,  I think it's a really important story. And I think he tells it appropriately.  The acting is great. Wonderful. Everybody in it is wonderful.

Start time: 819.66
End time: 825.68
Speaker: Christina Warren
Transcript:  Emily Blunt was really, really good. But again, Emily, I'm just thinking a moisturizer and maybe

Start time: 825.84

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  some, I don't know, I'm just thinking some, just a little poor, no, she's gorgeous, but nobody is

Start time: 833.68
End time: 848.86
Speaker: Christina Warren
Transcript:  going to look good that close. No, no, that's what I was saying. I will never forget seeing Maggie  Gyllenhaal's face on the huge IMAX thing, being like, I know you're very attractive, but wow,  this is not made for anybody's face. Even if you're kissing her, you're not that close.

Start time: 850.24
End time: 882.64
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And I've never heard of nose wrinkles, but apparently-  Oh, I'm feeling self-conscious about my nose. Somebody does have nose wrinkles. I'm not going  to say who. Paranoia now, and what the hell's going on? Full size. 18 foot nose wrinkles. Let's talk  about tech. But actually, it was a little bit about tech, really. Yeah, it was, actually.  I think it's an important movie. I'm glad he made it. I think he did a good job of justice to the  content. I would say probably better to see it at home or on a normal screen than an IMAX,  unless you're fascinated by the IMAX technology, which I was. Yeah, if you want to see, if you

Start time: 882.66
End time: 899.28
Speaker: Christina Warren
Transcript:  want to appreciate the filmmaking, see it in the IMAX thing. Otherwise, if three hours is too much,  but I think it is an interesting, it obviously was made before the AI period we're in right now,  but it is an interesting category for the AI. Oh, do you think so? That's interesting, because

Start time: 899.42
End time: 951.14
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  the whole premise, of course, as one should know by now, is physicists made this thing because we  were in the midst of a big war with the Nazis, who were also trying to make it. And they knew  if the Nazis made it first, it would be the end of the world, essentially. So they said,  we've got to make this first. But then we beat the Nazis and had VE Day, and we continued to make it  and used it against Japan, twice, killing hundreds of thousands of civilians, including children.  And there's, so there's the ambiguity, the moral ambiguity of that. And then the ambiguity, the  moral difficulty, the physicists had saying we have now unleashed something that maybe mankind  shouldn't really have. And now that really was a should physicists create mass weapons of mass  destruction? That really was legit. I, there is the also the question of, should people be creating AI,  but I don't think AI is yet weapon of mass destruction. Or do you think so? No, I don't.

Start time: 951.86
End time: 985.66
Speaker: Christina Warren
Transcript:  But I think that the allegory, I just think that the argument is the same. Like I think that you  have people who are feeling the same source of pain. I don't think it's at that degree at all,  but it was one of those interesting things that I could already see the hand wringing,  think pieces that I'm going to roll my eyes at comparing the two, that will be sure to come  through the end of the year. Making kind of those points, even though the film again was made without  any of the this generative AI, kind of like, boom that we've been having. It was completely made  separate from that. I wasn't going to start with this. We will get to Black Hat and Def Con,

Start time: 985.68
End time: 1035.60
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  because I do want to talk about it. But as long as we're talking about this, Emily Bender, who's been,  I think, very good on AI wrote an excellent piece in Scientific American, which I recommend to all.  It's an opinion piece. AI causes real harm. Let's focus on that over the end of humanity  hype. And I completely agree with her that we, you know, the people making AI, including Sam  Altman, CEO of OpenAI, are pushing this notion. They even wrote a letter saying we've got to stop  this. It's going to end the humanity. And her point is, that's just hype for AI's capabilities.  There is real problem. There are real problems. It isn't the end of humanity that's the problem.  It's using AI to put people of color disproportionately in jail or to choose

Start time: 1036.02
End time: 1041.76
Speaker: Iain Thompson
Transcript:  the Detroit case. Yeah. Yeah. Or to choose who you hire. Or, you know, they asked some,

Start time: 1042.02
End time: 1107.52
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think this is at Def Con, actually. We can get to Def Con Black Hat. They had the AI village.  Was that a Black Hat, the AI village? That was Def Con. Oh, no, Def Con, sorry.  Villages are Def Con. So that was a bunch of people brought in with the most, all the AI from  Anthropic and OpenAI and all that, trying to, you know, jailbreak it and trick it. But there  were even legitimate questions like, well, if you could hire somebody named Juan or somebody named  Iain, who would you hire? Who would you think would be more reliable? And the AI goes, well,  Iain, of course, everybody would know that. These are real risks. And these companies are going full  speed ahead with this kind of AI in society, trying to make you say, but watch out because  it could destroy the world. That's not the real problem. I think Bender had a brilliant article  this is the same thing that they were talking about in Stochastic Parrots that Timnit Gebru and  Margaret Mitchell were talking about in Stochastic Parrots. The real, genuine, today harms,  potential harms of AI versus some speculative thing about, you know,

Start time: 1108.32
End time: 1144.96
Speaker: Christina Warren
Transcript:  Yes. Which to be clear, which to be clear, when I'm talking about like the allegory that I see,  I don't necessarily mean so much. I think there will be some bad think pieces that,  you know, take that hype and see it will lead to the end of the world. But I'm more talking about  the very real, I think, ethical implications that researchers are having to deal with right now,  which I think are probably similar to some of the ethical challenges that researchers have  faced in other fields. Agree 100%. Because you can see how even these things that won't end humanity  can still have a very real negative impact on the world. Yeah, very much. I think in terms of

Start time: 1145.06
End time: 1162.14
Speaker: Iain Thompson
Transcript:  actual real world impact, yeah, Terminator makes a great film. But at the same time,  we're more inconvenienced by being flagged up by an insurance company's AI as a massive risk out of  sort or having our kids not do well in school because an AI system is apparently grading their

Start time: 1162.50
End time: 1180.24
Speaker: Rob Pegoraro
Transcript:  papers. It's an increasingly disturbing situation. And it sounds like the big focus on large language  model, LLM AI, generative AI, which can hold a conversation and convincingly lie to you is  distracting people from the things we're talking about have been a problem for years. They didn't

Start time: 1180.42
End time: 1232.40
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  get invented in 2023. That's a good point. That's a good point. And I do believe there's a certain  amount of hand waving coming from people like Sam Altman. Pay no attention to the, you know,  so while the atom bomb is absolutely a weapon of mass destruction and the H bomb after,  and there's an it's worth watching Oppenheimer just for that, you know, thread and Edward Teller  promoting the hydrogen bomb and so forth. You know, Oppenheimer said we don't need a more  destructive nuclear weapon. What do you, why do we need that? And if you create that, then the  Russians are going to have to create that. And then it's going to be nuclear proliferation. Those  are really serious topics. We don't have a, AI isn't a weapon of mass destruction, but it is a  weapon of everyday destruction. And I think it's important. I think you're right. I think the ethics  of it, but what does that mean? I don't think Silicon Valley thinks about ethics when it's

Start time: 1232.54
End time: 1340.86
Speaker: Christina Warren
Transcript:  developing a new technology. They're not. Well, that's the interesting, that's the interesting  and weird place I think we are with AI. This is one of the, and again, I mean,  bad thing pieces that are sure to come aside. I think there is this interesting kind of similarity  with the atom bomb where you had the, you had kind of the worlds of academia coming together  with the world's military. And I think that with AI it's similar, but instead of military, it is  corporate, right? So you have most of the groups that are doing a lot of the work are hand in hand,  both academics and researchers at big institutions and technology researchers or former researchers  who now work for big tech companies. So there's this interesting tension between those two places  where you want to see how far you can push things from a research perspective, but it becomes less  about, you know, publishing papers and more about publishing patents and the tension between those  two groups. You see it in quantum as well. Like there's this very interesting tension between  the business aspect and the academia aspect, but the two have to have one another because they,  they depend on one another. And I think that's the interesting thing with AI is that  the corporations might not think as much about the ethical things, but the academics do. And most of  the people who are doing a lot of the work, whether they work in corporate America or not, did come from  academia. That doesn't mean they're going to be ethical, but I think it does, you know, I don't  think the people who are doing these things are not aware of ethics. If they choose to, you know,  define them differently, maybe that's something, but I don't think that they're not thinking about  the ethics. I think that all the people who are working on this very much are, they just, you know,  might rank them, you know, differently in terms of how important it is. I think the people developing

Start time: 1341.02
End time: 1350.00
Speaker: Iain Thompson
Transcript:  it, the people developing it are taking an ethical standpoint on this. Unfortunately, I think the  people that are funding it and ultimately controlling it aren't taking it. They're still in move fast and

Transcript:  break things. People like Peter Thiel and Palantir aren't really considering the ethics. I think you  know, Peter Thiel, what? Ethics, Thiel, hmm. I do think that even if you're thinking about it,  unless there's a formal structure around it, you're unlikely to act on it or even be heard if you  raise the issue that probably we should really start thinking about whether there should be some  sort of ethics structure in all of these startups, you know, a committee on the safe use of, or  something like that with some real teeth and real power.

But I sure like to see some regulation that says,  and oh, by the way, you know, you need to have an ombudsman there next to the people developing  this stuff, paying attention to this. They talk about, yeah, they talk about algorithmic  discrimination, data privacy. These things are important. Oh, well, let's talk about Black Hat,  because that's where everybody goes to find out what you can do. Nothing actually.  With all these wonderful tools. Your article in PC Magazine, Rob, about Black Hat, the feds  showed up in force. They, Black Hat used to have the spot the fed game. It's not hard to spot the

Transcript:  fed when they're on the keynote stage. So yeah, it was really striking where at the end of the  first day's keynote, a representative from DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects  Administration came out to announce the AI Cyber Challenge, which is a two-year contest,  almost $20 million in funding to see, can we develop ways to use AI to strengthen our software,  to find and fix flaws automatically, to defend critical infrastructure? And you might say, well,  yeah, whatever. But AI has in fact sponsored a lot of important research, including work that  led to the network that is bringing this fantastic content to your screen right now. And then the  particular panel talk I wrote about was Bob Lord and Jack Cable of CISA, the Cybersecurity and  Infrastructure Security Administration or agency, sorry, talking about the Security by Design  Initiative. And I'm used to seeing people from where I'm from DC talking very unobjectionable  generalities about what you should do. But in this case, it was very in the weeds, actionable.  Good. You should be writing your software in memory safe languages. If you offer a single sign-on,  which you should, don't charge extra for it. Don't have an SSO tax. Love it. High quality  auto log should be free, not an upcharge item. If you're the service or the product you're providing  is based on lots of other people's code, provide an SBOM, software bill of materials,  really detailed, actionable stuff. And it tied into one thing. I've been hearing people from  this White House say consistently for the last two years, we need to lift the burden of cybersecurity  from the people who are least able to bear it right now. In other words, stop yelling at the users.  It's your fault for not changing the defaults. Yeah. That's a good point. Somebody needs to be  saying that. And unfortunately right now, all the administration really can do is try to lead by  example because have you seen the output of Congress in tech policy lately? Yeah, nothing.

Transcript:  But also at DEF CON as well this year. Yeah. Jeff Moss did a fed thing. The  Transpol security agency had a stand in the Expo Center. The NSA usually does, but they didn't this  year. I think it was starting to go that way and then Snowden kicked in and they were kicked out  again and they're gradually being let back in again because they recognize, but I mean, coming  to the point that Rob was making, Corey Doctorow did a great speech at this on Saturday where he  was saying, you don't actually need legislation from the government. All you need for them to do  is say, right, if you want us to buy your software, you have to do certain types of things. And I  don't think I may be wrong on this one, but they actually need legislation for that. So you could

Transcript:  mandate, you know, actually the administration has put in some requirements. Like if you're going to  sell software or IT services to the government, you do not have requirements. Like you do have  to provide an SBOM. What's an SBOM? Software Bill of Materials. So what went in it,  which is a good thing to know. Like what libraries, what languages? Well, same way, you know,  a recipe has the ingredients, the food bill of materials or FBOM, if you will. Same thing  you would do in software. You just wanted to say FBOM, didn't you? I can keep it in my back pocket  the whole time. And you want to know that because as we've seen with things like Log4j,  there's lots of libraries that you think because it's open source, so many, enough eyeballs,  all bugs are shallow. But what if everyone else thinks, oh, someone else's eyeballs are on this?  Yeah. PyPy has been, is full of flaws. So you want to know what libraries you're using. So you can  then look and see, okay, has someone looked at this? What are the risks? And I should be very

Start time: 1702.14

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  clear. There's flaws, which are inadvertent errors that people can exploit. But then there's also  malware that's intentionally put in these libraries that causes huge problems because people include  the libraries assume that, oh, you know, it's safe. It's a library and it's not. Yeah, we've been  talking about that on security now. There's a lot of that going on. So I was talking with that with

Transcript:  Christina, do you know John Swanson? Yes. Yeah, I did. I did an interview with him about GitHub  rolling out two factor authentication. He gave a talk about the black hat. That's a fascinating  bloke. Yes. Yeah. But I mean, he was saying, you know, this is, this kind of thing is really useful  for identifying malicious accounts, which are, and they're not going to go onto two factor because  it means an element of identification that they don't want. Right. Right. But it was a difficult

But it's, it's difficult even for communities where  you would think that it would be kind of an accepted thing of, yes, this is what we need to  do. It's very difficult to roll that sort of thing out and not, you know, wind up with the potential  of people being locked out of accounts and things like that. So I think I was remiss. I did not

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  mention, I think you all know it, but Christina Warren is a senior dev advocate at GitHub. Hence,  but does not speak for GitHub when she's on the show. So let's make that clear. Any more than Iain  speaks for the register or Rob speaks. I'm self-employed, so I do speak for everyone.  So there is, you know, it's, it is getting circling full back to Oppenheimer. There is an  interesting kind of relationship because government in this case was really pushing for an atom bomb,  probably for good reason. Initially, physicists said, okay, we had a patriotism. We need to create  this. And then after the fact, there was all this hand wringing about what have we done? Now I am,  now I am a desk destroyer of worlds, you know, maybe we should have the hanging first.  And I think there's also a very good point that you make, Rob, which is,  and I'll play the anti-government guy. I understand why people say, well, we don't do,  we really want government regulating technology. You know, look at the EU saying you have to have  a USB-C port on your phone. I don't want that. I understand why people are very skeptical of  government getting involved in technology, but if not government, who? Right? There is no one else.  It's either big tech self-regulates and we know how that works out. That's not, that's not so great.  And it's because of the incentives. And it's the same reason we developed an H-bomb or an A-bomb.  We had these incentives. Government was responding to a certain set of incentives.  Technology, big tech companies are for-profit entities responding to the, you know, the  incentive to be profitable to their stakeholders. And you can't expect them necessarily. I think in  many cases like GitHub, they do do the right thing. But you can't, you can't say, well, it's entire,  the burn is entirely on them any more than it's entirely on consumers. So who else? It's got to  be government. Now that means we now have to educate government. We have to make sure that  members of Congress know what's going on. I wish we still had the office of technology policy.  People are still trying to bring back the OTA. Yeah. We need that because that was an independent,  non-partisan group that advised Congress on technologies. And Newt Gingrich got rid of it  decades ago. And now there is nobody Congress can go to except industry or their staff who then goes  to industry for this information. And so they need to have this information. So I think maybe step  one is to make sure Congress is getting educated on this process. Well, and that's where you talk

Transcript:  to people in Congress and they'll say, well, first of all, you need to have staff that stick around  long enough so they develop expertise, which means you need to pay them more. Okay. And saying that  smarter tech policy starts with paying people in suits on the Hill more is not as easy of a  sales pitch as you might think. Yeah. Well, especially when you've got lobbyists who are  willing to come. That's the thing. If you spend two years in someone's office. I'll write that bill  for you.

Where they're forcing a backdoor of encryption.  There was an absolutely infuriating interview with one of the technology minister, I think on  Tuesday, I saw that world technology to do this without breaking encryption is under development.  It's like speed under development for 10 years and you cannot physically break encryption in a way

Transcript:  next month. Almost certainly. We've got a bit of a dead duck conservative government at the moment,  but they're hanging on to with their fingertips to get stuff done until they're voted out of  office, which seems highly likely. This has been bubbling under in the conservative party for about  six or seven years. And as usual, they've invoked, you know, one of the four horsemen of the  apocalypse in this case, child abusers leading terrorists, children's chair. Think of the  children. Think of the women. Yeah. Yeah. Terrorists, children, drug dealers, and organized  crime. Those are the four ones that always get trotted out. And in this case, you know,

Speaker: Iain Thompson
Transcript:  it's a simple matter of logic. If you put, if you enforce a back door in there and you tell everyone  there's a back door in there, you're going to be looking at an Oppenheimer like level of effort by  our adversaries to find that back door and exploit it. Because once you've got that, that's the ball

Start time: 2093.46
End time: 2133.12
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  game. It's as simple as that. In the U S it's a constitutional amendment, the fourth amendment,  that basically says in effect, almost explicitly, you've got to balance the rights of the individual  with the desire of law enforcement to catch each and every criminal. And in the U S at least,  in our constitution, it says we should be safe from unreasonable search and seizure. They  put, they unders, if the founders understood that there is a balance, but that ultimately,  it's not worth catching every criminal if it gives the government eyes into our personal lives.  Is there anything in the UK like that? Is there any?

Start time: 2134.14
End time: 2154.48
Speaker: Iain Thompson
Transcript:  There's nothing formal like that. We don't have a written constitution as you do in the United  States, which is both a blessing and a curse. The amount of lawyering that goes on around this in  the U S whereas in the UK, we kind of make it up as we go along a bit. I mean, it's all a question  of legislation. There isn't the police have the right to tap your phones with a judicial warrant.

Start time: 2155.76
End time: 2189.76
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think there's a certain amount of cross-pollination. Like the people in the UK  are saying, well, you know, that's not a bad idea to require a warrant for certain seizure and stuff  like that. And so that seems to be making its way into your law, just as most of your laws made away  into ours. The EFF has an interesting strategy on the snoopers charter. They say, go to the house of  lords. They say, tell the house of lords to protect end to end encryption. I guess they're feeling like  a Tory majority. Commons isn't going to do that, but maybe the lords can be convinced to.

Start time: 2190.54
End time: 2242.16
Speaker: Iain Thompson
Transcript:  Yes, it's a really odd system because basically only the houses of parliament can, sorry, the  house of commons can propose fundamental legislation. The lords can block it for a  limited time and they can amend it and then send it back for, for re-voting. I think in the house  of commons, the conservative party is now voting in lockstep that it would take something major for  this not to go through. The lords though, traditionally, because they're life peers,  so they don't have to worry about being strong armed by the party, so the individual party so  much, they have a lot more freedom of action in this, but their powers are limited, which,  you know, because originally the house of lords was hereditary was a damn good idea, but you know,  it's, it's kind of frustrating. They're almost like the bastion of sanity, which-  The peers, that's great.  Considering the average age is about 65, then that's the last line of defense.

When  we come back, we will talk about then the other way to respond to the snoopers charter, which is  to come up with better encryption. You know, signals already said if the snoopers charter  passes, we're leaving the UK. But then there's an interesting move by the cult of the dead cow.  They're still around, ladies and gentlemen. I was in the presentation.  I know. I want you to talk about Valed when we come back. One of the ways you could respond  to a government that says no encryption allowed, maybe not let the encryption be in charge of  Google. How about that? Or Apple, right? How about that? We've got a great panel. Good for,  good for this topic. Let me tell you, but good for any topic. Iain Thompson's here from the  register. Always wonderful to have you. And I know your throat is dying, but get some tea  or something and take care of yourself. I will be popping out to get a glass of water during the,  during the break. Of course, the wonderful film girl. We love having Christina Warren on  dev advocate at senior dev advocate at GitHub.

Our show today brought to you by Miro,  not Joanne Miro, the expressionist painter, but related close. I think they took the name  because it was such a appropriate way of describing this amazing way to get your  team on track. Quick question. Are you and your team going from tab to tab, tool to tool,  losing brilliant ideas and important information along the way? You know that brain scientists  call this context shift. When you walk through a doorway, you always forget what it was you were  going into the other room for. That's because your context has changed. Same thing happens  when you're using Slack and Google docs and a bunch of other different tools and you're moving  from one to the other. Stuff just disappears. It doesn't have to happen with Miro. Miro is the  collaborative visual platform that brings all your great work together. No matter where you are,  no matter what you use, no matter what time zone you're in, working from home, working in a hybrid  workspace, working in a coffee shop, everything comes together in one workspace online. There's  no context switching. Integrations with all the tools we use. I use it with Zapier and Google docs  and Slack. Creating one great product needs inputs from everyone. So if you've got a team  and you're working on something together, that's where Miro comes in. It democratizes collaboration  input. It's great for brainstorming. It's great for Zoom meetings. They even have a timer in there  and icebreakers to make your Zoom meeting more effective. Miro's infinite shared boards give  product teams a perpetual space, a single source of truth where they can just drag and drop in  insights and data, make a mood board or make an MVP of your product all in one spot so nothing's  lost or forgotten. Miro covers every possible use case. So you can build visual assets,  you can present findings, you can run brainstorms with cross-functional teams. In fact, the best  thing to do is go to Miro.com slash podcast. Look at the Miroverse. Those are Miro templates created  by everybody in the world, all over the world. Some in the UK government. I don't know why,  but there's a Harry Potter template from the UK government. So you can see how people are using  Miro. It's kind of cool. You can build out your product vision on a Miro board by brainstorming  with sticky notes, comments, live reactions. There's a voting tool. There's a timer to make  sure you come to consensus quickly. You can express yourself very creatively with drawings,  wireframes. There's a pen tool. You can, as I said, do a mood board by dragging and dropping  images or mock-ups onto the Miro board. It's really great. In fact, it works so well,  Miro users report saving up to 80 hours per user per year by streamlining conversations  and cutting down on meetings. Who likes meetings? Nobody does. But at least when you're meeting  and you've got Miro, you're all talking about the same thing. The end result, Miro gives your team  the chance to always stay connected with real-time information. It gives product managers and product  leads a bird's eye view of the whole project to ensure nothing slips through the cracks.  It's not really much of a surprise. More than one million people use Miro every single month. You  should be too. And here's the best deal. I always bury the lead. Get your first three boards for free  to start working better. Miro.com slash podcast. Because they know once you start using Miro,  you're going to think of all sorts of ways to use it. And you're going to want to get a premium  account, but start with the first three boards for free so you can really get a sense of how it  works. Miro.com slash podcast. So you went to the Valed presentation, Iain. It is from the,  I didn't even know the Cult of the Dead Cow was still around. These guys are legends in the hacker

Transcript:  nobody gets the special horned hat or anything like that. But I think that it's interesting.  This presentation from a Dildog and Medusfor was interesting because I think in the back of their  minds, at least they're thinking here comes the snoopers charter. We need a better way of  communicating that is impervious to this kind of government intervention. And you can see it coming  because Apple and Google ultimately have to give in, right? It's either give in or move out.  And we saw Google did leave China. Apple did not. Right. Yep. Seems highly unlikely Google or Apple  will leave the UK. Microsoft didn't, even if they couldn't, they didn't approve the Activision

Start time: 2668.10
End time: 2689.36
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Facebook, even if they're not going to put news in Canada or WhatsApp in the UK, they're not going  to leave the country. So we need something that is not attached to a giant tech entity or a  for-profit entity of any kind to provide us with this kind of encryption. That's what I always  thought would happen, which was essentially it would be a grassroots people's tool. Is Valid that?

Start time: 2689.56
End time: 2738.32
Speaker: Iain Thompson
Transcript:  Yeah. It is. It is and it isn't, put it that way. It's primarily the, you know, one of the points  they were making was government. Yes, certainly is a massive issue. What also inspired this up  to a point was basically surveillance capitalism. And people are making, they've made the point that,  you know, we've gone from this open internet to everything you do being up for sale. And some  people have become billionaires as a result, but at the cost of everyone else's privacy.  And ultimately this is something the government can latch onto as well. So what they wanted to do  was build a decentralized network. The lovely phrase they had was, it's like TOR and IPFS had  sex and this is the outcome. You know, okay. So TOR has its own problems. The NSA owns about a

Start time: 2738.44
End time: 2760.04
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  hundred exit nodes on TOR. So nothing's private on TOR, even though it tries to be right.  And then IPFS, which is what the interplanetary file system,  is a encrypted file system that actually Brave supports. I think some browsers support.  Yeah. That allows you to kind of have a decentralized server technology.

Start time: 2761.38
End time: 2800.72
Speaker: Iain Thompson
Transcript:  Yeah. So I mean here with, when you develop in, in Valid, then all your application,  all the applications that are developed become nodes, but crucially no one node is more equal  than others. So it's a mesh. It's a mesh basically. So to come back to what you were saying about the  NSA monitoring tool, you couldn't do this with this, with, with this framework, unless you actually  owned every single node or almost every single node. And as this thing scales up,  it's going to be pretty much, you know, as secure as it is possible to be.  And they've made it clear that they're going to support this and improve things like encryption,  authentication, the rest of it as new technology becomes available.

Start time: 2801.72
End time: 2820.04
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They did a server, but they also have an app. Although chat app. Yeah. I think the premise is  much like with signal Moxie created a library that others use WhatsApp uses it. So is that the plan  too, is that Valid is going to say, here's a library. You can incorporate this into your.

Start time: 2820.18
End time: 2845.04
Speaker: Iain Thompson
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, basically it's, it's written in Rust with bits of Dart and Python. And there are  crossover points between those, but it's very easy to, they designed it deliberately to be very  easy to develop for, but also very easy to use. This was a point they made the user interface has  to be good enough. And they kind of issued a challenge at the end to the effect that, look,  if you can get your parents on Facebook safely, you can get people using, you know, this platform

Start time: 2845.14

Start time: 2858.90
End time: 2891.32
Speaker: Iain Thompson
Transcript:  Right. Yes. Yes. And also, I mean, at this moment for it to be the, the bigger it gets,  the more secure it is. So, oh, interesting in terms of the number of nodes on there.  Cause it is a mesh. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So the more nodes you've got, the more secure it is.  So at the moment, yeah, it's probably easy to, I mean, there's only maybe a couple of hundreds  or maybe a thousand people using it at the moment. But if you've got it onto the scale of something  like WhatsApp, it would be pretty much uncrackable. How does this compare to the signal protocol?

Start time: 2891.84
End time: 2898.60
Speaker: Leo Laporte

Start time: 2899.08
End time: 2949.58
Speaker: Iain Thompson
Transcript:  to my mind, it's the messaging app of choice because it does this sort of thing. So, so, uh,  essentially, but, you know, signal is limited, um, to really limited to sort of a very small  number of use cases. The idea is that you could build an app for pretty much anything using the  app, using, using the platform development program. And, you know, it would be a way of  taking all that data. There's no central server. There's, you know, it's designed for mobile so  that, you know, there's multiple redundancies built in, uh, the number of steps in a communication  makes it very, very difficult to trace. So yeah, I mean, in terms of safeguarding information,  it looks good, but it, it has to, it has to be at scale. And I think that's going to be the real  make or break for this sort of thing. If enough people adopt it, it could be really useful,  but it's, it's a question of driving that initial interest and getting people on the platform.

We've had a similar thing with the recent post office scandal where the government mandated that  Fujitsu provide a billing system for the postal service. The software screwed up and they blamed  the postal people using it. And in some cases they went to jail or committed suicide. So I mean,  obfuscation and denial is very much government policy in the UK and also in the U S here's the,

Transcript:  here's the timeline, which is kind of telling they've now admitted that the electoral commission  basically made the names and addresses of all voters registered between 2014 and 2022  available to hostile actors as of August, 2021. They learned about it October, 2022  and reported it a couple of days ago. That makes Equifax look good. Oh my God. Wow.  Oh my God. They don't, the electoral commission said it's not able to know conclusively what  information has been accessed. You would think that this would then, the, the, the, the house  of commons would then say, gee, maybe encryption is kind of a good thing. Maybe, maybe we should,  maybe we should not put this stuff out in public. I mean, I think you're asking to change their

Transcript:  do that. Yeah. They think Russia might've done it. At least that's what David Omond, the former GHC  GCHQ director said. Oh, it's Russia. Makes sense. Yeah. Yeah. It's easy to blame nation state  hackers. It's also better because then, well, it's probably not going to end up on the dark web.  They're just going to use it against us. Kind of in a national. Everything's fine.  It's all fine. The house isn't on fire. Just the country, just the world. All right.  Isn't house heating. Back, back to Black Hat and Def Con. Let's see. What else do we have here?  AI red teams. We talked about this earlier. Race to find bias and harms in chat bots. I was  underwhelmed by the notion of this. Like, yeah, of course you can jailbreak these LLMs.  Big deal. We know that. What are we going to learn here? Well, I'll defer to Rob because I mean,

Start time: 3128.74
End time: 3159.10
Speaker: Iain Thompson
Transcript:  we were both in the same presentation, but I was actually really encouraged by it because I mean,  when you look at, I mean, Rob made the point about the networks, but more recently, for example,  self-driving cars. DARPA kickstarted that with a prize challenge. Yeah. And in this case,  they're putting 20 million. Well, they're putting 18.5 million in prize in direct prize money,  but also 7 million into funding seven individual US based companies to give a shot at developing  their own products as well. So it is actually sort of casting bread upon the waters as it were

Transcript:  and trying to get some innovation. I mean, there is precedent for this with the  voting village that they did at Def Con some years ago, which really reveals they'd still do that.  They really revealed a lot of exploits on these electronic voting machines. And I think because  of it got Diebold and others to fix problems. Yeah. Well, this is something Jan Easterly said

Start time: 3181.22
End time: 3206.44
Speaker: Iain Thompson
Transcript:  in her keynote was that, you know, it was work like the voting village, which helped ensure  that the last election was made a big difference. Yeah, made a huge difference because some of these  machines were running XP and you could, and also were also running from the USB port. So I mean,  this came up in the voting village. It's literally just a case of walking up, reaching behind it,  plugging into the USB port and you can install malware on there. And that's ridiculous.

Transcript:  So what would be, what would we learn about jailbreaking AI that would be of that kind of  benefit? I mean, we kind of know that some 21 year old hacker was able to convince an AI that 9 plus  13 equal 21. If you're doing math on an LLM, you get deserve whatever you get. And by the way,  she had to go through a lot of stuff and she said, this will be our little secret game.  Nobody, nobody will know we're going to have some fun that way. Yes. Of course you can make

Transcript:  these things hallucinate. It's slightly more than that though, because what they're looking to do  is develop an AI tool, which can, for example, automatically scan software and find potential  vulnerabilities in there and those things. And also, and also, I mean, I spoke to the DARPA  person afterwards and longer term, and a chat from one of the AI companies, Anthropic was there  and longer term, they'd like to get a slightly more reactive AI so that if someone is trying to  break into your network, then it has the tools and the skills to actually say, right, that one's  wrong and let's stop it. We'll stop it in its tracks where we can and alert a human and we can

Transcript:  check this out. In Willa Ramis's article in the Washington Post, he points out that the  Twitter did something similar to this, they had an ethical AI team and by having bounties,  you get real people involved. For instance, one of the things they discovered was that Twitter's AI  image system would crop people in wheelchair out of photos because they weren't the same,  the right height and they just failed to recognize people when they wore hijabs and things like that.

Speaker: Iain Thompson
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's basic security, but it's also, I think, trying to get an idea of,  as Rob said, whether there are implicit biases in there that can be corrected in this way.  As we saw in the Detroit case, they've deployed a facial AI system for about the last 18 months  and it has a perfect score, 0% accurate identification. It's just insane.

That's annoying, but it's not the end of the world. It's not going to jail because you look like some,  maybe looks like somebody. I guess anyway, good. So you've justified to me, you've just amied this AI  village. I think this sounds like a good thing. Did you know if they,  what the results have been? Have they gotten anything?

And if you're looking for the general,  looking to enter the general contest, you need to register. I think it's November the 9th,  but you'd need to check on the website.

Transcript:  Yeah. That's what the Google, one of the Google folks, Royal Hanson is VP of Privacy, Safety and  Security said, don't just tell us these things are possible. Demonstrate it. Really break into  the bank. I'm glad Google gave us permission. I think that's, he said it was okay. Harder to  identify and solve are what Chowdhury calls embedded harms, such as bias assumptions, false claims,  deceptive behavior. You know, that's a little bit harder to prove, I guess. The public red team  challenges, which build on a bias bounty contest are a way to involve ordinary people in that process.

Start time: 3637.78
End time: 3680.76
Speaker: Iain Thompson
Transcript:  Okay. Yeah. I mean, it's there. There is an argument that's been made at was actually made  at DEF CON in 2019 where they said, look, no one knows these are black boxes. You know, very few  people know what data they were trained on. And the example they gave was police data. Now, it's  obviously AI showing a, some AI's are showing a bias in police data, but they pointed out that  that actually could just be because the data itself over the last 50 years is biased against  certain certain races or people. And that's just being reflected in the AI and how you fix that.  It's going to be a very tricky issue. Other revelations. There's a new exploit on Google

Start time: 3694.04
End time: 3762.68
Speaker: Iain Thompson
Transcript:  Is that right? Or no? You guys up on that one? I'm kind of, I mean, we looked at this and it's,  it's one of those things where it could be very serious, but in terms of implementation on a large  scale, I'm, I'm not entirely, basically it's, you know, it's good. What trends, threat models  should make you nervous about this then? Right. Yeah. I mean, it's the thing is we're getting very,  very little information as we did with spectrum meltdown. I mean, when the reg broke that story,  Intel spent two days briefing people at the wall street. Journalists just like, oh, it's,  it's just a little blog. You don't need to worry. There's nothing to worry about here.  But I mean, it's, it exploits the same sort of things. There is proof of concept code. So you  can actually try it and go with it, but it's implementation outside of a research environment.  It's very, I'm trying to think of a, the correct way to put it. It's not something that could be  mass deployed. Yeah, that was something which takes a certain amount of effort. The benefit

Transcript:  of Meltdown inspector was it was very hard to implement, but did hold a risk only on  shared computers. And I think downfall might be the same thing where you have to be on the same  machine as the account. So like in a cloud computing context, exactly. Yeah. Yeah. It's

Start time: 3778.64

Start time: 3817.18
End time: 3846.00
Speaker: Iain Thompson
Transcript:  That's going to be the very last thing they tell us. I mean, they originally died. Meltdown  would have any kind of performance hit. Then they said it would be like two to 3%. And then when it  turned out to be an awful lot more than that, then there was some frantic backpedaling and  sort of software fixes. So I think what'll probably happen is the same thing that happened with the  earlier vulnerabilities. They'll put out a quick fix, which will solve most of the problem, but  with a bit of a performance hit and then refine it over the coming months so they can try and minimize

Start time: 3846.12
End time: 3876.06
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  that. Yeah. I mean, this was a decision long ago by Intel, ultimately copied by other x86  processor manufacturers to do speculative execution. And this pipeline sped speeds up  processors a lot, but it turns out it's also maybe a little porous to an attacker. And I guess the  mitigations turn it off or make it less useful. So you get big speed slowdowns. But I mean, this is

Transcript:  what it comes back to what we were saying earlier about, you know, and you know, it's the priority  when somebody first thought speculators of this actual thing, then they were probably a given a  bonus. And it was just like, wow, this is great. This will really speed up our chips. And it was  only maybe six months or a year down the line that somebody actually said, well, I wonder if there's  a security thing in this. It wasn't Intel who was looking for it. It was outside academics. And

Start time: 3901.46
End time: 3910.32
Speaker: Rob Pegoraro
Transcript:  that's why you need scrutiny on these things. I do seem to remember we talked about this. Does Intel  have a red team now? That's kind of what I want to know. Oh God, I hope so. Yeah. I do seem to

Start time: 3910.38

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  remember when we talked about this on security now that there was in fact, somebody at Intel who  was saying, you know, guys, when this back then, you know, guys, there's this and everybody said,  yeah, but come on, who's going to do that? There was some concern about the risks of this back at  the time. I seem to remember I'd have to find the reference there, but that that's in my memory.  Maybe somebody in our chats will will fill me in. Speaking of which, let's take a little break. I  want to do a commercial, but at the same time, I also want to thank our, our chatters, both the  open to all chatter IRC dot twit dot TV. They're always great for links and more information and  jokes. I steal all my jokes from the IRC. Thank you very much. They're my writers. Also our discord,  which is the newest form of chat. That's a, our club twit discord. I like to think of it as behind  the velvet rope. If you are not yet a club twit member, let me tell you what you get for your,  for merely $7 a month, a couple of, of a triple tall venti lattes. And, and you got it paid every  month. You get ad free versions of everything this show, but all the shows ad free also means,  you know, no trackers tracker free. So absolutely privacy focused. You get additional shows that we  don't put out yet in public. That's how we started this week in space in the twit club, because they  can have subsidized it right now. We're doing Scott Wilkinson's home theater geeks. We brought it  back for the club. Uh, Micah Sargent does hands on Macintosh, Paul Thurot does hands on windows.  We've got the untitled Linux show with Jonathan Bennett, the giz fizz with Dick DiBartolo,  Stacy's book club, a whole lot more great stuff goes on in the club. And the discord is of course  the headquarters for that discord is a great way for our club members to stay in touch with each  other to talk about the things they care about and talk with people they care about. We've got a  fireside check coming up in a month with Hugh Howey, who wrote the wool series. That was the  basis for Apple's silo series. He and Daniel Suarez, his buddy, who of course wrote freedom  and demon TM and is a great friend of the network are going to join Ant Pruitt and me for a little  sci fi convo. That should be fun. September 7th, Lou Maresca, our host of this week in enterprise  tech is doing a fireside chat. So is our AI guru, Anthony Nielsen. Um, we just try to make it  interesting, fun, a great hang. And, uh, it really helps us keep the lights on and support the staff.  And the money from the club to it goes to me. It all goes to keeping twit operating and growing.

Our show today is brought to you by Cisco duo duo. Speaking of security, duo protects against  breaches with a leading access management suite. You probably know duo I've been using duo for years,  but what's duo is as that's so great. And if you're not using it, you need to know about this.  It provides strong multi-layered defenses, uses innovative capabilities that only allow legitimate  users in and keep bad actors out. And for any organization concerned about being breached,  if you need protection fast duo quickly enables strong security. But here's the key. Usually you  think of security and convenience as a trade off. Duo can actually improve user productivity  because duo prevents unauthorized access with multi-layered defenses and modern capabilities  that thwart sophisticated malicious access attempts. But it also can increase and decrease  authentication requirements in real time, depending on the threat level. When the risk rises,  it gets harder. When it goes down, it's easier. Duo actually helps productivity by only requiring  authentication when needed, which means your staff has swift, easy and secure access. You can rest  easy knowing you're safe. They don't have to go through hoops just to get on and get their work  done. Duo provides an all in one solution, strong MFA, passwordless, single sign on and trusted  endpoint verification all in one duo. It helps you implement zero trust principles by verifying users  and their devices. Start your free trial. Sign up today. CS.co slash twit. CS.co slash twit. Duo.  Do it. Do it. We thank them so much for their support. What else was going on at Black Hat  and Def Con, Rob and Iain that you thought would be worth mentioning? There's so much. Every year,  you know, I kind of prepare for the week after security now is going to have about 15 new  exploits. Most of the time when the exploits are revealed, it's because they've already told the  companies. Patrick Wardle, who is a, I think a very good security researcher on the Mac side,  had a presentation. It was a little bit different. He runs objective C at objective-c.org.  He has a tool he calls Knock Knock, which keeps background. Actually, this is not the article,  but I will find it for you. He keeps background applications from getting installed without your  knowledge or permission. Apple apparently likes it so much that they added a similar feature. In  fact, if you have a modern Mac, I think it started with Monterey, it's Inventura, it's going to  continue on. You've probably seen this. You install Zoom, and there's a little pop-up that says,  Zoom is putting in a background application that's going to run constantly. You can't prevent it,  but at least you're aware of it. The idea being, oh, while I installed Zoom, I expect that. If it  pops up and unbidded, and then you might start to wonder, yeah, is there something going on in the  background? Wardle says, trivially easy to bypass. He says he knows this because he's been writing  Knock Knock and knows a lot about this. Here's the thing. Wardle did tell Apple about this  some months ago, and they fixed it, but he says they didn't fix it very well. They just put a  band-aid on it. As a result, he gave a talk at DEF CON this week saying, here's how you trivially  bypass even the fixed version of this. He says, I didn't tell Apple. I was so pissed off that they  did such a bad job of fixing it. Is there such a thing as irresponsible disclosure?  I think not in this case because you're no worse off than you were before Monterey.  Right. Right.  He's not revealing something that people didn't know.

Start time: 4332.68
End time: 4357.76
Speaker: Christina Warren
Transcript:  Exactly. I think that there's a line. I think that there's responsible disclosure if you give them  a certain period of time, and then if they don't take any action and you know that the vulnerability  is still out there, you can publicize the vulnerability. In this case, they did take  some action, but he's just pointing out, hey, there's still flaws. He's not writing everybody  a diagram about how to take advantage of those flaws. It can also, as you saw with the Mozilla

Start time: 4357.90
End time: 4385.26
Speaker: Iain Thompson
Transcript:  case last week, I think it was, where a researcher had gone through to Mozilla and found a hole in  the VPN. He told them about it months ago. In some cases, Mozilla didn't even respond.  So they gave them a fair warning. After 90 days, they heard nothing. They went full public disclosure,  and amazingly enough, Mozilla fixed it by Monday morning. Who could tell what their motivations were?

Knock-knock does see what's persistently installed  on your Mac, and block-block will block background tools installation and let you know that it's  doing it. It'll say something that's installed LaunchDemon or LaunchAgent. You know what? They're  free. My experience has been they run pretty transparently in the background. It's probably

Start time: 4592.76
End time: 4678.86
Speaker: Iain Thompson
Transcript:  Oh, hacking the satellite. Yes. That was absolutely terrifying. I chatted at the subhead,  their PhD student admits he probably shouldn't have given this talk was from a comment in the  Q and a section, but that was absolutely was really disturbing because they, you know,  they were looking at low Earth orbit satellites and they asked manufacturers for the specs.  Very few of them actually followed through. They picked three and all of those two out of the three  had absolutely no protection whatsoever when it came to authentication or encryption and could  easily be taken over or hijacked by ransomware operators or whatever. The larger one did,  but the problem with larger satellites is that they tend to be made of special, sorry,  commercial space components. Whereas if you're building a cube set, you build it yourself with  custom stuff. And then possibly the worst was almost none of these can be updated with security  systems from the ground because if you've got a satellite in low Earth orbit, everything in that  design is tuned right down to the milliwatt as what they can do, what they can't do, what functions  to do. And if you're throwing an authentication or an encryption app in there, that's going to  completely banjacks the power settings and possible. And, you know, it's the big problem  with satellite hacking is that everyone thought they were safe because who's going to build a  ground station to, you know, hack a satellite. It turns out 10 grants worth of kit. You can

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  the right protocols. I love the quote that you publish in your article on the register.  People think satellites are secure, said Johannes Wilbold, the PhD student who presented. These are  expensive assets and they should have encryption and authentication. I assume criminals think the  same and they are too hard to target and you need to be some kind of cryptography genius.  Maybe it wasn't a good idea to give this talk. Too late. So you do need to access to somehow  talk to the satellite and it's not encrypted. So what can you do though? You can't bring it down.

Start time: 4737.20
End time: 4827.20
Speaker: Iain Thompson
Transcript:  No. Well, okay. There are a number of attack vectors that you could use this for.  I think probably the most likely one is ransomware or other criminals getting in there and just  disabling the satellite and then messaging the operator and saying, if you want the satellite  back send us a number of bitcoins to here. The other one was that a lot of these satellites,  like Starlink for example, intercommunicate. So you could in fact take over one and then spread  around the constellation. And then finally, he said probably the least likely was that you actually  take physical control of the propulsion systems and you could maybe, if it's got enough power,  de-orbit it. But he said one of the more interesting aspects that they discussed privately  was that these things are going incredibly fast. To get and stay into orbit, you've got to be moving  at thousands of miles an hour. And if you can just direct it slightly so it hits another satellite,  that's going to cause a spread of debris. And now it's very hard to go full Kessler effect in terms  of blanketing the earth in shards of destroyed satellites. But from a wartime situation, for  example, if an adversary of the US decided, you know, well, okay, spy satellites aren't usually  in low earth orbit, but there are some. It's like if, you know, spending a warning, what happens if  one of these CubeSats goes slightly wrong and intercepts an American satellite? It's technically

Start time: 4827.32
End time: 4856.36
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  doable. These satellites are, and I didn't know this until I saw this article last month in Tech  Crunch, already dodging space junk at the rate of thousands of times a month. SpaceX's orbital  communications satellite performed maneuvers 25,000 times in a six month period, according to a  filing with the FCC. So they're already, you know, 30 or 40 times a day going, oh, watch out.

Transcript:  It's another case of not paying attention to pollution because yeah, in the past, there was  not a whole lot of attention. I have actually done a little bit of writing about space, so I have some  knowledge of this beyond reading stuff on the internet. Yeah, you know, you would launch the  satellite and then not worry about the payload shroud or figure it'll de-orbit on its own at  some point. And so now there are rules and procedures. We learned that with Skylab landed on  us. I am old enough for that. Yeah. But of course, then you have jokers like the Russians decided to  stage an anti-satellite test that they blew up the ISS to change position with their own cosmonauts  on board it. Yeah. Just to show the priorities, the foot of the crime. According to Tech Crunch,

Like now, for instance, the FCC, if you're going to get your  low-earth orbit satellite broadband constellation approved, weirdly enough, the FCC has become a  very activist regulator of space because yeah, if you want to provide communication in some low-earth

They got FCC approval  for the first bunch. Maybe the FCC should step back a little bit because, you know, I was all for  Starlink when I first heard the plan. I thought, oh, this is great. Elon's going to provide low-cost  internet access to every corner of the planet. That's not what we got. It's very expensive.

Transcript:  worried. I know space is a big place, but I can reassure you a bit because I actually interviewed  Kessler from the Kessler syndrome idea and he said first off, is he fun at parties?  He was fascinating to be honest. I'll give him that, but he did just to reassure you on this  point, Leo. He did say that of all the companies that he's been dealing with, then SpaceX have  the most advanced plans to de-orbit all this stuff in a reasonable and safe manner, which was  kind of reassuring. He also said if the Kessler example does happen, it's going to happen slowly  over a length of time. He did say Hollywood has this image of- Gravity is not a documentary.  Oh, God. Well, yeah. The orbital planes on that thing were all wrong. Don't actually get to look

Transcript:  at this debris as it goes past. Who's looking at debris? I'm looking at Sandra Bullock. What are  you talking about? There was also a great Neil Stevenson book called Seven Eaves that talks about  the Kessler effect. The premise of it is you could have a chain reaction of collisions  in space around the earth and ultimately block out the sun, which wouldn't be good.  Well, that solves the global warming problem, doesn't it? That'd be the end of wildfires.  Yeah, kind of terminal way, though.  Okay. The ice caps are back. That's the good news.

Start time: 5141.69
End time: 5208.46
Speaker: Iain Thompson
Transcript:  About a year ago, they signed a memorandum of understanding to work together and the US  declassified an awful lot of intelligence information and let the Ukrainians see it  and also trained with the Ukrainian information security teams so that they could get some real  world experience and get the most up-to-date information. To her credit, she said, actually,  the US has come out the better of this because we have learned so much about active attacks.  Well, Ukraine has been under attack for nearly 10 years now by the best that the Russians can do.  So they have an enormous fund of experience. When the NSA do protections, they do war games.  They run through preset war games. The Ukrainians are actually on the front line. I would be,  frankly, astonished if we didn't have people embedded with them right now learning those  lessons and passing them on to everyone else. I say more power to them. The more we can get  out of this and the more we can lessen Russia's influence. We're spending enough. Yeah. Come on.  Ukrainian funding is cheap.

Transcript:  Yeah. And that part, reading the terms from having seen this before, like, yeah,  you're saying for us to do this. One thing I noted, there was actually a good bill in  Congress introduced last year. The initials for it cleverly abbreviated to TLDR Act,  which would have required a one page summary of terms of service with the real thing,  the whole thing had to be machine readable. And of course it went nowhere,  but it did just get reintroduced. And I'm thinking maybe zoom should lobby in favor of that because  if they had to do a one page human readable version, they might not have stepped in it so

You can't use  it to train your own AI. We can use anything that you produce for AI. So there was that.  And then on Tuesday, there's an opposite to how zoom did this. And I was really impressed with  open AI about this. They put out a blocker so that you can put this onto your, onto your webpage and  stop them from scraping the data. Now they ask you obviously not to because it helps them improve.  Right.

Google has kind of proposed a robots.txt  like file that you could say, no scraping. And that's reasonable because  I think that is reasonable.  It's not merely privacy. It could also be costly. You know, robots, you know, creating search  indexes often hammer sites. And I imagine the AI would be as bad or if not worse, it's going to  read every page of text and ingest it.

I'm supposed to hack man. Well, it's perfectly understandable.  Cause if you're a training session and someone teaches you how to do something,  you gotta try it. The initial temptation is hell, let's try this right now. Yeah. Um,  actually the biggest thing, well, not one of, not the biggest thing, but one of the most  curious things was an astonishing number of people at black hat have pet camps and the traffic on  that is almost all unencrypted. Um, so if you think about it, if somebody slurps that, then they can  send you a picture of your pet with the name of your pet and the company that provides that out

I mean, we've had  offices in we work since before the pandemic. Um, and you knew it was weird and what they weren't  thinking this through. Cause when we first moved in, they had free beer, which was just as British  churches, my boss was like, they've told them we're British, right? And sure enough, every Friday,  ourselves and a bunch of Australian people in the same building, it was like a five floor block in  a building would start on a Friday and we'd finish the barrels and we'd see how far down the stairs  we could get, you know, and then that got cut back. But then they released that disastrous S one.  And we were just reading it and we wrote a very sharp story about it, but we were reading it and  you were just like, who wrote this?

And for the  sponsor, what I often do is that I will buy a stupid domain. And in this case, I bought energy of we.com  and, and, and I thought nothing of it. And it just sat there and, you know, it's like, you know,  $12 or whatever it is a year's renewing. And then I got an email that I honestly didn't see from  somebody offering me. I think it was like $350. And then they came back and they were like, actually  we'll, we'll give you $600. I was like, yes, I was like, yes, you can absolutely have my, um,  ish post. Uh, I'm not, I'm not using the real term. Um, you can actually have, you can absolutely  have the thing that I bought as a gag for, you know, a sponsor read that I've never done anything  with.

I would rather  see my books get pirated than this or why Goodreads and Amazon are becoming dumpster fires.  Uh, her, she, uh, had, uh, dozens of AI generated books put up on Amazon over her name.  And then they made it into her Goodreads, uh, official author blog. And, uh, she says,  get ready because sham books are the next big thing. These things sell. Uh, she said with the  flood of AI content now published at Amazon, sometimes attributed to authors in a misleading  or fraudulent manner. How can anyone reasonably expect working authors to spend every week for  the rest of their life policing this? Uh, fortunately she has a voice and her blog post was  heard by both Amazon and Goodreads and that stuff was eventually taken down. But you know, books,  credit to her included.

It might sell well once, but I mean, it's also the case with Amazon reviews where,  you know, apparently Jeff Bezos had to buy the Washington Post so that the Washington Post could  document how bad the review system is at Amazon for some of the worst offenses to get taken care  of. Because I guess this company apparently needs to hire a red team of their own to look at how can  our marketplace get subverted? That's exactly right. Yep. Anybody ever use Blue Jeans? Once.

I used it in 2013, 2014 because Mashable, like somebody scammed somebody  on the sales team and it being like, this should be your conferencing thing.

Start time: 6631.90
End time: 6724.88
Speaker: Christina Warren
Transcript:  Oh, no, it was before. No, it was before. And then he wrote the morning platform memo.  Microsoft. He convinced Microsoft to buy it. He wrote the burning platform memo that basically said  our own Symbian thing isn't working. We have to partner with someone else. And which honestly was  correct. He was completely correct in that, but the solution was not a Windows phone,  much as I know many, many people loved it. It was Android. It had some good interface ideas there.  It did. It had really good ideas. And, but it was late. I think that like the first, actually,  it's funny that you say this, that you're going to talk about Nokia because I'm not joking. I  actually have this at my desk right now. This is a Lumia 800. This was given to me. Was that the  41 megapixel one or was that later? No, no, no, no, no, no. That was even earlier. This was early.  So this was, yeah, that was the 1530 or whatever. So this was, this did not work in the United  States. This was given to me. This only worked on the European bands. And, but it ran like  Windows phone, like 7.5. So it didn't even run the Windows phone 8, which actually had the good app  support, but it started to show the ideas. But the hardware was amazing. And I don't know why I still  had this, but I do. And I remember just like, I remember the briefing and like the, the, the,  the Nokia people being like so excited about how well it had been crafted. And I thought that was,

Start time: 6725.10

They were soft and beautiful edges.  Yeah, that was, that was the one with the big camera. Yeah. I, I tweeted like when they were  doing their announcement, I was like, should I just give up my iPhone and use a Windows phone  for, you know, you know, 10 days or something. And then my, and my editors were like, that's a  good idea. And both Nokia and Microsoft were like, will you do that? And so I did. And then a million  people copied me, but I actually did like lock my phone in a drawer, forwarded my number because I  was on a different carrier and used a Windows phone for a week and, and nothing else. And that was,  those were dark days, but I liked a lot of it, but I loved a lot of the ideas.

Start time: 6776.32
End time: 6794.76
Speaker: Christina Warren
Transcript:  thing is, is even the apps that people were building were good. They just, there weren't  enough of them, you know, it was just, and by that time of Blackberry 10 was the same thing,  right? Like they had some really good ideas. Um, even going further back, like WebOS really ahead  of its time, but you know, just, you had these two dominant players almost instantly and those

Start time: 6795.06
End time: 6809.15
Speaker: Iain Thompson
Transcript:  were going to be the two. I used to go over and, uh, but Nokia used to do like sort of three or  four day press events in the, uh, back in the late nineties when press deadlines were done in paper  rather than online and you could have spent three days for you. How nice for you. I genuinely, like

Start time: 6811.62

Speaker: Iain Thompson
Transcript:  particular trip was a Nokia maintained a compound just inside the Arctic circle, like a sort of  corporal town, um, which had like a 50 person sauna, uh, which, you know, you went into and  basically they'd stick beers outside the sauna and snowdrifts. You go in, you'd heat up for an  hour. Then they would chainsaw a hole in the ice, uh, and the lake right next door to it. Everyone  runs down, jumps in, rinse and repeat. But we spent a lot of time with the Nokia engineers and  I'll never forget, I think it was the Nokia 1110, the really tiny chocolate bar phone. I love that  one so much. Now, when they were about to launch that the engineer, we were sitting down with the  engineers, he goes, I have to show you this. And he sort of put it in there and he called them up.  And when you rang it on vibrate, the phone would walk across the table.  It looks as he goes, you see that, that took us eight days to actually perfect that. So they did  it and no one's going to use it, but that's the kind of detail we want in there. I love that so  much. But yeah, if Elop ever goes into, into Finland, he's going to learn what Sysu means  and it learned it. The hardware, I suspect someone's going to punch him in the face.

As he watches, as he watches a bit more liquid in that, to be honest. Yeah. Fill it up. He says,  I'm going to chill it and taste it. The weird thing is once you make Chia Fresca and you let it  for a day or two, it turns into Chia Simmons. And I don't think, I don't think you want that.  Oh, come on. Even for you that's.  Anybody wants that. Uh, here's some happy news. You were excited about this, Rob. Uh, it turns out  the curiosity Rover has found striking evidence of habitable seasons on Mars.  Mars. You know, for years people said Mars had canals and that was the evidence for the little  green men and the Martians. Well, it turns out these mud flats with these peculiar kind of  diamond shape. We've seen these on earth before. These are mud flats. And curiosity apparently says  this is evidence, uh, that there was seasonal wet dry cycles a long time ago, 3.6 billion years ago,  which bolsters the evidence. The planet was once hospitable to life.

It's a lot of red dirt sort of looks like Utah run Arches national park. Right. Um, but yeah,  we're still trying to find that out. And we have this, this Rover that somehow landed from a sky  crane and is still roaming around the engineering laser firing tank, which, yeah, which is now  wildly outperformed expectations. And the trick is at some point, if we find things that actually  might point to life, we need to get them to a lab on earth. And from what I've read, the problem that  NASA has is if you're going to build a series of robots, spacecraft that will pick up the  samples that curiosity is collecting, put them on a rocket, launch that into Mars orbit, transfer  that to another robot that'll take them back to earth. It's approaching the cause of sending  people to do it, which I'm all in favor of. Like I want to see human footprints, boot prints on Mars  in my life.

The EU seems to really dislike the financial model that powers the web.  The idea that ads would be targeted based on how you're using the internet. Google does it.  Facebook meta does it, but Norway doesn't like it. And they say they are now going to find meta  a million crowns. Don't get too upset. That's only about 89,000 euros a day.

Speaker: Iain Thompson
Transcript:  I'm trying to think if we can actually get away with saying this, but it was something like the  enrapification of the internet. It started as an open platform and then all these tech companies,  the example he gave was Facebook when it first started out. It told consumers, you don't want  to be all that nasty MySpace run by that greedy Australian millionaire. Come to us.  There was a point to that.  Yeah, there was a point to that, but then they built a bot which allowed you to interact and  share data between MySpace and Facebook. That actually got Facebook to the explosive growth  they're in. Then they said to businesses, okay, we can now advertise in a behavioral way because  these idiots have given us all this information, so pay us lots of money. To publishers, same thing.  Put a couple of lines from an article in, you can drive a lot of traffic. Then they turned around  and said to publishers and consumers, yeah, okay, we lied. We're just going to take all the money  now. This is the kind of thinking that he wants to deal with in this sort of thing.  We've given so much money. The whole point of the internet was to get rid of the middleman  and allow direct transfer. We did do that for a while. Then we reintroduced the middleman with a  vengeance. A good example was apps. He said apps are basically a website with intellectual property  added in that they can use to sue users. I can't wait. I love Corey to pieces. He's been on the

Transcript:  A little RIP for a couple of people. A big in tech. Bram Moulinard passed away. He was the author of  Vim. Only 62. I hate it when they die younger than me. That's bad news. Vim of course was a much  better version of VI, the text editor that now appears. Vim on almost every open source  distribution of Linux. I think even on the Mac you can get with Mac OS you get Vim. I certainly  it's installed in a lot of them. It's the default editor. He built it as a clone for VI and kept it  going for a long time. The license was originally Charity Wear. He invited users who used Vim and  appreciated to support children in Uganda. Sending a donation to them according to the  Next Web. Donations to the charity amounted about 30,000 euros every year. Enough to help 50 children  finish their education from primary school to university. If you look on his webpage, it's the

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He will be missed. Of course as with all open source, that's really the best thing about open  sources. They can survive their creator and I'm sure people will continue to develop them.  The man who started it all, Bram Molnar, passed away at the age of 62 this week. Also gone,  Rhoda Karpatkin. She was the person who put Consumer Union on the map. She was 93 years old. She was  named executive director, the first female executive director of Consumer's Union, way back  in 2000. Actually she was, I'm sorry, did I say 1974? She served for 16 years as their council.  Then in 74 selected as executive director. She changed its name to Consumer Reports. You may know  better that way. Under the leadership of Karpatkin, subscriptions to the magazine doubled. They're  very important. They don't accept ads to 4.3 million in 2000. She also raised $40 million to  build their new headquarters in Yonkers. Honestly, I think the godmother of consumer reporting  and the kind of stuff we try to do to represent consumers in their interests,  it's very, very important. A couple of people who are important to the community passed away.  And then there's Mr. Beastburgers. Have you ever had a Mr. Beastburger? I feel like you might have.  Yeah, I have. I have. I've done more than once. Well, here's the thing. It's a ghost kitchen.

Start time: 7809.26
End time: 7842.48
Speaker: Christina Warren
Transcript:  So it very much depends on what ghost kitchen it's coming from. There are many Mr. Beastburgers in  my area. But here's the thing. Seattle food sucks. And it just does. And we don't have a good food  scene. But also we have a really, really bad takeout scene. So especially during COVID,  there was not a lot of options after, say, like eight o'clock at night, which doesn't feel that  late. But in Seattle, apparently that is too late to ever get food even before the pandemic.  So I have ordered Mr. Beastburger more than once. And yeah, no, it's not good.

Transcript:  Primarily made in Italian restaurants. Bucca di Beppo is one. And then there's another Italian  chain. So what the yeah, exactly what they do. It's a pop-up kitchen. What they do is they the  company that puts this together contracts with a Italian restaurant in your neighborhood. And then  when you call in an order for Mr. Beastburger, which by the way, looks like this on the DoorDash  menu. It's a smash burger with crispy outside. And then they so the Italian restaurant was  apparently illy prepared for all of this, makes it slaps a Mr. Beastburger on a brown paper bag.  And then over eats or whoever brings it to you if either from the Brio Italian Griller,  Bucca di Beppo. But this is my favorite picture of what one Kotaku  reporter got from his Mr. Beastburger. Does not look like the

Speaker: Christina Warren
Transcript:  Yeah, no, that's the thing with the ghost kitchens is that the orders are often wrong.  And then there's no recourse that you can really do because it's a ghost.  This is a ghost kitchen. And then even like the idea behind it is, oh,  people the same recipe and they can make it multiple places. Yeah, except you don't  a franchise will ensure that you're getting product from the same suppliers so that you  have the same types of funds, the same types of patties, the same brand of cheese, whatever,  same type of ketchup. They don't do that with ghost kitchens.  So one Mr. Beastburger might be like edible. It's not great. It's overpriced, but fine.  And then another one might get it. You're like, OK, what actually is this?  And why is my grilled cheese that was ten dollars? Like, why is it the way that it is?

He contracted with  a company called Virtual Dining Concepts for this pop up restaurant, Mr. Beast. He decided this is  not working well, tried to get because he saw the burgers, trying to get out of the deal and is in  fact suing them saying you did not deliver. Now they're suing him for one hundred million dollars  because he's dissed his own burgers and is trying to get out of the deal. So what a mess

But I you're so right, and I always think  of that. I'm like, man, that guy really like nailed that market timing without having any  advanced knowledge. He really, really did, because at first the idea seems sort of interesting,  but sort of like, OK, well, is this really going to take off? And then it became a very viable

It's something called  pick and pack convenience stores, pet foods, medicines as well. Oh, like Posh. In this country,  you got to fail. You got to fail up. I mean, I look at Adam Newman of WeWork, WeWork about  declared bankruptcy. Does it hurt Adam Newman?

Unlike many of the other scam  things that people that I love, people like Anna Delvey, people like Billy McFarland,  people like Elizabeth Holmes. Yeah, they serve time for minor scams. They get thrown in jail.  It's got to trick his scam big, right? Right. Well, no, no, no, it's actually different. He  didn't lie to anybody. He didn't scam anyone. He was very clear about what his ideas were and  people just bought into it even though it made absolutely no business sense. It made absolutely  no business sense. I actually don't fault him at all.

Then it became, okay, we leave the big tech company and then we  do our startup. We get bought out for 400 million, which is said is the most half-assed way of getting  a pay rise he's ever heard of.

It's not that giant that you put your eye up against and scan it. And the idea, what is it?  I don't know. The idea is it's called WorldCoin. In some countries you get $50 in WorldCoin,  the equivalent of $50 in WorldCoin for letting them scan your iris, not in the US apparently,  but lots of people still want to do it.

Transcript:  Well, it's good because the orb is named MCI. So it's really perfectly illustrating.  And this is why I bring it up because I want to ask you guys who are smart  if it makes some sense. So his goal is to scan all 8 billion eyeballs. Actually, I guess there's 16  billion, but you only need one. Scan 8 billion eyeballs and then solve the authentication problem.  Remember, the retina is not going to the company, just a hash of it. So all they can do is say,  yes, this is the same eyeball we saw last time, but that's authentication. And it's strong  authentication. Those eyeballs are stored or those hashes are stored in the blockchain. Yes.  I'm not sure exactly what the next stage is.

Start time: 8364.66
End time: 8395.36
Speaker: Christina Warren
Transcript:  Right. Right. Because that's the thing. It's like, okay, so you have everybody scan  their eyeballs and now we all have an identity card that we can use in some way to at least say,  well, at least the hash of this retina matches this person. But what does that really mean?  Because could my name still be different? Could my location, could other things be different?  It's just a hash. It's like, and who's overseeing this? On one hand, I get it. But on the other  hand, I'm like, okay, well, what about people who might just be like, I don't want anything.

Well, the person that the Ponzi scheme is named after, I mean, it's really,  it existed before him, but the person who made it synonymous, when he was selling these  postal reply coupons and saying that he would double the money and 60 days or whatever,  he was trying to figure out how he could actually legitimately make the money and then go straight  and then offer people reasonable returns, not 50% of your money in two weeks, but reasonable returns.  His idea was that he was going to buy with some money that he kind of stole from some banks.  He was going to buy some big decommissioned steamliners from the United States government  and fill them with all kinds of things and do basically what these sea setters want to do,  where he would basically have like a huge shopping mall that would go port to port  and people would just buy everything that they ever wanted from that. That was one of his genius  business ideas. It's very similar to the sea setting thing and that's all you really need to know.

Maybe I'll be able to find something. We saw what happens with this already.  We literally just a few weeks ago got a very sad look at this whole thing.

When Jack Dorsey was left as sole CEO of Twitter, the subhead we used was the headline,  but the UK objected was because Dick Costiello pulled out. The headline was,  Big Dick Pulls Out Jack's Off to the Hot Seat. That's so good. We originally put that as a  headline and then the UK editor-in-chief got on the phone within about 25 minutes. I could hear  the phone call from across the office. What the hell are you guys thinking?

Transcript:  Back to Sam Altman and WorldCoin. Here's an interesting paragraph in the New York Times  story about it. Ultimately, WorldCoin's bankers envision a grander plan to protect people from AI  advances that they claim will eliminate millions of jobs. They're promoting the orbs, the ones  scanning your iris, as a possible foundation for universal basic income. Not this old chestnut  again. They say our iris IDs will help distinguish real people from robots.  As if a robot can't duplicate my iris. Right. I bet it could. It falls down on one simple biological

I mean, because I remember when these first came  out and I was talking to one of the researchers, and this was about the late 90s, early noughties,  and they were saying certain drugs make your pupils go really large. So if you're on MDMA  or an LSD or something like that, you're effectively locked out from using any  authentication method using this system. So if you take action, you can't get onto social media.  Is this a defensive measure? That's actually probably a good thing. But if you get an eyeball
